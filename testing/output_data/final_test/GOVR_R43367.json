    "content": "During the 113th Congress, housing and mortgage markets in the United States faced significant turmoil with decreasing house prices leading to high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates. Despite some signs of stabilization, concerns remained as Congress grappled with issues related to reforms in the housing finance system and new rules on mortgage lending. The 113th Congress addressed issues related to housing and mortgage markets in response to the housing market collapse. Lower-income households may struggle to find affordable housing, as Congress reduces funding for housing programs. The report discusses prioritizing funding for housing assistance programs and possible reforms in a fiscally austere environment. During the 113th Congress, housing and mortgage markets were addressed in response to the housing market collapse. The report discusses issues related to homeownership, housing finance, and housing assistance for low-income households. National housing market indicators showed positive signs, with increases in home sales and prices in 2013. Housing markets are local in nature, leading to varying conditions across the country. During the 113th Congress, the housing market showed signs of improvement with increased home sales and prices in 2013. Rising home prices had positive economic effects but made it harder for some prospective homebuyers. Rental markets were tightening, making it difficult for low-income families to find affordable housing. The housing market showed signs of improvement during the 113th Congress, with increased home sales and prices in 2013. However, in early 2014, some housing indicators were lower than in 2013, raising concerns about a slowing housing recovery. Home prices continued to increase in 2014, but at a slower rate than in 2013, while home sales and housing starts remained relatively flat year over year. Nationally, home prices began to rise again in 2012 after several years of declines. House prices began to decline in late 2007 and continued to do so for several years before starting to increase again in early 2012. In 2013 and 2014, home prices rose on a national level, although still below peak levels. However, the rate of house price appreciation in 2014 was lower than in 2013. Rising home prices can benefit existing homeowners and the economy but may make homeownership less affordable for prospective buyers. Rising home prices reduced negative equity for many homeowners, but over 5 million still remained in negative equity positions by the fourth quarter of 2014. CoreLogic reported that 4 million homeowners reached positive equity in 2013 and another 1 million in 2014. The percentage of mortgaged homes in negative equity positions has been decreasing, with Nevada having the highest share of mortgaged homes with negative equity at 24% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Texas had the smallest share at under 3%. Home prices rising may lead more homeowners to sell, increasing the supply of homes for sale. Existing home sales outnumber new home sales by a wide margin, with both types showing some increases during the 113th Congress. Existing home sales decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013, with numbers at nearly 5.1 million in 2013 and 4.9 million in 2014. New home sales also saw an increase, with over 429,000 in 2013 and 437,000 in 2014. The number of home sales is crucial as it can impact new housing construction, which in turn contributes to the economy and job creation. Housing starts in one-unit residential buildings fluctuated between 1.2 million and 1.6 million per year from 2000 to 2007, peaking at 1.7 million in 2005. However, starts dropped to 600,000 in 2008 and remained below 500,000 for the next three years. In 2012, there was a slight increase to over 500,000 starts, reaching over 600,000 in 2013 and close to 650,000 in 2014. Delinquency and foreclosure rates surged in the US from mid-2006, but foreclosure inventory rates have decreased in recent years. Foreclosure inventory rates decreased from their peak levels as fewer mortgages became delinquent and entered the foreclosure process. In the third quarter of 2014, the foreclosure inventory rate was about 2.3%, down from a peak of 4.6% in 2010. Rental housing accounted for about 35% of all occupied housing units in 2013, with over one-third in one-unit structures and nearly 60% in single-family structures. During the 113th Congress, rental markets were tight with rising rents and falling vacancy rates. The share of renters relative to owners has been increasing in recent years, reaching about 36% in 2014, equal to the historic average. Renter households are typically younger, smaller, more likely to be minorities, and have lower incomes than owner households. The share of renters has been increasing, reaching about 36% in 2014, equal to the historic average. This rise is partly due to the economic downturn of 2007-2009. Rental vacancy rates have decreased, leading to higher rents. In 2014, the median asking rent was $762 per month, up from $746 in 2013. Rents were increasing in most areas of the country. According to the State of the Nation's Housing Report and research by MPF Research, rents increased in 85 of 93 metropolitan areas in 2013. Many households faced joblessness or income loss after the 2007-2009 recession, leading to rental housing affordability issues. About half of all renters, totaling 21 million, are considered cost-burdened or severely cost-burdened, paying more than 30% or 50% of their income on housing costs, respectively. According to data from the American Community Survey, in 2012, about half of all renters, totaling 21 million households, were cost-burdened, with the share of renters paying more than 30% of their income for housing costs increasing across all income levels. Lower-income households were the most affected, struggling to find affordable housing. In 2013, there were 7.7 million renters with \"worst case housing needs,\" defined as those with incomes at or below 50% of the area median income who pay more than half of their income for rent or live in inadequate conditions. This represented a decrease from 2011 when there were 8.5 million households in this situation. The number of households experiencing worst case housing needs decreased from 8.5 million in 2011 to 7.7 million in 2013, but was 30% higher than in 2007. Most of these households are cost burdened, with only 3% living in inadequate housing. Tightened mortgage credit availability since the housing bubble collapse has made it difficult for some prospective homebuyers to qualify for loans. The new mortgage rules, influenced by the Dodd-Frank Act, may limit access to mortgages for some borrowers due to regulatory uncertainty. Economic factors have depressed household formation, reducing demand from first-time homebuyers. The mortgage market has been dominated by government-insured mortgages and those purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The mortgage market has been dominated by government-insured mortgages and those purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with a significant share of new mortgages backed by these entities. According to the Urban Institute, in 2013, over 60% of new residential mortgages were backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, while the FHA or VA insured an additional 20%. By 2014, the share of new mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac had fallen to about 50%, with the remaining mortgages mostly held on bank balance sheets. Less than 1% were securitized through private companies. The overall dollar amount of mortgage originations decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, to $1.2 trillion from $1.8 trillion. There are debates about reducing the government's role in the mortgage market, with some policymakers suggesting steps like raising fees or reducing the size of guaranteed mortgages. Concerns have been raised that such actions could limit credit availability and affordability in housing markets. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have been historically low, staying below 5% since May 2010 and dropping below 4% in 2012 and 2013. Rates began to rise slightly in late 2013 but remained below 4.5%. In 2014, rates fell from a high of 4.4% in January to under 4% by the end of the year. Concerns have been raised that rising interest rates could weaken the housing market by reducing home sales and refinancing activity. Despite low interest rates in 2014, fewer households benefited from refinancing due to decreased origination volumes. Rising interest rates may deter homeowners from selling their homes as new mortgages would likely have higher rates. Congress considered large-scale housing finance reform and other related issues in the 113th Congress. The agenda in the 113th Congress focused on housing finance reform and the role of the federal government in mortgages. Currently, the government guarantees mortgages through various programs and entities like FHA, VA, and Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac. Congressional interest shifted towards reforming the housing finance system as the market recovered from the recession. During the 113th Congress, discussions on housing finance reform focused on the GSEs and the role of FHA. The goals included preventing future taxpayer assistance, returning private capital to the mortgage market, and ensuring mortgages are available to creditworthy borrowers. Treasury invested $188 billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, receiving over $200 billion in dividends. The government provided support by purchasing bonds and MBS from the GSEs. During the 113th Congress, discussions on housing finance reform focused on the GSEs and the role of FHA. Treasury invested $188 billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, receiving over $200 billion in dividends. Concerns were raised about the lack of government support for affordable, 30-year fixed rate mortgages. Two bills, H.R. 2767 and S. 1217, aimed to reform the housing finance system but were not considered by the full House or Senate. The PATH Act proposed to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and replace them with a National Mortgage Market Utility without a government guarantee. The PATH Act aimed to facilitate mortgage securitization without a government guarantee, eliminate certain regulations hindering the mortgage market, and reform the FHA. The Johnson-Crapo bill proposed winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, creating the FMIC to oversee a new federal mortgage insurance program. The FMIC would support the mortgage market and provide reinsurance on eligible MBS with full-faith-and-credit federal government backing. The Johnson-Crapo bill proposed creating the FMIC to regulate mortgage-backed securities with a government guarantee. Another Senate bill, S. 1376, would address FHA without changes to the PATH Act. For more information on housing finance system structures and GSE reform options, refer to CRS reports. FHA, an agency within HUD, insures private mortgage lenders against losses on certain mortgages to encourage affordable lending. The program aims to be self-supporting through borrower fees rather than appropriations, but increasing foreclosure rates have raised concerns about its financial stability. The FHA experienced large increases in costs for insuring loans, leading to the need for $1.7 billion from Treasury in FY2013. Bills introduced in Congress aimed to improve FHA's financial position through various changes requested by FHA. The bills introduced in Congress included changes requested by FHA to better manage the FHA insurance fund and stabilize its finances. The PATH Act proposed more extensive reforms for FHA, such as making it an independent agency, limiting insurance to specific demographics, and gradually reducing the share of mortgages insured by FHA. The FHA reform bills aimed at improving financial soundness and reducing FHA's market role. The PATH Act proposed significant reforms, while other bills focused on financial stability without limiting market role. These bills were introduced in Congress but not considered for full House or Senate approval. Additionally, the 113th Congress enacted a bill to strengthen FHA's reverse mortgage program. The 113th Congress enacted the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013, giving FHA greater flexibility to make changes to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) program. This is intended to reduce the riskiness of these mortgages. For more information on FHA-insured mortgages, refer to CRS Report RS20530. For details on FHA's financial status, see CRS Report R42875. For information on FHA policy changes and proposed legislation, see CRS Report R43531. Financial regulators are implementing mortgage-related rulemakings required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2011, including rules by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on ability to repay, qualified mortgage standards, homeownership counseling, escrow requirements, mortgage servicing, loan originator compensation, and mortgage disclosure forms. Additionally, six federal agencies issued a final rule for credit risk retention and qualified residential mortgages. Various policy issues are common across these rules, with some lenders expressing concerns. The 113th Congress addressed policy concerns regarding financial regulators overseeing mortgage-related rulemakings. Congressional action included legislative proposals to repeal or modify some rules, such as the PATH Act which aimed to reform FHA, repeal credit risk retention requirement, modify qualified mortgage definition, and delay certain mortgage reform regulations. The federal government established temporary measures in response to elevated mortgage default and foreclosure rates in recent years. The federal government has implemented temporary programs to help households avoid foreclosure by modifying mortgages and facilitating refinancing. Programs like HAMP and HARP have been extended through 2015 and 2016. Several bills in the 113th Congress aimed to further assist at-risk households. Several bills in the 113th Congress aimed to assist households in danger of foreclosure or struggling with mortgage payments. These bills focused on expanding refinancing options, including changes to HARP to make more people eligible. However, none of these bills were enacted before the end of the Congress. During the 113th Congress, bills aimed at assisting households facing foreclosure or mortgage struggles were not enacted. The Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act provided protections for renters in foreclosed properties, but expired in 2014. Legislation (H.R. 3543 and S. 1761) was introduced in the 113th Congress to address these issues. The Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act expired in 2014. Legal issues from the mortgage crisis affected the mortgage market players, leading to investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements transferring billions of dollars. Concerns arose in 2010 about mortgage servicers engaging in documentation improprieties. In 2010, concerns about mortgage servicers' improprieties led to state and federal investigations, lawsuits, and settlements. Federal banking regulators conducted examinations and issued consent orders in 2011 to address foreclosure process issues. The National Mortgage Settlement in 2012 provided $25 billion in relief for individuals affected by foreclosure, improving mortgage servicers' behavior and legal liability. Other mortgage-related litigation and settlements have also occurred outside of mortgage servicing issues. The Justice Department announced a legal settlement with JPMorgan Chase & Co. for their involvement in mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan is required to pay approximately $13 billion in civil penalties, restitution, and consumer relief. Similar agreements were made with Citigroup and Bank of America. Entities in the secondary market are seeking indemnification for losses from mortgages that did not meet underwriting standards. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has sued or settled with around 20 mortgage companies for violations of securities laws related to mortgage-backed securities purchases in the mid-2000s, totaling over $15 billion. Mortgage brokers, originators, and bank directors have also faced charges for money laundering, fair lending violations, and fraud. The 113th Congress has shown interest in overseeing mortgage-related legal settlements and called for additional information on settlement actions. This includes changes to consent orders with mortgage servicers. For more details on foreclosure procedural issues, refer to CRS Report R41491. For information on the National Mortgage Settlement, see CRS Report R42919. Several city councils, including Richmond, CA and North Las Vegas, NV, are in discussions with Mortgage Resolution Partners (MRP) to implement eminent domain programs to address underwater mortgages. The proposals involve cities using their eminent domain powers to purchase underwater mortgages and selling them to MRP, who would issue new mortgages to homeowners at a higher price than the condemnation price but lower than the original mortgage amount. The focus is on purchasing performing mortgages held by private-label issuers. The focus is on purchasing performing mortgages held by private-label residential mortgage-backed securitized trusts. The Takings Clause limits the government's power to seize private property by eminent domain, requiring acquisition for a \"public use\" and payment of \"just compensation.\" The condemnation of underwater mortgages for economic development raises constitutional questions under public use and just compensation principles. Critics argue that acquiring mortgages through eminent domain could be unfair, undermine private contracts, and deter future mortgage lending. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prohibits government agencies from insuring mortgages subject to eminent domain condemnation. Legislation was introduced to prevent backing mortgages in areas that used eminent domain in the past 10 years. Policymakers are calling for clarity on potential policies if local jurisdictions proceed with eminent domain programs. During the 113th Congress, there were discussions about potential changes to the mortgage interest deduction, but no legislation was enacted. Eminent domain issues related to acquiring underwater mortgages were also a topic of debate. During the 113th Congress, discussions were held on potential changes to the mortgage interest deduction, with various options considered such as retaining the deduction, expanding it to include private mortgage insurance, converting it to a credit, or reducing the eligible mortgage size. Comments from interested parties varied. For more analysis on the rationales for subsidizing homeownership and the impact of tax incentives on homeownership rates, refer to CRS Report R41596. For information on how changes to the deduction could affect taxpayers in different locations, see CRS Report R43385. The Mortgage Interest Deduction allows homeowners to deduct interest paid on their mortgage, property taxes, and qualifying mortgage insurance premiums if they itemize their tax deductions. The deduction was initially available from 2007 to 2010, extended through 2011, with income thresholds for eligibility. The Mortgage Interest Deduction was extended through 2014 by the 113th Congress. Home foreclosure, mortgage default, or modification can result in cancellation of debt with tax consequences. Lenders forgiving debt is treated as cancellation of debt income subject to tax, with exceptions for insolvent or bankrupt taxpayers. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income for taxpayers who are insolvent or in bankruptcy. It was effective for debt discharged before January 1, 2010, and was extended multiple times by subsequent acts of Congress until the end of 2014. Congress deliberated on housing assistance programs targeted at lower-income households and special populations. Issues included funding for these programs and possible reforms. Concerns about reducing federal budget deficits led to discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011, impacting HUD's budget mostly made up of discretionary appropriations. The majority of HUD's budget is allocated to three main programs: Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, Section 8 project-based rental assistance, and public housing. The cost of Section 8 vouchers has been increasing due to the creation of more vouchers each year and rising renewal costs. Similarly, the cost of the project-based Section 8 program has also been growing. Public housing, a significant expense in HUD's budget, has been underfunded for years, leading to pressure from advocates to increase funding. Balancing this pressure is the need to maintain or increase funding for other HUD programs like the Community Development Block Grant and grants for homelessness assistance. HUD's funding needs must also be considered in relation to other departmental funding requirements. HUD's funding needs, along with those of the Department of Transportation, are determined by the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations subcommittee. While DOT's budget is generally larger, HUD's budget makes up the largest share of the discretionary T-HUD appropriations bill each year. These considerations influenced the 113th Congress's decision on HUD appropriations. For more information, see the CRS Issue Before Congress website on \"Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies' Appropriations.\" The Budget Control Act of 2011 led to reforms in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher and public housing programs. Recent reform proposals have aimed at streamlining program administration, with some controversial provisions. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is HUD's largest direct housing assistance program for low-income families. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest direct housing assistance program for low-income families, serving over 2 million families at a cost of over $18 billion in FY2013. Administered by public housing authorities, the program provides portable rental subsidies to very low-income families to reduce their rents in private market units. The program has faced criticism for its administrative complexity and growing cost. Public housing, on the other hand, is smaller in size with over 1 million units available to eligible low-income tenants, owned and operated by the same local PHAs that administer the Section 8 voucher program. The Section 8 voucher program provides housing assistance to low-income families through public housing authorities. The public housing stock is in need of significant capital repairs, estimated at $26 billion by HUD. PHAs have turned to private market loans to address these needs due to insufficient funding from Congress. However, federal restrictions limit their ability to borrow funds, leading to criticism of the program's complexity and administrative burden. Recent reform proposals aim to simplify the Section 8 voucher program by changing income eligibility, rent determination, and inspection processes. Legislation also seeks to establish a permanent formula for allocating voucher funding to public housing authorities. Additionally, proposals include modifications and expansions of the Moving to Work demonstration. The Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration allows selected PHAs to seek waivers of federal rules governing the Section 8 voucher program and public housing. The President requested Congress to enact less controversial administrative reforms, some of which were included in the FY2014 Omnibus funding measure. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans in tribal areas. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans in tribal areas by consolidating most housing funding into the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) program. This program provides formula funding for federally recognized tribes and Alaska Native villages to use for various housing activities benefiting low-income households in their formula area. Additionally, the act authorized a loan guarantee program and funding for training and technical assistance. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) provides funds for affordable housing for low-income Native Hawaiians eligible to live on Hawaiian home lands. NAHASDA's authorization expired in FY2013, with reauthorization bills introduced in the House and Senate. H.R. 4329 was passed by the House in December 2014, while S. 1352 was reported out of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in January 2014 but not considered by the full Senate. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers housing assistance programs for rural residents. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers housing assistance programs for low and moderate income residents in rural areas, including rental housing development, rent subsidy programs, and single-family direct loan and mortgage insurance programs. These programs are only available in designated \"rural\" areas, with a complex definition that includes population thresholds and a determination of being \"rural in character.\" The USDA updated the list of rural areas based on Census data, with over 900 communities no longer meeting the criteria. In 2012, over 900 communities identified as \"rural\" faced losing eligibility for rural housing programs. Congress grandfathered existing eligible communities until the end of FY2014. The 2014 \"Farm Bill\" amended the rural definition, extending provisions disregarding Census data for determining rural status. The 2014 \"Farm Bill\" extended provisions disregarding Census data for determining rural status and increased the population threshold for eligibility for certain communities. The low-income housing tax credit program encourages affordable rental housing development through non-refundable federal tax credits awarded to developers. The low-income housing tax credit program reduces developers' debt and equity contributions, leading to lower financing costs and potentially more affordable rents. Temporary changes during the financial crisis extended the 9% floor for credit allocations until the end of 2014. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 temporarily excluded military housing allowances from LIHTC income calculations. LIHTC tenants must have income below a specific threshold, either 50% or 60% of the area's median income. Servicemembers' income for eligibility includes annual pay and basic allowance for housing (BAH). The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 temporarily excluded military housing allowances (BAH) from LIHTC income calculations, benefiting more servicemembers to qualify for LIHTC housing in counties with military bases. The exclusion was extended multiple times, most recently through the end of 2014. Affordable housing advocates, led by the National Low-Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), had long advocated for a national housing trust fund for dedicated funding. In 2008, Congress established the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund to provide funding for rental housing for low-income households. The Housing Trust Fund would offer grants to states for very low- and extremely low-income households, funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, the contributions were suspended after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went into conservatorship. Affordable housing advocates continue to push for funding for the Housing Trust Fund. Affordable housing advocates have sought funding for the Housing Trust Fund from profitable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Legal action was taken to reinstate their contributions, but the lawsuit was dismissed in September 2014. Some policymakers oppose the Housing Trust Fund, citing duplication of other programs or potential misuse of funds. There were legislative proposals in the 113th Congress to eliminate or limit funding for the Housing Trust Fund. Despite never receiving funding, contributions were directed to be set aside in 2015 for transfer in early 2016. In early 2016, contributions were directed to the Housing Trust Fund. Affordable housing advocates praised the decision, while some lawmakers criticized it due to concerns about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorship.
