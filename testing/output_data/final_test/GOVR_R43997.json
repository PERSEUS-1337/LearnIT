    "content": "The federal land management agencies, including BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS, are responsible for maintaining diverse assets in various locations to ensure their proper functioning. There has been significant attention on the infrastructure needs of these agencies, particularly on deferred maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repair activities are crucial for preserving these assets. Maintenance and repair activities are essential for preserving assets in an acceptable condition. Deferred maintenance and repairs, also known as the maintenance backlog, accelerate deterioration, increase repair costs, and decrease asset value. Debate surrounds funding levels, efficiency, priority, and potential additional funding sources for reducing deferred maintenance. The report focuses on balancing maintenance of existing infrastructure with acquiring new assets, disposal of assets, and prioritizing infrastructure maintenance. It provides agency deferred maintenance estimates for FY2018 and discusses changes over the past decade. Factors contributing to these changes are also identified, with agencies typically identifying deferred maintenance through condition assessments. The Department of Interior (DOI) currently reports annual deferred maintenance estimates for 10 classes of assets, including roads, buildings, trails, bridges, and water systems. This reporting began in FY2015, with prior years showing estimates as a range. For example, in FY2014, the range had an accuracy level of minus 15 percent to plus 25 percent of the initial estimate. The Department of Interior (DOI) uses a range for deferred maintenance estimates due to the difficulty in determining exact figures. The estimates are taken from annual budget justifications to Congress, with mid-range figures calculated by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). For example, NPS estimated deferred maintenance for FY2014 between $9.31 billion and $13.70 billion, with a mid-range figure of $11.50 billion. Since FY2015, DOI has provided CRS with single estimates for each agency. The DOI Budget Office provided CRS with single estimates for each DOI agency's deferred maintenance as of the end of FY2018. The total deferred maintenance for the four agencies was $19.38 billion, with NPS having the largest share at 62%, FS at 27%, FWS at 7%, and BLM at 5%. Each agency's estimate consisted of various components. The maintenance estimate for FY2018 included various components. In FS, roads accounted for 61% of the total, followed by buildings at 24%, trails and bridges at 5% each, and 6% for other asset classes. For NPS, roads, bridges, and trails made up 57% of the total, buildings 19%, other structures 18%, and irrigation, dams, and water structures 6%. BLM's deferred maintenance was mainly in roads, bridges, and trails at 69%, with buildings at 14%, other structures at 12%, and irrigation, dams, and water structures at 6%. In FY2018, the total deferred maintenance estimate for the four agencies showed variation over a 10-year period, peaking in FY2012. The total estimate ended the decade relatively flat, with a slight increase of $0.36 billion overall. The estimates for BLM and NPS increased, while those for FWS and FS decreased. The total deferred maintenance estimate for the four agencies showed variation over a 10-year period, peaking in FY2012. The estimates for BLM and NPS increased, while those for FWS and FS decreased. Agency trends varied with fluctuations in estimates, with NPS showing a steady increase, FS remaining similar, BLM fluctuating before rising, and FWS experiencing a decline. Factors contributing to these changes are discussed. In constant dollars, the total deferred maintenance estimate for the four agencies decreased over a ten-year period by $3.61 billion, from $22.99 billion to $19.38 billion, with three agencies experiencing decreases and one agency showing an increase. The BLM estimate fluctuated over the period, reaching its lowest point in FY2011 and its highest in FY2018, while the FWS estimate dropped significantly after the first four years. The NPS estimate peaked in FY2010, then declined over the next six years to roughly one-third of the FY2009 level before increasing in FY2018. The FS estimate exceeded $6 billion for the first half of the 10-year period, ranging between $5 billion and $6 billion in the second half. NPS consistently had the largest portion of total deferred maintenance, followed by FS, FWS, and BLM. The NPS portion of annual deferred maintenance grew from 53% in FY2009 to 62% in FY2018, while the FS share decreased from 28% to 27% over the decade. The FWS component declined from 16% to 7%, and the BLM portion rose from 3% to 5%. Roads typically comprised the largest portion of each agency's deferred maintenance, with NPS roads, bridges, and trails having the highest share. The category of roads, bridges, and trails was the biggest portion of BLM's deferred maintenance from FY2009 to FY2018. Fluctuations in estimates are influenced by factors like funding levels and asset portfolios. Comprehensive information on the impact of these factors is not always readily available. The data in the report may not fully explain changes in deferred maintenance estimates over time due to evolving methods for assessing asset conditions. Agencies have improved efforts to define maintenance needs by collecting comprehensive information on facility conditions and improvement needs. The first cycle of comprehensive condition assessments for NPS facilities was completed by FY2006, with ongoing development of business practices through at least FY2018. The NPS continued to refine business practices for estimating maintenance needs of nonindustry-standard assets through at least FY2018. Changes in methodology led to adjustments in deferred maintenance estimates, particularly for gravel and native surface roads. The FWS is working on improving consistency in cost estimates for deferred maintenance to aid in budget planning. The FWS has made significant reductions in the deferred maintenance backlog by refining cost estimates for roads, bridges, and trails. The method of estimating deferred maintenance for roads has changed to exclude minimally used administrative roads. This has led to a substantial decline in the FWS deferred maintenance total, from $1.46 billion in FY2012 to $0.28 billion in FY2018. The FWS and FS have reduced deferred maintenance by refining cost estimates for roads, bridges, and trails. Changes in estimating methods led to decreased estimates over a 10-year period. FS adjusted survey methodology for roads, resulting in a $0.84 billion decrease in deferred maintenance from FY2012 to FY2014. NPS included deferred maintenance for unpaved roads in its total estimate in FY2014. The DOI's total deferred maintenance increased by $0.26 billion (4%) from FY2013 to FY2014, reaching $6.83 billion. Changes in methodology, including the inclusion of unpaved roads, impacted NPS estimates. DOI agencies shifted to a single estimate for deferred maintenance starting in FY2015, affecting funding allocations. Total funding for deferred maintenance across agencies remains unclear due to budget requests and appropriations laws. The total funding for deferred maintenance across DOI agencies is unclear as budget requests and appropriations laws do not aggregate funds for this purpose. Funding for deferred maintenance comes from various sources such as agency accounts, recreation fees, and specific funds for roads and restoration. Evaluations of federal funding sufficiency are hindered by the lack of total funding figures and the incomparability of estimates to actual costs. Maintenance may be hindered by the lack of total funding figures and the incomparability of appropriations and deferred maintenance estimates. Deferred maintenance estimates could fluctuate due to economic conditions beyond agency control, such as changes in material costs, fuel, supplies, and labor. The Department of Interior (DOI) has highlighted that National Park Service (NPS) deferred maintenance estimates may vary with market trends and inflation. Comprehensive information on the impact of federal funding on facility conditions and deferred maintenance over the decade is not readily available in budget documents, particularly regarding the facilities condition index (FCI) in agency justifications. The facilities condition index (FCI) in agency budget justifications is often incomplete or inconsistent, with some not providing FCI figures for assets or only for certain years. It is unclear if FCI figures cover all agency assets or just a subset. Budget justifications mix FCI information using quantitative, percentage measurements, and qualitative statements. Agencies have expressed a need for increased appropriations to reduce backlogs, like the proposal for a \"Public Lands Infrastructure Fund\" in the Interior Budget for FY2020. The \"Lands Infrastructure Fund\" uses revenues from energy development on federal lands to address deferred maintenance needs of agencies. A 2017 audit report highlighted the need for resources to reduce the maintenance backlog, with agencies attributing reductions in backlog to additional appropriations in the past. Some stakeholders have suggested ways to address deferred maintenance. Some stakeholders have suggested ways to address deferred maintenance, including using donations, volunteers, partnerships, leasing assets, and seeking transportation grants. Another suggestion is outsourcing certain agency operations to the private sector, establishing a franchising system for new park units, and disposal of assets. The asset portfolios of agencies vary in terms of number, type, size, age, and location. Comprehensive data on these variables over the past decade are not readily available. The NPS has a significant maintenance backlog, with a large portion of assets constructed before 1900 or in the first half of the 20th century. The 2016 GAO report found that park units established over 100 years ago accounted for 32% of the total deferred maintenance, while those over 40 years old made up 88%. Some assets are in urban areas or are iconic structures, potentially affecting maintenance costs. The impact of changes in agency asset portfolios on deferred maintenance is not entirely clear. The acquisition of assets, such as large or iconic assets in poor condition, increases maintenance needs and backlog if not performed on schedule. Disposal of assets, like old assets in poor condition, could reduce deferred maintenance. For example, the NPS has a significant maintenance backlog, with assets constructed before 1900 or in the first half of the 20th century contributing to it. The impact of changes in agency asset portfolios on deferred maintenance is unclear. One way to reduce maintenance backlogs is by disposing of unneeded or underused assets in the agency's portfolio. For example, FS has conveyed administrative sites and decommissioned infrastructure to reduce backlog. FWS has also reduced maintenance by disposing of assets, while NPS identifies non-critical assets for potential disposal. However, the analysis of removal costs versus annual costs often hinders the removal option."
