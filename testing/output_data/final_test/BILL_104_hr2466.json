    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Land Exchange Improvement Act of 1995\" amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to adjust the value of lands eligible for equal treatment. The amendment replaces the previous value of $150,000 with $500,000, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The Federal Land Exchange Improvement Act of 1995 amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 by adjusting the value of lands eligible for equal treatment. Section 206(b) is further amended to allow funds received by the Secretary for land exchanges to be deposited in a special fund, with a limit of $12,000,000. Amounts exceeding this limit will be transferred to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to require an environmental assessment for exchanges under the Act, completion of conferencing or consultation within 45 days, and compliance by the Secretary concerned before any action on non-Federal land acquired in an exchange. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws before completing any land exchange under the Act. The exchange process must be finalized within one year of application submission. Non-Federal land values should not be restricted by environmental regulations. MINOR BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS: The Secretary may dispose of lands by exchange to make minor adjustments to public lands or National Forest System boundaries to reflect actual conditions, without the need for equal value exchange. REMOVAL OF RESTRICTION: The Secretary of Agriculture can now exchange Oregon and California Railroad Grant lands without restrictions. SEC. 7 of the Act amends the Sisk Act by changing the timeframe for prior land use. SEC. 8 waives the public use requirement for lands under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. The Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act is amended to allow the Secretary to waive requirements for lands to be sold, exchanged, or granted only to public authorities for public purposes after consulting with other Federal agencies with property interests."
