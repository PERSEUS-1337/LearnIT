    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Belarus Arms Transfers Accountability Act of 2009\". Congress finds that Belarus is a significant arms exporter, with official exports valued at $1 billion between 1999 and 2006. There are concerns that the actual value of arms exports may be higher due to undisclosed agreements. Many arms sales from Belarus are reportedly made without proper oversight by government security organs. According to the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, the Department of State reported that Belarus has been exporting defense articles, dual-use items, and military equipment. There are concerns about Belarusian sales of weapons to states of concern, including state sponsors of terrorism. Belarusian authorities are also expanding relations with countries of concern. Belarus has been a significant supplier of rockets, mortars, antitank weapons, and mines to Palestinian extremist groups and state sponsors of terrorism. Belarus has been exporting defense articles, dual-use items, and military equipment to state sponsors of terrorism like Iran and Syria. They have supplied helicopters, artillery systems, and armored vehicles to Sudan, tanks to North Korea, and military aircraft to Iran. Sanctions were imposed on a Belarusian entity for transferring items to Iran that could contribute to weapons of mass destruction. Belarus ratified a security agreement with Iran in 2005. Belarus, under the leadership of Aleksandr Lukashenko, expressed readiness to cooperate with Iran in various areas. Lukashenko affirmed support for Syria despite international criticism, citing mutual assistance agreements. Venezuela, led by Hugo Chavez, has strong ties with Iran, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria, all designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the US. The US has criticized Venezuela for not fully cooperating in anti-terrorism efforts since 2006. In 2006, Venezuela's ambassador to Cuba visited Belarus, calling the US a common enemy. Hugo Chavez also visited Belarus. Belarus and Venezuela considered a $1 billion military contract. Questions arose about Belarus's weapon stockpiles and their source. Russia did not cooperate with the US on dissuading Belarus. Belarus increased military cooperation with Russia, facilitating the sale of S-300 air defense missiles to Iran and Syria. In 2009, Israel warned Belarus against strengthening ties with Iran. Belarus has been a proxy route for Russian arms sales to Iran. In March 2008, Belarusian military specialists planned to assist Venezuela in creating an advanced air defense system using the Russian-made S-300 missile system. Venezuela also discussed nuclear cooperation with Belarus and Iran during this time. The planned deployment of an advanced air defense system, like the S-300 missile system, by Venezuela, along with its growing nuclear cooperation with Belarus and Iran, raises concerns similar to Russia's sale of the S-300 system to Iran during their nuclear development collaboration. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the need for the Secretary of State to consider reports of arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and states not cooperating with the US in anti-terrorism efforts. It also highlights concerns about Iran using nuclear cooperation agreements to proliferate weapons technology to countries like Venezuela through arrangements with Belarus or other countries. The United States opposes arrangements with Belarus or other countries that are not in its interest. SEC. 4. REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress detailing Belarus' exports of weapons and services, including revenue flows and the potential involvement of the Russian Federation. The report also assesses Belarus' stockpiles of weapons from the Soviet era and the capability of Belarusian enterprises to manufacture weapons. The annual report to Congress evaluates Belarus' ability to produce conventional and advanced weaponry, assesses nuclear cooperation agreements with Iran, Belarus, and Venezuela for potential nuclear proliferation, and monitors weapon sales from Belarus to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The report may include a classified annex. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This section defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific committees in the House and Senate and \"state sponsor of terrorism\" as a government that supports international terrorism."
