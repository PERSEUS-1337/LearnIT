The Technology Administration Authorization Act of 1995 authorizes appropriations for the Under Secretary for Technology and the National Institute of Standards and Technology for fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998. The Secretary of Commerce is directed to submit a strategic plan for phasing out the Office of Technology Policy by transferring essential functions to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. For Scientific and Technical Research and Services, $263,000,000. For Industrial Technology Services, $427,000,000, with no funding for Advanced Technology Program grants after October 1, 1995. For Construction of Research Facilities, $60,000,000. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new section for the Competitive Technology Program. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new section for the Competitive Technology Program, emphasizing the importance of strengthening research institutions and industry in rural and less populous states for enhancing U.S. competitiveness. The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCOR) and similar programs have successfully strengthened research in rural states by funding competitive grant proposals. Establishing a program at NIST based on the EPSCOR concept would further broaden the nation's scientific and technology base. The policy of the United States is for NIST to conduct programs to strengthen the nation's scientific capabilities, support research in rural states, and coordinate with other federal science agencies. The Secretary of Commerce, through NIST, is required to promote competition. The Secretary of Commerce will establish EPSCOT to provide grants for research, technology transfer, outreach, economic development, and education. Grants will be awarded based on merit and relevance to the Institute's mission, and the potential to enhance researchers' competitiveness. The Secretary of Commerce will establish EPSCOT to provide grants for research, technology transfer, outreach, economic development, and education. Grants will be awarded based on merit and relevance to the Institute's mission, with a focus on improving the environment for science, mathematics, and engineering education in the State. Additionally, there will be supplemental grants for fellowships, traineeships, equipment, or instrumentation for qualified institutions. The Secretary of Commerce will establish EPSCOT to provide grants for research, technology transfer, outreach, economic development, and education. Grants will be awarded to not-for-profit institutions, local and state governments, individuals with a record of achievement in science and technology, and other qualified entities. Up to $10,000,000 from the Industrial Technology Services account at the National Institute of Standards and Technology will be used to establish and develop the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology Research. Eligible states are those designated to compete in the National Science Foundation's program. The American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 repeals the National Quality Council and makes amendments to the Fastener Quality Act. Amendments to the Fastener Quality Act include redesignating subsections, changing specifications for minimum tensile strength to Rockwell C hardness, and updating language regarding critical applications to commerce. Amendments to the Fastener Quality Act involve changes such as inserting \"International Organization for Standardization\" after \"Society of Automotive Engineers,\" adding \"consensus\" after \"or any other,\" updating specifications for minimum tensile strength to Rockwell C hardness, and revising language related to critical applications in commerce. The Fastener Quality Act is being amended by repealing Section 4 and making amendments to Section 5, including changes to subsections and inserting new language for achieving uniform hardness. The Fastener Quality Act is being amended to include an alternative procedure for demonstrating chemical characteristics conformity, bypassing certain requirements in subsections (b) and (c). The Fastener Quality Act is amended to allow manufacturers to demonstrate conformity of metal coil or heat numbers through accredited laboratory testing and inspection reports. The reports must confirm that the chemical characteristics meet required standards. The Fastener Quality Act is amended to allow manufacturers to demonstrate conformity of metal coil or heat numbers through accredited laboratory testing and inspection reports. The Secretary shall provide an alternative to the statement required for cases where a manufacturer elects to use a permitted procedure. Amendments are made to Sections 6 and 7 of the Act. The Fastener Quality Act (15 U.S.C. 5406) is amended to require domestically produced fasteners to meet specific manufacturing, testing, and inspection standards. Manufacturers must have original laboratory testing reports and certificates of conformance on file for inspection. Additionally, a label must be affixed to private shipments. The Fastener Quality Act is amended to prohibit commingling of like fasteners from different lots in the same container, except for fasteners of the same type, grade, and dimension from two tested and certified lots during repackaging and plating operations. Containers with fasteners from two lots must be marked with lot identification. The Fastener Quality Act is amended to require containers with fasteners from two lots to be conspicuously marked with lot identification numbers. Additionally, the Secretary may designate officers to conduct investigations for enforcement of the Act. The Fastener Quality Act is amended to shorten the time period for certain provisions from 10 years to 5 years. Section 13 is amended to remove a specific timeline requirement, and Section 14 is repealed. Enforcement authorities can be exercised under other US laws with approval from the Attorney General."
