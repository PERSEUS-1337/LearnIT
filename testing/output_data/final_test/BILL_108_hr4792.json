    "content": "The Act is titled the \"New United States Global HIV Prevention Strategy to Address the Needs of Women and Girls Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to HIV prevention strategies. Congress finds that globally, there are over 40 million people infected with HIV/AIDS, with the majority in the developing world. Women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection, representing over half of all infected individuals worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls account for 60% of HIV infections, with young women being significantly more likely to be infected than men. Gender disparities in HIV infection rates are influenced by various factors. The factors contributing to the vulnerability of women to HIV infection include inadequate knowledge about transmission, lack of access to prevention services, inability to negotiate safer sex, social norms inhibiting open discussions about sex, limited access to female-controlled prevention methods, and gender-based social and economic inequalities. Current HIV prevention programs based on the ABC model may not effectively address these issues. The Global Coalition on Women and AIDS was launched by UNAIDS in 2004 to address the vulnerability of women to HIV infection, focusing on prevention, equal access to care, and increasing access to female-controlled prevention methods. Violence against women, perpetuated by intimate partners, is a major human rights and public health issue worldwide and a significant factor in HIV spread. WHO reports that a significant percentage of women have experienced abuse or coercion, mostly within marriage. Current HIV prevention programs lack emphasis on addressing violence against women. The fear of domestic violence and stigma related to HIV/AIDS hinder women from accessing information, testing, and treatment. Economic and social disparities worsen the impact of discrimination and violence on HIV risks faced by women. Gender discrimination in access to education, income, and property rights leaves women and girls vulnerable to risks such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, exploitation, and HIV infection. Violations of women's property rights often lead to homelessness, poverty, and resorting to activities like commercial sex work to survive. Many women face stigma, violence, and economic challenges, leading to fear of abandonment and vulnerability to HIV. Discriminatory legal frameworks hinder women from leaving abusive relationships, with inadequate resources and institutional support exacerbating the issue. Several studies show that early marriage does not protect against HIV, with young married women aged 15-19 at a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS compared to single women of the same age. Unmarried sexually active girls are less vulnerable to HIV due to less frequent sex, partners closer to their age, and higher condom use. Efforts to expand access to education for women and girls, increase age at marriage, and promote condom use are crucial in reducing HIV infections among females in relationships and inside marriage. Education for women is linked to positive outcomes such as delayed intercourse, increased age at marriage, delayed childbearing, improved child survival, better nutrition, and reduced risk of HIV infection. Recent studies show that young married women without children are less likely to be in school compared to single women of the same age. This highlights the importance of comprehensive health and sexuality education in HIV prevention programs for women, especially younger women, to equip them with the necessary tools for protection. (18) Evidence supports coordinating HIV prevention initiatives with existing health care services like family planning and reproductive health programs to improve the health and well-being of women and girls. (19) The US has invested in basic health care services for mothers and children, including trusted sources of health information and resources for women and their children. Efforts to coordinate HIV prevention services with family planning and reproductive health care programs are crucial for an efficient global health policy. Increasing women's access to prevention information, addressing gender violence, and promoting equitable partnerships between women and men are key components in this initiative. The global strategy to combat HIV/AIDS lacks focus on preventing HIV infection among women and girls, despite the importance of equitable partnerships between men and women in reducing the spread of the disease. The strategy aims to prevent HIV infections on a country-by-country basis. The United States aims to prevent 7,000,000 new HIV infections by implementing a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy for each country receiving assistance. This strategy prioritizes the immediate and ongoing needs of women and girls, going beyond the traditional ABC model to reduce HIV infections. The United States aims to prevent new HIV infections by implementing a comprehensive prevention strategy prioritizing the needs of women and girls. The strategy includes increasing access to female-controlled prevention methods, destigmatizing HIV/AIDS, empowering women and girls, reducing violence against women, and supporting economic empowerment programs. The United States prioritizes preventing new HIV infections by implementing a comprehensive strategy that focuses on the needs of women and girls. This includes promoting positive male behavior towards women, supporting expanded educational opportunities, protecting property and inheritance rights, coordinating HIV prevention services with existing healthcare services, and promoting gender equality through civil society organizations and legal frameworks. The President must coordinate HIV prevention strategies with the national government, donor countries, and organizations through the Three Ones Principles, involving consultation with indigenous and international NGOs working on HIV/AIDS and women's health. The Three Ones Principles, developed by UNAIDS and agreed upon by the United States and other donor countries in 2004, outline the need for a national HIV/AIDS action framework, coordinating authority, and monitoring system in each country. The President is required to report on the implementation of these principles within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The President must report on the implementation of HIV prevention strategies and US-supported activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report should include details on nongovernmental organizations carrying out activities, funding sources, and implementation strategies. SEC. 4. BALANCING FUNDING FOR HIV PREVENTION METHODS. Congress acknowledges that abstinence programs alone may delay sexual debut but without comprehensive sexuality education, young people may lack the knowledge to protect themselves from HIV. The United States policy is to support culturally appropriate HIV prevention programs aligned with each country's strategy. The United States provides assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in various countries, ensuring funds for programs are not burdened by unnecessary requirements. Amendments to funding provisions remove the mandate for a specific percentage to be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms related to HIV/AIDS, including AIDS, HIV, and HIV/AIDS."
