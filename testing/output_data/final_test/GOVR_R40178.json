    "content": "The 112th Congress has been focused on deficit, debt limit, and corporate tax reform to stimulate the economy. A proposal to reduce tax on repatriated dividends has been considered in several bills. The American Jobs Creation Act (P.L. 108-357) included a provision for a temporary reduced rate on repatriated earnings, requiring them to be used for domestic investment. While there was a significant increase in repatriated earnings, there was no clear evidence of a corresponding rise in domestic investment or employment. The business community has suggested another repatriation holiday, but CFOs from various corporations opposed it in a 2011 hearing before the Ways and Means Committee. The debate on another repatriation holiday is ongoing, with some firms supporting it while others like Caterpillar Incorporated oppose it. The key to the proposal's effect on U.S. economic growth lies in the use of repatriations rather than the magnitude of repatriations. Even if significant repatriations occur, the rate of return on U.S. investment will remain unaffected. Repatriated funds may be used for dividends or to pay down corporate debt, especially by large firms. Additionally, the conversion of foreign currency repatriations to dollars could drive up the price of the dollar in world currency markets. The debate on a repatriation holiday continues, with some firms supporting it while others oppose it. Proposals for a phased-in repatriation at a lower tax rate are being considered, along with a shift to a territorial tax system. The current U.S. tax system taxes international income based on residence, leading U.S.-chartered corporations to be taxed on worldwide income. Operating through foreign subsidiaries allows U.S. firms with overseas operations to indefinitely postpone U.S. tax on foreign income. The U.S. tax system allows firms to defer taxes on foreign income by operating through foreign subsidiaries. Taxes are only paid when earnings are repatriated to the U.S. parent corporation. The foreign tax credit alleviates double taxation, allowing firms to claim credits for foreign taxes paid on repatriated dividends. This incentivizes U.S. firms to invest in countries with low tax rates. The American Jobs Creation Act (P.L. 108-357) reduced taxes on repatriated earnings by providing a deduction equal to 85% of the increase in foreign-source earnings repatriated, effectively lowering the tax rate to 5.25% for firms paying taxes at the 35% corporate tax rate. The act also required firms to adopt domestic investment plans for qualifying repatriations and limited the maximum deduction allowed. The American Jobs Creation Act (P.L. 108-357) reduced taxes on repatriated earnings by providing a deduction equal to 85% of the increase in foreign-source earnings repatriated. The maximum allowable deduction was set at $500 million or the amount of earnings shown to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Researchers have studied the impact of this tax reduction on repatriated earnings, focusing on repatriations and economic stimulus measures. Studies on the impact of tax reduction on repatriated earnings have shown an increase in repatriated earnings but no significant effect on domestic investment or employment. Most repatriated earnings were used for stock repurchases. A permanent reduction in the tax rate is unlikely to increase repatriations according to economic theory. Once equity capital is invested in a foreign subsidiary, home-country taxes are inevitable. Repatriation taxes do not affect the decision to repatriate foreign earnings. Young subsidiaries receive capital from the U.S. parent, self-finance foreign investments, and eventually repatriate earnings. A temporary tax reduction on repatriated earnings leads to short-term increase in repatriations. The temporary tax reduction on repatriated earnings may affect the level of repatriations, with young firms potentially unaffected. However, any short-term increase in repatriations could be offset by a decrease in later years, especially if corporations expect the tax reduction to recur. The Joint Tax Committee estimates a revenue loss from a repatriation holiday despite short-term tax collection gains. The American Jobs Creation Act led to a significant increase in repatriations of offshore earnings, with approximately one-third of all earnings being repatriated in the tax year after enactment. This resulted in a greater-than-eight-fold increase in repatriations compared to the normal rate. The IRS study provided information on the recipients of the benefits. The repatriation provision under the American Jobs Creation Act led to a significant increase in repatriations of offshore earnings, with the pharmaceutical and medicine industry accounting for $99 billion (32%) and the computer and electronic equipment industry accounting for $58 billion (18%) of the total repatriations. The benefits were mainly from low tax countries and concentrated in a few firms, with five top firms responsible for $88 billion (28%) of total repatriations. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that a few top firms (Intel, Coca-Cola, Altria, and Motorola) accounted for over half of repatriations. There was a significant increase in repatriations due to the American Jobs Creation Act, with U.S. multinationals increasing repatriations by 266%. Unrepatriated earnings have grown rapidly since 2005, with total unrepatriated earnings reaching $958 billion for all corporations. The American Jobs Creation Act led to a significant increase in repatriations by U.S. multinationals. The impact on economic growth depends on how the repatriated earnings are used and the role of flexible exchange rates. Fiscal policy, such as reducing the tax rate on repatriated earnings, can boost economic activity by increasing demand for goods and services. Earnings must be spent to stimulate the economy effectively. The American Jobs Creation Act required corporations to have an approved plan to reinvest repatriated earnings before claiming a deduction. Critics argued the provision allowed too many reinvestment options, while proponents believed it recognized the fungibility of money. Economic theory suggests that changes in the after-tax cost of new investment are more likely to induce new investment compared to incentives that only increase after-tax profits without altering investment conditions. The Sinai study estimated that implementing repatriation provisions similar to those in the American Jobs Creation Act could have boosted participating companies' net cash-flow by around $535 billion in 2009. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggested that the stimulative impact of a cash-flow proposal for loss carrybacks could range between 0 and 40 cents of GDP per tax dollar not received, serving as an upper-bound estimate for the cash-flow effect of a repatriation rate reduction. A reduction in the tax on repatriated earnings may not have a significant stimulative effect on new investment, as empirical analyses suggest limited impact from such provisions. Economic theory indicates that without a strong focus on reinvestment plans, the tax reduction falls into a less stimulative category. Analysts found limited stimulative impact from the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Most repatriated earnings were used for cash-flow purposes, with little evidence of new investment. Firms that repatriated earnings also reduced employment, indicating a lack of expansion in domestic operations. Some industries increased their rate of repatriations after the provisions expired. The Subcommittee Report found that top repatriating corporations had job losses from 2004 to 2007, with Oracle being an exception due to acquiring other firms. Event studies couldn't establish a causal relationship between repatriation provisions and firm responses. Empirical studies concluded that the American Jobs Creation Act repatriation provisions did not increase domestic economic activity. Several studies found that repatriations had little impact on domestic capital expenditures and employment. Investment expenditures did not increase significantly in corporations utilizing repatriation provisions. While there was no effect on investment for non-capital constrained firms, capital-constrained firms did see some investment, accounting for about 20% of total repatriations. Overall, the repatriation provisions were deemed ineffective in boosting economic growth, but some evidence suggests that repatriated funds were used for stock repurchase programs. Several studies have shown that repatriated funds were mainly used for stock repurchase programs, with estimates ranging from 20% to 91% of the funds. Additionally, a study found that only 6% of repatriating firms surveyed had foregone U.S. investment opportunities due to taxes on repatriations. Several studies have projected the economic impact of a repatriation holiday, with simulations showing a temporary reduction in tax on repatriated earnings leading to increased domestic economic activity. The reduction in tax would boost GDP by $62 billion per year, business capital spending by $7 billion per year, and create 614,000 additional jobs in 2011. Shapiro and Mathur's 2008 debate on repatriation holiday effects used various methods to project unemployment, not following standard macroeconomic stimulus approaches. Recent simulation studies by Tyson, Serwin, and Drabkin estimated $977 billion in repatriations in 2012, leading to an output increase of $178 billion to $336 billion with multipliers of 0.18 to 0.34. The induced investment accounted for over 80% of the stimulus effects. The study estimated the effects of repatriation, assuming amounts 40% larger than projected by the JCT. The multiplier used projected an increase in output between $140 billion and $654 billion, with a central tendency of $360 billion. The range of projected repatriations was from $800 billion to $1.5 trillion. The estimated effects of repatriation were larger than projected by the JCT, with a range of $800 billion to $1.5 trillion. The stimulative effect of reduced tax rates on repatriated earnings may be offset by exchange rate adjustments. Repatriated foreign earnings are converted to U.S. dollars, increasing demand for dollars and leading to an appreciation of the dollar. The demand for dollars increases due to repatriated foreign earnings, leading to a stronger dollar in foreign exchange markets. This results in more expensive U.S. exports and cheaper foreign imports, causing a decline in net U.S. exports. The repatriation holiday may have a contractionary effect on the economy, partially offsetting any stimulative effects. The repatriation holiday may have a contractionary effect on the economy, as the demand for dollars increases due to repatriated foreign earnings, leading to a stronger dollar in foreign exchange markets. This results in more expensive U.S. exports and cheaper foreign imports, causing a decline in net U.S. exports. Subsequent evidence suggests a negative effect of the repatriation holiday on spending. The repatriation holiday could have a significant contractionary effect on the economy, with a projected $700 billion in repatriation leading to a potential $140 billion contraction. Concerns have been raised about the overly generous range of reinvestment options and the lack of specific use requirements. Empirical evidence supports these concerns, indicating the risk of repeated repatriation holidays. Concerns have been raised about the impact of repatriation holidays on the economy, with fears of firms moving operations overseas or engaging in profit shifting. A repatriation holiday similar to the one in 2004 is estimated to reduce federal receipts by $78.7 billion over 10 years. Various options to improve the efficiency of a dividends-received deduction proposal have been considered, but there are limitations due to the fungibility of money. Despite interest in a repatriation holiday for stimulus in 2012, there was discussion about incorporating it into a larger permanent tax revision for a territorial tax system. One option discussed for a permanent tax revision is to tie rate reductions to increases in desired activity like domestic employment or investment. This incremental \"trigger\" would only benefit if there is growth in desired activity, addressing concerns about repatriated money not being tied to U.S. outcomes. Implementing this trigger could determine eligibility for the provision and create tiers of reductions based on increased activity. Pooling repatriated earnings could lower the cost of a repatriation holiday and prevent firms from selectively repatriating earnings to avoid foreign taxes. Defining the base for such triggers is challenging, especially for permanent provisions. The 2004 law may be modified to prevent firms from cherry-picking earnings for repatriations without a dividends received deduction. A proposal suggests determining the foreign tax credit on a country-by-country basis. Another proposal combines a repatriation holiday with an infrastructure bank, but the rationale is unclear due to the small initial revenue collected. The revenue loss over the 10-year horizon is significantly larger. The net revenue loss for the budget horizon is $79 billion, with a short-term revenue gain of about $26 billion followed by a subsequent revenue loss of $105 billion."
