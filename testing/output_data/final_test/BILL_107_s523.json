    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building Better Health Centers Act of 2001\". Congress finds that lack of access to basic health services is a significant issue in the US, with millions of Americans unable to access primary care providers or health insurance. Health centers play a crucial role in providing primary care services to over 11 million Americans, including minorities, in medically-underserved communities. Health centers serve over 11 million Americans, including 7 million minorities, 600,000 farmworkers, and 600,000 homeless individuals annually. Studies show they offer high-quality, cost-effective care at less than $1 per day. Expanding access to health centers is a key solution to America's healthcare access issue. Many existing centers need renovation, with 30% in buildings over 30 years old and 12% over 50 years old. In a recent survey of health centers in 11 States, 2/3 identified a need to improve, expand, or replace their facilities, with an estimated $1.2 billion in unmet capital needs. Building new facilities in communities lacking access is crucial for increasing access to health centers. However, many health centers struggle to fund capital improvements or new facilities due to limited resources from private donations. Health centers face financial challenges due to uninsured patients and low reimbursements, making it difficult to secure loans. While the Federal government provides grants for operational expenses, they cannot assist with capital needs like new facilities. This hinders health centers' ability to expand and improve services for the medically underserved. The Federal government should supplement local efforts to meet health centers' capital needs for providing healthcare to the medically underserved. The Public Health Service Act is being amended. Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to authorize grants for eligible health centers to cover costs for facility expansion, replacement, or new construction. Eligible health centers are those already receiving specific grants under subsections (c)(1)(A), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i). An eligible health center receiving a grant can use funds to acquire, lease, modernize, expand, or replace existing facilities. The total cost of the project shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost proposed by the health center, unless the project cost is less than $750,000 or the Secretary waives the limitation for good cause. The Secretary may guarantee loans for health centers to acquire, lease, modernize, expand, or replace facilities and purchase equipment. The Secretary may guarantee loans for health centers to acquire, lease, modernize, expand, or replace facilities and purchase equipment. The loan guarantee shall not be considered a Federal subsidy for any other purpose. Definitions include facilities as buildings used by health centers for permitted services and non-Federal lender as a lender not affiliated with the Federal government. The term 'non-Federal lender' refers to any entity authorized by law to make loans, excluding Federal agencies. The Secretary must ensure the protection of financial interests before approving a loan guarantee. The Secretary must ensure that the loan terms, including interest rates and repayment schedule, protect the financial interests of the United States. The rate of interest should be reasonable and not exceed a certain percentage per annum. The Secretary cannot require essential assets as security for the loan. The loan guarantee program ensures that loans are provided on reasonable terms and conditions, with the United States entitled to recover payments unless waived for good cause by the Secretary. The Secretary may waive the right of recovery for loan guarantee payments, with the United States being subrogated to the recipient's rights. Recovered amounts will be credited to the program's financing account. Terms and conditions can be modified within the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act. The Secretary has the authority to modify or waive terms and conditions of a loan guarantee under section 504(e) of the Federal Credit Reform Act.
