    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean reflects the diversity of countries in the region, with some receiving aid for political, socioeconomic, and security challenges, while others no longer receive traditional development assistance but still get support for security issues. Despite progress in the region, foreign aid continues to play a crucial role in advancing U.S. policy goals. Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is crucial for advancing U.S. policy goals. Congress oversees aid programs and is considering spending cuts in this area. The report provides an overview of historical and recent trends in aid to the region, as well as the Obama Administration's FY2015 request for assistance. Congressional action on foreign aid appropriations for Latin America is also examined. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, providing over $160 billion since 1946. Assistance spiked in the 1960s with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress and increased again in the 1980s due to leftist movements. In the 1980s, the United States supported the Contras in Nicaragua to overthrow the Sandinista government and aided Central American governments against leftist insurgencies. Aid decreased in the mid-1990s but rose again in the late 1990s, with a focus on humanitarian and development assistance. This included aid after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and the establishment of programs like PEPFAR and MCC in the early 2000s. The United States provided significant assistance to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and increased funding for counternarcotics and security programs in the region. Foreign aid has been substantial for Colombia and its neighbors to combat drug trafficking and support development initiatives. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance package for Mexico and Central America, was split into CARSI for Central America and CBSI for the Caribbean. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010 due to overall budget reductions in foreign assistance. The recent decline in U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean reflects changes in the region, including economic growth and improved social policies. This has allowed the U.S. government to focus resources in fewer countries and sectors, such as closing USAID's mission in Panama in 2012. The USAID closed its mission in Panama in 2012 as the country graduated from foreign assistance. Latin American nations like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay are now providing foreign aid to other countries. The United States partners with these nations through \"trilateral cooperation\" initiatives for joint development and security assistance efforts in third countries. Bolivia and Ecuador show less interest in working with the United States, leading to reduced U.S. assistance and closure of USAID missions in those countries. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has decreased over the years due to evolving priorities and budget cuts. The Obama Administration and Congress have allocated fewer resources to the region, with assistance declining annually since FY2010. The Administration's FY2015 foreign aid request for the region is $1.3 billion, 10% lower than FY2014 and 27% lower than FY2012. This shift in emphasis would result in nearly 40% of assistance going towards the region. The Obama Administration's FY2015 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean would shift the emphasis of U.S. assistance efforts, with nearly 40% ($528 million) going towards development and humanitarian assistance programs. Development assistance aims to foster sustainable economic progress and social stability in developing nations through long-term projects in democracy promotion, economic reform, education, health, and environmental protection. The request includes funding for Development Assistance (DA) and Global Health Programs (GHP) accounts, as well as humanitarian assistance through the Food for Peace (P.L. 480) account to address immediate food security needs. The FY2015 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes increased funding for development assistance, particularly through the Development Assistance (DA) account. This shift in funding reflects a focus on supporting countries dealing with drug trafficking and violence, such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Peru. Additionally, a significant portion of the funding would come from the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account, which aims to promote U.S. political, economic, and security interests in the region. The Administration's FY2015 request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes a 14% decrease in ESF funding compared to FY2014. This is due to a shift in funding from ESF to DA accounts, resulting in reduced aid for Colombia and Haiti. The remaining 30% of the request ($405 million) would support security assistance programs, including counternarcotics efforts under the INCLE account. The FY2015 request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes funding cuts in various security assistance accounts, with the biggest decrease in the INCLE account by 29%. This reduction is mainly due to cuts in major U.S. security programs in the region like Plan Colombia, the M\u00e9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI. The FY2015 request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes funding cuts in security assistance accounts, with reductions in aid to Colombia, Haiti, and Mexico. These three countries remain top recipients of U.S. foreign aid, comprising over 52% of assistance. Funding cuts will be redirected to mid-sized aid programs in Peru, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Colombia has received significant aid for counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts since FY2000, but assistance has decreased as the country's security situation has improved. Under the Administration's FY2015 request, Colombia would receive nearly $281 million for drug eradication, alternative development, land restitution, demobilization of ex-combatants, human rights promotion, and aid to vulnerable groups. Despite a 14% decrease in U.S. assistance compared to FY2014, Colombia remains the top recipient in Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States has provided significant aid to Haiti for years due to humanitarian and development challenges, especially after the 2010 earthquake. The FY2015 request includes $274 million for various development projects, with a 6% decrease from FY2014. Mexico has also started receiving substantial aid from the U.S. The FY2015 request includes $137 million for the M\u00e9rida Initiative in Mexico, supporting efforts against criminal organizations, law reform, violence prevention, border security, and low carbon development. Aid to Mexico is decreasing by 34% compared to FY2014, as previous funding has not been fully utilized. In contrast, Peru would receive a 25% increase in U.S. assistance in the Administration's FY2015 foreign aid request. In the FY2015 foreign aid request, Peru would receive a 25% increase in U.S. assistance, totaling $94 million. The aid is primarily for counternarcotics efforts, environmental programs for the Amazon Rainforest, and climate change adaptation. The Peruvian government has increased its own funding for these efforts, prompting the request for increased U.S. assistance. The FY2015 foreign aid request includes increased assistance for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to address high levels of crime and violence. The funding would focus on strengthening justice and security sector institutions, as well as traditional development activities. The Administration is emphasizing a more balanced approach in Central America, with a focus on governance, prosperity, and security. Additionally, regional programs administered by the Administration would receive $295 million in foreign aid. The FY2015 foreign aid request includes $295 million for regional programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. The majority of funds would go to the Western Hemisphere Regional program, supporting security initiatives like CARSI and CBSI. Despite cuts in funding for CARSI and CBSI, the Administration maintains a focus on citizen security. The FY2015 foreign aid request prioritizes citizen security in the Western Hemisphere. Congress uses annual appropriations bills to review U.S. assistance. Funding for regional programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, including CARSI and CBSI, was included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. The legislation allocates $33.2 billion for global economic and security assistance, slightly higher than the Administration's request. Specific funding levels for Latin America and the Caribbean are not specified, but the bill includes $260 million for CARSI, $130 million more than requested. The explanatory statement directs the Administration to address key factors in Central America with the additional funds. The legislation allocates funds for addressing key factors in Central America contributing to migration to the US, with additional funds for aid to Mexico, border security initiatives in Mexico, security and justice sector assistance in Colombia, and environmental programs in the Brazilian Amazon. Congress may consider policy priorities, budget constraints, aid coordination, and sustainability of assistance programs for Latin America and the Caribbean. The Administration's FY2015 budget request cuts aid to the Western Hemisphere by 10% compared to FY2014, with Latin America and the Caribbean seeing a decline from 7.6% to 6.8% of all U.S. assistance. Members of Congress may debate U.S. policy priorities in the region and how they compare to priorities elsewhere in the world. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget request reduces aid to Latin America and the Caribbean from 7.6% to 6.8% of all U.S. assistance. Administration officials attribute the decline to shifting circumstances and budget tradeoffs. The U.S. policy priorities for the region include promoting economic and social opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. The emphasis in the FY2015 foreign aid budget request would shift slightly towards development assistance and away from security. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget request reduces aid to Latin America and the Caribbean from 7.6% to 6.8% of all U.S. assistance. Some Members of Congress criticize funding for clean energy and climate change programs, preferring support for security efforts. U.S. assistance to the region has declined, with a focus on trade negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and trade preference programs like GSP and CBI. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget request reduces aid to Latin America and the Caribbean. Initiatives like 100,000 Strong in the Americas and Connecting the Americas 2022 aim to increase student exchanges and access to clean energy. Questions for Congress include comparing U.S. priorities in the Western Hemisphere to other regions and assessing if foreign aid budget aligns with U.S. interests in Latin America. The potential effects of foreign aid reductions on political, economic, and security conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean are being questioned. Congress is considering resource coordination and alternative forms of engagement to advance U.S. policy priorities in the region. Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is managed by various government agencies, including the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Defense (DOD). In FY2012, DOD provided $283 million for counternarcotics, humanitarian, and security aid through U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command. Other agencies like the Inter-American Foundation, MCC, and Peace Corps also provide aid. A 2012 GAO report highlighted a lack of coordination among State Department, USAID, and DOD, leading to potential overlap in assistance efforts. The lack of coordination among State Department, USAID, and DOD in providing foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean may lead to unnecessary overlap. GAO suggests that better coordination and a formal framework for sharing information could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of programs. Congress could also consider closer coordination with other international donors, as Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.1 billion in official development assistance in 2012, with the United States contributing $2 billion. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States contributed $2 billion in official development assistance in 2012, while other major donors provided $4.6 billion (46%) and multilateral organizations provided $3.4 billion (34%). Studies have found a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could improve efficiency, but disagreements on leadership and division of labor pose challenges. Strategic interests may also impact aid programs' focus on specific countries or sectors. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay to provide assistance to third countries. The agreements aim to access new solutions and expertise, combining best practices with financial resources to improve food security and provide security support to countries like Haiti, Honduras, and Mozambique. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay to provide assistance to third countries. Colombia will receive $1 million to support training and security efforts in Central America and the Caribbean. Critics raise oversight concerns about foreign government assistance potentially leading to misuse of U.S. funds. Members of Congress may need to clarify roles of U.S. agencies providing foreign aid and improve inter-agency coordination. The United States is considering its foreign assistance capacities in Latin American and Caribbean nations, focusing on political will, program sustainability, and ensuring funds are used in accordance with U.S. law. The State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review emphasizes assessing host nations' political will to make effective reforms for impactful assistance. Congressional oversight is crucial to address potential misuse of U.S. funds in trilateral cooperation agreements with countries like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay. Inter-agency coordination and clarifying roles of U.S. agencies providing aid are essential for effective assistance delivery. The United States is focusing on political will and program sustainability in Latin American and Caribbean nations to ensure impactful assistance. Colombia has shown success in implementing reforms and taking over financial responsibility as U.S. aid is gradually reduced. USAID has closed its mission in Panama and withdrawn from development sectors in other countries where partner nations have developed the capacity to manage. Despite successes in Latin American countries, political will has often been lacking in sustaining U.S.-supported programs. Reports show instances of resources languishing post-U.S. support, with countries unable to maintain equipment due to funding shortages. Even Millennium Challenge Corporation projects have faced sustainability challenges. The MCC compact in Honduras faced sustainability issues due to lack of equipment, expertise, and funding for road maintenance. Questions for Congress to consider include the host country's capacity for maintenance, financial responsibility, assistance duration, political will for reforms, and complementing U.S. aid with host efforts. To ensure sustainability of MCC compacts, Congress must consider host nation's capacity for maintenance, financial responsibility, political will for reforms, and complementing U.S. aid with host efforts. Should U.S. assistance be contingent upon host nation reforms or financing?"
