    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security Protection Act of 2011\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that Social Security is a successful program that has kept millions of seniors, individuals with disabilities, and children out of poverty for 75 years. Before its enactment in 1935, half of seniors lived in poverty, compared to less than 10% today. Social Security protects working Americans from income loss due to retirement, disability, or the death of a spouse or parent, with over 53 million Americans receiving benefits. Social Security benefits over 53 million Americans, including retirees, veterans, disabled individuals, surviving spouses, and dependent children. It has never contributed to the Federal budget deficit or national debt. The Trust Funds have been running surpluses for the last 25 years, with a current surplus of $2.6 trillion projected to grow to $4.2 trillion by 2023. According to the Social Security Administration, the current surplus of $2.6 trillion is projected to grow to $4.2 trillion by 2023. Full benefits will be available until 2037, with 78% of promised benefits funded after that. Workers contribute 12.4% payroll tax to Social Security. Social Security, funded by a 12.4 percent payroll tax split between employees and employers, ensures a dignified retirement for many elderly Americans. Two-thirds rely on Social Security for the majority of their income, with one-third depending almost entirely on it. Retirees receive an average of $14,000 annually, with women averaging less than $12,000. Additionally, 1 in 4 adult beneficiaries are military veterans, and Social Security also functions as a disability insurance program. The Social Security Disability Insurance program provides critical support for American workers who become permanently disabled. Privatizing Social Security or raising the retirement age could jeopardize the financial security of millions, especially those in physically demanding jobs and lower-income groups with lower life expectancies. Social Security benefits have been cut by 13 percent, and raising the retirement age would further reduce benefits. This could force millions to choose between basic necessities like heating, food, and prescription drugs. Social Security is a promise that must be upheld. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CHANGES TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE BENEFICIARIES. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, legislation cannot increase retirement age or reduce cost-of-living increases for individuals receiving Social Security benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. The provisions of this Act prohibit any increase in retirement age or reduction in cost-of-living increases for individuals receiving Social Security benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. Additionally, the Act prohibits the reduction of benefit payment amounts and the creation of private retirement accounts for these individuals. The waiver or suspension of these provisions requires a two-thirds affirmative vote in the Senate and a rule or order in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives requires a two-thirds vote to waive certain provisions related to Social Security benefits. It is not allowed to consider a rule or order that waives specific subsections, and the Speaker cannot entertain a motion to suspend these rules."
