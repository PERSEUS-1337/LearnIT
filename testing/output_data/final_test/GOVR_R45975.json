Today, the U.S. government is a major donor to these efforts, providing significant funding for organizations like GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. The ongoing concern in Congress is the extent of U.S. funding for global child vaccination and donor coordination. Donor-backed campaigns have reduced mortality in poor countries, with setbacks occasionally. In the early 1990s, U.S. assistance led to an 80% immunization rate for DTP3 vaccine. Progress has stalled on certain vaccines. In the late-1990s, global vaccination rates stalled for certain vaccines due to various reasons. In 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was launched to address this issue and has since supported the immunization of 700 million children. Vaccinations are cost-effective in preventing infectious diseases, with WHO recommending 10 vaccines for all children. The United States, as a founding member of GAVI, provides funding and holds a rotating seat on its board. Childhood vaccinations protect against VPDs, saving 3 million lives annually. Global vaccine coverage varies, with high morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Vaccine hesitancy has led to increased VPD cases in some high-income countries. GAVI reports 760 million children immunized from 2000-2018, with 20 million not fully vaccinated by 2018. According to GAVI, full vaccination coverage could prevent one in seven deaths in under-5 children, with over 1.5 million children dying annually from VPDs. Nearly 60% of these deaths occur in 10 countries. Global immunization campaigns have reduced child deaths from 12.7 million to 5.8 million from 1990 to 2017. Measles vaccination has averted 15.6 million deaths from 2000 to 2017. While global vaccine coverage has increased, progress in vaccinating children with DTP3 has stagnated in recent years. The coverage of the three-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine has stagnated in recent years, with higher coverage compared to other required vaccinations. GAVI attributes the recent stagnation to issues faced by previously high-performing countries. These diseases are particularly fatal to neonates, new mothers, and pregnant women. Maternal and neonatal tetanus has been nearly eliminated globally, with an 85% reduction in newborn deaths from tetanus since 2000. However, MNTE still exists in 14 countries as of March 2019. In 2018, 86% of children under one received all three doses of the DTP3 vaccine. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for four out of every five under-5 child deaths, highlighting the need for improved global uptake of childhood vaccines. In 2015, U.N. member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children by 2030. SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-5 mortality rates to 25 per 1,000 live births in every country. International efforts to decrease vaccine-preventable deaths among children are led by organizations like WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI, with significant U.S. support. International organizations such as WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI, with U.S. support, lead efforts to decrease vaccine-preventable deaths among children. UNICEF is the largest global purchaser of vaccines, focusing on providing vaccinations, monitoring vaccine supply and quality, vaccine innovation, and disease eradication programs. They align with WHO targets in the Global Vaccine Action Plan. The WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) in 2011 to reach 90% of children under one with routine immunization by 2020. The plan aligns with WHO's strategic goals to promote new vaccines, establish norms, and ensure quality. WHO also provides evidence-based immunization policy recommendations through an advisory group. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) provides policy recommendations based on evidence for member states. GAVI, a public-private partnership, aims to expand global access to vaccines and prevent deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. GAVI's Phase IV strategy for 2015-2020 aligns with the goals of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), with a goal to immunize 300 million children by 2025 and save 5-6 million lives in the long term. Various factors affect global immunization coverage, including vaccine hesitancy and stigma, geographic location, inadequate country capacity, and poverty and socioeconomic status. A resurgence of certain vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) has highlighted challenges of vaccine hesitancy and stigma, with examples like polio and measles. In 2019, there was a 300% increase in global measles cases, prompting concerns among public health officials. The WHO listed \"vaccine hesitancy\" as a global public health threat due to cases in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. Factors like corruption, authoritarian governance, and social discrimination can fuel vaccine hesitancy by undermining trust in authority figures. Nigeria struggled to eliminate polio due to conspiracy theories, vaccine stigma, and ethical concerns. Geographic distance from health centers negatively impacts vaccination coverage, especially for underserved populations. Underserved populations in many countries face higher disease burdens and lack access to basic medical care. Vaccine coverage disparities between urban and rural areas contribute to disease spread. For example, measles vaccine coverage in rural areas of countries like Nigeria and Indonesia is 33% lower than in urban areas. Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in vaccination coverage, with low-income countries lagging behind high-income countries. Inadequate funding in low-income countries hinders vaccination efforts, leading to inequities in coverage based on income levels. Children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from wealthier families, with unequal access to vaccines being a key factor. Vaccine coverage disparities exist between the richest and poorest populations, with up to 58% higher coverage for the wealthiest. UNICEF reports that 40% of unvaccinated children live in conflict-affected countries, where fragile healthcare infrastructure hinders vaccination efforts. Refugee and displacement camps also face challenges like poor nutrition and unsanitary conditions that contribute to disease spread. Conflict-affected countries with poor healthcare infrastructure face challenges in vaccination efforts, leading to spikes in vaccine-preventable diseases. Congress has historically supported global child vaccination programs to eradicate infectious diseases. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State and Foreign Operations fund global immunization activities through various agencies like CDC, USAID, and GAVI. These agencies work with country governments to strengthen immunization programs and align with global vaccination plans. The CDC and USAID support global immunization efforts through supply chain management, product procurement, and research funding. They collaborate with international partners like the WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank to control vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide. The CDC's Global Immunization Program, funded through various sources including Table 2, focuses on polio with smaller allocations for measles and other VPDs. Global vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced polio cases worldwide, with only Afghanistan and Pakistan reporting wild polio cases in 2018. Nigeria still detects vaccine-derived poliovirus, but no confirmed cases have been reported since 2019. The CDC's programming is guided by its 2016-2020 Strategic Framework for Global Immunization, which outlines five goals. The CDC's Global Immunization Program focuses on controlling, eliminating, or eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases globally. The strategic framework outlines five goals, including strengthening country ownership and partnerships, ensuring quality vaccination delivery, and conducting research. The CDC collaborates with USAID, UNICEF, GAVI, and other stakeholders to implement the strategy, aligned with other global health initiatives. Congress appropriated more funding for CDC global immunization programs in FY2019 than requested by the Trump Administration. The Administration's FY2019 and FY2020 budget requests aimed to reduce funding for global immunization activities, focusing on polio eradication, measles, and rubella elimination in high disease burden countries. USAID collaborates with ministries of health and GAVI to strengthen routine immunization campaigns and disease surveillance, aiming to prevent child and maternal deaths through capacity building for foreign health systems. In Ethiopia, USAID works with the Ministry of Health to train community volunteers to identify vaccine-preventable diseases and track vaccine defaulters. The United States provides significant support for multilateral immunization programs through contributions to international organizations and GAVI, a public-private partnership aimed at expanding global access to vaccines. GAVI, founded in 2000 with U.S. involvement, works to prevent deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases by accelerating vaccine access and strengthening healthcare systems. The United States supports GAVI to accelerate vaccine access and strengthen healthcare systems. The US is the third largest donor to GAVI, providing nearly $2 billion of the total $21 billion donated. Funding for GAVI is appropriated by Congress through USAID's Global Health Programs account. The US holds a seat on GAVI's board along with WHO and UNICEF. Congressional appropriators have increased funding for GAVI during the Obama Administration, but the Trump Administration proposed cuts in FY2019 and FY2020. In FY2019, Congress appropriated $290 million for GAVI, the same level as in FY2018. Concerns have been raised about maintaining progress in preventing and eradicating communicable diseases due to global outbreaks of VPDs. Congress may explore the effectiveness of global vaccination campaigns for domestic pandemic preparedness. The global resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and mumps poses a threat to U.S. public health. Recent outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to travelers from abroad and domestic vaccine hesitancy. The Senate Committee on HELP discussed preventable disease outbreaks, including cases from international travelers. Congress may consider oversight on vaccine-related issues like misinformation and funding for global vaccination campaigns. The U.S. government's core focus on foreign policy includes funding for global vaccination programs. The Trump Administration has requested cuts to global health funding, aiming to prioritize resources for countries with the highest disease burden. Some experts warn of stagnation in vaccination coverage and the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. Experts are concerned about flat support for global vaccine campaigns leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, raising questions about burden sharing and the efficacy of increasing vaccination rates globally."
