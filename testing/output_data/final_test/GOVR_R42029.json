Assessments focus on physician population size, composition, and geographic distribution. Policies targeting physician supply aim to address current and future needs, as physician training is lengthy. Physician decisions influence 90% of healthcare spending, making the size of the physician population key in determining healthcare costs. Physician supply impacts healthcare costs and quality, with composition and geographic distribution playing a role. Areas with more specialists tend to have higher healthcare spending. Inadequate physician numbers can lead to increased emergency room visits, while an excess may result in unnecessary services. Physician supply affects population health by influencing access to timely care and potentially impacting health outcomes. The federal government supports physician services and training through programs in various departments and agencies, primarily funded by Medicare and Medicaid. Physician supply impacts healthcare costs, quality, and population health outcomes. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed by President Obama in 2010 may affect physician services demand. It expands insurance coverage, Medicaid eligibility, and increases demand for primary care physicians. The ACA authorizes funding for physician training programs, supports primary care, and encourages physicians to practice in specific areas. This report analyzes the impact on physician supply. The report examines the dimensions of physician supply and workforce planning activities included in the ACA that may affect supply. An appropriately sized physician population is crucial for an effective healthcare system, as too few physicians can lead to delayed care and increased costs, while too many physicians may result in unnecessary services and higher risks of adverse events. The physician population is crucial for an effective healthcare system to avoid delayed care and increased costs. The number of physicians in the United States has increased since 1970, measured by absolute counts or ratios of physicians to the population. The ACA aims to increase the number of physicians and improve productivity. The physician population in the United States has increased significantly since 1970, with 985,375 physicians in 2010, representing a 195% increase. The physician-to-population ratio also rose by 98% during the same period. However, critics argue that these measures do not consider physicians' specialties or geographic distribution, which can impact access to quality care. Determining the appropriateness of the physician population size requires considering the balance between available services and demand. Determining the appropriate size of the physician population involves accurate measures of the number of physicians, their productivity, and demand for services. Factors like physician training, retirement, productivity, work hours, technology, and population demographics impact this. Policies supporting the right physician population size require precise measurement of these components, which can be challenging. The appropriate size of the physician population involves accurate measures of the number of physicians, their productivity, and demand for services. Policies supporting this require precise measurement of these components, which can be challenging. The ACA includes provisions targeting the number of physicians and their productivity, sparking debates on whether the current physician population is adequate. The debate is further fueled by the ACA's potential to expand insurance coverage to the uninsured population. In 2012, 34 states reported physician shortages or anticipated future shortages. The AAMC estimated 13,700 too few physicians in 2010 due to the ACA. GAO found in 2009 that 97% of Medicare beneficiaries had access to physician services. Differences in estimates may be due to methodologies or focus on Medicare population. Some experts believe the current physician population is adequate. Experts debate the appropriateness of the physician population size, with concerns about access to care attributed to the composition and distribution of physicians. The cyclical nature of concerns over the past 30 years has seen predictions of surpluses in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by worries of shortages due to aging populations, workforce, and medical technology advances. Discussions continue on the future size of the physician population. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and AAMC predict future physician shortages. HRSA predicted a shortage of 55,000 to 150,000 physicians by 2020, while AAMC estimated a shortfall of 124,400 to 130,600 physicians by 2025. Some believe technological and practice changes may create efficiencies, potentially reducing the need for as many physicians. Both HRSA and AAMC predict future physician shortages, with estimates varying due to assumptions and limitations in their models. Factors influencing projections include changes in medical technology, physician productivity, and the aging population. Policy changes like the ACA may also impact future demand for physician services. Predicting the effects of such changes adds uncertainty to the projections. The ACA may impact the demand for physician services and the size of the physician population. Provisions in the ACA aim to increase insurance coverage, leading to higher demand for physician services. Predictions suggest that the ACA will require more primary care physicians in the future. The ACA includes provisions to increase physician services by targeting methods to increase physician training and productivity, such as coordinating care and training non-physician providers. This may lead to more efficient care delivery and increased availability of physician services. The ACA includes provisions to increase physician services by modifying federal Medicare payments and authorizing additional funding for medical residency training programs. This aims to increase the number of physicians by supporting residency training, which is required for licensure. Medicare is a major source of support for residency training, making approximately $9.5 billion in payments annually to teaching hospitals. The ACA supports medical residency training by providing payments to teaching hospitals, with Medicare being a major source of support. The ACA includes provisions to increase the number of residents trained by redistributing unused Medicare-funded residency training slots. The ACA redistributes unused residency positions to hospitals meeting specific criteria, with a focus on primary care and general surgery. It also includes provisions to increase non-Medicare-funded residents and grants for establishing primary care residency training in community-based settings. The ACA establishes the PPHF to support prevention and public health programs with indefinite appropriations. $750 million was allocated in FY2010, with $167.3 million used to fund 889 primary care residents. The ACA promotes care coordination and expands the non-physician provider workforce to increase physician productivity and services available. The ACA includes provisions to encourage care coordination through medical homes, which aim to better manage patients' chronic conditions by coordinating care across primary care physicians, specialists, and non-physician providers. This includes establishing grant programs, Medicaid options, a Center for Innovation, and pilot programs for Medicare payment incentives for coordinated care. The ACA includes provisions for payment incentives and service delivery models to promote coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries, including support for non-physician providers like physician assistants and advanced practice nurses. A new program supports Family Nurse Practitioner training to address concerns about the composition of the physician population, with a focus on primary care shortages and oversupply of specialty physicians. Research shows that primary care is linked to improved health outcomes and reduced costs. Research has shown that having more primary care physicians is associated with lower mortality rates and decreased healthcare costs. Countries with a higher number of primary care physicians also tend to have better overall population health indicators. On the other hand, the impact of an increased number of specialists on health outcomes is less clear, with mixed results from various studies. Specialty supply has little effect on infant mortality or all-cause mortality. Adverse health outcomes, including higher mortality rates, may be linked to the current distribution of specialists and primary care physicians. Shortages in certain specialties like cardiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, and neurology have been documented. Some specialties, such as general surgery, geriatrics, pediatric subspecialties, and psychiatry, have acknowledged shortages. The U.S. physician population consists of one-third primary care physicians and two-thirds specialists, with shortages in certain specialties like cardiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, and neurology. Primary care supply and factors deterring entry into primary care practice are discussed, along with ACA provisions aimed at addressing these issues. Additionally, there are targeted federal programs to address shortages in specialties like general surgery, geriatrics, pediatric subspecialties, and psychiatry. The Council on Graduate Medical Education recommends increasing the percentage of U.S. primary care physicians to at least 40%, in line with other industrialized nations. Experts predict future primary care shortages, exacerbated by the ACA's focus on care coordination and preventive care. One study suggests that the ACA's insurance expansions could lead to an additional shortage of 8,000 primary care physicians by 2025, on top of the 43,000 needed to care for a growing and aging population. One study suggests that the ACA's insurance expansions could lead to an additional shortage of 8,000 primary care physicians by 2025, on top of the 43,000 needed to care for a growing and aging population. However, another study suggests that there may not be future primary care shortages due to delivery system reforms and increased use of non-physician providers and electronic health records. Role models and exposure in hospital-based training may influence medical specialty choice. Hospital-based training can influence medical students towards specialties, with salary differences between primary care physicians and specialists being a key factor. Primary care physicians face uncompensated care coordination duties and administrative burdens, which can deter students from entering primary care specialties. Policy implications include the need to address these challenges to encourage more students to pursue primary care. The ACA aims to increase primary care supply by addressing barriers such as lack of exposure to primary care content in training, low Medicare and Medicaid payments for primary care providers, and the need for care coordination incentives. Additionally, the ACA supports training for specialists in shortage. The ACA targets primary care content in physician training through changes to PHSA Title VII programs and the Medicare GME program. ACA Section 5301 reauthorizes PHSA Section 747, \"Primary Care Training and Enhancement,\" providing grants to support medical students, residents, and faculty in primary care. HHS is supporting additional primary care resident training starting in July 2011 for five years. The ACA authorizes grants for teaching health centers to support primary care residency programs in community-based settings. GME payments are appropriated for teaching health centers in addition to other sources. HRSA awarded GME funds to teaching health centers in FY2011 and FY2012, with intentions to do so in FY2013. The ACA redistributes residency positions to hospitals meeting criteria, with 75% for primary care or general surgery. It also changes how Medicare counts resident time in non-hospital settings for increased payment, aiming to boost primary care exposure in training. The ACA allows hospitals to count resident time at conferences and seminars in non-hospital settings for GME payments. It also includes provisions for increased payments to certain primary care physicians providing services to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA includes provisions to increase Medicaid payments to primary care physicians in 2013 and 2014, aligning them with Medicare rates. It also encourages care coordination through medical homes and various sections like 3502, 2703, 3021, 3023, and 3024. Section 5405 authorizes a grant program for educating primary care providers on care coordination, chronic disease management, and preventive medicine. Additionally, Section 3503 establishes medication management programs involving a multidisciplinary group of providers to improve chronic disease treatment and reduce costs. The ACA includes provisions to increase Medicaid payments to primary care physicians and encourages care coordination through medical homes. Section 5203 authorizes loan repayments for pediatric medical, surgical, and mental health subspecialists in underserved areas. Sections 5501 and 5503 aim to incentivize training and practice in general surgery, with bonus payments for surgeons in shortage areas. The ACA redistributes unused Medicare residency positions to hospitals meeting criteria, prioritizing primary care and general surgery. It also provides grants for training in geriatrics and behavioral health to address shortages in these areas. Geographic distribution of physicians impacts healthcare access, quality, and cost. The distribution of physicians in the United States varies significantly, with some regions having a surplus of 50% and others facing a deficit of 10%. Both over- and undersupply of physicians can lead to issues in healthcare access and quality. Rural areas and economically disadvantaged urban areas are particularly prone to physician shortages, impacting the population's ability to receive necessary care. This section focuses on physician shortages in specific geographic areas, including Health Professional Shortages Areas (HPSAs) and Medically Underserved Populations/Areas (MUA/Ps). The federal government designates Professional Shortages Areas (HPSAs) and Medically Underserved Populations/Areas (MUA/Ps) to identify areas with health professional shortages, including physicians. These designations guide federal policies to increase the number of health professionals in specific geographic areas. The section also explores reasons for physician shortages in certain areas and how ACA provisions may impact physician distribution. Federal policies prioritize addressing shortages over areas with excess physicians. The federal government designates HPSAs and MUA/Ps to identify areas with health provider shortages, making them eligible for federal programs to address these shortages. HPSAs can be in urban or rural areas and may include specific population groups or facilities. The HPSA designation is the most restrictive designation of physician undersupply, with specific criteria for primary care shortages. Areas, populations, or facilities may have physician shortages without being designated as HPSAs. The federal government also designates areas and populations as MUAs or MUPs based on services available and population characteristics. Policies aim to reduce physician shortages in underserved areas by increasing primary care supply, particularly family medicine physicians. There is a documented shortage of family medicine physicians, and fewer medical school graduates are choosing this field. Encouraging primary care, especially family medicine, may benefit areas with few physicians designated as HPSAs. These areas are eligible for federal programs to bring providers to shortage areas. Physicians in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are eligible for federal programs like NHSC scholarships and loan repayments. They may also receive Medicare bonus payments and facilities in Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) can be designated as federally qualified health centers. MUA/Ps may be eligible for certain federal programs, such as health workforce programs authorized by Title VII of the PHSA. Physician shortages in certain areas may be influenced by aspects of physician training and specialty choice. Physician training, particularly in teaching hospitals located in urban areas, can influence where physicians choose to practice. Training in community health centers may encourage practicing in those settings post-residency. Educational experiences during training impact career choices. Recent research suggests that medical students' racial, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds may influence their choice of practice location after residency. Students from underrepresented groups and rural areas are more likely to serve the medically underserved. Medical schools are advised to consider these factors in admissions and develop programs to recruit and retain students who will care for underserved populations. Lifestyle factors, such as on-call time, are also becoming important in students' practice location decisions. Physicians in shortage areas may face unique challenges, such as isolation. The ACA includes provisions to address the geographic maldistribution of physicians by expanding the number of NHSC providers in shortage areas and revising criteria for designating HPSAs and MUPs. These changes aim to increase diversity in the physician workforce and encourage providers to serve in underserved areas. The ACA includes changes to the NHSC to encourage providers to serve as faculty at teaching health centers, increase loan repayment amounts, and offer part-time options in exchange for extended service requirements. This aims to make NHSC participation more attractive to younger providers seeking work-life balance. The ACA includes increased discretionary appropriations for the NHSC and transfers funds from the Community Health Center Fund to support the NHSC. Funding for the NHSC was reduced in FY2011 and eliminated in FY2012, with no discretionary funds appropriated in FY2013 under the six-month Continuing Resolution. The ACA includes provisions to increase diversity in the physician workforce, as research shows current population lacks diversity. Federal programs support minority representation in underserved areas. Section 5401 reauthorizes Centers of Excellence program to promote diversity in health professions. Section 5402 authorizes increased funding for scholarships and loans. The ACA authorizes increased funding for scholarship, loan repayment, and fellowship programs to support students and faculty from disadvantaged backgrounds in pursuing health professions education. It also includes provisions to encourage training in rural areas and HPSAs/MUAs, as well as a program to recruit medical students from rural areas for training in rural settings to promote rural practice. Programs may connect physicians in underserved areas, reducing isolation and increasing contact with colleagues to address barriers to practice in shortage areas. Section 5403 of the ACA amends the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) program to address workforce shortages by supporting physician recruitment and retention in underserved and rural areas. It includes new grants for medical and nursing schools to develop programs, increased appropriations for AHECs, and grants for continuing educational support in underserved communities through distance learning, conferences, and telehealth. The ACA includes a new program to train students likely to practice in rural settings, with grants awarded to medical schools for focused training in underserved rural communities. Teaching health centers may also increase medical residency training in underserved areas. The ACA requires updated criteria for designating HPSAs and MUPs to address outdated criteria and potential shortages. HHS has yet to establish new methodology despite efforts since 1998. Lack of workforce planning, coordination, and data hinder evaluation of physician workforce programs funded under PHSA Title VII. These concerns predate the ACA. The ACA aims to address the lack of planning and coordination in the healthcare workforce by expanding federal support. It establishes the National Health Workforce Commission to evaluate workforce supply and demand, make recommendations, and authorize grants for workforce development planning. The ACA establishes the National Center for Health Care Workforce Analysis and requires data collection on health workforce programs. It also authorizes grants for workforce development and longitudinal evaluations for individuals receiving support. Concerns exist about the adequacy of the current and future physician supply. The current and future physician supply may be inadequate, with concerns about overall physician shortage, especially in primary care, and uneven distribution across the US. The impact of the ACA on physician supply is uncertain, as many of its provisions are not yet implemented and some are temporary or rely on discretionary funding."
