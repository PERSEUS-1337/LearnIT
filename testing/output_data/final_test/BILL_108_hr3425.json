    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Domestic Violence Prevention, Education, and Awareness Act\" and includes findings related to domestic violence. The Congress finds that nearly one-third of American women report being physically or sexually abused by a partner, costing the nation billions annually. The US is becoming more multicultural, with minorities expected to make up 50% of the population by 2050. Two-thirds of female immigrants come from Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East for economic security or to reunify their families. Racial and ethnic minority women and immigrant women face unique challenges in reporting domestic violence due to structural inequalities, including threats of deportation by abusive spouses. Many racial and ethnic minority women and immigrant women encounter cultural and institutional barriers when trying to report domestic violence or seek help. Cultural barriers include strong religious beliefs emphasizing family unity and fear of dishonor, while institutional barriers include limited access to public assistance and immigration relief, lack of language support, and treatment programs that do not consider cultural differences. Cultural and institutional barriers, such as prohibitive fees and inconvenient hours, hinder minority and immigrant women from seeking help for domestic violence. Grants will be provided for public information campaigns to educate racial and ethnic minority communities and immigrant communities about domestic violence. The Attorney General will make grants for public information campaigns to educate minority and immigrant communities about domestic violence, including prevention methods and available services. Grant funds can only be used for these campaigns and staffing. The Attorney General may award grants for public information campaigns on domestic violence to minority and immigrant communities. The campaigns can include public service announcements, print media messages, public transit advertising, electronic broadcast media, and other appropriate methods. The campaigns must be culturally sensitive, involve consultation with local advocates, and test-market plans. The Attorney General may award grants for public information campaigns on domestic violence to minority and immigrant communities. Criteria for awarding grants include partnering with entities with a record of high-quality campaigns, testing marketing plans with relevant communities, using effectiveness criteria, and evaluating campaign effectiveness. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State or entity must submit an application to the Attorney General that includes a description of the proposed public information campaign, identification of specific communities to be educated, and plans to educate communities at greatest risk of domestic violence. The applicant must provide details on working with organizations for culturally appropriate messages, geographic distribution of the campaign, media organizations involved, nature of informational messages, and information required by the Attorney General for grant eligibility. The General may need to determine if the requirements in subsection (d) will be met and if the criteria in subsection (e) apply. The Attorney General may also require additional information and assurances. The term \"State\" includes various territories for this section. Appropriations are authorized as needed for this Act."
