    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 38134 of the Education Code allows school districts to authorize the use of facilities by nonprofit organizations, clubs, or associations promoting youth and school activities, including the Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire USA, YMCA, parent-teacher associations, school-community advisory councils, and recreational youth sports leagues with nominal fees.

The governing board of a school district may charge fees not exceeding direct costs for facility use, excluding activities deemed not beneficial to youth or school activities. The governing board of a school district can charge fees for the use of school facilities by entities organizing sports league activities for youths, including religious organizations. The fees should not exceed the direct costs incurred by the school district. Additionally, if a church or religious organization uses school facilities for specified purposes, they must be charged an amount equal to the school district's direct costs. (e) For entertainment or meetings with admission fees or solicited contributions, a charge equal to fair rental value is levied for using school facilities. If school property is damaged, the entity may be charged for damages and denied further use. \"Direct costs\" include all costs incurred by the school district for facility use. The entity using school facilities must pay a share of costs for supplies, utilities, janitorial services, and salaries of school district employees. They also need to cover costs for maintenance, repair, and refurbishment of nonclassroom spaces and school grounds. This does not apply to certain areas like playing fields or tennis courts. The school district requires organizations using school facilities to pay a fair rental value for after-school programs or instructional activities. Funds collected are deposited into a special fund for this purpose. The Superintendent will develop regulations for determining allowable costs by December 31, 2013. The school district is liable for injuries due to negligence in owning and maintaining school facilities. Entities using the facilities are also liable for injuries caused by their negligence. Both the school district and the entity must insure against their respective risks and cover the costs of defending against claims. This liability cannot be waived and does not affect the school district's immunity under the Government Code for injuries from dangerous public property conditions. The governing board of a school district must authorize the use of school facilities by nonprofit organizations or clubs promoting youth activities. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2020, unless a later statute extends the date.
