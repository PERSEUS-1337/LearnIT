    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Research in Secondary Schools Act\". The Congress finds that the quality of education in science, mathematics, and engineering is crucial for the nation's future security and prosperity. American secondary school students score lower in science and mathematics compared to their peers in other developed countries. The number of undergraduate degrees in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering has remained stagnant or declined, despite a projected increase in demand for scientists and engineers. New initiatives are needed to stimulate student interest in science, mathematics, and technology to prepare them for success in college courses. Hands-on research experiences are effective in stimulating student interest in science, mathematics, and technology, building confidence in the scientific method and problem solving, and strengthening understanding of scientific concepts to prepare students for success in college courses. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation, \"institution of higher education\" is defined as in the Higher Education Act of 1965, and \"science teacher\" means a teacher at the secondary school level in science, mathematics, or technology. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director can establish a program to enhance science, math, and technology education in secondary schools through awards to higher education institutions for research projects. Awards are based on merit and guidelines set under subsection (c). Recipients use awards to train science teachers in research design and proposal preparation, and establish submission requirements for research project proposals. The Director can establish guidelines for selecting and funding research projects in secondary schools. This includes providing grants, developing guidelines for science teachers, offering stipends for graduate student advisors, and assessing the educational value of the projects. The Director will establish guidelines, procedures, and criteria for awards under the program, including collaboration between education and STEM faculty, and proposal requirements for research projects. The Director will establish guidelines, procedures, and criteria for awards under the program, including collaboration between education and STEM faculty, and proposal requirements for research projects. Proposals must specify the number of research projects, the number of graduate students to be supported, and identify sources of non-Federal funding equal to the award amount sought. The Director will ensure ongoing coordination and information exchange among awardees under the Act. $2,500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2002-2004 for the National Science Foundation to implement the Act."
