Congress finds that nearly 26 million Americans have diabetes and 79 million have pre-diabetes, with increases since 2008. Diabetes affects 8.3% of all Americans and 11.3% of adults aged 20 and older, with higher rates among racial and ethnic minorities. Diabetes is prevalent among Asian-Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, with significant health and financial implications. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the US, leading to various complications like heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure. The national costs associated with diabetes are substantial, exceeding $174 billion in 2007. Medicare spending on diabetes is high, and current trends suggest a potential increase in diabetes cases among American adults by 2050. There are 35 Federal departments, agencies, and offices involved in Federal diabetes activities. The National Diabetes Clinical Care Commission is established under the Public Health Service Act to oversee diabetes care. The National Diabetes Clinical Care Commission (referred to as the `Commission') is established within the Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate and make recommendations for better coordination of programs related to clinical care for people with pre-diabetes and diabetes. Membership includes heads of Federal agencies and departments involved in diabetes care. The Commission evaluates Federal agencies impacting clinical care for pre-diabetes and diabetes, including CMS, AHRQ, CDC, IHS, VA, NIH, FDA, HRSA, and DoD. The Commission includes voting members appointed by the Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation with medical societies and patient advocate organizations, representing clinical endocrinologists and other physician specialties. The Commission includes voting members representing various physician specialties, primary care physicians, non-physician health care professionals, patient advocates, and national experts. The voting members select a chairperson and the Commission meets 2-4 times a year. The Commission, including the chairperson, serves for a 3-year term and fills vacancies in the same manner as original appointments. Their duties include evaluating programs for diabetes screening benefits, identifying gaps in Federal efforts for diabetes care, and making recommendations for coordination. The Commission is tasked with making recommendations on coordinating clinically based activities supported by the Federal Government, developing federally funded clinical practice support tools for healthcare professionals in managing pre-diabetes and diabetes, evaluating existing programs to ensure they meet identified needs, and recommending the development of an outcomes-based registry for evaluating care models. The Commission is responsible for evaluating care models and methods for diabetes management, expanding education for healthcare professionals on diabetes prevention, recommending outreach methods for educational resources, and including activities related to public health and nutrition as deemed appropriate. The Commission will submit an operating plan for carrying out its activities related to public health and nutrition, including specific activities, completion plans, and involvement of members and other individuals. The Commission will need to involve various stakeholders, explain Federal agency involvement, provide a budget, plan for evaluating recommendations, and submit updates to the Secretary and Congress. Additionally, they will include any other relevant information deemed appropriate. The Commission must submit a final report with findings and recommendations to the Secretary and Congress within 3 years of its first meeting. The Secretary will review the report within 120 days to decide on the Commission's continuation. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 to support the Commission's work."
