    "content": "Federal regulations, stemming from acts of Congress, implement statutes and establish specific requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies, with 330 provisions requiring rule issuance. Around 80% of these provisions assign rulemaking responsibilities to agencies like the SEC, Board of Governors, CFTC, and CFPB. Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to have a significant impact. The Dodd-Frank Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies, with regulations expected to have a major impact on implementation. The legislation is complex, giving regulators significant power to determine its impact, with many ambiguities to be resolved through the adoption of regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies, with regulations expected to have a major impact on implementation. Some provisions are specific, while others give agencies discretion in crafting rules. Agencies may decide to issue rules for certain provisions as they see fit, with broad discretion in determining the content of these rules. The Dodd-Frank Act grants federal agencies broad discretion to create rules, including provisions that require regulatory actions without explicitly mentioning regulations. For example, Section 732 mandates the CFTC to implement conflict-of-interest safeguards for futures commission merchants and introducing brokers. The Dodd-Frank Act grants federal agencies discretion to create rules, including provisions for regulatory actions. Congressional oversight of rulemaking ensures delegated authority is exercised properly. Congress can oversee the regulations issued to implement the Dodd-Frank Act by reviewing the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, published twice a year. The legislation does not specify timelines for some mandatory rules, and not all permitted rules may be developed. Many rules issued by agencies may not be explicitly mentioned in the act. The Unified Agenda, published by the U.S. General Services Administration, helps agencies meet transparency requirements such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866. It aims to involve the public and resolve conflicts early in the regulatory process. The executive order requires agencies to involve the public and officials in regulatory planning. Each agency must prepare a \"regulatory plan\" listing significant regulatory actions expected in the upcoming fiscal year. The Unified Agenda categorizes upcoming regulatory activities into five stages: prerule, proposed rule, final rule, and long-term actions. The Unified Agenda categorizes upcoming regulatory activities into three stages: upcoming actions, long-term actions, and completed actions. Each entry includes data elements such as the issuing agency, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), action description, and projected regulatory action date. Priority of the regulation is also indicated. The Unified Agenda categorizes upcoming regulatory activities into three stages: upcoming actions, long-term actions, and completed actions. It helps Congress and the public know about upcoming regulatory actions, providing federal agencies with a systematic way to alert the public. The December 20, 2010, edition of the Unified Agenda is the first one compiled after the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal agencies submit data to the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) for the Unified Agenda. The report examines the December 20, 2010, edition of the Unified Agenda, identifying upcoming proposed and final rules related to the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal agencies submitted data to RISC for the Unified Agenda by September 10, 2010, with some agencies submitting later. The information in the Unified Agenda was current as of September/October 2010. The search for upcoming rules and actions related to the Dodd-Frank Act included proposed and final rules as well as long-term actions. The report analyzes upcoming proposed and final rules related to the Dodd-Frank Act listed in the December 20, 2010, edition of the Unified Agenda. It includes information on the department and agency issuing the rule, the rule's title and RIN, a brief description of the rulemaking action, and the expected issuance date. The entries are organized based on the expected dates of issuance, with 30 Dodd-Frank Act-related actions in the \"proposed rule stage\" listed in the Unified Agenda. The Unified Agenda listed 30 upcoming proposed rules related to the Dodd-Frank Act, with most expected to be issued by the CFTC. Other agencies such as the SEC, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Housing and Urban Development also had proposed rules in the pipeline. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted on July 21, 2010, with numerous rulemaking provisions applicable to the Commission. The SEC is considering consolidating some rulemakings and adding specific rules under the Act to the Regulatory Flexibility Act agenda. The Unified Agenda indicated that 25 proposed rules related to the Dodd-Frank Act would be issued in December 2010, with 20 already published by January 14, 2011. Most of these published proposed rules are expected to become final rules in the future. The Unified Agenda indicated that 25 proposed rules related to the Dodd-Frank Act would be issued in December 2010, with most expected to become final rules in 2011. Some proposed rules, such as those on alternatives to external credit ratings and position limits on commodities, were delayed but expected to be issued in the future. The upcoming Dodd-Frank proposed rules, including the \"Volcker Rule\" and \"Proposed Rules Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\" were expected to be issued in April and August 2011. None of the 30 upcoming rules were deemed \"economically significant\" or \"major.\" The HUD/Office of Housing rule on \"Housing Counseling: New Program Requirements\" was considered important and included in the regulatory plan. Expected to be published in March 2011, the rule aimed to address new program requirements and certification for HUD approved housing counselors as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. It would enhance choices and protections for borrowers in HUD's single family mortgage insurance programs. 20 out of the 30 upcoming proposed rules were deemed \"other significant\" in the Unified Agenda, indicating they were expected to be reviewed by OIRA. In March 2011, the HUD/Office of Housing rule on \"Housing Counseling: New Program Requirements\" was considered important and included in the regulatory plan to address new program requirements and certification for HUD approved housing counselors as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule aimed to enhance choices and protections for borrowers in HUD's single family mortgage insurance programs. 17 out of the 20 upcoming proposed rules were to be issued by CFTC and were considered \"other significant,\" indicating they would be reviewed by OIRA or were a priority by the agency head. These rules covered various topics such as alternatives to external credit ratings, governance and ownership limits, identity theft red flag rules, and swap execution facilities registration requirements. The Federal Reserve System's \"Regulation Z\u2014Truth in Lending\" proposed rule, under the Dodd-Frank Act, is the only upcoming regulation that would impact small entities. The Unified Agenda listed 12 Dodd-Frank Act-related actions in the \"final rule stage,\" with most entries from the SEC, and two each from the FTC and OSHA. The Unified Agenda listed 12 Dodd-Frank Act-related actions in the \"final rule stage,\" with most entries from the SEC, and two each from the FTC and OSHA. The SEC final rule entry was very general, indicating upcoming interim final rule issuance under the Dodd-Frank Act. The upcoming SEC action in September 2011 will involve an interim final rule related to the Dodd-Frank Act. There are multiple final rule entries scheduled for action in July 2011, with the agency considering how to proceed in light of the Dodd-Frank Act. These entries may result in final rules or the agency may conclude action without issuing them. The final rule entry \"Transitional Registration as a Municipal Advisor\" was issued in September 2010 and is effective through December 2011. It is unclear if this rule will be continued or allowed to expire. The Unified Agenda shows that one FTC final rule on \"Rulemaking Proceeding With Respect to Mortgage Loans\" was issued in December 2010. As of January 14, 2011, 11 upcoming Dodd-Frank Act final rules had not been issued, with three scheduled for the first two months of 2011. The FTC rule on the \"Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003\" was scheduled for January 2011, while an SEC final rule on \"Family Offices\" was set for April 2011. Other Dodd-Frank Act final rules were expected in the later part of 2011, including OSHA final rules in September 2011 regarding retaliation complaints and employee protection provisions. OSHA indicated that upcoming final rules under the Dodd-Frank Act were not included in the regulatory plan and were not considered economically significant. Three rules were labeled as \"other significant,\" including procedures for handling retaliation complaints and complaints under the Employee Protection Provision of the Consumer Financial Protection Act. An FTC rule on the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act was also mentioned. Two upcoming final rules under the Dodd-Frank Act were expected to trigger the requirement for an analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act: An SEC rule on \"Shareholder Approval of Executive Compensation and Golden Parachute Compensation\" and an SEC rule on \"Transitional Registration as a Municipal Advisor.\" Other rules were expected to impact small entities but not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 20 of the 25 proposed rules expected in December 2010 had been published by January 14, 2011, with 17 of them having final rule statutory deadlines in 2011. Several final rules were expected to be issued by CFTC and SEC in 2011, including rules on \"Larger Trader Reporting,\" \"Review of Rules To Find Alternatives to Reliance of Credit Ratings,\" \"Whistleblowers,\" and \"Systemically Important DCO Rules Authorized Under Title VII.\" These rules had proposed deadlines ranging from January to June 2011. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was published in December 2010, with final rules expected in July 2011. The Unified Agenda listed long-term actions related to the Dodd-Frank Act by CFTC and FDIC. CFTC was directed to adopt an interim final rule for reporting swaps entered into before the Act. The CFTC and FDIC published interim final rules related to swaps entered into before the Dodd-Frank Act. The agencies were required to review regulations assessing credit-worthiness and remove references to credit ratings. They sought comments on alternative standards for risk-based capital requirements. Next steps for both agencies were still undetermined. The CFTC and FDIC published interim rules related to swaps pre-Dodd-Frank Act, removing credit rating references. They sought comments on alternative risk-based capital requirements. Next steps for agencies were undetermined. Congress should oversee agency rules to ensure consistency with legislative intent. Unified Agenda provides early information on rules issued under Dodd-Frank Act. Some entries in the Unified Agenda related to Dodd-Frank Act are incomplete. The Unified Agenda entries related to the Dodd-Frank Act do not specify upcoming rules, making them less helpful. The SEC may issue multiple proposed and final rules or none at all. Congress can oversee agency rules through hearings and interactions with regulatory agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act allows for oversight of agency rulemaking activities through various means, including GAO studies and reports. Specific provisions require GAO to examine compliance costs associated with SEC rules and study the feasibility of creating an independent professional. The Dodd-Frank Act allows for oversight of agency rulemaking activities through various means, including GAO studies and reports. GAO is required to study the feasibility of creating an independent professional organization for rating analysts employed by rating organizations and assess the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on credit availability and affordability. Another option is the Congressional Review Act, enacted in 1996 to give Congress authority over rulemaking. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) gives Congress authority over rulemaking by requiring federal agencies to submit final rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect. Congress can use expedited procedures to disapprove these rules through joint resolutions of disapproval, which must be presented to the President for signature or veto. The CRA covers a broad range of documents that agencies wish to make binding on the public. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove agency rules through joint resolutions of disapproval, which require the President's signature or veto. Despite being used only once in 14 years, Congress can also use regular legislative procedures to overturn rules, but it may be more challenging. Additionally, Congress often includes provisions in agencies' appropriations bills to direct or prevent specific regulations. The inclusion of regulatory provisions in appropriations legislation allows Congress to control agency actions through restrictions and requirements. This legislative strategy is influenced by Congress's power of the purse and the necessity of appropriations bills to pass. The frequency of regulatory appropriations restrictions varies over time and may be less common when Congress and the President are of the same party."
