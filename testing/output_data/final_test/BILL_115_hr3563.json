    "content": "The \"Veterans' Pathway to Citizenship Act of 2017\" allows for the naturalization of veterans during periods of hostilities. The \"Veterans' Pathway to Citizenship Act of 2017\" amends Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide remedies for current or former members of the Armed Forces who are eligible for naturalization but have not completed the required residency or physical presence in the United States. Upon application for naturalization, they will be deemed lawful permanent residents. The \"Veterans' Pathway to Citizenship Act of 2017\" amends Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow current or former members of the Armed Forces to apply for naturalization without meeting residency or physical presence requirements. Prior removals are not considered for eligibility, and pardons may be granted to eligible individuals. The \"Veterans' Pathway to Citizenship Act of 2017\" amends Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow current or former members of the Armed Forces to apply for naturalization without considering pardoned offenses, except if the offense caused a dishonorable discharge. Military recruiters must provide information on the program upon enlistment. The officer overseeing enlistment must inform recruits of their naturalization options and available services. Upon discharge, the Secretary of Homeland Security will provide former Armed Forces members with information on their naturalization options. The Secretary of Homeland Security will inform former Armed Forces members of their naturalization options and provide necessary forms and certifications at no cost. When eligible for naturalization, the Secretary will notify the member unless requested otherwise. The Director of United States Customs and Immigration Services shall review any application for naturalization submitted by or on behalf of a current or former member of the Armed Forces as if it were completed and timely filed. Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended by striking subsection (d)(5). The amendment made by subsection (a) will be effective upon enactment of the Act, while the amendment made by subsection (b) will be effective one year after the Act's enactment."
