    "content": "The Forest Service Financial Accountability Restoration Act of 1999 may be cited as the Act. It focuses on using incentives to restore Forest Service financial accountability. The Congress finds that the Forest Service has had issues producing reliable financial statements, leading to adverse opinions from the Inspector General. The Comptroller General identified the Forest Service as high risk for waste and mismanagement due to accounting weaknesses. The Forest Service must receive two consecutive unqualified audit opinions from the Inspector General and correct internal control weaknesses to maintain its high-risk status. Despite initial efforts to address financial management deficiencies, the Comptroller General and Inspector General have highlighted ongoing issues. The Department of Agriculture stated that the Forest Service is still years away from producing reliable financial statements or changing its high-risk status. Performance incentives are needed to restore financial accountability to the Forest Service while ensuring the ability to reduce the natural resources backlog and protect taxpayer investments. Conditional limitations on Forest Service appropriations are also proposed for future fiscal years. The Forest Service appropriations are limited until it no longer poses a high risk of financial mismanagement or until the end of the fifth fiscal year under the Act. The Forest Service will no longer be considered at high risk if the Comptroller General certifies to Congress that financial management is no longer at high risk, based on receiving two consecutive unqualified audit opinions and correcting identified weaknesses in financial statements. During each fiscal year, the Forest Service must maintain or increase outputs from programs that reduce the natural resources backlog in the National Forest System. Outputs include treating forested land for wildfire and insect risks, reconstructing roads and trails, maintaining recreational facilities, and restoring terrestrial habitat. Outputs from programs must be maintained or increased each fiscal year to reduce the natural resources backlog in the National Forest System. This includes treating forested land for wildfire and insect risks, reconstructing roads and trails, maintaining recreational facilities, and restoring terrestrial habitat. Additionally, acres of terrestrial habitat and miles of riparian areas are restored or enhanced, along with other priority outputs identified by the Secretary."
