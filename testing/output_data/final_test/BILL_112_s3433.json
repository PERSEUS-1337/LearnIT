    "content": "The \"Radio Spectrum Inventory Act of 2012\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Communications Act of 1934 by adding a section on Spectrum Inventory. The Radio Spectrum Inventory Act of 2012 requires the Commission to prepare a biennial report that includes an inventory of each radio spectrum band managed by agencies, detailing licensees, spectrum allocation, and equipment numbers. The Radio Spectrum Inventory Act of 2012 mandates the FCC to compile a biennial report listing licensees, spectrum allocation, and equipment numbers for each radio spectrum band managed by agencies. The report should include details on user terminals, transmitters, end-user terminals, and receivers authorized or deployed in the band. The FCC is required to compile a biennial report under the Radio Spectrum Inventory Act of 2012. The report should include details on coverage area, receiver performance, geo-location of base stations, extent of frequency band use, and supported activities by transmitters and receivers. The FCC is mandated to compile a biennial report detailing coverage area, receiver performance, base station geo-location, frequency band use, and supported activities by transmitters, end-user terminals, or receivers. A centralized portal must be created to provide public access to inventory data from the FCC and NTIA, updated quarterly to reflect any changes in licenses or authorizations. National security and classified information are also addressed. The FCC is required to compile a biennial report on various aspects of communication technology. If disclosure of certain information is deemed harmful to national security, the agency must notify the NTIA and provide a summary description of the information along with an annex containing the classified details. The FCC must compile a biennial report on communication technology. If classified information is involved, the agency notifies the NTIA, provides unclassified information, a summary of classified details, and an annex with the classified information. The NTIA must provide an annex with classified information to the Commission, but neither the NTIA nor the Commission can disclose it to the public or unauthorized individuals. Licensees of non-Federal spectrum can petition the Commission to withhold information from the biennial report if its disclosure would harm public safety or if prohibited by law. Licensees can request an exemption from being included on the centralized portal or in reports by providing clear evidence. If granted, they must still provide necessary information to the Commission. Licensees can request an exemption from public disclosure of certain information deemed detrimental to public safety or prohibited by law. Reports required by NTIA and the Commission must be submitted to Congressional committees in unclassified form, with the option to include annexes that are not for public disclosure. Licensees can request an exemption from public disclosure of certain information. Reports required by NTIA and the Commission must be submitted to Congressional committees in unclassified form, with the option to include classified annexes for specific oversight committees. The term 'appropriate Congressional committees' refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The Committee on Energy and Commerce, along with other relevant congressional committees, and the NTIA must provide an update on the inventory and report required by the Communications Act of 1934 to specific Senate and House committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
