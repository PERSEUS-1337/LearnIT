    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Direct Care Workforce Empowerment Act\". Congress recognizes the crucial role of direct care workers in the nation's long-term care system, highlighting the shortage of qualified workers to meet the growing demand for care services. Over two-thirds of older adults will require long-term care at some point, emphasizing the need for a strong and stable workforce in this sector. Direct care work is demanding with difficult working conditions, high turnover due to low pay, lack of benefits, strenuous conditions, limited advancement opportunities, inadequate training, and lack of respect. Nearly 1 in 3 direct care workers live near or below the poverty level, with over 1 in 4 lacking health insurance. The average annual income for direct care workers is $17,000, and 40 percent receive public benefits. States lack management information systems to gather and report basic workforce information. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. LIMITATION TO EXEMPTION UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT.\" is a section related to limitations on exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include provisions for home care workers providing babysitting or companionship services on a casual basis in domestic service employment. The term \"casual basis\" is defined as irregular or intermittent employment not performed by individuals whose vocation is providing these services. A home care worker providing babysitting or companionship services is defined as an individual employed by an employer or agency other than the family or household. Employment is not considered casual if it exceeds 20 hours per week for all employers. SEC. 4. DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING.
