    "content": "Most people in the United States use loans for education, mortgages for homes, and invest in stocks and bonds for retirement. Financial regulatory policies are important for Congress to ensure economic growth. This report discusses the regulation of U.S. financial markets. The framework for regulating U.S. financial markets involves identifying regulatory overlaps and gaps, where different agencies oversee firms and activities. Understanding the problem to be regulated is key. This report analyzes financial regulatory policy, not legal jurisdiction. The report analyzes financial regulatory policy by matching financial regulatory agencies to policies addressing market failures. It distinguishes between regulators focusing on prudence and disclosure in the United States. Four federal agencies have prudential authority over banks, thrifts, and credit unions. Four federal agencies have prudential authority over banks, thrifts, and credit unions, while two agencies oversee markets for financial contracts. Other agencies regulate housing government-sponsored enterprises and consumer financial products. Entities in the coordinating forum category facilitate communication among member agencies. Two agencies regulate activities regardless of the institution type or provide prudential regulation to nonbanks. The policy problems and regulatory approaches of these agencies vary considerably. The prudential bank regulators and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) monitor and limit risks for firms with specific charters. Securities and derivatives regulators oversee exchanges, disclosures, and enforce rules against deceptive trading practices. Securities regulators do not typically monitor firms' asset and liability composition like prudential bank regulators. These differences stem from the agencies' missions and the risks they address in the financial industry. JPMorgan's losses in derivatives markets in 2012 highlighted the complex regulatory oversight in the financial industry, with multiple agencies regulating different aspects of the firm's trades. The firm's risk management unit, CIO, incurred significant losses on trades related to complex derivatives, known as the London Whale trades. When the losses were made public, it was revealed that there were many regulators overseeing JPMorgan's trades, depending on the specific aspect of the event. Regulatory policy areas related to JPMorgan's derivatives trades are illustrated in Figure 1. The policy areas of agencies overseeing JPMorgan's derivatives trades are outlined in Figure 1. JPMorgan's risk management is regulated by the OCC at the depository level and by the Federal Reserve at the holding company level. The SEC regulates disclosures to stockholders, the CFTC oversees transactions in derivatives markets, and the FDIC ensures safety and soundness. A comparison of banking regulators and securities market regulators is presented in Table 2, listing various categories of regulations. In Allen's and Herring's view, banking regulatory policies focus on systemic risk, while securities regulatory policies aim at investor protection and efficiency enhancement. The United States has implemented various policy options for banks and securities markets, with different approaches taken at different times. These categories of policy options are discussed in more detail in later sections of the report. The report discusses policy problems in financial intermediation, modes of financial regulation, regulators for banks and financial trading markets, and other financial regulators and markets. It compares banking and securities markets' policy problems and regulatory approaches. The appendices cover organizational differences among financial firms, the rating system used by regulators to evaluate banks, regulatory structure pre-Dodd-Frank Act, common acronyms, and a glossary of financial terms. The financial system's function is to coordinate resources between savers and borrowers through direct lending by firms like banks or trading financial obligations in markets. Financial obligations include debts and equities. The financial system distinguishes between various types of financial instruments such as debts, equities, hybrids, insurance, swaps, and forwards. In the United States, the regulation focuses on differentiating banks, securities markets, and insurance. Commercial banks handle customer deposits and offer loans, while investment banks underwrite securities and market them to investors. Investment banks provide brokerage services, corporate financing advice, proprietary trading, and assistance with merger and acquisition proposals. Commercial banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers by accepting deposits to make loans. Specialized lenders offer advantages such as identifying credit-worthy borrowers and enforcing loan terms on behalf of savers. The business model of banks involves writing and administering loan contracts, enforcing loan terms, and earning profits through timing strategies like maturity transformation. Bank managers may not always act in the best interests of investors or depositors, and the maturity mismatch can make banks vulnerable to interest rate volatility and runs. Identifying credit-worthy borrowers can also pose challenges for bankers. Banking regulations address policy problems such as conflicts of interest, lending discrimination, and excessive risk-taking. Systemic issues can also arise from individual bank activities, leading to credit shortages and profit-seeking behavior. The systemic banking problem arises when individual banks take excessive risks by offering more loans in high-risk categories and depending on borrowing from other banks in case of losses or withdrawals. This strategy cannot be followed by all banks simultaneously, leading to a fallacy of composition. Excessive risk-taking by banks can lead to systemic consequences, such as a spike in interest rates or the inability to obtain interbank loans during a crisis. This can result in all banks being unable to find a lender in the event of depositor withdrawals. During boom periods, banks may offer excessive credit without considering the risk of losing access to credit if market conditions change, leading to a price bubble. In contrast, during busts, more banks may fail due to inadequate risk reserves, causing a decrease in available credit for the wider economy. Bank regulators can address systemic concerns in banking by restricting bank balance sheets through safety and soundness regulations and capital requirements. Other policy responses include offering bank depositors insurance, providing a lender of last resort for banks in emergencies, and recognizing the impact of the banking system on credit booms and busts. Securities markets differ from commercial banks in their role as venues for trading securities. Securities markets serve as venues for trading financial contracts like debts, equities, and futures, facilitating transactions between various financial institutions. Investment banks help market these instruments. Commercial banks can also participate in securities markets as buyers or sellers, including in government debt trading. Private firms have issued tradable debt securities for centuries, leading to enduring economic inefficiencies in securities markets due to limited information availability and conflicts of interest. The \"lemons problem\" highlights the risk of buyers discounting securities due to potential withholding of negative information by sellers. Securities buyers may be vulnerable to dealers and brokers with incentives to deceive. Potential economic inefficiencies in securities markets can arise from undisclosed flaws in securities, leading to buyers being deceived by dealers and brokers. Additionally, specific types of contracts, like forward or futures contracts for physical commodities, can create inefficiencies if not traded under formal rules. Attempts to corner commodity markets using forward contracts can introduce price distortions and contribute to financial instability. Formal trading organizations and platforms can also lead to economic inefficiencies if not properly managed, potentially causing financial instability if rules exacerbate existing problems. Policy responses to concerns related to trading financial contracts include requiring securities and traders to be registered, providing investors with adequate disclosures, and regulating the organization and membership of formal exchanges. Providers of securities-related services may also be regulated for professional qualifications and conflicts of interest. Issuers of new securities may be mandated to adhere to certain requirements. Securities markets may create systemic concerns if risks are not adequately addressed, leading to an influx of savings into a particular asset class and eventual market collapse. Leveraged and collateralized funding can contribute to a boom-bust cycle in securities markets. Leveraged funding in securities markets can lead to a boom-bust cycle, causing \"fire sales\" when security prices decline. Algorithmic trading and program trading can also contribute to systemic events. Policies like halting trading or limiting debt for securities purchases can address these concerns. Shadow banking refers to funding loans through securities markets or funding banks through securities markets instead of deposits. It can also refer to financial activities that are not eligible for government support like deposit insurance or emergency loans. The term emphasizes the need for firms to retain some risk in securities issuance. The shadow banking system offers alternatives to traditional banking by allowing lenders to borrow money through securities markets like repurchase agreements (repos) instead of relying on insured deposits. This system includes regulated activities where banks can borrow from other financial institutions through repos, providing a form of interest payment similar to a collateralized loan. Non-banks can use repurchase agreements to raise funds for investments, including loans, without being subject to prudential regulation or having access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. This is one alternative to traditional deposits for funding loans, with other options like asset-backed commercial paper also available. The bank's participation in providing liquidity for the market is subject to prudential regulation. Shadow banking, which includes firms other than banks sponsoring Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP), can lead to market funding by entities without access to the Fed's discount window or insured deposits. Despite being subject to securities regulation, shadow banking activities can still pose similar policy issues as traditional banking and securities markets. Flaws in securities issuance and pricing in shadow banking can contribute to asset bubbles and busts, especially when funded through securities markets like mortgages or sovereign debt. Nonbanks like money market mutual funds and hedge funds can face runs if they invest a fraction of gathered funds and promise easy withdrawal for investors. Nonbanks in shadow banking can face runs if investors withdraw funds simultaneously. Financial regulators have varying reach to address policy issues in shadow banking, with regulatory missions differing among agencies. Some agencies have authority over specific firms, while others oversee markets or activities, leading to regulatory overlap. In some cases, a corner of the financial system may lack a regulator for specific firms or activities. The regulatory system in the United States has a regulatory gap where specific firms or activities lack a regulator. Different categories of regulation are summarized, including the roles of financial regulators and their policy spheres. Regulatory architecture can involve a single agency overseeing all industry firms or specialized regulators focusing on specific policy problems. The U.S. historically has provided one or more regulators for each category of financial regulation. The United States historically has multiple regulators for different financial categories. Calls for regulatory consolidation have been made, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act created new agencies and merged existing ones, showing the trade-offs involved in choosing a regulatory architecture. A regulatory architecture involves trade-offs, with the need to compete and attract clients potentially impacting effectiveness. Countries with single regulators may not fare better during crises. Different approaches were seen in the US and UK after the 2008 financial crisis. The US created a single council, while the UK broke up its Financial Services Authority. Various ways to regulate financial firms and services exist. Different ways to regulate financial firms and services include regulating certain types of financial institutions. Federal agencies oversee specific classes of institutions, such as depository institutions and government-sponsored enterprises, with primary oversight authority based on the institution's charter. Regulator shopping and unchartered firms engaging in similar businesses are perceived disadvantages of institution-specific regulation. Entities can choose their regulator, and unchartered firms in the same business may avoid regulation. Markets like the NYSE and CME are regulated by the SEC and CFTC, focusing on organization, trading rules, and fraud prevention. Market-based regulation has drawbacks due to market evolution. Regulation keyed to markets has drawbacks due to jurisdictional ambiguities among regulators and regulatory gaps from financial product innovation. Regulating specific financial activities can also be problematic, as there are multiple methods to achieve similar objectives, allowing for potential circumvention of regulations. Regulation aims to address systemic risk in the financial system by overseeing institutions, markets, and activities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to coordinate efforts among regulators to detect risks arising from interactions between firms and markets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) coordinates among financial regulatory agencies and has a permanent staff to monitor sector risks. Appendix D contains a pre-Dodd-Frank version of the federal financial regulatory architecture for banks and securities markets. Banking regulators focus on the health of chartered banks by limiting their activities and affiliations. Bank regulators employ examiners to monitor and evaluate the financial health of banks. Deposit insurance and a system to coordinate bank reserves and provide emergency lending are available to participating banks. Prudential regulation depends on a bank's charter, with activity-based regulation applying to chartered banks. Four prudential regulators coordinate examination policies through the FFIEC to prevent inconsistencies in regulatory oversight. The OCC, FDIC, NCUA, and Federal Reserve are federal regulators overseeing different types of banks and thrifts. State governments also have agencies regulating state banking laws. The CSBS serves as a forum for state banking agencies but is not a regulator. Regulatory oversight aims to prevent inconsistencies in oversight. Prudential regulations focus on managing risks in banking activities, such as interest rate risk. Banks must diversify their activities or use hedging strategies to control risks. Monitoring and controlling risks is a key aspect of prudential regulation, even for banks that have not violated any laws. Banks that have not violated any laws may need to adjust their practices in response to regulatory evaluations of current risks. Primary prudential regulators oversee safety and soundness, capital requirements, asset management, consumer compliance, and community reinvestment. Coordination with other regulators may be necessary for certain regulations, such as capital requirements and safety and soundness. Adequate asset management procedures are crucial for maintaining safety and soundness. Appendix C discusses the official ratings system for covered firms, focusing on safety and soundness in financial institutions. This includes risk management, capital requirements, portfolio diversification, liquidity provisions, and more. The section does not cover all safety and soundness regulations listed in Table 2. Safety and soundness regulation is conducted proactively, allowing banks to be examined before any excessive risks are identified. Safety and soundness regulation in banks is conducted prospectively, allowing for examination before any excess risk is evident. Regulations impact economic policy by influencing the credit cycle and conflicts of interest. Diversification of loan exposure can mitigate the impact of rapid price declines on bank failures. Transparent control systems help owners and counterparties monitor bank managers effectively. Various risk characteristics, such as credit risk and interest rate risk, are considered in loan issuance. Federal financial regulators consider default rates, prepayment rates, and interest-rate exposure when examining loans issued by lenders. Risks in a bank's portfolio are not just the sum of individual loan risks; lenders can adjust their balance sheets to manage risks. For example, lenders with loans exposed to prepayment risk during falling interest rates can make changes to reduce this risk. A lender facing prepayment risk from falling interest rates can mitigate this by acquiring compensating assets like interest-rate derivative contracts. Federal financial regulators consider compensating assets, risk-based capital requirements, and prudential standards when evaluating lenders' balance sheets. They have tools to reduce risks, such as requiring banks to adjust lending practices, dispose of assets, and restore sound balance sheets. In enforcement, regulators have options like withdrawing deposit insurance or taking over a failing bank. Capital regulation is important as it affects the credit cycle and firms with more equity capital tend to have lower leverage ratios. Higher bank capital requirements can make the banking system more resilient during downturns by reducing the likelihood of bank failures due to unexpected loan losses. However, it may not necessarily make the entire financial system safer if the cost of capital leads to a shift of financial activity to securities markets or shadow banking. Additionally, higher capital requirements can impact the amount of bank credit available by reducing leverage that banks can achieve. Bank capital requirements aim to lower bank leverage, reducing potential lending to the economy. Regulators mandate minimum capital levels to enhance firm resilience and protect stakeholders. Capital requirements vary based on a bank's risk profile, impacting lending capacity. Bank capital requirements aim to lower bank leverage, reducing potential lending to the economy. Individual banks adjust their capital ratio to maximize profits, while regulators modify standards to prevent excessive risk-taking or promote credit availability. Banks may hold excess capital in anticipation of economic downturns. Regulators may encourage banks to hold additional capital for system resilience. JPMorgan executives referred to their portfolio as a \"fortress balance sheet\" in preparation for economic challenges. Banking regulators increased capital requirements after the 2008 financial crisis without new legislation. They cooperate with regulators in other countries based on the Basel Accords. Each country sets its own capital standards as they are not enforceable internationally. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision enhances cooperation among countries on banking supervisory matters to improve global banking regulation. It develops international standards on capital adequacy and effective banking supervision. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision develops international standards on capital adequacy and effective banking supervision. Capital requirements should be risk-based, with riskier assets requiring more capital to be held against possible losses. Risk-based regulations can be more prudent than simple leverage ratios, as different types of assets can have varying probabilities of failure. However, a drawback of a risk-based approach is that it may become procyclical, reinforcing the tendency for the banking system to expand credit during economic booms and contract credit during economic busts. Risk-based capital requirements may lead to procyclicality, making it challenging for regulators to mitigate asset bubbles and promote credit expansion during economic downturns. This could happen if economic forecasters and analysts are overly confident or pessimistic, affecting the evaluation of long-term asset risk. If regulators and market participants use similar financial models, optimal capital requirements may not be achieved. Regulators may not effectively check pro-cyclicality in risk-based systems due to similarities in risk measures with banks. Additional stress tests for the system as a whole could be required. Asset management involves providing financial services for a fee, such as wealth management. Regulation of asset management activities is important for economic policy issues. The custodian role of banks in complex financial transactions can impact interbank lending markets during financial turmoil. Disruptions in asset management services can heighten uncertainty and slow processing, affecting banks' desire for safety and speed. Bank regulators issue guidance to firms in the asset management industry, not just banks. The banking agencies issue guidance to firms in the asset management industry and conduct examinations to ensure compliance with sound principles. Lenders must adhere to various statutes and regulations when offering financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to oversee consumer financial protection, but bank regulators still supervise many consumer activities to maintain safety and soundness. Banking agencies oversee banks for consumer law compliance and help resolve complaints. An ombudsman can assist in resolving consumer concerns, separate from safety examiners. This helps ensure fair resolution and may reduce the need for formal complaints. Rulemaking for consumer compliance is shared between the CFPB and bank regulators, such as in appraisals for residential properties and mortgages. The CFPB and bank regulators are involved in rulemaking for residential real estate appraisals. Depository banks are owned within a larger holding company structure, with different primary prudential regulators. There is a dual banking system where each institution is regulated by its chartering authority. Federal deposit insurance ensures that all depository institutions are subject to at least one federal primary regulator. The federal banking agencies have certain powers beyond being the primary prudential regulator. The Office of the Comptroller (OCC) was established in 1863 to supervise federally chartered banks and ensure a single national currency. It is the primary regulator for these banks, with examination and enforcement powers to maintain their safety and soundness. The OCC also monitors systemic risk among nationally chartered banks and thrifts. The OCC oversees systemic risk among nationally chartered banks and thrifts through regular surveys of credit underwriting practices and reports on derivatives activities. The FDIC, established in 1933, provides assurance to small depositors and is the primary federal prudential regulator of state-chartered banks. It also administers a deposit insurance fund. The FDIC, in addition to regulating banks, administers a deposit insurance fund and resolves failing depositories. Deposit insurance stabilizes bank funding during financial turmoil by assuring depositors their funds are guaranteed by the federal government. Insured banks have experienced almost no depositor runs since the establishment of deposit insurance. The FDIC assesses premiums for deposit coverage. The FDIC provides deposit insurance to federally insured banks and thrifts. In 2008, the deposit insurance ceiling was increased to $250,000 for most accounts, which became permanent with the Dodd-Frank Act. Legislative reform in the mid-2000s raised the coverage limit for retirement accounts to $250,000 and indexed it to inflation. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system to determine payments and sets the designated reserve ratio to support the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has the authority to examine institutions, issue regulations, and guarantee certain types of bank debt during crises. The 2008 financial crisis led to emergency measures to protect depositors and prevent bank runs. During the 2008 financial crisis, lessons were learned about bank runs and deposit insurance. Dodd-Frank expanded FDIC premiums to cover a bank's entire balance sheet. In extreme cases, failing financial institutions may receive additional guarantees to protect the financial stability of the US. The FDIC manages the DIF, funded by assessments on depository institutions, to resolve failed banks. The FDIC has broad jurisdiction over banks and thrifts with insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the FDIC's role in liquidating troubled financial institutions. The Financial Stability Oversight Council designates systemically important firms, requiring them to have \"living wills\" for orderly liquidation. The Federal Reserve can close firms deemed a \"severe threat\" to financial stability. The FDIC administers the resolution process for both banks and nonbanks. The Federal Reserve System was established in 1913 to regulate reserves for banks and trusts. The Federal Reserve System, established in 1913, regulates reserves for banks and trusts. It consists of the Federal Reserve Board, regional Federal Reserve Banks, and the Open Market Committee. The Fed is the primary prudential regulator for various lending institutions, including bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fed also serves as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act made the Fed the primary regulator of all financial firms designated as systemically important. The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, regulates reserves for banks and trusts. It is the primary regulator for systemically significant financial firms designated by the FSOC. Capital requirements may be stricter for these firms. The Fed also regulates financial-market utilities, savings and loan holding companies, and securities holding companies. In addition to its regulatory role, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy, monitors the financial system, acts as the fiscal agent of the United States, and regulates the payment system and various financial activities. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulates federal and state credit unions, administers a Central Liquidity Facility and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Credit unions are member-owned cooperatives exempt from corporate income tax, often offering services similar to community banks. Regulators address economic policy problems in financial trading, focusing on conflicts of interest and full disclosure of material information to ensure market fairness and transparency. Securities market regulation, unlike bank regulation, focuses on resolving conflicts of interest and ensuring full disclosure of material information. The SEC, established in 1934, enforces federal securities laws to maintain fair and orderly markets and protect investors from fraud. The SEC's jurisdiction includes corporations selling securities to the public and securities broker/dealers. Firms selling securities to the public must register with the SEC, disclosing detailed information about the firm, management, fund usage, and risks to investors. Registration requires filing periodic financial statements. The SEC enforces securities laws to ensure fair markets and protect investors from fraud, focusing on disclosure and conflict resolution. The SEC enforces securities laws to ensure fair markets and protect investors from fraud by requiring firms selling securities to register and disclose detailed information. The SEC has statutory authority over financial accounting standards, requiring publicly traded firms to use GAAP formulated by FASB, AICPA, and the SEC. Securities market participants, including stock exchanges, are also required to register with the SEC or industry self-regulatory organizations overseen by the SEC. The SEC oversees self-regulatory organizations such as stock exchanges, securities brokerages, mutual funds, auditors, and investment advisers to protect investors' interests and prevent fraud. Broker/dealer regulation is similar to banking regulation, with provisions to protect customers from losses. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) guarantees customer accounts up to $500,000 for losses from brokerage failure or fraud. Unlike the FDIC, SIPC does not examine broker/dealers. The SEC enforces a net capital rule for broker/dealers to maintain excess capital to stop trading before insolvency. The rule is similar to risk-based capital requirements but with its own risk weightings. The SEC lacks authority to intervene if a firm takes excessive risks, leading to potential capital drops. The SEC's net capital rule is a liquidation rule to minimize impact on customers, not prevent failures. Unlike banking regulators, the SEC lacks preemptive seizure powers. The collapse of Bear Stearns in 2008 highlighted differences in bank and securities regulation. The SEC believed Bear Stearns had enough capital before its collapse, but the Federal Reserve facilitated its sale. The Federal Reserve brokered the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase by purchasing $30 billion of toxic assets. The SEC lacked safety powers, and the Fed had to commit funds to an investment bank without regulatory jurisdiction. The Bear Stearns collapse exposed the SEC's inability to respond to systemic risks. The SEC had implemented a voluntary supervisory scheme for large investment banks in 2004. The SEC implemented the Consolidated Supervised Entities (CSE) program for large investment banks in 2004. The CSE firms agreed to follow Basel risk-based standards and allow the SEC to monitor their compliance. However, the program failed to prevent excessive risk-taking, leading to the collapse or merger of all five CSE investment banks by September 2008. The SEC's CSE program for large investment banks failed to prevent excessive risk-taking, leading to the collapse or merger of all five CSE investment banks by September 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the investment bank holding company framework and allowed securities holding companies to be subject to consolidated supervision and Federal Reserve regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the SEC's responsibilities, including setting capital requirements for security-based swap participants and dealers, and prohibiting risky compensation structures. The CFTC, established in 1974, regulates commodities futures and options markets to prevent speculation, price manipulation, and fraud. The CFTC, like the SEC, oversees industry self-regulatory organizations and requires registration of various industry firms and personnel. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the CFTC's jurisdiction by eliminating exemptions for certain over-the-counter derivatives, requiring entities like swap dealers and clearing organizations to register with the CFTC. The CFTC does not directly regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, except for newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants for whom it sets capital standards. The FHFA, established in 2008 by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, regulates housing finance-related government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It succeeded the OFHEO and FHFB, combining safety and soundness authority with housing mission goals. The creation of FHFA was driven by concerns about risk, including systemic risk, posed by the rapid growth of these GSEs. The FHFA, established in 2008, regulates government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with enhanced safety and soundness powers. It placed both firms in conservatorship, provided capital through preferred stock purchases, and received warrants equivalent to a 79.9% equity stake in return. Title X of Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve to regulate consumer financial products and services. CFPB enforces federal consumer protection laws over institutions offering deposit taking, mortgages, credit cards, loan servicing, debt collection, and other financial services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) enforces consumer protection laws over institutions offering financial products and services. Regulatory authority varies based on institution size and type, with exemptions for certain entities like merchants, automobile dealers, and insurance companies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act to coordinate and share data among regulators overseeing institutions with $10 billion or less in assets. The council, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, includes heads of various regulatory agencies as voting members and advisory members from state regulatory bodies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes heads of regulatory agencies as members. It identifies financial risks, responds to systemic risks, and proposes regulatory changes to promote stability and efficiency in the financial system. The FSOC collects information on financial firms, monitors the system for potential risks, and makes regulatory recommendations to address gaps in regulation. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) reviews accounting standards, identifies regulatory gaps, and resolves disputes among members. It provides recommendations to address risks but cannot impose changes. The council reports annually to Congress and does not have direct supervisory authority over financial institutions. The FSOC designates systemically important firms under a strict supervisory regime. The FFIEC coordinates federal regulation for lending institutions and harmonizes auditing principles. It consists of the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, NCUA, and CFPB. The CFPB and other regulatory agencies oversee depository institutions and enforce safety regulations. Federal financial examiners assess risks in covered institutions based on indicators like capital adequacy and liquidity. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets was established in 1988 to address financial stability. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) includes key officials like the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairmen of the Federal Reserve, SEC, and CFTC. It was created in response to the 1987 stock market crash to review studies on market mechanisms. The PWG coordinates interagency efforts, studies entities like hedge funds and OTC derivatives, and addresses intermarket regulatory issues. The PWG issues policy statements on financial crises and systemic risk, including recommendations for money market mutual funds. The FHFA sets capital standards for GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac based on their operations. GSEs face limitations if they fail to meet capital standards, with no asset growth allowed for undercapitalized GSEs without FHFA approval. The FHFA sets capital standards for GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. An undercapitalized entity faces heightened scrutiny and supervision. FHFA can take actions such as electing new directors or appointing a receiver for significantly undercapitalized entities. Bonuses or pay raises for executives of significantly undercapitalized entities require prior approval. Receivership or conservatorship provisions apply when a GSE becomes critically undercapitalized. In July 2008, Congress empowered Treasury to provide financial assistance to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA appointed itself conservator for both GSEs in September 2008 due to their large losses threatening solvency. FHFA may downgrade the capital classification of a regulated entity if it could rapidly deplete core capital or if it is determined to be in an unsafe condition. The SEC's net capital rule imposes an \"Aggregate Indebtedness Standard\" on broker/dealers, limiting their aggregate indebtedness to 1500% of net capital. Liquid capital is calculated by applying haircuts to assets to cover potential declines in value. This concept is similar to risk weights in the Basel Accords. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to set capital standards for major security-based swap dealers and participants, with enforcement delegated to the NFA. FCMs are subject to adjusted net capital requirements, with assets receiving varying haircuts based on risk levels. Member FCMs regulated by the CFTC must maintain Adjusted Net Capital as per CFTC Regulation 1.17, with specific requirements based on capital levels, remote locations, associated persons, SEC regulations for securities brokers, and margin requirements for futures and options contracts. The Dodd-Frank Act sets capital standards for major derivatives participants, including security-based swap dealers and participants. Foreign exchange market plays a crucial role in global trade, with exchange rates impacting macroeconomic policies. Central banks influence the market by pegging currencies, making it one of the largest markets globally. The foreign exchange market is one of the largest globally, with daily turnover exceeding $4 trillion. Federal Reserve policies impact the value of the dollar, but no single agency regulates foreign exchange trading. Trading involves global banks, central banks, hedge funds, commercial firms, and retail brokers in an over-the-counter market. Similarly, U.S. Treasuries resale market lacks a central exchange but utilizes computer-based transaction systems. Treasury securities were exempted from SEC regulation in the 1930s. The government securities market, exempted from SEC regulation in the 1930s, saw further regulation with the Government Securities Act Amendments in 1993. The market remains less regulated than corporate securities markets, with the primary market for Treasury securities monitored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Primary dealers play a key role in the distribution of new Treasuries. Primary dealers, a group of 19 commercial and investment banks, purchase new Treasuries at auction for themselves and their customers. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) maintains the primary dealer list and conducts auctions for the Treasury. In 2008, the Federal Reserve established a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide short-term loans to primary dealers against various collateral. The FRBNY collects data on primary dealers' transactions in government securities. The private placement market allows for the sale of securities to accredited investors without extensive disclosures. Venture capitalists and private equity firms have become significant players in corporate finance in recent decades. Private equity firms and venture capitalists play important roles in corporate finance by purchasing interests in private firms or publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions to strengthen capital requirements for banks and non-bank financial firms to mitigate systemic risks. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens capital requirements for depository institutions, holding companies, and systemically significant firms. Bank holding companies can no longer include trust-preferred securities in Tier I capital. The Act also mandates a study on implementing contingent capital requirements for systemically significant firms, allowing debt to be converted into equity under certain circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens capital requirements for systemically significant firms by imposing leverage limits and countercyclical capital requirements. It also mandates a study on implementing contingent capital requirements. The structure of banks can be complex, with regulators depending on the activity of subsidiaries or charters. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens capital requirements for systemically significant firms by imposing leverage limits and countercyclical capital requirements. The structure of banks can be complex, with regulators depending on the activity of subsidiaries or charters. The following flow charts provide simplified representations of various bank structures, with different regulators for umbrella banks and subsidiaries. Federal bank regulators conduct confidential assessments of covered banks using the UFIRS and CAMELS rating system, which evaluates the safety and soundness of banks based on capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. The CAMELS system is used to evaluate the safety and soundness of banks, assessing capital adequacy and asset quality. Market factors can impact multiple categories in the ratings, with capital adequacy reflecting the level of capital in relation to risks taken. Asset quality evaluates credit risk in a bank's portfolio, considering potential risks even if not on the balance sheet. Increases in problem assets may require more capital to be held. The CAMELS system evaluates a bank's risk by assessing asset quality, management capability, and earnings quantity and quality. Management oversight, legal compliance, and earnings sustainability are key factors in determining a bank's rating. The CAMELS system evaluates a bank's risk by assessing asset quality, management capability, and earnings quantity and quality. Controls for expenses and difficulties in forecasting can reduce earnings rating. Liquidity assesses the ability to meet funding needs timely. Market risk includes potential changes in asset prices. Market risk is closely related to the other CAMELS factors and evaluates a bank's ability to manage risks from trading activities in financial markets and interest rate risk from nontrading positions. The glossary includes definitions such as affiliate - a corporate relationship of control. A bank holding company is a business that controls one or more banks and other financial service affiliates. Asset-backed securities represent a share in debt obligations or assets, with repayment flows going to the holder. The agency relationship involves one party representing another in transactions with third parties. A bank holding company, regulated by the Federal Reserve, can have affiliates in financial services. The Bank Holding Company Act governs these businesses, while the Basel Accords provide international banking regulations. Blue sky laws regulate securities offerings, and broker/dealers buy and sell securities.
