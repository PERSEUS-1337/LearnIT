    "content": "The Act titled \"Farmland Preservation and Land Conservation Act of 2008\" includes a transfer tax exclusion for certain farmland and land of conservation value under the Estate Tax. This Act adds a new section 2059 to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to farm and conservation land. For estate tax purposes, the value of the taxable estate can be reduced by the adjusted value of qualified farm or conservation land included in the estate. This applies to estates of U.S. citizens or residents if the executor elects this option and meets certain requirements. Qualified farm or conservation land refers to U.S. real property. The adjusted value of qualified farm or conservation land for estate tax purposes is determined based on specific criteria, including the location in the United States, use for farming or conservation purposes, recorded covenant preventing inconsistent use, and designation in the agreement. The election under this section must be made on the estate tax return and is irrevocable once made. A written agreement signed by all interested parties is required for the application of subsection (e) to designated property, with the option to modify the election and agreement. The procedures for modifying elections and agreements under section 2032A(d)(3) apply to the tax treatment of dispositions and inconsistent uses of qualified farm or conservation land in a decedent's estate. Additional estate tax may be imposed if the heir disposes of the land without the required covenant or violates its terms. If an heir disposes of qualified farm or conservation land without the required covenant or violates its terms, an additional estate tax is imposed. The amount of the tax is the adjusted tax difference with interest at the underpayment rate from the due date of the estate tax return. The adjusted tax difference for the estate is the excess of the estate tax liability if the fair market value of the interest at the time of disposition is higher than the estate tax liability. Additional rules similar to those in section 2032A(c) apply for this subsection. For estate tax purposes, the fair market value of an interest at disposition triggers an additional tax. The interest is treated as sold at its fair market value, and gain is recognized. The basis of qualified farm or conservation land in the estate is its adjusted basis at the decedent's death. Additional rules apply for this subsection. For estate tax purposes, additional rules apply to the fair market value of an interest at disposition triggering an additional tax. Rules similar to those for certain real property, definitions of farm and farming purposes, property acquired from decedent, community property, bond in lieu of personal liability, special rules for woodlands, statute of limitation, involuntary conversions of real property, and exchanges of qualified real property shall apply. Cross-reference to section 6324C for a special lien on farm and conservation land. For estate tax purposes, special lien on farm and conservation land is referenced in section 6324C. Part II of subchapter C of chapter 64 of the tax code is amended to include this new section. \"Special lien on farm and conservation land is established under SEC. 6324C.\" \"A lien in favor of the United States is imposed on qualified farm or conservation land when an election is filed under section 2059. The lien continues until the land is transferred to a qualified organization, the tax liability is satisfied, or becomes unenforceable.\" The lien imposed on qualified farm or conservation land under section 2059 may become unenforceable by lapse of time or if no further tax liability may arise. Rules from section 6324A(d) apply, and qualified farm or conservation land includes certain types of property. Substitution of security for the lien is allowed. The furnishing of security may be substituted for the lien imposed on qualified farm or conservation land under section 2059. Conforming and clerical amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a special lien on farm and conservation land under section 6324C. Additionally, a new section 2524 is added for gift tax purposes related to farm and conservation land. In computing taxable gifts, a deduction is allowed for gifts of qualified farm or conservation land if the donee elects and files the agreement. Qualified farm or conservation land is defined as real property located in the US used for farming or conservation purposes. The term 'adjusted value' refers to the value of qualified farm or conservation land for tax purposes, reduced by the deduction allowable under section 2053(a). The election for this deduction must be made as per regulations set by the Secretary. The election for a deduction on qualified farm or conservation land must be made according to regulations set by the Secretary and is irrevocable once made. An agreement signed by all interested parties is required, and modifications are permitted following prescribed procedures. Tax treatment of dispositions and inconsistent uses in a decedent's estate with qualified land and a covenant is governed by subsection (d). If the donee disposes of qualified farm or conservation land without the required covenant or uses the land in violation of the covenant, an additional gift tax is imposed. The amount of the tax is determined based on the value of the interest in the land. The additional gift tax imposed on the donee for disposing of qualified farm or conservation land without the required covenant or violating the covenant is calculated based on the adjusted tax difference with respect to the gift, which includes the gift tax liability if the fair market value of the interest at the time of disposition or use exceeds a certain amount. Interest is also added to this amount at the underpayment rate established under section 6621. The gift tax liability is defined as the tax imposed by section 2501 minus credits. Additional rules from section 2032A(c) apply. Dispositions trigger an additional tax treated as a sale at fair market value for income tax purposes. The disposition of property triggers an additional tax treated as a sale at fair market value for income tax purposes. Additional rules from section 2032A apply, including rules for real property, definitions of farm and farming purposes, bond in lieu of personal liability, special rules for woodlands, statute of limitation, special rules for involuntary conversions of real property, and exchanges of qualified real property. See section 6324C for a special lien on farm and conservation land. Section 6324C provides for a special lien on farm and conservation land. Additionally, a conforming amendment was made to section 2525 of the Code. Section 2524 allows for a deduction for the gift of farm and conservation land, with similar rules applying for generation skipping tax purposes. The effective date for these amendments applies to estates of decedents dying and gifts made. The amendments apply to estates of decedents dying, gifts made, and generation-skipping transfers after December 31, 2008."
