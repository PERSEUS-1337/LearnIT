    "content": "The Act titled \"Head Start Accountability Act of 2005\" amends Section 638 of the Head Start Act to provide financial assistance to Head Start agencies for a period of 5 years. The Head Start Act is amended to authorize the Secretary to designate local agencies as Head Start agencies if they have the capability to carry out program functions within the community. The Head Start Act authorizes the Secretary to designate local agencies to run Head Start programs, with required goals for continuous improvement in program operations, design, management, and partnerships. Eligibility for subsequent designation requires demonstrating meeting set criteria. To be eligible for designation as a Head Start agency, an entity must establish a local oversight board composed of volunteer individuals from various backgrounds. The board operates independently of agency staff and includes members with expertise in child development, business, accounting, law, and management. The Head Start agency oversight board actively participates in program development, planning, and evaluation, ensuring high-quality services are delivered in compliance with standards and performance measures. No financial benefits are provided to board members or agency staff. The oversight board reviews and approves the operating budget, bylaws, and human resources for the program annually. They also monitor staff implementation of corrective actions to comply with laws and regulations. In this subchapter, a community can be a city, county, Indian reservation, or neighborhood that has the commonality of interest to operate a Head Start program. The Secretary gives priority to high-performing Head Start agencies that meet program and financial management standards. High-performing Head Start agencies must meet program and financial management standards, have no unresolved deficiencies, and have taken corrective actions as required by the Secretary. SEC. 4. QUALITY STANDARDS; MONITORING OF HEAD START AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. Quality Standards under the Head Start Act are amended to include administrative and financial management standards, as well as procedures for evaluating and taking corrective actions for delegate agencies. The Head Start Act amendments include standards for evaluating delegate agencies and procedures for appealing financial assistance termination decisions. Agencies must evaluate delegate agencies, inform them of deficiencies, and take corrective actions if needed. The Head Start Act amendments allow for terminating delegate agencies if deficiencies are not corrected. Monitoring visits may be conducted without notice until issues are resolved, and funds will only be released as reimbursements until the deficiency is corrected or financial assistance is terminated. The Head Start Act allows for corrective action and termination of delegate agencies if deficiencies are not corrected within 60 days. The Secretary retains responsibility for overseeing Head Start agencies receiving financial assistance. The Secretary has the responsibility to approve or reject proposed quality improvement plans from Head Start agencies within 30 days. If approved, an on-site review must be conducted within 60 days to ensure all deficiencies have been corrected. The Secretary approves quality improvement plans from Head Start agencies within 30 days, followed by an on-site review within 60 days to ensure compliance with established standards and performance measures. SEC. 5. APPEALS, NOTICE, AND HEARING. Procedures amended for recipients of financial assistance under the Head Start Act to receive written notice 30 days before any suspension, termination, or reduction of assistance, with the right to a full and fair hearing. Limitation placed on using funds for appealing decisions made by the Secretary. SEC. 6. AUDITS. Section 647 of the Head Start Act requires Head Start agencies to submit an independent financial audit within 60 days after each fiscal year. The audit must be conducted by a certified public accountant chosen through a competitive process by the local oversight board. The Secretary must provide feedback on necessary corrective actions within 60 days of receiving the audit. The Head Start Act mandates agencies to correct deficiencies identified in audits by taking specified actions, including submitting annual accounting of administrative expenses to the Secretary and providing additional documentation as requested. The Act and its amendments will be effective on the 1st day of the 1st fiscal year after enactment."
