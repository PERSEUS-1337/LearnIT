    "content": "The franking privilege, rooted in 17th century Great Britain, allows Members of Congress to send official mail at government expense. In the United States, it dates back to 1775 when the First Continental Congress granted mailing privileges to communicate with constituents. Congress uses this privilege for various communications such as responding to constituent requests, sharing legislative updates, press releases, Congressional Record copies, and notices about town meetings. The franking privilege is regulated by federal law and House and Senate rules. The franking privilege, governed by federal law and House and Senate rules, allows Members of Congress to send official mail at government expense for public concern or service. Despite its intent to facilitate communication with constituents, the privilege has faced criticism and scrutiny. Proponents argue it enables important information delivery, while opponents are wary of incumbent advantages. Significant reforms have been adopted in response to debates over the franking privilege, with calls for additional changes such as banning franking for Members and prohibiting its use in election years. Despite public perception, franking is not free, as Congress pays the U.S. Postal Service for franked mail through annual appropriations. This has led to a significant reduction in costs over the past 30 years, with a decrease of over 85% in even-numbered-year costs and over 90% in odd-numbered-year costs. During FY2015, Congress spent $8.3 million on official mail, with House official mail costs at $6.8 million (82% of the total) and Senate official mail costs at $1.5 million (18% of the total). In FY2014, Congress spent $16.9 million on official mail, with House costs at $15.1 million (89% of the total) and Senate costs at $1.8 million (11% of the total). In FY2013, Congress spent $7.6 million on official mail. During FY2014, Congress spent $16.9 million on official mail, with House costs at $15.1 million (89% of the total) and Senate costs at $1.8 million (11% of the total). The higher official mail costs in FY2014, FY2012, FY2010, FY2008, and FY2006 compared with FY2015, FY2013, FY2011, FY2009, and FY2007 continue a historical pattern of Congress spending more on official mail costs during election years. During election years, congressional mail costs show a historical pattern of higher spending. The lowest costs occur in the fourth quarter of even-numbered calendar years due to mass mailing prohibitions before general elections. Higher costs were seen in December of certain years and the months leading up to election periods. The higher mail costs in FY2006, FY2008, FY2010, FY2012, and FY2014 were due to increased mailings by the House, with significant spikes in costs during December of those years. House mailings in the first quarter of those fiscal years cost significantly more compared to previous years. During FY2006, FY2008, FY2010, FY2012, and FY2014, House mailings saw increased costs, particularly in December, compared to previous years. Critics point to higher election-year mail costs as evidence of political use of the franking privilege, but fiscal calendar structure also plays a role in cost disparities between election and non-election years. The comparison of mail costs between 2005 and 2015 shows that annual costs by calendar year balance out the December spike and pre-election increase. Fiscal year official mail costs tend to overstate the effect of pre-election increases due to capturing the December spike. Data on congressional official mail costs is available from FY1978, while overall franked mail costs records date back to FY1954. Franked mail costs include the franking privilege for former Presidents and widows, with Figure 2 showing a plot of overall franked mail costs. Figure 2 displays the trend of franked mail costs from FY1954 to FY2015, showing a significant increase and decrease. The rise in costs during the 1960s and 1970s was followed by a reduction starting in FY1989. Factors contributing to the cost increase include the rapid growth in mail volume sent by Members of Congress and postal rate hikes. Rates for first-class mail and standard mail increased significantly from FY1972 to FY1988. Congressional mail costs have decreased over the past 30 years, with franking expenditures reduced by over 85% in even-numbered years and over 90% in odd-numbered years. The decrease in official mail expenditures in the early 1990s was due to congressional reforms. Since 1986, Congress has implemented tighter restrictions on official mail expenditures, including establishing franking allowances for Senators and House Members, disclosing individual mail costs, and limiting mass mailings. Senators have been prohibited from sending mass mailings outside their districts since 1992, with further restrictions on mass mailings since 1994. The adoption of new communication technology like email since 1995 has shifted some communication from franked mail to electronic formats, leading to significant monthly variations in official mail costs. Figure 4 shows the monthly official mail costs for the House of Representatives from FY2000 to FY2015, indicating regular spikes in costs during specific years. The highest costs occur in December of odd-numbered years and July or August of even-numbered years, while the lowest costs are seen before and after general elections. Figure 5 compares the Senate's official mail costs to the House, showing lower costs due to fewer Senators franking mass mailings and Senate rules limiting mass mailing expenses. Costs for Senate official mail are similar to the House of Representatives, peaking annually in September and higher before the pre-election prohibited period. Senate rules limit Senators to $50,000 for mass mailings in any fiscal year."
