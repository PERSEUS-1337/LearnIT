    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act\" and includes definitions for clarity. The Act defines \"clean technology\" as energy production from renewable sources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage improvement, enhanced building and industrial energy efficiency, and Smart Grid development. The Act defines \"clean technology\" as energy production from renewable sources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage improvement, enhanced building and industrial energy efficiency, Smart Grid development, integration of renewable energy sources, distributed generation, demand response, demand side management, systems analysis, advanced or sustainable material with energy or energy efficiency applications, improved energy efficiency for transportation including electric vehicles, and enhanced water security through improved water management, conservation, distribution, or end use applications. Advanced manufacturing refers to a manufacturing process that extensively uses computer, high precision, or information technologies integrated with a high performance workforce in a production system capable of. The term \"cluster\" refers to a network of entities involved in clean technologies and advanced manufacturing, facilitating the sharing of resources and expertise. A clean technology consortium, established in accordance with this Act, supports projects led by qualifying entities such as educational institutions, government entities, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in clean technology or cluster development. The term \"translational research\" refers to coordinating research to enable discoveries to be commercially applied. The Secretary of Commerce determines appropriate entities for development projects. Establishment of Clean Technology Consortia Program. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote domestic development, manufacture, and deployment of state-of-the-art technologies. This program will leverage expertise and resources from various sectors to support collaborative research, development, and commercial application of clean technologies and advanced manufacturing. The Secretary will oversee the program for clean technology consortia, selecting grant recipients through a competitive process and coordinating innovation activities with other agencies, industry, and higher education institutions. This aims to promote the development, manufacture, and deployment of advanced clean technologies and manufacturing practices. The clean technology consortia will convene a conference to bring together representatives from various sectors to share research, commercialization results, and collaboration opportunities. The purposes of the consortia include promoting innovative clean technologies, expanding advanced manufacturing capabilities, and fostering job creation and entrepreneurship. The clean technology consortia aims to promote job creation and entrepreneurship by supporting companies in establishing new ventures, expanding existing businesses, and commercializing clean technologies. They provide assistance in investing in clean technologies, new products, and enhanced processes to grow sales and jobs. Additionally, they help small- and medium-sized enterprises adopt new clean technologies and advanced manufacturing practices, accelerate investment in clean technologies through partnerships, and encourage collaboration among emerging companies. The clean technology consortia support job creation and entrepreneurship by assisting companies in establishing new ventures, expanding businesses, and commercializing clean technologies. They encourage partnering between emerging and established clean technology enterprises and demonstrate successful models for commercialization of clean technologies. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS. To receive a grant under this Act, a consortium must submit an application to the Secretary with necessary information. Eligibility requires the consortium to consist of research universities with clean technology research budget and expertise, as well as other qualifying entities with translational research and cluster development expertise. Members must have a binding agreement in place. The consortium applying for a grant must have a binding agreement that outlines the partnership structure, governance, conflicts-of-interest policy, accounting structure, and an external advisory committee. The consortium applying for a grant must have an external advisory committee, receive funding from non-Federal sources, be part of a cluster or show potential to develop one, and operate as a nonprofit organization or public-private partnership. The Secretary can disqualify an application if the conflicts-of-interest policy is inadequate. The Act requires a consortium to establish an external advisory committee with members having relevant expertise to review and ensure compliance with conflicts-of-interest policies. The committee includes representatives of the consortium and industry experts as deemed necessary. The Act mandates a consortium to form an external advisory committee with members having relevant expertise to review and ensure compliance with conflicts-of-interest policies. The Secretary is required to join the committee of a consortium receiving a grant under this Act. \"Grants are provided under this Act for consortiums, with the Secretary required to join the advisory committee to ensure compliance with conflicts-of-interest policies.\" The Secretary will award grants to consortiums on a competitive basis, with specific timelines and funding limits. Grants have an initial term of 5 years, extendable for up to 5 additional years. The maximum grant amount is $30,000,000 per fiscal year or the total contributions from non-Federal entities to the consortium. The Secretary awards grants to consortiums based on competitiveness, with set timelines and funding limits. Grants last 5 years, extendable for another 5 years, with a maximum amount of $30,000,000 per fiscal year or total non-Federal entity contributions. Grants support translational research, technology development, and manufacturing. The consortium receiving grants must develop and share project plans, criteria, and terms publicly. They must also establish policies to prevent displacement of private sector investment and encourage private sector participation. The consortium overseeing project solicitations, reviewing proposals, selecting projects for awards, and monitoring implementation. Private entities and parties with clean technology expertise participate in due diligence, review processes, and provide guidance. Administrative expenses are limited for consortium use. The consortium overseeing project awards must limit administrative expenses to 10% of the grant amount. Funds cannot be used for new construction. Annual audits are required to ensure grant compliance, with reports submitted to the Secretary and the Comptroller General. The Secretary has the authority to review and revoke grants awarded under the Act if a consortium misuses the funds. The Comptroller General must have full access to consortium records, and the Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress including audits and recommendations related to the clean technology consortia program. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized to the Secretary for implementing this section of the Act."
