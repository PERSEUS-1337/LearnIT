    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Fusion Energy Act of 1993\". It includes findings, purposes, and definitions. Congress finds that fusion energy has the potential to be a safe, environmentally attractive, secure, and economically affordable source of energy. The US Department of Energy's magnetic fusion energy program has made significant progress, and international collaboration is necessary for continued advancement in proving the feasibility of magnetic fusion energy. The United States should focus on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and a fusion demonstration reactor to advance fusion energy. Industry and utilities need to commit to these projects for a successful fusion energy program. The Act aims to involve industry and utilities in the design, construction, and operation of fusion facilities. It focuses on redirecting the Department's magnetic fusion energy program towards building the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor by 2005 and a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025. The plan includes budget, critical path, milestones, and schedules for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The Act aims to involve industry and utilities in the design, construction, and operation of fusion facilities, focusing on building the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor by 2005 and a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025. It includes selecting a candidate host site within the United States for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. Definitions include the Department as the United States Department of Energy, ITER as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, and the Secretary as the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy. The Act focuses on the International Fusion Energy Program, including the construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor by 2005 and a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025. The Office of the International Fusion Negotiator is established as an independent establishment in the executive branch. The Negotiator, appointed by the President with Senate approval, represents the US in negotiations with other countries regarding the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The Secretary will redirect the Department's magnetic fusion program to align with these goals. The Department's magnetic fusion program aims to design, construct, and operate ITER by 2005 and a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025 in cooperation with the international community. The program focuses on developing ITER, fusion materials, and reactor components, while eliminating non-contributing components. A candidate host site within the United States will be selected. The Department's magnetic fusion program aims to design, construct, and operate ITER by 2005 and a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025 in cooperation with the international community. The program focuses on developing ITER, fusion materials, and reactor components, while ensuring substantial US industry and utility involvement. A candidate host site within the United States will be selected, and support will be provided for negotiating with other countries involved in ITER. The Secretary, in consultation with the International Fusion Negotiator, shall prepare and implement a management plan for the Department's magnetic fusion program. The plan will be updated biannually and will establish program goals, prioritize elements contributing to ITER or fusion reactor development, and eliminate components not directly contributing to these goals. The Secretary, in consultation with the International Fusion Negotiator, shall prepare and implement a management plan for the Department's magnetic fusion program. The plan will prioritize elements contributing to ITER or fusion reactor development, establish a selection process for a proposed host site within the United States for ITER, and set necessary steps for the design, construction, and operation of ITER by 2005 and a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025. The Secretary, in consultation with the International Fusion Negotiator, will prioritize elements for ITER and fusion reactor development, establish a selection process for a host site in the US, and set steps for the design, construction, and operation of a fusion demonstration reactor by 2025. International agreements may be negotiated for the design, construction, and operation of ITER or facilities. The International Fusion Negotiator will seek agreements with other countries to share costs for ITER facilities and components. They will also report annually to Congress on negotiation status, issues, impediments, and steps needed for ITER progress. Prior to seeking funds for construction of ITER, the Secretary must certify to Congress that there is agreement in place or a substantial likelihood of reaching agreement with countries involved in ITER on siting, construction, and operation. The Secretary will report to Congress if termination is necessary. The Secretary may terminate the ITER program if it is no longer essential for fusion reactor development, there is no agreement on the host site or design, or there is insufficient commitment from US industry. If terminated, research in magnetic fusion can continue at authorized levels. Authorization of appropriations for magnetic fusion energy activities is limited to specified amounts set forth in the Act. The Secretary is authorized to receive $380,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $425,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, $475,000,000 for fiscal year 1996, and additional funds as needed. In case of program termination, $50,000,000 is allocated for each of the years 1994, 1995, and 1996 for magnetic fusion energy activities. Passed the Senate on June 29, 1993. Attest: WALTER J. STEWART, Secretary."
