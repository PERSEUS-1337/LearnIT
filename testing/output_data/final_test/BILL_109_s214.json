    "content": "The Act titled \"United States-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act\" directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to assess priority transboundary aquifers between the United States and Mexico. The Act defines key terms such as aquifer, IBWC, Indian tribe, Participating State, and priority transboundary aquifer. The Act defines key terms related to transboundary aquifers, including priority transboundary aquifer, program, reservation, Secretary, and transboundary aquifer. The curr_chunk defines terms related to transboundary aquifers, including transboundary aquifer, tri-regional planning group, and water resources research institutes. Establishment of program. The Secretary, in consultation with various entities, will conduct the US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program to characterize priority aquifers along the border. The program aims to develop an integrated scientific approach to identify and assess these aquifers. The Secretary, in consultation with various entities, will conduct the US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program to characterize priority aquifers along the border. This includes evaluating criteria such as population density, aquifer usage, contamination susceptibility, and other relevant factors. Data and publications will be used to develop study plans, create or enhance a geographic information system database, and conduct field studies for monitoring and metering efforts. The curr_chunk discusses the expansion of monitoring and metering efforts to gather additional data for defining aquifer characteristics and developing groundwater flow models. It also mentions the consideration of modifying existing agreements for joint scientific investigations and data sharing between the US Geological Survey, Participating States, and authorities in the US and Mexico. The Secretary will designate priority transboundary aquifers for the program, including the Hueco Bolson, Mesilla, Santa Cruz River Valley, and San Pedro aquifers. Scientific products will be produced for each aquifer to provide necessary information for water managers and natural resource agencies on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The Secretary may designate additional priority transboundary aquifers in New Mexico or Texas. Cooperation with Mexico is essential for a comprehensive assessment of these aquifers. Grants and cooperative agreements may be provided to carry out the program. The implementation of the program is outlined in Section 5. The Secretary must coordinate activities with water resource agencies in Participating States, affected Indian tribes, entities monitoring transboundary aquifers, and the IBWC. No new field studies can start without consulting Participating State agencies. The Secretary will work with State agencies on study plans and cost estimates. The Secretary must coordinate with relevant entities to develop study plans, timelines, and cost estimates for priority transboundary aquifers. The study plan should integrate existing data, improve groundwater flow models, and align with State guidelines and goals. SEC. 6. EFFECT. This Act does not impact state jurisdiction over water resources, water rights, or existing water laws, compacts, or treaties. It also does not affect works related to the Treaty Between the United States and Mexico Regarding Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande. SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nWithin 5 years of enactment, the Secretary must submit interim and final reports to water agencies in Participating States. Reports will detail program activities, Secretary's conclusions on priority aquifers, and Mexico's program participation.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorized appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 under this Act. 50% of funds to water resources research institutes for activities in Participating States and Mexico, with Mexico providing 50% of necessary resources. The authorized activity receives 50 percent of necessary resources for assistance. The Secretary's authority to implement the provisions of this Act will end 10 years after its enactment."
