The \"Robert Carey Service Disabled Veterans' Insurance Act of 2002\" introduces a new section for service disabled veterans' insurance, providing coverage against death for eligible individuals upon payment of premiums. The \"Robert Carey Service Disabled Veterans' Insurance Act of 2002\" introduces a new section for service disabled veterans' insurance, providing coverage against death for eligible individuals upon payment of premiums. Eligibility criteria include being released from military service under honorable conditions, having a disability, being insurable according to health standards, and being under 65 years old. The new section introduced by the \"Robert Carey Service Disabled Veterans' Insurance Act of 2002\" provides additional insurance coverage for eligible service disabled veterans. Those deemed insured under section 1922(b) are not eligible for this insurance. The insured amount under this section can be chosen by the individual, ranging from $5,000 to $45,000, in increments of $5,000. The new section allows eligible service disabled veterans to choose insurance coverage ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. At age 70, the coverage amount is adjusted to 20% of the elected amount. Applicants must submit a written application within 10 years of the release date. The application for insurance by a service-disabled veteran must be submitted within 10 years of release from service. Additionally, the application for disability-related insurance must be filed within two years of the Secretary finding service connection, unless the person was mentally incompetent, in which case the deadline is two years after a guardian is appointed or the disability is removed. The insurance premiums for service-disabled veterans are determined by the Secretary and must be paid until the age of 70. Premium rates are level and based on specific mortality tables and interest rates. All payments are credited to a Treasury fund established for this purpose. Insurance under this section shall be issued on the same terms as National Service Life Insurance policies, with no loan or extended values. Settlements will be paid in a lump sum, and the insurance may be referred to as 'Robert Carey Service Disabled Veterans' Insurance'. The amendment to the Service Disabled Veterans' Insurance Program includes coordination with the current program and eligibility for insurance under section 1922B. The amendment updates the mortality table and interest rate for service disabled veterans' insurance, with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs evaluating the suitability of the mortality table used. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will submit a report to Congress if the current mortality table is no longer suitable, with a recommendation for an alternative standard table. Regulations will be prescribed for administering the amendments, effective October 1, 2003. Authorization of appropriations for the revolving fund is also included. The amendments made by subsections (a) through (c) will take effect on October 1, 2003, with necessary sums allocated for section 1922B of title 38, United States Code."
