The programs are based on voluntarism and informed choice, integrating reproductive health with maternal and child health interventions. The United States supports family planning programs in developing countries, integrating them with other health interventions. Controversies arise over funding levels, abortion promotion, and coercion in national programs, particularly in China. The debate over U.S. funding for family planning programs in other countries stems from the domestic abortion policy debate since Roe v. Wade. Abortion opponents have sought to restrict funding for abortions supported by U.S. foreign assistance funds, leading to provisions in annual appropriation measures banning federal funds for legal abortions. This debate has mainly focused on domestic spending bills. The controversy over U.S. funding for international family planning programs includes restrictions on using foreign aid for abortions and sterilizations. The \"Helms amendment\" prohibits the use of foreign development assistance for abortions or coercing individuals to undergo sterilizations. Congress has enacted this amendment and other abortion-related restrictions in annual Foreign Operations appropriation bills since 1981. In the mid-1980s, the \"Mexico City policy\" was introduced by President Reagan, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to refrain from promoting abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by various Administrations, most recently by President Obama in 2009. In 1985, the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment was adopted by Congress due to concerns about the UNFPA's program in China potentially supporting abortion or coercive family planning practices. The UNFPA's program in China faced restrictions under the Kemp-Kasten amendment, which prohibits U.S. assistance to organizations involved in coercive family planning. Presidential decisions on the Mexico City Policy and UNFPA's activities in China have been divided along party lines. Congressional actions and executive directives have historically limited U.S. population assistance. Restrictions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and executive regulations prohibit indirect support for coercive family planning and abortion activities by international NGOs, particularly in China. Controversial actions include the Mexico City policy on funding for foreign NGOs and \"Kemp-Kasten\" restrictions on UNFPA funding due to its activities in China. The Reagan Administration restricted U.S. population aid by terminating support for foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities, even if funded by non-U.S. sources. The Mexico City policy, also known as the \"Mexico City policy,\" was introduced at the 2nd U.N. International Conference on Population in 1984. Efforts to overturn the policy during the George H. W. Bush Administration were unsuccessful, despite criticism that it violates free speech and women's rights to choose abortion. Critics argue that the policy hinders family planning and maternal health services in developing nations, potentially leading to an increase in abortions. The Mexico City policy, criticized for hindering family planning services in developing nations, may lead to an increase in unsafe and illegal abortions. Opponents argue that the policy strains relations between the U.S. government and foreign NGOs, imposing restrictions on how funds are spent and promoting a gag order on abortion laws. President Clinton lifted these restrictions in 1993. President Clinton, in response to USAID, ended the Mexico City policy by lifting restrictions on grants to family planning foreign NGOs. This move aimed to support safe and effective family planning programs abroad. However, President George W. Bush reinstated the Mexico City restrictions in 2001, requiring foreign NGOs to certify that they would not perform or promote abortions to receive U.S. family planning assistance. President Bush reinstated the Mexico City policy in 2001, requiring foreign NGOs to certify they would not promote abortions to receive U.S. family planning assistance. The certification process aimed to prevent organizations from using USAID funds for abortions or advocacy. President Obama revoked the policy in 2009, allowing voluntary population planning without Bush Administration conditions. President Obama directed the State Department and USAID to waive broad conditions on grants for voluntary family planning programs, aiming to promote safe and effective programs in foreign nations. The Reagan Administration required UNFPA to provide assurances against abortion and coercive family planning programs, particularly in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment in the FY1985 Supplemental Appropriations Act restricted UNFPA funding due to concerns about coercive family planning practices in China. $10 million of $46 million allocated for UNFPA in FY1985 was redirected to other programs by USAID. The United States suspended contributions to UNFPA in 1986 due to concerns about its activities in China. Critics argued that UNFPA was the most effective family planning organization and that the quality of services in developing nations suffered without US support. US payments accounted for nearly one-third of UNFPA's budget at the time of suspension. No US contributions were made to UNFPA from 1986 to 1993. The Clinton Administration later lifted the ban and provided $14.5 million in FY1993. In FY1993, the US provided $14.5 million to UNFPA but excluded China. Congress tried to restrict funding unless UNFPA left China or China stopped coercive family planning. From FY1994 to FY2001, US support to UNFPA had restrictions reducing funding by the amount spent in China. In FY2002, Congress allocated $34 million, but the Bush Administration halted contributions for a review due to alleged coercive practices in China. The Bush Administration halted funding to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 due to alleged coercive practices in China. $34 million was transferred from FY2002, FY2004, and FY2005 appropriations, and $25 million from FY2003 funds to support other programs. $22.5 million in unused UNFPA funds from FY2006 was transferred to the International Organizations and Program account. Debate continues on UNFPA's involvement in involuntary activities in China. The State Department investigative team found no evidence of UNFPA knowingly supporting coercive practices in China. Despite this, Secretary of State Powell declared UNFPA ineligible for U.S. funding under Kemp-Kasten. The State Department found that UNFPA's funding in China supported the government's coercive family planning practices, leading to the organization being declared ineligible for U.S. funding under Kemp-Kasten. The State Department found that UNFPA's funding in China supported the government's coercive family planning practices, leading to the organization being declared ineligible for U.S. funding under Kemp-Kasten. In September 2005, the U.S. urged UNFPA and China to make changes to allow U.S. support to resume, but no significant changes occurred. USAID then redirected funds to expand family planning programs in 14 other countries. Kelly Ryan argued at a UNFPA meeting that the organization should end its operations in China. The State Department criticized UNFPA for supporting China's coercive family planning programs, leading to the organization being ineligible for U.S. funding. Despite UNFPA's disapproval of coercive policies, its presence in China was seen as endorsing them. Critics of the Bush Administration's decision argued that it would reduce access to voluntary family planning programs in many countries, impacting women's health. The Obama Administration expressed support for funding UNFPA, contributing $50 million in 2009. Critics were concerned about the impact on women's health due to reduced access to family planning programs in various countries. The Obama Administration's decision to support funding for international family planning and reproductive health through USAID highlighted the President's commitment to women's health and global development. USAID has been the largest international family planning donor for over 40 years, with obligations exceeding $13.8 billion since 1965. Their current activities focus on key priorities such as healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies, community-based approaches, and contraceptive security in nearly 40 countries. The level of funding for family planning and reproductive health activities has been controversial, linked with Mexico City policy restrictions, UNFPA funding, and abortion. Congress generally supported higher funding levels for population aid than proposed by the President, especially during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. During the Clinton Administration, Congress cut and placed restrictions on bilateral funding for family planning and reproductive health. Funding levels peaked in FY2010 at $648.4 million, attributed to President Obama's determination that UNFPA is eligible for U.S. funding. From FY2012 to FY2015, funding levels remained constant at $575 million for bilateral activities and $35 million for UNFPA. In FY2016, bilateral family planning funding remained at $575 million, while UNFPA funding decreased to $32.5 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 113-114) specified funding levels for bilateral FP/RH activities and UNFPA, with a $2.5 million decrease for UNFPA compared to previous years. The FY2016 Administration requested $577.623 million for bilateral FP/RH activities, including $538 million from GHP and $39.623 million from the ESF account. Additionally, $39.6 million was requested for UNFPA from the IO&P account. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2015 specified funding levels for bilateral FP/RH activities and UNFPA, with $575 million for FP/RH activities and $35 million for UNFPA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) allocated $71 million from the GHP account and $35.3 million for UNFPA from the IO&P account. Funding for UNFPA is subject to restrictions, including no funds for China programs, separate accounting of U.S. contributions, and a prohibition on funding abortions. President Obama requested $635.4 million in family planning funding for FY2014, including $37 million for UNFPA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2013 funded State-Foreign operations accounts for family planning. The Act also required reporting on UNFPA's budget for China programs. Funding for UNFPA is subject to restrictions, including no funds for China programs and a prohibition on funding abortions. In FY2013, President Obama requested $642.7 million for international family planning and reproductive health funding, with $575 million allocated for family planning activities and $35 million for UNFPA. Funding for UNFPA is subject to restrictions, including no funds for China programs. UNFPA funding is subject to restrictions, including no funds for China programs. U.S. contributions must be kept separate from other UNFPA accounts and not used for abortions. The Secretary of State must report on UNFPA's budget for China programs. Obama Administration requested $769.105 million for international family planning in FY2012. The Obama Administration requested $769.105 million for international family planning in FY2012, including funding from various accounts such as GHCS, ESF, AEECA, and IO&P for UNFPA."
