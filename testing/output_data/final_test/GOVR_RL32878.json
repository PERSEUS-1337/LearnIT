    "content": "Senate rules do not have general time limits for nominations or other matters, allowing opponents to use filibusters to delay a final vote. The motion for cloture in Senate Rule XXII is used to place time limits on consideration and overcome filibusters. When cloture is invoked, a time limit of 30 hours is set for further consideration before a vote occurs. The cloture rule in the Senate sets a 30-hour time limit to ensure a vote on a question. Prior to November 2013, a supermajority vote of three-fifths of the full Senate was required to invoke cloture, allowing opponents to delay consideration. After November 2013, the Senate changed the cloture rule to require a simple majority for invoking cloture, allowing for quicker approval of nominations. Despite this change, Senators can still extend post-cloture consideration within the limits of the rule, including one hour of debate per Senator and a total time limit of 30 hours. In cases of a large number of nominations, the majority may seek unanimous consent for quicker approval instead of cloture. Filibusters can occur without cloture being sought, as cloture is requested by supporters while filibusters are conducted by opponents. Supporters may not seek cloture due to lack of votes, confidence in overcoming delays, or hopes of negotiation. This dynamic was more common in earlier times, particularly regarding nominations. In the Senate, leaders may move for cloture to speed up action or in response to a perceived filibuster threat. They often avoid bringing contentious matters to the floor to save time. Observers now use \"filibuster\" more broadly to include attempts to discourage a matter in advance. The term \"filibuster\" now includes attempts to discourage a matter in advance, such as placing a \"hold\" on a nomination. This newer sense of the term is different from the historically established usage of filibusters during floor consideration. Cloture motions cannot be used to identify these \"silent filibusters.\" The cloture rule can only be invoked during floor proceedings, typically on a pending question. If a filibuster is anticipated, cloture can only be considered if the leadership decides to bring the matter to the floor. In some cases, the Senate has set time limits for consideration by unanimous consent, requiring 60 votes for approval, known as the \"60-vote hurdle.\" This allows a minority to potentially block the nomination. The cloture rule, known as the \"60-vote hurdle,\" allows a minority to potentially block a nomination. The reinterpretation of the cloture rule complicates using cloture motions to identify filibusters, especially when comparing over time. The majority party's increased use of cloture may reflect increased obstruction by the minority or a majority more readily relying on a simple majority process. The periods before and after the rules reinterpretation are incomparable. The reinterpretation of the cloture rule complicates identifying filibusters, as any procedural action can be used for both delaying a vote and normal consideration. Filibusters cannot be easily identified by specific criteria, requiring subjective judgment in each case. The reinterpretation of the cloture rule complicates identifying filibusters, as any procedural action can be used for delaying a vote and normal consideration. Subjective judgment is required to determine filibusters, as specific criteria are not easily identifiable. The data provided in the report only includes nominations where cloture motions were offered, not systematically identifying filibustered nominations. Developing a list of filibustered measures would require a commonly accepted standard for defining filibustering. The data may indicate potential filibuster cases. The Senate adopted a cloture rule in 1917, allowing cloture on legislative measures only until 1949. From 1949 to 2013, cloture was sought on 143 nominations. The report does not include failed cloture attempts before 2013. Table 6 in the report lists the nominations, cloture motions filed, and outcomes. The Senate adopted a cloture rule in 1917, allowing cloture on legislative measures only until 1949. From 1949 to 2013, cloture was sought on 143 nominations. The Senate invoked cloture on 59 nominations, while cloture motions on 56 nominations were withdrawn or vitiated. The Senate voted against cloture on 28 nominations. Ultimately, 118 out of the 143 nominations were confirmed, including those on which cloture was invoked and some on which it was not. The Senate adopted a cloture rule in 1917, allowing cloture on legislative measures only until 1949. From 1949 to 2013, cloture was sought on 143 nominations, with 118 nominations confirmed. The remaining 25 nominations failed of confirmation following a cloture motion, but none were rejected by the Senate on an \"up-or-down\" vote. Filibusters against nominations were infrequent until recent years, with limited knowledge about earlier filibusters due to closed sessions and lack of rules for ending debates before 1917. Until 1917, the Senate had no rule to end debates, and the cloture rule did not apply to nominations until 1949. Historical accounts suggest that filibustering on nominations was infrequent in earlier periods, possibly due to Presidents submitting nominations selectively. During earlier periods, obstacles to nomination confirmations often arose from \"silent filibusters\" rather than overt opposition during floor consideration. The custom of \"Senatorial courtesy\" allowed Senators to block nominations they found objectionable in their home state. This practice suggests that Presidents consulted with Senators before submitting nominations, and if objections were strong, the Senate might not bring the nomination to the floor. In 1968, the Senate rejected cloture on the nomination of Abe Fortas for Chief Justice, leading to President Johnson withdrawing the nomination. In 1969 and 1970, nominations of Haynsworth and Carswell to the Supreme Court were defeated after debate without cloture. In 1971, cloture was sought for Rehnquist's nomination, but not invoked. No other cloture motions were filed until 1980. Since 1980, the frequency of cloture being sought on nominations has increased. The rules for invoking cloture on nominations were changed in 1975, lowering the threshold to 60 votes. In 1980, cloture was sought on the nomination of William G. Lubbers for General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, and it was confirmed. The frequency of cloture being sought on nominations has increased since 1980. Data shows a rising trend in cloture attempts on nominations, especially in Congresses from 2003 onwards. In contrast to earlier Congresses, cloture has been sought more frequently in recent years. The frequency of cloture being sought on nominations has increased since 1980, especially in Congresses from 2003 onwards. The pattern of activity since then has increasingly made the 103rd Congress look like a forerunner of typical practices. Highly controversial nominations may now be more likely to be brought to the Senate floor if it is the President's party that can set the agenda. In the 108th Congress, there was extensive contestation over judicial nominations by President George W. Bush, leading to a potential change in Senate rules. The maximum number of cloture motions on a single nomination was significantly higher compared to previous and subsequent Congresses. In the 108th Congress, there was intense contestation over judicial nominations by President George W. Bush, with multiple cloture motions being used. The Senate leaders became less willing to invest extensive floor time on nominations that lacked sufficient support for cloture. The Senate rejected cloture more frequently on nominations, with opponents persisting in contesting them more intensely. In the 108th Congress, there was increased opposition to judicial nominations by President George W. Bush, leading to more frequent cloture rejections. Despite this, over consecutive Congresses, the Senate only voted against cloture on a small fraction of nominations. Cloture actions were evenly split between nominations for the judiciary and executive branch positions, with a historical focus on federal bench appointments. The focus of cloture actions on nominations has shifted between judicial and executive branch positions in different Congresses. In some periods, nominations to judicial positions were the main focus, while in others, cloture motions on executive branch nominations were more prevalent. The rejection of cloture attempts on nominations occurred more frequently in certain Congresses, particularly following the inauguration of a new President. In the 108th Congress, cloture attempts on judicial nominations were rejected more often than invoked or abandoned. In contrast, the 109th and 111th Congresses saw high proportions of cloture being invoked or no vote occurring on executive branch nominations. In the 112th Congress, many cloture attempts on judicial nominations did not result in cloture votes, indicating potential filibuster threats that did not materialize. Prior to the reinterpretation of the cloture rule, few nominations subject to cloture were for top federal government positions. Prior to the reinterpretation of the cloture rule, few nominations subject to cloture were for top federal government positions. Only 4 have been to the Supreme Court, and only 11 to head Cabinet departments or other positions sometimes accorded Cabinet rank by the President. Cloture attempts have occurred particularly often on nominations to positions in the Department of State and the Department of Justice."
