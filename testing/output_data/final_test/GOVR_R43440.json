The regulations set a deadline for compliance by July 21, 2015. The Volcker Rule, implemented by federal financial regulators on December 10, 2013, requires banking institutions to comply with the Rule by July 21, 2015. The Rule prohibits \"banking entities\" from engaging in proprietary trading and making investments in certain funds, with various exclusions and permissible activities outlined. The Volcker Rule, implemented in 2013, prohibits banking entities from engaging in certain activities unless specific conditions are met. Federal financial regulators have the authority to issue detailed regulations to distinguish prohibited activities from essential ones.

Compliance with the Rule is essential for banking entities. The Volcker Rule, implemented in 2013, prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in covered funds unless specific conditions are met. It applies to a wide range of financial institutions, both domestic and foreign, and requires compliance with various compliance programs and reporting obligations. Congress has given federal financial regulators extensive discretion to craft the Rule to meet diverse objectives, including promoting safety and soundness. The Volcker Rule, implemented in 2013, prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in covered funds unless specific conditions are met.

Regulators may modify and clarify the requirements over time to ensure financial stability. The rule applies to FDIC-insured depository institutions and companies that own them. Companies that own FDIC-insured depository institutions, including bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and foreign-based companies treated like bank holding companies. Affiliates and subsidiaries of these companies are also covered.

The Volcker Rule applies broadly to depository institutions and companies with a common ownership interest. Regulations provide exceptions to the definition of \"banking entity.\" Compliance standards vary based on the organization or activities of the banking entity.

Foreign banks may be allowed to trade foreign government obligations under certain circumstances, unlike U.S.-based banking entities. The Volcker Rule prohibits proprietary trading by banking entities, with exceptions and conditions outlined in the legislation. Financial instruments like securities and derivatives are covered, but certain types are excluded.

It establishes a rebuttable presumption for financial instruments held for fewer than 60 days. The rule defines a \"trading account\" as one used for short-term resale, price movements, arbitrage profits, or hedging. It applies to securities dealers, swap dealers, and market risk capital transactions. The Market Risk Capital Rules exclude certain activities from the definition of \"proprietary trading,\" such as acquisitions or sales of financial products under specific agreements, derivative clearing activities, and transactions for delivery obligations. The Rule excludes certain activities from the definition of \"proprietary trading,\" such as acquisitions or sales of financial products while acting as a trustee for an employee compensation plan, and acquisitions or sales of financial products in the \"ordinary course of collecting a debt.\" It also lists exceptions to the prohibition of proprietary trades, setting conditions for permitted activities while excluding those that could result in conflicts of interest or high-risk exposure. The Volcker Rule sets standards for banking entities to prevent activities that could pose a risk to financial stability. It allows regulators to impose limits and conditions on activities, with exceptions for underwriting activities that meet certain criteria. These activities must be related to the banking entity's role as a securities underwriter and comply with internal compliance programs. The Volcker Rule allows banking entities to engage in market making activities that are related to their role as securities underwriters, as long as they comply with internal compliance programs and meet certain requirements.

The final rule of the Volcker Rule allows banking entities to engage in market making activities and permits \"risk-mitigating hedging activities\" to reduce specific risks related to positions. Portfolio hedging is not permitted, and banking entities must document any investment undertaken as a hedge by linking it to specific risks or exposures being offset. This provision aims to prevent incidents like the $6 billion loss suffered by JPMorgan & Co. in 2012 due to derivatives trades conducted by the London Whale. The final rule of the Volcker Rule allows banking entities to engage in market making activities and permits \"risk-mitigating hedging activities\" to reduce specific risks related to positions.

Insurance companies can trade for their general accounts in compliance with state laws. Banking regulators, in consultation with the FSOC and relevant state or foreign insurance regulators, may jointly restrict insurance company investment activities if state regulation is inadequate to protect banking entity safety or US financial stability. Foreign banking entities can conduct permitted investments outside the US under certain conditions. The Volcker Rule regulations restrict foreign banking entities from engaging in trading activities that pose a risk to the U.S. financial system. The agencies have discretion to permit proprietary trading for activities that promote banking entity safety and financial stability. The Volcker Rule regulations prohibit banking entities from acquiring ownership interests in covered funds, except when acting as agent, trustee for employee compensation plans, or in the ordinary course of debt collection. Ownership interest is broadly defined as any equity, partnership, or similar interest. A banking entity's ownership interest in a covered fund will be considered an \"other similar interest\" if it includes control over hiring or removal of fund managers, rights to share in income or profits, rights to fund assets after other interests are settled, rights to excess spread, duties to pay based on interest rates or asset value, or earnings from pass-through income. The regulations define ownership interest in a covered fund as control over hiring or removal of fund managers, rights to share in income or profits, rights to fund assets after other interests are settled, rights to excess spread, duties to pay based on interest rates or asset value, or earnings from pass-through income. This definition has caused concerns among banking entities, particularly regarding collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities. The Volcker Rule regulations initially prohibited banking entities, including community banks, from holding certain investments like CDOs backed by TruPS. The American Bankers Association and community banking organizations challenged this, leading to the issuance of an interim final rule allowing banking entities to continue holding TruPS-backed investments. This rule focused on community banking organizations but similar issues may arise with other investments. The Volcker Rule regulations apply to securities issued and held by banking entities, including community banking organizations, that are backed by various types of debts such as commercial paper, automobile loans, and mortgages.

Banking entities can make de minimis investments in covered funds, with limits on the total value not exceeding 3 percent of the total ownership interests or value of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund. The Rule establishes various methods for calculating per fund de minimis investment caps based on the type of fund in question. The final regulations for the Volcker Rule establish how tier 1 capital should be calculated for banking entities not required to report capital levels. Banking entities can make initial seed investments in covered funds but must actively replace their investments with those of unaffiliated third parties and comply with de minimis investment requirements. The FRB may grant up to two additional years for compliance with the per fund de minimis investment cap if consistent with safety and soundness.

The Volcker Rule allows banking entities to engage in market making activities for covered funds, with requirements such as standing ready to buy and sell financial instruments in appropriate amounts. Ownership interests acquired must be included in investment cap calculations, and ownership stakes in covered funds for hedging purposes are permitted with limitations. Acquisitions for hedging purposes under the Volcker Rule are limited to reducing specific risks related to compensation arrangements with employees providing services to covered funds. Banking entities must have internal programs to ensure compliance with the rule for the duration of the investment. Foreign banking entities not controlled by U.S.-based entities may also engage in such acquisitions. Foreign banking entities not controlled by U.S.-based entities may be exempt from Volcker Rule restrictions on investments in covered funds if certain conditions are met, such as conducting all activities outside the U.S. and having the majority of business in a foreign country. Insurance companies can also sponsor or acquire ownership interests in covered funds if held for their own account and compliant with state insurance regulations. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities and their affiliates from engaging in certain transactions with covered funds, except for specific exceptions. Regulations require compliance with the statute to ensure financial stability. The final regulations require banking entities to develop and maintain compliance programs, internal controls, and recordkeeping systems to control and monitor the risk of trading and investment activities in order to ensure compliance with Section 619 of the Volcker Rule. Compliance requirements vary based on the size, scope, complexity, and types of trading and investment activities conducted by the banking entity. Banking entities with no proprietary trading activity or investments in covered funds may not need a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program unless they begin such activities. Entities with assets below $10 billion can integrate Volcker Rule compliance measures into existing programs. Standard compliance requirements are outlined in Appendix A of the regulations. The final regulations require banking entities with assets of $10 billion or more to comply with standard compliance program requirements outlined in Appendix A. Entities with assets of $50 billion or more are subject to Enhanced Minimum Standards outlined in Appendix B. The compliance program includes written policies, internal controls, management frameworks, testing, training, and recordkeeping. Additionally, banking entities must calculate quantitative measurements for seven aspects of each trading desk. The final regulations require banking entities with assets of $10 billion or more to comply with standard compliance program requirements outlined in Appendix A. Entities with assets of $50 billion or more are subject to Enhanced Minimum Standards outlined in Appendix B, including quantitative measurements for seven aspects of each trading desk. These measurements cover risks, position limits, risk factor sensitivities, value-at-risk, stress value-at-risk, profit and loss attribution, inventory turnover, aging, and customer facing trade ratio. The regulations emphasize the importance of robust risk monitoring and compliance with proprietary trading restrictions. The Enhanced Minimum Standards for banking entities with assets of $50 billion or more outline specific requirements for trading desks, including identifying, authorizing, and documenting financial instruments, allocating risks, setting limits, approving new products and strategies, defining permissible customers and counterparties, and detailing compensation arrangements. These standards emphasize the importance of risk management and compliance with proprietary trading restrictions. The Enhanced Minimum Standards for banking entities with assets of $50 billion or more outline requirements for risk management, trading desks, and covered fund activities. This includes authorizing risks, documenting financial instruments, setting limits, monitoring conflicts of interest, and involving management in reviewing and testing fund activities. CEO attestation is also required. The Volcker Rule regulations require banking entities to promptly terminate any activity or investment violating the rule. The FRB can enforce compliance by directing entities to restrict, limit, or terminate activities and divest investments. Nonconforming activities must be divested within two years of the rule's effective date, with a possible extension of up to three years. The recent extension sets the conformance date as July 21, 2015. Banking entities must bring their activities into conformance with the Volcker Rule regulations by July 21, 2015. Companies not classified as banking entities on that date have until two years after becoming one to comply. Good faith efforts are expected, including developing a specific conformance plan and terminating proprietary trading operations. During the conformance period, entities with significant trading operations remain subject to the rules. During the conformance period, banking entities with significant trading operations must adhere to the data reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the Volcker Rule. The FRB may extend the July 15, 2015, deadline by one-year increments, up to a maximum of two additional years. If a banking entity is contractually obligated to maintain ownership in an illiquid fund, they can request an extension of up to five years from the FRB, after which divestiture is required."
