It utilizes abs functions as activation functions and can generate data resembling input. Results on the MNIST dataset are discussed briefly. The principle of 'Ockham's Razor' states that the simplest solution is often the best. AANN, a technique driven by this principle, can classify inputs forward and generate them backward. It combines classification and regression tasks. GAN can create representations of input data using a unique distribution generation technique. The GAN technique generates a distribution containing original and generated data points for classification by the Discriminator. InfoGAN resolves entanglement issues by maximizing mutual information in related latent representations. Auto-encoder uses encoder-decoder architecture for low dimensional representations. VAE aims to make learned representations sparse using KL-divergence cost as a regularizer. The Absolute Artificial Neural Network (AANN) utilizes labelled training datasets to structure learned representations of input data. AANN is similar to a feed forward Neural Network but uses the abs function as the activation function, resulting in all activations being positive real numbers. This approach aims to simplify the complexity of combining GAN and VAE techniques in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. The AANN transforms input data into a space with dimensions equal to the number of labels in the training dataset, ensuring all activations are positive real numbers. This simplifies combining GAN and VAE techniques for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. The AANN is constructed using a 'Bidirectional Neuron' as the building block for hidden layers of a feed forward neural network. The neuron uses the abs function as the activation function and computes transformations in both forward and backward directions. The weights of the hidden layers learn to transform input data into representation vectors. The AANN utilizes bidirectional neurons in hidden layers to transform input data into representation vectors. These weights serve as functions for both forward and reverse transformations, generating distinct functions. The forward pass involves passing n-dimensional feature vectors through the neural network to obtain an m-dimensional representation vector, which is then converted into a unit vector. The forward cost can be computed as the Euclidean distance or mean absolute. The forward cost J forward can be computed as either the Euclidean distance or the mean absolute difference between the unit representation vector Y and the one-hot-encoded-label vector Y. The direction cosines of the vector can be obtained by scaling every activation value in the representation vector by the inverse of the magnitude of the vector, resulting in a unit vector that corresponds to the direction of the original vector. The forward cost aims to bring this direction vector close to the ideal label coordinate axis, where input information is encoded as representation vectors of different magnitudes converge on it. This visualization shows how information is encoded along the label axis in various real-valued magnitude ranges. The visualization generated by interpolating values along 10 axes corresponding to digits in an MNIST dataset shows smooth transitions between different forms of a digit. The reverse pass of the AANN involves feeding representation vectors back into the network to compute the reverse cost. The AANN (Absolute Artificial Neural Network) aims to minimize the final cost by using the Backpropagation algorithm. This involves calculating forward and reverse costs, adjusting parameters with Adam optimization, and performing a single pass of the network. The AANN (Absolute Artificial Neural Network) minimizes cost using Backpropagation. Using ReLU as activation function leads to activations shooting to nan, causing issues in both forward and reverse directions. The AANN (Absolute Artificial Neural Network) minimizes cost using Backpropagation. Different activation functions lead to various outcomes in the network, affecting performance in both forward and reverse directions. The AANN architecture, trained on the MNIST dataset, achieved a classification accuracy of 99.86% on the train set and 97.43% on the dev set. The network also achieved an accuracy of 97.671% on the unseen test set. The research paper introduced the AANN architecture, achieving 97.671% accuracy on 28000 images. It emphasized evaluating the network's performance in both forward and reverse directions, proposing the Abs function as an activation function. Limited by hardware, experiments were conducted on the MNIST dataset. The AANN architecture encodes information in real number valued ranges across dedicated label axes in the representation space. Regularization functions can stretch these ranges to incorporate more information. The number of dimensions in learned representations can be controlled by setting axes to a single label. Future research could focus on an in-depth mathematical study of the Abs activation function. The AANN architecture offers new research opportunities for modifying network architectures like BID10 for semi-supervised learning. Further implications could be explored by applying these modifications to advanced architectures such as Conv-nets BID6 and Recurrent Nets with LSTM cells BID3."
