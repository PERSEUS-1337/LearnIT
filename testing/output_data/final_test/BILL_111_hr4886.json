Congress finds that Radio Free Asia (RFA) was authorized under the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994, operates as a surrogate news service in regions without free media, and aims to provide accurate and timely news. RFA is headquartered in Washington, DC, with additional offices in various locations around the world. Radio Free Asia (RFA) provides news and information to Asian countries with restricted press freedom to promote informed decision-making. Using a \"surrogate\" broadcasting model, RFA offers daily broadcasts in multiple languages despite government attempts to block transmissions. Since 2004, RFA has also delivered online news, facing challenges from countries that try to block its website. Despite attempts to block, monitor, and discourage access to RFA's website, the organization has successfully reached its online audiences through proxies, cutting-edge software, and active republication by its audience. RFA also provides forums for local opinions and experiences through various online platforms. Freedom House has noted a decline in press freedom globally, especially in Asia where RFA operates. RFA operates in Asia, where press freedom has not improved in the past five years. Independent media is limited or restricted, often serving the government's agenda. Congress funds RFA on a yearly basis, but its sunset provision hinders operations like hiring staff and negotiating agreements. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress recognizes the importance of public access to accurate information for government accountability, human rights protection, and democratic values. Radio Free Asia is crucial in providing a unique voice in Asia, especially as press freedom in the region faces challenges. Some Asian governments actively try to disrupt RFA's broadcasts and online presence. The US should support RFA and other entities for internet censorship circumvention. Permanently authorizing funding for Radio Free Asia would reflect concerns about increasing media censorship in the countries served, signal US support for a free press in Asia and worldwide, and enhance RFA's operations. Permanent authorization for Radio Free Asia is being amended under the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 to remove restrictions on funding availability after September 30, 2010. Subsections (f), (g), and (h) are also being reorganized."
