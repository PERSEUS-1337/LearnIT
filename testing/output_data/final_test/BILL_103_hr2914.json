    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FHA Multifamily Housing Emergency Disposition Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has a large inventory of multifamily housing projects, with an estimated loss of $11.9 billion due to mortgage foreclosures. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has a large inventory of multifamily housing projects, leading to increased costs. An emergency exists in disposing of these projects, requiring $7 billion in rental assistance to eliminate the backlog. The Department of Housing and Urban Development aims to streamline the disposal of multifamily housing projects by removing statutory requirements, encouraging assistance for residents through means other than rental assistance, and maintaining the low-income character of the projects during disposal. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY PROVISIONS. During the property disposition emergency, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has the authority to dispose of multifamily housing projects in accordance with this Act. Section 203 requirements of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 apply, with exceptions for waivers or inconsistencies with this Act. The Secretary can determine if any inconsistencies exist when disposing of subsidized or formerly subsidized multifamily housing projects. The Secretary can provide project-based or tenant-based rental assistance for subsidized multifamily housing projects under this Act, lasting up to 180 months for very low-income families. The Secretary may provide assistance to low-income families occupying a project upon its sale, with additional assistance based on market conditions. Additionally, the Secretary must ensure affordable rent charges for a specified period through means other than Section 8 assistance. The Secretary may encourage the sale of a multifamily housing project to a local nonprofit organization and provide project-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to facilitate its disposition. In cases of unsubsidized projects, the Secretary is not required to provide assistance under section 8 but may take specified actions. The Secretary may dispose of multifamily housing projects for uses related to low-income housing other than rental or cooperative use, such as homeownership opportunities, homeless shelters, and office space for social services providers. Additionally, the Secretary may allow other uses if it helps reduce the concentration of low-income housing opportunities. SEC. 4. DURATION OF EMERGENCY.\n\nA property disposition emergency under this Act is in effect from the enactment of the Act until the conclusion of the third fiscal year after enactment.\n\nSEC. 5. WAIVER OF DISPOSITION PLAN REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Secretary can waive section 203(e) provisions of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 for expedited multifamily housing project disposition.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"multifamily housing project,\" \"subsidized project,\" and \"formerly subsidized project\" according to specific criteria outlined in the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. This includes multifamily housing projects receiving project-based housing assistance payments under certain sections of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The terms \"low-income\" and \"very low-income\" are defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937. Section 203(i)(2)(E) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 is amended to include \"tenant-based\" before \"certificates.\""
