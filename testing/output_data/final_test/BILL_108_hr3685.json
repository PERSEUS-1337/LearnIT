    "content": "The Act titled \"High-Quality Education Act of 2003\" is established for the purpose of providing findings and objectives. The Congress finds that Tennessee's STAR project, initiated in the mid-1980s, demonstrated the benefits of reducing class size for early grade students. Research indicates that these benefits continue over time, with students in small classes showing improved achievements in subsequent years. Follow-up studies also reveal that high-school students who were in small classes in first grade experienced long-term benefits. The benefits of reducing class size for early grade students were demonstrated in Tennessee's STAR project in the mid-1980s. High-school students who were in small classes in first through third grades showed improved achievements, with better grades, more advanced courses, and higher test scores. Wisconsin's SAGE program also saw increased test scores in smaller first grade classes. Students in small classes were found to be about half a school year ahead by the end of fifth grade. In smaller classes, students are about half a school year ahead in core subjects like reading, language arts, math, and science. Studies show a positive link between reduced class size and improved student performance. Teachers in smaller classes can focus more on instruction and less on discipline, providing more individualized instruction. The purpose of this Act is to assist States in lowering class sizes to improve student performance, behavior, and overall school climate. Smaller classes lead to better identification of students needing help, increased participation, improved behavior, and reduced retention rates. Improved student behavior, human relations skills, increased participation in school events, a sense of community, and a better school climate are outcomes associated with small classes. The Act aims to help states reduce class sizes to enhance student performance, behavior, and school environment. The Secretary of Education may grant funds to eligible entities, defined as states or local educational agencies with class size reduction programs in public schools. Funding must be specifically allocated in the annual budget for the program. The annual budget must allocate funds for the program. The average class sizes in schools served by the agency are specified. Grants can only be used for constructing new classroom space, hiring teachers, or purchasing portable structures. The Secretary may not grant funds for long-term financing obligations or administrative costs. Priority may be given to schools with high poverty rates or larger class sizes. Matching funds are required for grants. The Secretary requires non-Federal contributions for grants, with a ratio of $2 for every $1 provided by the Secretary. Contributions can be in cash or in kind, excluding Federal Government assistance. To apply for a grant, submission is necessary. To apply for a grant under this section, an eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary with specific information required. The application should include certification of average core curriculum class sizes at schools served by the entity and the entity's expenditures for the class size reduction program. The eligible entity must submit an application with specific information required for the grant, including details of their class size reduction program, goals, intended use of funds, and progress in achieving program goals. The Secretary will establish a deadline for application submission. The term \"average core curriculum class size\" is defined as the number of students in the program. The term \"average core curriculum class size\" is the number of students in core curriculum classes, including subjects like Mathematics, Science, Reading, Social Studies, and Foreign Language. It is calculated based on the ratio of physical classrooms to students, regardless of the teacher-student ratio. The terms \"local educational agency\" and \"poverty line\" are defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary of Education is referred to as the \"Secretary.\" The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States and Indian tribes. The Secretary is responsible for making biannual payments. The Secretary will make biannual payments to grantees under this section, limited to 20% of the total appropriation for the fiscal year or $200,000,000, whichever is less."
