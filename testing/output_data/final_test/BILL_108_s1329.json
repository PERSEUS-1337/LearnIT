The Secretary of Transportation will establish a grant program for local rail line relocation projects to improve safety, traffic flow, and economic development in municipalities. States can receive grants for projects involving the relocation of rail lines to mitigate adverse effects of rail traffic. The grant program for local rail line relocation projects aims to improve safety, traffic flow, and economic development in municipalities. Projects must meet a costs-benefits requirement, considering factors such as the impact on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, and area commerce. The grant program for local rail line relocation projects considers factors such as the impact on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, and area commerce. The Secretary also considers the state's capability to fund the project without federal grant funding, allocation requirements, and equitable treatment of regions in the United States. Grants are limited to $20,000,000. The grant program for local rail line relocation projects awards grants of up to $20,000,000, with at least 50% of funds allocated in this manner. No more than 25% of the total amount available for a fiscal year can be used for one project. The federal share of a grant is 90% of project costs, with states required to contribute 10%. The contribution required for local rail line relocation projects can be paid in cash or in kind. In-kind contributions allowed include real or personal property, employee services based on costs, and project costs incurred before applying for a grant. The project requires in-kind contributions and costs incurred before applying for a grant to comply with statutory provisions. Costs defrayed by sources other than the municipality are not considered shared costs for the project. The municipality must meet certain conditions when using funds for a project, as determined by the Secretary. Multistate agreements can combine amounts for projects. Multistate agreements allow two or more States to combine grant amounts for projects that benefit all parties involved, as long as it does not violate any state laws. The Secretary will establish regulations for implementing this section, and the term 'State' includes political subdivisions. $350,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008 for carrying out these provisions. $350,000,000 authorized annually from 2004 to 2008 for multistate agreements benefiting multiple states. The Secretary of Transportation will issue temporary regulations by October 1, 2003, for the grant program under section 20154 of title 49, United States Code. Final regulations for the program must be issued by April 1, 2004."
