United Nations officials have proposed various ways to finance the organization, including international taxes and bonds. The United Nations Secretary General proposed an international tax to reduce financial dependence on Member States.

The United Nations lacks legal authority to impose taxes on US citizens. The OECD is trying to hinder tax competition between nations, which could undermine the competitive advantage of the US. The OECD's tax harmonization policies may allow foreign governments to tax income earned in the US. The US contributes a significant portion of the OECD's budget. The OECD's budget is influenced by the US, as it aims to prevent tax competition between nations.
