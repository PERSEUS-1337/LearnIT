The program aims to enhance work incentives for SSDI and SSI beneficiaries by providing choices in providers for employment services and expanding Medicare and Medicaid coverage for individuals with disabilities who are working. The program created a market for public and private providers known as employment networks for beneficiaries to assign their tickets to. The Ticket to Work program allows Social Security disability beneficiaries to assign their tickets to Employment Networks (ENs) in exchange for employment support services. ENs can receive payments from SSA based on the employment outcomes of ticket holders. This report provides an overview of the program's operation, including its components, regulations, and work incentive programs. The Ticket to Work program allows Social Security disability beneficiaries to assign their tickets to Employment Networks (ENs) for employment support services. SSA administers SSDI and SSI disability programs, providing benefits to individuals with disabilities who have worked and made contributions to the Social Security system. SSDI recipients become eligible for Medicare after a 24-month waiting period, while SSI is a means-tested program for low-income individuals with disabilities. Individuals receiving Social Security disability benefits must have countable resources of less than $2,000 and meet the definition of disability under the Social Security Act. Disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable impairment. The monthly substantial gainful activity thresholds for 2014 are $1,800 for individuals who are blind and $1,070 for individuals with other disabilities. These limits are adjusted annually based on average wage growth. Approximately 12.2 million beneficiaries collected monthly benefits in 2013. In 2013, 12.2 million beneficiaries collected SSDI or SSI benefits, totaling $146.8 billion in federal expenditures. Only 0.4% of SSDI beneficiaries left the program due to work, attributed to disincentives. Recipients risk losing benefits and health insurance if they attempt to work. Ticket to Work legislation aimed to address these issues. Before the passage of Ticket to Work legislation, advocates argued that work incentives for individuals with disabilities were complex and discouraging. Return-to-work legislation became a focus of legislative proposals and the Clinton Administration's strategy to increase employment among individuals with disabilities. President William J. Clinton established the Presidential Task Force on the Employment of Adults with Disabilities (PTFEAD) in 1998 to increase employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. PTFEAD's recommendations led to the full funding of Ticket to Work programs in the FY2000 budget request. Senator James M. Jeffords introduced the legislation in the 106th Congress. Senator James M. Jeffords introduced the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (S. 331) and Representative Rick Lazio introduced the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (H.R. 1180) in the 106th Congress. The legislation, which became P.L. 106-170, provided vouchers to beneficiaries for rehabilitation services, payments to employment service providers based on outcomes, and increased access to services for employment. It received bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Clinton on December 17, 1999. The Ticket to Work program (Title I of H.R. 1180) provided vouchers for rehabilitation services and payments to employment service providers based on outcomes. The Congressional Budget Office estimated modest gains in Social Security beneficiaries' future participation in the program, projecting a reduction in direct spending by $53 million for SSDI and $32 million for SSI programs by FY2009. The Ticket to Work program aims to reduce direct spending by $53 million for SSDI and $32 million for SSI programs by providing vouchers for rehabilitation services and payments to employment service providers. Beneficiaries receive a \"ticket\" to access services from approved providers to help them enter or re-enter the workforce. The program is managed by two contracted program managers under SSA supervision. The Ticket to Work program, implemented in 2002, aimed to reduce spending for SSDI and SSI programs by providing vouchers for rehabilitation services. It was phased in nationally over three years and expanded to all states by 2004. In July 2008, regulatory adjustments were made to provide greater financial incentives to employment networks (ENs) and allow more beneficiaries to participate, including those with medical conditions expected to improve. The Ticket to Work program, implemented in 2002, aimed to reduce spending for SSDI and SSI programs by providing vouchers for rehabilitation services. In July 2008, regulatory changes were made to allow more beneficiaries to participate in the program. A \"ticket\" is issued to eligible beneficiaries authorizing payment for employment services and support. Participation is voluntary, and eligibility terminates when SSDI or SSI benefits end. Entities interested in becoming Employment Networks (ENs) can apply by completing a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to SSA's Employment Networks Contract Team. ENs are responsible for providing employment services, VR services, and other support services to individuals with assigned tickets. SSA selects and enters into agreements with these ENs, who work with beneficiaries to develop individual work plans (IWP) for informed choice in selecting services. The Ticket to Work program requires SSA to contract with Program Managers (PMs) to assist in administering the program. Maximus, a consulting firm, was contracted as the PM for the Ticket program in 2000. They were also awarded a contract in 2008 to serve as the Ticket Program Data Operations Center Manager (TPDOCM). Approved Employment Networks (ENs) provide vocational rehabilitation services and other support to beneficiaries in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. ENs are selected to help beneficiaries choose an employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve it. The list of approved ENs can be found on the Ticket to Work website or by contacting Maximus. The Ticket Program Data Operations Center Manager (TPDOCM) is responsible for maintaining electronic systems supporting daily ticket operations and providing system support services to SSA. Program Managers (PMs) are organizations with expertise in VR or employment services, responsible for providing information to beneficiaries, recruiting ENs, ensuring service availability, and ensuring EN compliance. Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a PM contract to serve as TPDOCM. On September 29, 2010, Booz Allen Hamilton and Maximus were awarded five-year PM contracts for managing different aspects of the Ticket program. ENs and state VR agencies can choose between Milestone-Outcome and Outcome-only payment systems for achieving employment outcomes. ENs use the ticket to claim payment from SSA for services provided. ENs use the ticket to claim payment from SSA for services provided to ticket holders. They are paid based on payment option limits, with Milestone-Outcome system providing payments of $1,357 for 2014 for completing Phase 1 milestones. ENs can also receive Phase 2 milestone payments for SSDI or SSI ticket holders. ENs can receive payments based on completion of Phase 2 milestones for SSDI or SSI ticket holders with earnings above the SGA level. They can receive up to 60 outcome payments for SSI ticket holders and 36 payments for SSDI ticket holders when the ticket holder has earnings for zero cash benefits. ENs can receive up to $23,680 for SSI ticket holders and $24,557 for SSDI ticket holders for completing all Milestone-Outcome phases. Under the Outcome-only payment system, ENs can receive payments for ticket holders with earnings for zero cash benefits, up to 36 payments at $758 a month for SSDI ticket holders and up to 60 payments at $436 a month for SSI ticket holders. The Partnership Plus program allows state VR agencies and ENs to work together to help ticket holders achieve successful employment outcomes. SSA will compensate both agencies sequentially for their services. State VR agencies can be reimbursed under the traditional cost-reimbursement system after service delivery, while ENs can receive payments based on completion of milestones for ticket holders with earnings above the SGA level. The Partnership Plus program allows state VR agencies and ENs to collaborate in assisting ticket holders in achieving successful employment outcomes. ENs can provide ongoing job retention and employment supports to ticket holders, becoming eligible for Phase 2 Milestone-Outcome or Outcome-only payments based on earnings. A ticket period ends under various circumstances outlined by SSA regulations, including the beneficiary no longer making timely progress towards self-supporting employment. During the active ticket period, beneficiaries must show progress towards self-supporting employment or degree completion. SSA conducts timely progress reviews to assess this progress. Beneficiaries have up to 12 months to prepare for employment or school after receiving the ticket and must actively participate in their plans. After 12 months, they need to demonstrate increasing earnings or college credit completion to continue using the ticket. Regulations outline measures to assess beneficiaries' progress. The regulations require ticket holders to meet specific criteria at different time intervals to continue using the ticket, such as working above certain levels or completing college credits. The regulations require ticket holders to meet specific criteria at different time intervals to continue using the ticket, such as earning sufficient income or completing a 4-year degree program. Ticket holders can also place their ticket in inactive status for up to 24 months without penalty, but they will not be protected against CDRs during this period. P.L. 106-170 included provisions to enhance work opportunities for individuals with disabilities, such as reducing work disincentives, establishing SSA demonstrations, creating an advisory panel, and extending the time period for reinstatement of benefits for beneficiaries who return to work. Provisional benefits may be provided for up to six months if income falls below SGA within five years. The P.L. 106-170 allows for up to six months of provisional benefits while applications are reviewed. SSA can award cooperative agreements to organizations for benefit planning and assistance. WIPA programs offer employment planning support to Social Security disability beneficiaries through community-based organizations. Each WIPA project has Community Work Incentives Coordinators who refer beneficiaries to employment support programs. The Benefits Planning Assistance and Outreach (BPAO) program, predecessor to WIPA, focused on assisting beneficiaries with work options. WIPA funding expired in FY2011 but was renewed in FY2013 under P.L. 113-6. SSA can award grants to state protection and advocacy systems under the PABSS program. The PABSS program provides grants to state protection and advocacy systems to offer vocational rehabilitation, employment, advocacy, and other services to SSDI or SSI beneficiaries for gaining employment. States receive funds based on a percentage of the amount appropriated, with minimum payments set at $100,000 or one-third of 1%. Grantees must submit annual reports on services provided to individuals. SSA awards grants to protection and advocacy systems in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The PABSS program provides grants to state protection and advocacy systems to offer vocational rehabilitation, employment, advocacy, and other services to SSDI or SSI beneficiaries for gaining employment. SSA conducts research projects to improve services for Social Security beneficiaries, potentially leading to legislative changes for better coordination between SSA and states. The SSA has the authority to conduct demonstrations on alternative methods of treating work activity for individuals receiving disability benefits under SSDI. The Benefit Offset Pilot Demonstration (BOPD) was initiated to gradually reduce benefits as beneficiaries earn above the SGA level, aiming to reduce barriers to work and improve beneficiary outcomes. The Benefit Offset Pilot Demonstration (BOPD) aimed to reduce barriers to work for SSDI beneficiaries by gradually reducing benefits as they earn above the SGA level. The project informed the development of the Benefit Offset National Demonstration (BOND) project, which started in 2011 and ended enrollment in 2012. A final report on BOND is expected in 2017, with 13.6 million active tickets issued to eligible beneficiaries by December 2013. Tickets were issued to beneficiaries at the start of the Ticket to Work program, with 319,972 tickets (2.4%) activated. Most tickets were assigned to state VR agencies rather than ENs. Currently, there are 666 ENs providing services to ticket recipients, with 594 (89.2%) having tickets assigned to them. As of December 31, 2013, $138.1 million in total payments have been made to ENs in the Ticket to Work program. Studies have shown low participation rates among eligible SSDI and SSI recipients, with only 4.1% participating in 2010. This has raised concerns among policy makers. Low participation rates among SSDI and SSI recipients in the Ticket to Work program in 2010 have been attributed to fear of losing benefits and lack of awareness about work incentives programs. The WIPA program was authorized to provide counseling on how work affects benefits to address these barriers. The WIPA program provides support to beneficiaries enrolled in their services, but many Social Security disability beneficiaries do not receive the ongoing assistance intended. ENs are compensated by SSA based on employment outcomes, with autonomy to choose clients and a disincentive to accept those deemed unemployable without costly services. Some ENs face upfront costs before receiving payments from SSA. ENs provide employment services to ticket holders before receiving payments from SSA. They may focus on individuals needing less assistance, while those with severe disabilities may be denied services. SSA reports annually on beneficiaries whose benefits were terminated due to work, but return-to-work rates for disabled individuals are better understood over several years rather than monthly or annually. A longitudinal study found that 3.7% of SSDI beneficiaries left the disability rolls within 10 years, which is more than 7 times the published SSA statistic. Ticket to Work participants were over two-and-a-half times more likely to leave the disability rolls. Return-to-work rates vary based on age and impairment, with younger beneficiaries having higher rates. Individuals with sensory impairments, such as the deaf and blind, are more likely to find employment compared to those with severe physical or neurological impairments. Ticket to Work legislation aimed to increase employment service providers, but most tickets are assigned to state VR agencies. Age and recent work experience play a role in the likelihood of returning to work. The Ticket to Work program aimed to increase employment service providers, but most tickets are assigned to state VR agencies, reducing the incentive for new ENs to enter the market. Ticket holders can choose between ENs and state VR agencies, with the majority opting for the latter. The introduction of Partnership Plus in July 2008 allowed ticket holders to seek assistance from state VR agencies, which are better equipped to provide intensive vocational rehabilitation services. The Ticket to Work program has seen growth in the number of ENs and ticket holders assigning tickets to them, but most ticket holders still prefer working with state VR agencies. A 2011 audit by GAO identified deficiencies in the program, including a lack of managerial oversight of ENs and TPRs performed by SSA on ticket holders. The number of ENs providing services and SSA payments to them increased significantly between FY2007 and July 2010. SSA payments to ENs and ticket holders increased due to regulatory changes in July 2008, with some ENs concentrating payments among a small minority. GAO found issues with shared payments between ENs and ticket holders, where ENs marketed these payments as work-support. The GAO found deficiencies in the Employment Networks (ENs) system, where ENs acted as \"middlemen\" for SSA payments to ticket holders. There were issues with maintaining up-to-date EN listings, accounting for services provided, and vetting unqualified ENs. SSA temporarily suspended progress reviews at the request of ENs in 2009, leading to a lack of oversight for ticket holders. The GAO found that suspended TPRs in 2009 allowed some ticket holders to avoid accountability for seeking employment support, leading to continued payments from SSA without oversight. Although TPRs have been reinstated, the backlog may overwhelm SSA's capacity to address the issue effectively. Between 2002 and 2004, SSA implemented the Ticket to Work program in three phases. A GAO audit in 2005 revealed that less than 1% of beneficiaries assigned their tickets to ENs. By 2008, SSA made changes to the payment system to attract more providers to the program. SSA made changes to the payment system for the Ticket to Work program in 2008 to increase incentives for ENs, resulting in a significant rise in the number of ENs participating from 818 in 2007 to 1,600 in 2011. The percentage of ENs receiving payments increased from 23.0% in 2008 to 34.6% in 2011. The share of ENs accepting ticket assignments also rose from 51% in July 2008 to 60% in December 2011. The number of new tickets assigned under the EN payment system saw a significant increase, with a 566.7% rise from 2007 to 2010. The use of Milestone-Outcome payment system increased significantly after 2008 regulatory changes, while Outcome-Only system decreased. The changes included increasing the number and maximum payable amount under Milestone-Outcome system. The impact on employment outcomes remains inconclusive due to the economic recession during 2007-2009. The 2013 Ticket to Work evaluation report from Mathematica found that post-2008 regulatory changes led to participants working fewer hours per month, but the likelihood of employment did not significantly differ. Participants with a ticket assigned to an Employment Network (EN) were employed longer under the new payment system. The Ticket to Work program changed how the SSA interacts with Social Security disability beneficiaries. Ticket to Work tasks SSA with facilitating a voluntary return-to-work program for individuals unable to work. Challenges include increasing participation rates and expanding ENs. SSA addresses issues through program changes based on assessments. Integration of disability systems, tailored rehabilitation programs, and increased return-to-work incentives are suggested for a more effective system. Some research suggests that providing immediate medical and rehabilitative support after the onset of a disability may prevent worsening over time and help individuals return to work sooner. Recent attachment to the workforce is crucial for disabled individuals to re-enter employment following a disabling condition. Individuals with disabilities face challenges in returning to gainful employment due to factors like outdated skills, inadequate accommodations, and a lack of motivation. The recent economic downturn has led to higher unemployment rates for both disabled and nondisabled individuals. To access health insurance, rehabilitative services, and employment supports through the Ticket to Work program, disabled individuals must navigate a lengthy application process with the SSA. Claim denials and appeals can further prolong the process, with SSDI claimants facing a mandatory five-month wait from disability-onset. The application process for disability benefits can be lengthy, hindering individuals from accessing necessary services to help them return to work. Congress may consider expanding non-monetary benefits to SSDI and SSI applicants to address this issue. This delay in benefits approval may lead to increased reliance on cash payments and untreated medical conditions. Early intervention with targeted support could help individuals transition back to work sooner. Early intervention with targeted support after the onset of a disability can help individuals quickly return to work or continue working part-time, reducing the need for full disability benefits. State VR agencies, favored by ticket holders, are well-positioned to offer necessary services and support beneficiaries, potentially preventing the need for SSA to provide full disability benefits. State VR agencies are reimbursed for services provided to clients, with the option to act as Employment Networks (ENs) under the Ticket to Work program. ENs have flexibility in selecting ticket holders and are more likely to serve those who are working or ready to work. This has led to discrepancies in service approaches and revenue sharing, potentially deviating from the program's goals. The Ticket to Work program's revenue sharing provisions are not aligned with program goals, and the SSA lacks a system to measure EN performance as required by law. Congress may need to authorize the SSA to develop a system to ensure ticket holders receive accurate information on EN services, assess if EN incentives are in line with program goals, and establish performance measures for employment outcomes. Consideration should also be given to how the SSA measures return-to-work rates for beneficiaries whose benefits are terminated due to work. The Ticket to Work program's revenue sharing provisions are not aligned with program goals, and the SSA lacks a system to measure EN performance as required by law. Congress may need to authorize the SSA to develop a system to ensure ticket holders receive accurate information on EN services, assess if EN incentives are in line with program goals, and establish performance measures for employment outcomes. Supplementing cross-sectional data with a longitudinal measurement of return-to-work rates of annual SSDI and SSI cohorts could provide a more accurate picture of how SSA's work incentives enable individuals with disabilities to return to the workforce. The Ticket to Work program provides Phase 1 payments to Employment Networks (ENs) based on milestones related to beneficiaries' earnings from work exceeding the Trial Work Period (TWP) threshold. Milestones include working for one month, working for three months within a six-month period, and working for six months within a 12-month period, with earnings above the TWP threshold. Phase 2 Milestones involve ENs becoming eligible for payments as beneficiaries' earnings progress towards self-sufficiency. The earnings standard increases to the SGA threshold ($1,070/month or $1,800/month if blind for 2014) for Phase 2 milestones. Monthly payments to ENs are 36% of the respective PCB for SSDI ($1,130.89 for 2014) or SSI ($650.44 for 2014). ENs can potentially collect additional monthly payments in an \"outcome\" phase for ticket holders that have sustained earnings at the SGA level long enough to no longer receive cash payments from SSA. ENs can receive additional payments equal to 36% of the respective PCB for up to 36 payments for SSDI ticket holders. Under the Outcome-only payment system, ENs can receive payments for ticket holders with earnings at a zero cash benefit status. Payments can be made for up to 36 months for SSDI ticket holders and up to 60 months for SSI ticket holders, equal to 67% of the PCB for each."
