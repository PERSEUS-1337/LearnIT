    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act\". The Congress finds it timely to honor the 50 States of the United States and promote knowledge about their history and geography. The circulating coinage has not been modernized in 25 years. A commemorative 25-cent coin program could generate significant earnings for the Treasury. The Congress plans to contribute $5.1 billion to the United States Treasury to reduce national debt borrowing. Additionally, they propose a commemorative circulating coin program to encourage collecting State-themed coins at face value. The Congress plans to issue redesigned quarter dollars over a 10-year period to commemorate each of the 50 states. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to redesign and issue quarter dollar coins in commemoration of each of the 50 states starting in 1999. The coins will have designs emblematic of the states on the reverse side. The Secretary may continue to mint and issue quarter dollars in 1999 with the previous design and the year '1998' inscription. The redesign and issuance of quarter dollar coins in commemoration of each of the 50 states starting in 1999 will feature designs emblematic of the states on the reverse side. The designs for the coins will be emblematic of 5 states selected in the order of ratification of the Constitution or admission into the Union during each year of the 10-year program. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine the number of quarter dollar coins to be issued with each of the 5 designs selected for each year. The selection of the 50 designs for quarter dollars will be done in consultation with the Governor of the State being commemorated. The designs for quarter dollars may be submitted and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The selection and approval process will be developed by the Secretary, who may include participation from State officials, artists, engravers, and the general public. The Secretary ensures dignified designs for quarter dollars, prohibiting frivolous or inappropriate designs and any head and shoulders portraits. All coins minted under this subsection are considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities, with some containing 90% silver. Silver for minting coins will be sourced from available resources. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue quarter dollar coins emblematic of newly admitted states during a 10-year period, in addition to regular quarter dollar coins. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 23, 1997. Attest: ROBIN H. CARLE, Clerk. By Jeff Trandahl, Deputy Clerk."
