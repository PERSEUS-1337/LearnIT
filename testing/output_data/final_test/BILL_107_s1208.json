    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2001\". It includes findings related to the prevention of ecstasy use. Congress finds that the illegal importation and use of MDMA (Ecstasy) has increased significantly in the past 3 years, leading to potential long-lasting damage to the brain's serotonin system and learning and memory functions. Greater emphasis is needed on educating young people about the negative health effects of Ecstasy due to its popularity and marketability. The dangers of Ecstasy lie in its false reputation as a safe drug, leading to increased illegal importation and use. Steps needed include educating law enforcement and healthcare professionals, funding research on its health effects, and implementing government initiatives. Grants for Ecstasy abuse prevention prioritize communities combating club drug use through measures like restricting rave clubs, increasing law enforcement on Ecstasy, and seizing lands under nuisance abatement laws. States may receive priority grants for combating Ecstasy and other club drugs in high-intensity drug trafficking areas. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy will use funds to combat MDMA trafficking in high intensity drug trafficking areas by assisting law enforcement initiatives with investigative costs, intelligence enhancements, technology improvements, and training. Authorization of appropriations includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The Director will apportion funds for activities in high intensity drug trafficking areas based on threat assessments. Federal funds received must supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds for these activities. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy will ensure the national youth antidrug media campaign addresses the abuse of MDMA and emerging drugs among young people in the US. $7,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for 2003-2005. Funds will be allocated for an MDMA drug test meeting Federal Workplace standards, and for a report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse will conduct research on the effects of MDMA use on health, including physiological and psychological effects like changes in body temperature, cardiovascular stimulation, muscle tension, and mood alterations. The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse will conduct research on the effects of MDMA use on health, including short-term effects like confusion, depression, sleep problems, severe anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, and amnesia, as well as long-term effects on memory and cognitive functions. A report will be submitted to Congress by January 1, 2003, with an authorization of $1,500,000 for this research. SEC. 8. INTERAGENCY ECSTASY/CLUB DRUG TASK FORCE. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy establishes a Task Force on Ecstasy/MDMA and Emerging Club Drugs to design, implement, and evaluate federal education, prevention, and treatment practices. The task force includes law enforcement and substance abuse experts and reports findings to Congress. The Task Force on Ecstasy/MDMA and Emerging Club Drugs, comprised of law enforcement, substance abuse, judicial, and public health professionals, evaluates federal practices for education, prevention, and treatment. It identifies resources for implementation and makes recommendations to Congress and the President in line with the National Drug Control Strategy. The Task Force on Ecstasy/MDMA and Emerging Club Drugs evaluates federal practices for education, prevention, and treatment in line with the National Drug Control Strategy. The task force meets every 6 months and will terminate 3 years after enactment of the Act, with an authorization of $1,000,000 for implementation."
