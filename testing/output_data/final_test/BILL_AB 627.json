The curr_chunk defines terms related to health benefit plans, including maximum allowable cost, obsolete drugs, and pharmacies. The curr_chunk defines \"Pharmacy\" and \"Pharmacy audit\" as related to prescription drug records audits conducted by carriers or pharmacy benefits managers for health benefit plan beneficiaries. The curr_chunk defines a \"Pharmacy benefit manager\" as a person or entity that manages prescription drug coverage for carriers, health benefit plan sponsors, or third-party payers. This includes processing claims, drug utilization review, prior authorization requests, appeals, network pharmacy contracting, and cost control. Section 4432 of the Business and Professions Code requires contracts between pharmacies and carriers or pharmacy benefit managers to comply with specified provisions. Section 4440 mandates that pharmacy benefit managers reimbursing pharmacies on a maximum allowable cost basis must adhere to certain requirements. (b) A pharmacy benefit manager must include in contracts, starting January 1, 2016, information on the sources used to determine maximum allowable cost for drugs. They must also provide the most current maximum allowable cost list to pharmacies upon request in a user-friendly format. Drugs can only be included on the list if specific criteria are met. The pharmacy benefit manager must review and adjust the maximum allowable cost of drugs on a list using current data sources at least once every seven days. The drugs must meet specific criteria to be included on the list. A pharmacy benefit manager must have a process for pharmacies to appeal the maximum allowable cost for drugs on a list. Pharmacies can appeal if the cost is below what other pharmacies pay or if the drug doesn't meet requirements. The pharmacy benefit manager must have an appeal process for pharmacies regarding the maximum allowable cost of drugs. Pharmacies can appeal if the cost is below market price or if the drug does not meet requirements. If an appeal is denied, the pharmacy benefit manager must provide the reason for denial and suggest an equivalent drug with a lower cost. If an appeal is upheld by a pharmacy benefit manager, the maximum allowable cost of the appealed drug for the appealing pharmacy and similar pharmacies must be adjusted within one day. The appealing pharmacy can resubmit the claim for corrected reimbursement. Contracting pharmacies are prohibited from disclosing maximum allowable cost information received from pharmacy benefit managers."
