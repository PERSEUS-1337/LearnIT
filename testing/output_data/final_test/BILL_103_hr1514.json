    "content": "The Act titled \"Expedited Consideration of Proposed Revenue Amendments Act of 1993\" allows for the expedited consideration of certain proposed revenue amendments. It amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to facilitate this process. The Act allows the President to propose the repeal of provisions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The President must transmit a special message to Congress within 3 days of a law amending the Code, proposing to repeal specific amendments. Procedures for expedited consideration are outlined for Congress to act on the proposed repeal. The majority or minority leader of the House of Congress introduces the draft bill or joint resolution accompanying a special message within three days. If not done, any Member of the House may introduce it after the third day of continuous session. The bill is then referred to the Committee on Ways and Means or Finance, which must report it without substantive revision within seven days. The bill or joint resolution must be reported by the Committee on Ways and Means or Finance within seven days of receipt of the special message. If the committee fails to report it within that time, they will be discharged from consideration, and the bill will be placed on the calendar for a vote within 10 days of introduction. If passed, the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate will handle the bill accordingly. The bill or joint resolution must be engrossed, certified, and transmitted to the other House of Congress on the same day it is agreed to. It will then be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means or Finance, which must report it within seven days without substantive revision. If the committee fails to do so, the bill will be placed on the calendar for a vote within 10 days. The bill or joint resolution must be reported by the committee within a specified period, or it will be automatically discharged. A vote on final passage must be taken within 10 days of transmission to the House, and if agreed upon, it will be certified and transmitted to the other House for further consideration. The House of Representatives must consider a bill or joint resolution within 10 days of transmission. Debate on the bill or joint resolution shall not exceed 4 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Amendments to the motion to proceed are not allowed, and a motion to limit debate is not debatable. The House of Representatives must consider a bill or joint resolution within 10 days of transmission. Debate on the bill or joint resolution shall not exceed 4 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Limiting debate is not debatable, and appeals from decisions of the Chair shall be decided without debate. Consideration of a bill or joint resolution shall be governed by the Rules of the House of Representatives. A motion in the Senate to proceed to the consideration of a bill or joint resolution is privileged and not debatable. Debate in the Senate on a bill or joint resolution under this section shall not exceed 10 hours, divided between the majority leader and the minority leader. Debate on any debatable motion or appeal shall be limited to 1 hour, divided between the mover and the manager of the bill. The manager of the bill or joint resolution can allot additional time to Senators during the consideration of any debatable motion or appeal. Amendments are prohibited for bills or joint resolutions considered under this section in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The subsection prohibits the suspension of its application by unanimous consent in either House of Congress. Definitions clarify that a session continuity is broken only by adjournment sine die, excluding days of adjournment over 3 days. Amendments are made to Section 904 of the Act, including changes to subsections (a) and (d). Additionally, Section 1011 of the Act is amended. Section 1011 of the Act is amended to update paragraph numbers and references. Section 1015 is also amended to reflect the changes in paragraph numbers and references.
