    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ALS Registry Act\". The ALS Registry Act acknowledges the following key findings about ALS: it is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with unknown causes, the average life expectancy is 2 to 5 years post-diagnosis, only one FDA-approved drug offers limited benefits, there is no cure, and thousands are diagnosed annually in the US. Several ALS disease registries and databases exist in the United States and worldwide, including the SOD1 database, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke repository, and the Department of Veterans Affairs ALS Registry. A national system to collect and store information on ALS prevalence and incidence in the US is lacking, but Congress allocated funds to the CDC in 2006 and 2007 to start a nationwide ALS registry. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have initiated pilot projects since 2006 to establish a national ALS registry. This registry aims to identify ALS incidence and prevalence, collect important data for ALS research, promote better understanding of the disease, and gather information on genetic and environmental factors contributing to ALS. The ALS registry aims to collect and disseminate research findings on environmental, genetic, and other causes of ALS and related motor neuron disorders, provide information on research studies for patients, maintain data on clinical specialists and trials, and enhance efforts to find treatments and a cure for ALS. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section for the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a national registry for collecting data on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron disorders that can be confused with ALS. The national registry established under the Public Health Service Act aims to collect data on ALS and other motor neuron disorders, including incidence, prevalence, environmental factors, demographics, and family history of individuals diagnosed with the disease. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry will address family history, motor neuron disorders, and other relevant matters as recommended. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry shall be composed of members appointed by the Secretary, representing national health associations focusing on ALS, neurodegenerative diseases, and the National Institutes of Health. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry includes representatives from various organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients with ALS or their family members, clinicians, epidemiologists, geneticists, and statisticians. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry includes representatives from various organizations and individuals with an interest in developing and maintaining the registry. The committee reviews information and makes recommendations to the Secretary on the development, maintenance, data collection, storage, use, and availability of the registry. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry reviews information about diseases affecting motor neurons essential for ALS study and cure. They submit recommendations to the Secretary within a year of establishment. Grants may be awarded for data collection and analysis despite committee recommendations. The National ALS Registry collaborates with public and private entities to collect data on ALS and related motor neuron disorders. It coordinates with existing data systems and registries to enhance surveillance efforts. The National ALS Registry collaborates with various organizations to collect data on ALS and related disorders, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mayo Clinic, Emory University, Department of Veterans Affairs ALS Registry, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Human Genetics Resource Center. The National ALS Registry collaborates with various organizations to collect data on ALS and related disorders from Disease Registry studies in multiple states, State-based ALS registries like the Massachusetts ALS Registry, the National Vital Statistics System, and other relevant databases recommended by the Advisory Committee. Research access to ALS data is provided as recommended by the Advisory Committee. The Secretary shall ensure that information obtained under subsection (a) is shared with the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs, in accordance with privacy regulations. The term 'national voluntary health association' refers to a non-profit organization with chapters nationwide. Authorization of appropriations for this section includes $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and $16,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2012. The House of Representatives passed the bill on October 16, 2007."
