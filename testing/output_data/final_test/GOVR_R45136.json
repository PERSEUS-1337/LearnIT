    "content": "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123) was enacted on February 9, 2018, extending appropriations for federal agencies and programs through March 23, 2018. It includes FY2018 supplemental appropriations, debt limit increase, tax provisions, and changes to mandatory spending programs. Division E of BBA 2018, titled the ACCESS Act, affects programs like Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, public health programs, and MIECHV. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123) extended appropriations for federal agencies and programs through March 23, 2018. Division E of BBA 2018, known as the ACCESS Act, impacts programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, public health programs, and MIECHV. The report provides detailed information on provisions related to CHIP, public health extenders, MIECHV, and Medicaid. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended funding for federal programs, including CHIP, public health extenders, MIECHV, and Medicaid. CHIP provides health coverage for low-income children and pregnant women. Funding for FY2018 CHIP allotments to states was initially lacking but was later provided through various continuing resolutions. P.L. 115-120 extended federal CHIP funding through FY2023 and other related provisions. BBA 2018 extends CHIP funding and related provisions through FY2027, reducing federal spending by $0.3 billion and increasing revenues by $4.6 billion, for a net savings of $4.9 billion. It also extends funding for public health programs through mandatory appropriations. BBA 2018 extends funding for various programs through FY2018 and FY2019, including Special Diabetes Programs, Health Professions Opportunity Grant Program, and National Health Service Corps. It also makes programmatic changes to programs such as the Family-to-Family Health Information Program and the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program. Legislation had been introduced for some programs, but long-term funding extensions were not enacted prior to BBA 2018. The BBA 2018 extends funding for various programs through FY2018 and FY2019, including the MIECHV program which provides grants for early childhood home visiting. The law reduces funding to the Public Health and Prevention Fund to offset costs. The CBO estimates a net increase of $8.0 billion in federal spending from FY2018 to FY2027 for public health provisions. Eligible entities must track program performance and conduct a statewide needs assessment. The BBA 2018 extends funding for programs like the MIECHV program, which requires eligible entities to track performance and conduct a statewide needs assessment. The law also designates data exchange standards for reporting and allows for some funding to be used for pay-for-outcomes initiatives. The CBO estimates a $2.0 billion increase in federal spending over FY2018 to FY2027. The BBA 2018 includes provisions that modify Medicaid DSH allotments, TPL rules, Medicaid eligibility criteria, rebate obligations for line-extension drugs, and rescind funds from the Medicaid Improvement Fund. These provisions are estimated to reduce federal spending by $11.3 billion over FY2018 through FY2027. Table 1 provides a summary of the provisions under Division E of BBA 2018 for CHIP, public health, the MIECHV program, and Medicaid. The BBA 2018 includes provisions modifying various aspects of federal healthcare programs, such as Medicaid DSH allotments, TPL rules, eligibility criteria, rebate obligations, and funds from the Medicaid Improvement Fund. Specific details on CHIP funding history and legislation are also provided. The BBA 2018 includes provisions modifying federal healthcare programs, such as Medicaid DSH allotments, TPL rules, eligibility criteria, rebate obligations, and funds from the Medicaid Improvement Fund. The CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 provided funding for FY2016 and FY2017, with additional funding for FY2018 through FY2023. Annual appropriations increase from $21.5 billion in FY2018 to $25.9 billion in FY2022, with a combination of semiannual and one-time appropriations for FY2023. Federal CHIP funding is extended for FY2024 through FY2027 under SSA Section 2104(a). Funding amounts for FY2024 through FY2026 are unspecified. The funding for FY2027 for CHIP is structured with semiannual appropriations of $7.65 billion each, along with a one-time appropriation. States are reimbursed by the federal government for a portion of their CHIP expenditures up to state-specific annual limits. Allotments are federal funds allocated to each state for their CHIP expenses, with two formulas used to determine state allotments. State CHIP allotment funds are provided annually and available for two years, with authorization extended through FY2023 by P.L. 115-120. In odd and even years, state CHIP allotments are determined based on federal allotments or state spending from the prior year. Allotment amounts are adjusted for growth in National Health Expenditures and child population. CHIPRA established the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund with an initial deposit of $2.1 billion for FY2009. Funding for FY2024 through FY2027 maintains the odd- and even-year allotment formulas. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established under CHIPRA with an initial deposit of $2.1 billion for FY2009. Payments from the fund are made to states with funding shortfalls and CHIP enrollment exceeding target levels. The fund's funding mechanism is extended for FY2024 through FY2027, and in some cases, federal CHIP funding is used to finance Medicaid expenditures. Prior to the enactment of BBA 2018, FY2023 was the last year in which the qualifying states option was authorized. Section 50101(d) extends the qualifying states option under SSA Section 2105(g)(4) for FY2024 through FY2027. Eleven states are allowed to use their CHIP allotment funds to finance the difference between the Medicaid and CHIP matching rates for Medicaid-eligible children in families with income above 133% of the federal poverty level. This provision is referred to as the qualifying state's option. The Express Lane eligibility option, created by CHIPRA, allows states to use findings from specified agencies to determine eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP. This option has been extended through legislation, most recently by P.L. 115-120, until FY2023. Section 50101(e) further extends this option for FY2024 through FY2027. Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP is determined by both programs. Statewide upper-income eligibility thresholds for CHIP-funded child coverage vary significantly across states, ranging from 170% to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) as of January 2017. CHIP enrollment is mainly concentrated among lower-income families, with 99.4% of child enrollees having annual income at or below 300% of FPL. States are required to maintain Medicaid programs with the same eligibility standards until January 1, 2014, for adults and through September 30, 2019, under the ACA maintenance of effort (MOE) provisions. The ACA requires states to maintain income eligibility levels for CHIP children until September 30, 2019, to receive federal Medicaid funds. Non-compliance results in the loss of all federal Medicaid funds. The MOE requirement affects CHIP Medicaid expansion and separate CHIP programs differently. States may impose waiting lists or enrollment caps to limit CHIP expenditures. After September 1, 2015, states can enroll CHIP-eligible children in qualified health plans in the health insurance exchanges. If a state's CHIP allotment is insufficient, procedures must be established to screen children for Medicaid eligibility and enroll them if eligible. For children not eligible for Medicaid, procedures must be established to enroll them in qualified health plans certified by the Secretary of HHS. P.L. 115-120 extended the Medicaid and CHIP MOE requirements for children until FY2023. The Medicaid and CHIP MOE requirements apply to children in families with income less than 300% of FPL until FY2023. States can adjust eligibility for children with income over 300% of FPL without losing federal funds. MOE requirements for children are extended from FY2024 to FY2027. SSA Section 1139A authorizes pediatric quality measurement activities under Medicaid and CHIP. The HHS Secretary must establish a Pediatric Quality Measures Program by January 1, 2011. The Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) was established by January 1, 2011, to identify measure gaps, award grants for development, and revise core measures. States must submit annual reports on child health quality measures. The Secretary awarded grants for demonstration projects to improve children's healthcare quality between FY2009 and FY2013. Additionally, a program to encourage the development of a model electronic health record for children was established by January 1, 2010. The Institute of Medicine developed a report on child health status and quality, with funding appropriated for the Pediatric Quality Measures Program. Funding extensions were made for specific sections in subsequent years, with additional appropriations for carrying out child health quality measures. MACRA also allocated funds for carrying out child health quality measures in FY2016 through FY2017. Section 3003(b) of P.L. 115-120 appropriated $90 million for FY2018 through FY2023 for SSA Section 1139A activities. $60 million was allocated for FY2024 through FY2027 for pediatric quality measurement activities, excluding certain subsections. Annual state reporting of pediatric core measures to the HHS Secretary became mandatory. The CHIPRA Section 201 allocated $100 million for outreach and enrollment grants from FY2009 to FY2013 to increase participation of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. 10% is for a national campaign for underserved children, 10% for Native American children, and 80% for eligible entities. Reporting of pediatric core measures to the HHS Secretary became mandatory, with triennial reporting to Congress starting in 2025. The ACA, MACRA, and P.L. 115-120 allocated funds for outreach and enrollment grants to increase participation of children in Medicaid and CHIP. The grants target rural areas, underserved populations, and address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. Parent mentors are now eligible to receive grants to assist families with uninsured children. The provision allocates $48 million for CHIP outreach and enrollment grants from FY2024 to FY2027. It also allows parent mentors to assist families with uninsured children in obtaining health insurance coverage and addressing social determinants of health. The provision allocates $48 million for CHIP outreach and enrollment grants from FY2024 to FY2027, with 10% set aside for evaluations and technical assistance. It also allows national enrollment campaign funds to be used for developing strategies for underserved Medicaid and CHIP child populations. Additionally, the Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program provides support and education to families of children with special health care needs. The Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program, administered by HRSA, received funding through the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The program's appropriation was extended in MACRA, with $6 million allocated for FY2018 and FY2019. Funding was also provided for centers in territories and Indian tribes, with definitions for \"Indian Tribe,\" \"State,\" and \"territory.\" The 1996 welfare reform law established the Title V Abstinence Education Grant program to fund states and territories in providing abstinence education. Section 50502 amends the program to be called the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program. Funding has been used for children in elementary through high school. The Title V Abstinence Education Grant program was renamed the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program. States can request funds for abstinence education through the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant. Funds are allocated based on the proportion of low-income children in each jurisdiction. HHS could reallocate FY2015 Abstinence Education funds to states that applied for them. The Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program provides funding to states based on their proportion of low-income children. Funds can be allocated to states that have applied for Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds. HHS can competitively award funds to entities within states that have not previously applied for funding. The HHS Secretary must publish a notice to solicit grant applications for competitive funds after states apply for MCH Services Block Grant funds. Eligible states must apply for Sexual Risk Avoidance Education funds within 120 days. Title V Abstinence Education Grant funds are exclusively for teaching abstinence. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of teaching abstinence from sexual activity outside of marriage to school-age children to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancy, STIs, and associated health problems. It emphasizes the benefits of a faithful monogamous relationship within marriage and the harmful effects of sexual activity outside of marriage. Additionally, it educates young people on rejecting sexual advances, avoiding alcohol and drug use, and achieving self-sufficiency before engaging in sex. The curr_chunk specifies that Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program funds are available for states or entities to implement education exclusively on sexual risk avoidance, emphasizing refraining from sexual activity. The education must be medically accurate, age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and focus on six sexual risk avoidance topics. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of promoting optimal health behavior by avoiding nonmarital sexual activity through six key topics. These topics include personal responsibility, self-regulation, goal setting, healthy decision-making, refraining from sexual activity to improve future prospects and health, avoiding poverty by attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity, healthy relationships for forming stable families, the link between drug/alcohol use and teen sex, and how to resist sexual coercion and seek help. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of sexual risk avoidance education for teens, emphasizing the need for accurate information on contraception. It also mentions the evaluation activities for the Title V Abstinence Education program. The Education program can use up to 20% of the allotment for research on sexual risk avoidance. States receiving grants must collect program data and submit reports to HHS. HHS is required to conduct rigorous evaluations in consultation with state and local agencies and stakeholders. HHS must report evaluation results to Congress, including information on states' Sexual Risk Avoidance Education programs. SSA Section 510 applies key sections of the act to Abstinence Education allotments. Section 50502 of the SSA specifies that certain sections apply to allotments under the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program. Four definitions are added to SSA Section 510, including \"Age-appropriate\" and \"Medically accurate and complete\". The Title V Abstinence Education Grant program is funded through mandatory funds, with $50 million provided per year for five years. The program must use established scientific methods to evaluate the impact of interventions on changing behavior among youth aged 10 through 19. MACRA increased funding for the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program to $75 million per year for FY2016 and FY2017. Section 50502 of the SSA now provides $75 million in mandatory funds for the program for FY2018 and FY2019. The HHS Secretary must reserve up to 20% of the funding for program administration, including national evaluations and technical assistance to states. The new program under Section 50502 is retroactively effective from the start of FY2018. ACA Section 2953 established the Personal Responsibility Education Program under SSA Section 513. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) under SSA Section 513 aims to educate adolescents aged 10-19 and pregnant/parenting youth under 21 on abstinence and contraceptives for pregnancy and STI prevention. ACA provided $75 million annually for PREP for FY2010-FY2014, with an extension by MACRA for FY2015-FY2017. All states, DC, and territories are eligible for funding based on youth population proportions. Failure to apply for funding in FY2010 or FY2011 made states ineligible for funding for FY2010-FY2017. Local organizations in states or territories can apply for three-year grants known as Competitive PREP grants to carry out programs previously done by the state. HHS also offers Tribal PREP grants for American Indian and Alaska Native youth, and PREIS grants for innovative teen pregnancy prevention programs. Tribal PREP focuses on educating youth on abstinence and contraceptives, while PREIS aims to support high-risk and vulnerable populations. The law amends SSA Section 513 to provide $75 million for PREP in FY2018 and FY2019, focusing on teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk, vulnerable, and culturally underrepresented youth populations. It extends eligibility requirements for states applying for funding and specifies grants for victims of human trafficking. The law amends SSA Section 513 to provide $75 million for PREP in FY2018 and FY2019, focusing on teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk, vulnerable, and culturally underrepresented youth populations. It extends eligibility requirements for states applying for funding and specifies grants for victims of human trafficking. Additionally, ACA Section 5507(a) required the HHS Secretary to establish a demonstration project in SSA Section 2008 to award funds for health profession opportunity grants (HPOG) to help low-income individuals obtain education and training in healthcare jobs. The program is administered jointly by HRSA and ACF with $85 million in mandatory funding provided by the ACA. The ACA provided $85 million in mandatory funding for HPOG in FY2010-FY2014, with $15 million reserved for a demonstration project. Funding was extended through FY2019 in MACRA, providing $85 million for each of FY2016 and FY2017. The health center program, authorized by Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, grants funds to operate outpatient health centers in medically underserved areas. The ACA created the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) in 2010, providing mandatory funding for the health center program. A total of $9.5 billion was appropriated to the fund from FY2011 through FY2015. Mandatory funding for the CHCF was extended through FY2017, comprising approximately 72% of health center programs' appropriations in that year. Funding for the CHCF was not initially provided in FY2018 but later included in P.L. 115-96. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was initially created in 2010 by the ACA, providing mandatory funding for health centers. Funding for the CHCF was extended through FY2017, and in FY2018, P.L. 115-96 provided $550 million. Section 50901(a) now allocates $3.8 billion for FY2018 and $4.0 billion for FY2019 to the CHCF. Health center grants are awarded competitively, with a focus on rural areas, and support various programs such as health center operations, service expansion, and quality improvement activities. The program includes community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for public housing residents, and migrant health centers. Community health centers (CHCs) are the most numerous type of health centers, providing care to underserved populations. The other types, including health centers for the homeless, public housing residents, and migrants, serve more targeted subpopulations. All health centers are required to offer primary, preventive, and emergency health services, including diagnostic, preventive, and dental care. Emergency health services at health centers include arrangements for emergent cases and after-hours care. Additional services like behavioral and environmental health are provided to meet the needs of the population. Changes to the health center program include modifying references to \"substance abuse\" to \"substance use disorder\" and deleting authorizations for certain grant programs. The curr_chunk discusses changes to grant programs authorized in PHSA Section 330, including the elimination of a loan guarantee program and the authorization for supplemental funding awards to existing centers to implement evidence-based models for improving access to high-quality primary care services. This includes models related to improving care delivery for individuals with chronic conditions, workforce configurations, cost reduction, care coordination, telehealth use, and integrating primary care with behavioral health services. The provision authorizes the Secretary to consider applicant health centers' plans for continuing quality improvement activities after receiving supplemental grant awards. Special consideration will be given to applications addressing barriers to care in areas with provider shortages. Changes to the operating grant program include shortening the award period to one year for non-compliant entities. The subsection adds language to permit operating grant funds to be used for various activities aimed at improving health services, access, quality, and community health. It also includes provisions for noncompliant health centers to submit an implementation plan within 120 days of receiving grant funding. The provision in 50901(b) of the PHSA adds a new section related to grants for \"New Access Points and Expanded Services.\" It allows the HHS Secretary to make grants to health centers for establishing new delivery sites, with special consideration given to locations in sparsely populated areas or areas with high unmet needs. The provision also ensures a balanced ratio of awards between health centers serving rural and urban populations. Additionally, the Secretary can consider grant applications for new delivery sites overlapping existing sites based on unmet needs. The HHS Secretary can approve grants for expanding health centers' capacity to provide primary health services or additional services, with special consideration for addressing emerging public health or behavioral health issues in areas with barriers to care. The awards must ensure a balanced ratio between health centers serving rural and urban populations. The Health Centers for the Homeless Section 50901(b) amends PHSA Section 330(h) to include homeless veterans and veterans at risk of homelessness in grants. Section 50901(b) also amends PHSA Section 330(k) to require applicants to describe unmet health service needs and consult with state and local agencies. Section 50901(b) amends PHSA Section 330 subsections to broaden requirements for health centers, including collaborating with other providers to reduce nonurgent use of hospital emergency departments. It also specifies governance and auditing requirements for health centers. The new language in the center director requirements includes written policies for federal fund use. It limits funds for technical assistance and operational support to 3% of appropriations. The HHS Secretary can only waive auditing requirements for one year. Reporting requirements include funding distribution and unexpended funds. The curr_chunk discusses funding distribution for health centers, including support for participation in the \"All of Us Research Program\" and the deletion of grants for individualized wellness plans. The CHCF provides funding for the NHSC, offering scholarships and loan repayments to health professionals in shortage areas. Funding was provided in FY2018 through P.L. 115-96. Section 50901(c) extends mandatory funding for the NHSC. The curr_chunk discusses the funding provided for the NHSC and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program. It includes details about the funding amounts for FY2018 and FY2019, as well as the history of funding for the THCGME program. The MACRA funds were used to support residents at existing teaching health center programs. No new teaching health centers were added to the program in FY2018. Funding for FY2018 was provided in two laws, with $15 million from the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 and $30 million from the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018. Section 50901(d) amended PHSA Section 340H to allow payments to support current and new residents in existing and new programs. The HHS Secretary must consider training costs for residents at teaching health centers and funding preference is given to programs in HPSAs/MUAs or rural areas. Funding for FY2018 and FY2019 is $126.5 million each, with reporting requirements amended to include data on care volume and resident outcomes. The HHS Secretary must report on expenses related to teaching residents at health centers in underserved areas. Federal funds are restricted from paying for abortions except in specific cases, as outlined in the Hyde Amendment. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) includes restrictions on the use of funds for abortions and allows funds from the CHCF to be transferred to the DOJ for health services for victims of human trafficking. This authority for fund transfers to DOJ for victims of human trafficking is extended for FY2018 and FY2019. PHSA Section 330 B and 330C authorize funding for research and services related to type I diabetes. The programs were created in BBA97 and received funding from CHIP funds. Funding was extended and increased in subsequent legislation, with MACRA providing $150 million for each program for FY2016 and FY2017. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians received $37.5 million in additional funding. The Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 provided $37.5 million for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians in the first quarter of FY2018. No funding was initially provided for the Special Diabetes Program for Type I Diabetes, but both programs later received funding in P.L. 115-96. This legislation allocated $37.5 million for the first and second quarters of FY2018 for the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes and $37.5 million for the second quarter of FY2018 for the Special Diabetes Programs for Indians. Section 50902 amended PHSA Section 330B and PHSA Section 330C to provide longer funding extensions for the two Special Diabetes Programs, with $150 million in mandatory funding for each of FY2018 and FY2019 for the Special Diabetes Program for Type I Diabetes. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under ACA Section 4002 with a permanent annual appropriation to support national prevention and public health programs. PPHF funds are distributed to HHS agencies, particularly the CDC, with amounts available each fiscal year starting on October 1. Congress can direct the distribution of PPHF funds, as seen for FY2014 through FY2018. The PPHF funds were distributed from FY2014 through FY2018, with annual appropriations increasing under the ACA. However, BBA 2018 reduced PPHF appropriations for FY2019 through FY2027 by $1.35 billion. This resulted in a redistribution of funds, with varying appropriations for different fiscal years. The MIECHV program receives funding of $1.0 billion for FY2022 and FY2023, increasing to $2.0 billion for FY2028 and beyond. It provides grants for evidence-based early childhood home visiting to at-risk families. The program was initially funded at $1.5 billion for FY2010 through FY2014 and later increased to $400 million annually by MACRA for FY2016 and FY2017. Section 50601 mandates $400 million in funding for the program for FY2017 through FY2022. The MIECHV program requires $400 million in funding for FY2017 through FY2022. Eligible entities must establish measurable benchmarks in six areas to show improvements for participating families. Performance will be assessed at three and five years, with entities required to demonstrate improvements in at least four of the six benchmark areas. The HHS Secretary requires eligible entities to demonstrate improvements in at least four of six benchmark areas within the first three years of the MIECHV program. Failure to do so necessitates the development and implementation of an improvement plan approved by the HHS Secretary, with ongoing monitoring and oversight. The HHS Secretary oversees the MIECHV program, providing technical assistance and convening an advisory panel. Funding may be terminated if improvements are not made in four benchmark areas within the first three years or if required reports are not submitted. Grant funds may be included in future grants. The Secretary may include unexpended grant funds in grants to nonprofit organizations operating home visiting programs in states without MIECHV grants. Eligible entities must track and report improvements in four benchmark areas, comparing enrolled families to those not receiving services. Reporting is required within 30 days after FY2020 and every three subsequent years. Section 50602 of the SSA requires eligible entities to report improvements in benchmark areas every three years. If improvements are not made, a plan must be developed and implemented with HHS Secretary approval. Technical assistance will be provided for the improvement plan. The eligible entity must demonstrate ongoing improvements in benchmark areas to continue receiving funding under the MCH Services Block Grant. Failure to show improvements or submit required reports may result in funding termination. States had to conduct a needs assessment for the MIECHV program, focusing on communities with high rates of premature birth, low-birth weight infants, and infant mortality. The needs assessment for the MIECHV program focuses on various indicators such as mortality, poverty, crime, domestic violence, substance abuse, and child maltreatment. It evaluates the quality and capacity of existing early childhood home visitation programs, gaps in services, and the state's capacity for substance abuse treatment. This assessment is separate from the statewide needs assessment required for the MCH Services Block Grant. Eligible entities are directed to demonstrate ongoing improvements in benchmark areas to continue receiving funding. Section 50603 amends SSA Section 511(b)(1) to require eligible entities to conduct a statewide needs assessment for the MCH Services Block Grant. The assessment must prioritize home visiting services for high-risk populations, including low-income families, pregnant women under 21, and those with a history of child abuse or substance abuse. The assessment must be reviewed and updated by October 1, 2020. Section 50604 allows eligible entities to consider additional factors necessary for the service delivery model to operate and show improvements for high-risk families. Section 50605 enables entities to use up to 25% of MIECHV funding for outcomes or success-based payments related to a pay-for-outcomes initiative. MIECHV funding can be used for pay-for-outcomes initiatives that involve performance-based payments for improved outcomes in evidence-based home visiting services. The initiative must include a feasibility study, rigorous evaluation, progress reports, and payments to the grant recipient. Section 50606 of the SSA amends the MIECHV program to require data exchange standards for necessary information between state agencies operating home visiting programs. This ensures accountability and efficiency in program operations. The SSA amends the MIECHV program to require data exchange standards for information between state agencies. Standards must be nonproprietary, interoperable, and developed in consultation with OMB and state perspectives. HRSA and ACF will designate standards for federal reporting and data exchanges, aiming for widely accepted features. The provision mandates data exchange standards for federal reporting under the MIECHV program, requiring nonproprietary, searchable, and computer-readable formats. It emphasizes cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and continual upgrades. HHS will distribute funds based on poverty rates among children, with formula and competitive grants to states and jurisdictions. The formula awards are based on poverty rates among children under age five in jurisdictions. Territories lack federal poverty data, except for Puerto Rico. Each territory receives $1 million annually in formula funds. Section 50607 amends SSA Section 511(j) to use accurate federal population and poverty data for funding allocation. Medicaid DSH payments are required for hospitals treating low-income patients to address their financial challenges. The ACA reduced the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through its health insurance coverage provisions, leading to less need for Medicaid DSH payments. Each state receives an annual DSH allotment, capped federal funding for Medicaid DSH payments. Section 53101 amends Medicaid DSH reductions, eliminating reductions for FY2018 and FY2019, increasing reduction amounts for FY2021 through FY2023 to $44.0 billion. Annual reductions are $4.0 billion in FY2020 and $8.0 billion from FY2021 to FY2025. In FY2026, states' DSH allotments will be calculated as though the reductions never occurred, with annual inflation adjustments for FY2020 through FY2025. Medicaid serves as the payer of last resort, paying for services only when third parties are not liable, known as third-party liability (TPL). States must collect TPL information during Medicaid eligibility determinations. Enrollees who have already received Medicaid payment for services entitled to third-party payment are considered to have assigned their claim to the state. States must require health insurers to provide coverage information for Medicaid enrollees upon request. The state may request coverage information for Medicaid enrollees or Medicaid-eligible individuals. Health insurers may also be required to provide this information for CHIP enrollees or CHIP-eligible individuals. States must follow cost-avoidance rules for billing liable third parties before Medicaid. Exceptions exist for preventive pediatric services, prenatal services, and services for individuals with child support enforcement. States pay providers first for these services and then seek reimbursement from third parties. Section 202 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended Medicaid TPL rules, limiting exceptions for cost avoidance. States may defer payment for preventive pediatric and prenatal services until 90 days after claim submission to third parties. For services related to child support enforcement, states must pay claims if third parties haven't paid within 90 days, with an option to limit payment delay to 30 days for access to care. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended Medicaid TPL rules, allowing states to recover TPL payments from Medicaid enrollees. Section 53102 of the act made changes to TPL rules, including limiting the cost-avoidance exception to preventive pediatric services only and repealing TPL changes made by BBA 13. These amendments took effect on October 1, 2017. The amendments to Medicaid TPL rules, including the repeal of certain provisions and the delay of others, are retroactively effective as of September 30, 2017. The changes will apply to any open claims after that date. Additionally, a report on the TPL changes is required to be submitted to specific committees within 18 months of the enactment of BBA 2018. The BBA 2018 addresses changes in TPL rules, including the removal of cost-avoidance exceptions for prenatal services and delays in effective dates for certain amendments. The report must assess the impact on access to prenatal and pediatric services, as well as on providers due to payment delays. Additionally, TPL requirements are now binding on the CHIP program, and states must mandate health insurers to respond to coverage queries. The ACA created Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code to provide premium assistance tax credits for individuals to purchase coverage through health insurance exchanges. Medicaid's MAGI income-counting rule is used to determine eligibility for various federal health programs, including the ACA Medicaid expansion. States are required to mandate health insurers to respond to coverage queries concerning CHIP enrollees and CHIP-eligible individuals. The Medicaid MAGI income-counting rule defines income for eligibility, including deductions and additions like tax-exempt interest and Social Security benefits. Certain types of income are subtracted, and irregular income is counted only in the month received. Household income types are specified for eligibility consideration. The regulations define \"household\" for Medicaid eligibility determinations, requiring all household members' income to be considered. Income eligibility for new enrollees is based on current monthly income, while redeterminations for current enrollees can use projected annual income. Section 53103 of Medicaid requires states to consider \"qualified lottery winnings\" and/or \"qualified lump sum income\" received by an individual when determining eligibility based on MAGI. Winnings/income under $80,000 are counted in the month received, $80,000-$90,000 prorated over 2 months, and $90,000-$100,000 over 3 months. For winnings and income over $100,000, an additional month is added for each $10,000 received, up to a maximum of 120 months. Income over $80,000 is counted in equal monthly installments. States can provide a hardship exemption for individuals facing undue medical or financial hardship due to Medicaid eligibility denial. Individuals losing Medicaid eligibility must be informed of their option to enroll in a health plan through the exchange during a special enrollment period. The provision requires states to inform individuals losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage about their option to enroll in coverage through a special enrollment period. It defines \"qualified lottery winnings\" and \"qualified lump sum\" income, allowing states to recover lottery winnings to pay for Medicaid medical assistance. Prescription drugs are an optional benefit. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on covered outpatient drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. This agreement ensures that Medicare and Medicaid will cover most FDA-approved drugs, excluding vaccines. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on covered outpatient drugs, including biologic drugs derived from natural sources, for Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid rebates consist of a basic rebate and an additional rebate based on the drug's Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) and inflation-adjusted AMP. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on covered outpatient drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Manufacturers owe a larger additional rebate as the drug's AMP increases above the inflation rate. Modifications to existing drug products, like new doses or formulations, were considered new products for Medicaid rebate obligations. Line-extension formulations often incur a lower additional rebate despite being introduced at a higher price than the reference product. Section 53104 clarifies drug manufacturers' Medicaid rebate obligations for line-extension drugs, ensuring they owe the greater of the total rebate for the line-extension drug or the product it was developed from. This amendment aims to address the discrepancy in rebate obligations between reference products and line extensions, especially for oral solid dose innovator drugs. Section 53104 clarifies Medicaid rebate obligations for line-extension drugs, effective from October 1, 2018. The HHS Secretary was mandated to establish the Medicaid Improvement Fund, with $5 million appropriated for FY2021 and $980 million for state activities related to claims processing. Funding has not yet been used for its intended purposes. Section 53105 rescinds the $5 million and $980 million appropriations for the Medicaid Improvement Fund for FY2021 and beyond, allowing the Secretary to use the funds for state activities related to mechanized claims systems starting in FY2023. The Secretary can obligate fund resources in advance as long as the total amount does not exceed the available funds."
