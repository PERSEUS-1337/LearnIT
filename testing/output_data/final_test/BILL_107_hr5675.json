    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"21st Century Veterans Equitable Treatment Act\". The Congress findings highlight the failure of the current allocation system for Veterans Affairs medical care funding, known as VERA formula, to distribute funds fairly across the 22 national service regions. The VERA formula for Veterans Affairs medical care funding has led to unequal distribution of funds across regions, forcing veterans to compete for critical care. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs set performance goals in 2000 to schedule primary and specialty care visits within 30 days. The Department of Veterans Affairs aims to schedule primary and specialty care visits within 30 days, with a maximum wait time of 20 minutes. Nationally, 87% of primary care appointments and 84% of specialty care appointments were scheduled within 30 days in Fiscal Year 2001. However, in VISN 1, only 82% of primary care appointments and 80% of specialty care appointments met this target. Changes to the VERA formula are needed to ensure fair distribution of medical care funding for veterans. Appropriate access to medical care for veterans is a national priority, and a safety net must be established to ensure they receive the healthcare they need without compromising the Department of Veterans Affairs' existing network. SEC. 3. STANDARD FOR TIME FOR REFERRAL FOR SPECIALIST CARE. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a maximum specialist referral period for veterans referred to specialty clinics, based on clinical need and department performance goals. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will ensure transportation services for qualified veterans within a reasonable time period of a scheduled appointment. Contract care will be provided when Department of Veterans Affairs care is not available according to standards. In cases where the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot provide hospital care or medical services as per standards, they will arrange for care from a private source. The care provided will be those the veteran is eligible for within the VA medical care system. The Secretary will reimburse the provider for the reasonable value of the care or services provided. The Secretary will expedite reimbursement for care provided by private sources to veterans, utilizing modern technology like smart card technology for electronic processing of claims. This includes emergency services, with terms and conditions applicable under section 1725 of title 38, United States Code. SEC. 5. TERMINATION OF 24-MONTH RULE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES. The 24-month rule for reimbursement for emergency treatment under section 1725(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is terminated for treatment provided after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. MEDICAL ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE RATINGS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will include a standard for assessing improvements in appointment waiting times in the performance ratings of administrators in the VA medical care system. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding waiting times for appointments in the VA medical care system, detailing any reductions in wait times and experiences with appointment delays."
