    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Accounting for Methane in Production through Loophole Elimination with Oil and Gas Royalties\" or the \"AMPLE Oil and Gas Royalties Act\". The Congress finds that inefficient development of mineral resources owned by the Federal Government is costing taxpayers millions in lost royalties, especially with vented, flared, and leaked natural gas. Government Accountability Office estimates show that capturing 40% of natural gas from Federal onshore leases could increase royalty payments by $23 million and reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 16.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. According to a University of Maryland study, emissions from oil and gas production can negatively impact air quality hundreds of miles away. Methane emissions have a greater impact on climate change than carbon dioxide, diminishing the benefits of using natural gas. Control technologies exist to capture natural gas economically, ensuring taxpayers receive deserved royalties. Requiring royalty payments on flared, vented, and lost natural gas will lead to more efficient use of Federal resources. Requiring royalty payments on flared, vented, and lost natural gas will lead to more efficient use of Federal resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase royalty payments to the Federal Government. SEC. 3. VOLUME ALLOCATION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. The amendment to Section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 now requires lessees to report and pay royalties based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir, regardless of sales. The amendment to Section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 mandates that lessees report and pay royalties based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir, irrespective of sales. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to define \"withdrawn from the reservoir\" as any oil and gas produced, sold, vented, flared, used for beneficial purposes, leaked, or otherwise emitted during production. This aligns with the amendment to Section 111(k) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, which requires reporting and payment of royalties based on the actual volume of oil and gas withdrawn from the reservoir. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to specify that \"withdrawn from the reservoir\" refers to oil and gas extracted from the reservoir per well per day. This aligns with the reporting and payment requirements outlined in the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to define \"withdrawn from the reservoir\" as oil and gas extracted per well per day, in line with the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. This amendment does not apply to leases issued before the enactment of this Act."
