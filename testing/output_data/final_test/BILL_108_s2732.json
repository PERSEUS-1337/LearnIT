Congress finds that school transportation issues have concerned parents, lawmakers, and agencies for years. Millions of children face health problems due to fumes from old school buses. The EPA's Clean School Bus USA program aims to replace old diesel buses to improve air quality, but some rural agencies struggle due to specialized fuels needed. The purpose of this Act is to establish a Federal cost-sharing program to help rural local educational agencies replace older, unsafe school buses with newer, safer ones. The Act aims to create a Federal program to assist rural schools in replacing old, unsafe buses with newer, safer ones. The Act defines \"Administrator\" as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and \"rural local educational agency\" as a school district with low population density or specific school locale codes. The term \"school bus\" is defined as a vehicle primarily used to transport students to and from school or school activities. Additionally, all schools served by a local educational agency must be designated as rural schools by the state legislature for educational service purposes. The grant program is outlined in Section 4. The Administrator shall provide grants to rural local educational agencies for purchasing new school buses on a competitive basis. Agencies must submit an application with required documentation showing at least 50% of their school buses are in need of replacement. The rural local educational agency must provide documentation on the number of miles traveled by each school bus in the previous academic year, operating with a reduced fleet, and submit a resolution authorizing the grant application. The rural local educational agency must provide documentation on the number of miles traveled by each school bus in the previous academic year, operating with a reduced fleet, and submit a resolution authorizing the grant application. Priority for grants will be given to agencies with buses manufactured before 1977 or with a depleted fleet. The agency must also assure payment of the non-Federal share for new bus purchases. The Administrator will pay the Federal share of 75 percent for purchasing new school buses to rural local educational agencies approved under this section. These agencies must have a depleted fleet or serve schools required to provide transportation for students to transfer to another public school. Under this Act, the Federal share for purchasing a new school bus is 75 percent. Authorization of appropriations includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2006 through 2010."
