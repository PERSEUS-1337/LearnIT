    "content": "Section 1 of the Agricultural Market Transition Act is amended to reduce loan rates for peanuts for various crop years. Section 2 discusses the future termination of price support and marketing quota programs for peanuts. The amendments made by this section will take effect on October 1, 2001, applying to the 2002 and subsequent crops of peanuts. Price support and marketing quota programs for peanuts are repealed, with conforming amendments made to related sections. The Secretary of Agriculture is prohibited from providing price support after the effective date of this section. The Secretary of Agriculture is prohibited from providing price support to peanut producers for 2002 and subsequent crops, except for settling outstanding loans for 2001 and previous crops. The liability of producers under previous laws remains unaffected. SEC. 3. Nonrecourse loans for peanut producers. Nonrecourse loans are available for peanut producers in the US for each crop year, with loan rates set by the Secretary of Agriculture. The loan rate for peanuts is between 85% of the average price received by producers over five years, excluding the highest and lowest years, and a maximum of $350 per ton. The nonrecourse loan for peanuts has a term of 9 months and repayment rates are determined by the Secretary to minimize potential forfeitures and government costs. The government stores peanuts and allows for free marketing domestically and internationally. Loan deficiency payments may be available to peanut producers who forgo obtaining nonrecourse loans in return for payments. Loan deficiency payments are available to peanut producers who choose not to take out a loan, with the payment rate determined by the difference between the established loan rate and the repayment rate."
