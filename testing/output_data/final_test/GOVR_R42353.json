    "content": "This report provides an overview of federal food assistance programs in the United States and territories, split into programs administered by USDA-FNS and AOA within HHS-ACL. It includes Farm Bill programs, WIC, child nutrition programs, and OAA nutrition programs. The tables in the report offer summary information to illustrate key details. The report discusses federal food assistance programs in the US, aiming to provide food to low-income populations and prevent hunger. Programs like NSLP have historical roots, while policymakers now focus on improving diet quality and reducing obesity. Evaluating hunger trends is crucial to assess program effectiveness and identify vulnerable populations in need of assistance. The concept of \"hunger\" is difficult to measure, so terms like \"food security\" and \"food insecurity\" are used instead. These terms focus on an individual's ability to access adequate food, which can be objectively measured. A panel recommended that USDA distinguish between food insecurity and hunger, stating that hunger is a physiological condition that cannot be accurately measured through a household survey. The terms \"food security\" and \"food insecurity\" are used to measure access to adequate food, as hunger is difficult to capture accurately. The USDA conducts annual analyses to measure food security in the US, distinguishing between households able to acquire enough food (\"food security\") and those unable to do so (\"food insecurity\"). The USDA distinguishes between food security and food insecurity to measure access to adequate food. Food security levels range from high to very low, with very low food security indicating disrupted eating patterns due to lack of resources. The National Commission on Hunger used \"very low food security\" to define \"hunger\" in its 2016 report. Food insecurity rates were 12.3% in 2016, with 4.9% experiencing very low food security. 59.0% of food insecure households participated in SNAP, WIC, or NSLP. In 2016, 7.8% of households with elderly members were food insecure, while 16.5% of households with children experienced food insecurity. Only 8.0% of households with children had food insecure children. In 2016, 22.5% of black, non-Hispanic households and 18.5% of Hispanic households were food insecure, with no significant changes from 2015 rates. White, non-Hispanic households saw a decrease in food insecurity to 9.3% from 10.5% in 2015. Various domestic food assistance programs differ in target population, eligibility requirements, and types of assistance provided. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified 18 food assistance programs focusing on coordination and assistance activities. These programs vary in eligibility based on age, with some targeting children under five (WIC) and school-age children (NSLP and SBP). Benefits include uncooked foods, cash assistance, USDA-purchased commodity foods, and prepared meals. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified 18 food assistance programs focusing on coordination and assistance activities. These programs vary in eligibility based on age, with some targeting children under five (WIC) and school-age children (NSLP and SBP). Benefits include uncooked foods, cash assistance, USDA-purchased commodity foods, and prepared meals. SNAP provides benefits redeemable for a wide variety of foods, while OAA programs offer prepared meals for those lacking resources or functional capacity to cook. The report details services, eligibility, participation, and funding for each program, highlighting similarities and differences in assistance provided to various populations. USDA's Food and Nutrition Service administers domestic food assistance programs authorized in the farm bill, WIC, and Child Nutrition Programs. The USDA-FNS administers domestic food assistance programs authorized in the farm bill, WIC, and Child Nutrition Programs. Tables provide details on services, eligibility, participation, and funding. State agencies and legislatures have options and waivers that can affect program operations. State departments of education and school districts play a role in school meals programs. WIC and CACFP are often co-administered by state and local health departments. USDA commodity foods are distributed to various nutrition programs including TEFAP, CSFP, NSLP, SFSP, and CACFP. These programs provide entitlement and bonus commodities to grantees, with a historical tie to farming and agriculture. The Food Stamp Program in the 1940s sold orange and blue \"food stamps\" to participants, with blue stamps used for agricultural products in surplus. Commodity donation programs supported the post-Depression farm economy and led to the National School Lunch Program. USDA commodity foods benefit TEFAP and child nutrition programs, with surplus goods purchased for price support. Recent farm bills and USDA initiatives also support these programs. The 2014 farm bill, also known as the Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79), reauthorized various farm, food, and nutrition programs, including \"farm-to-school\" initiatives. The nutrition programs are authorized under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized various farm, food, and nutrition programs, including SNAP, which accounted for close to 79% of the spending. The federal program name changed to SNAP in the 2008 farm bill. Farm bill nutrition programs are under the jurisdiction of the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate Committee. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized nutrition programs under the House Agriculture Committee and Senate Committee. It includes programs like WIC and child nutrition programs providing meals in school settings. The National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs offer meal subsidies for free, reduced, or paid meals. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) provide free meals to children at certain sites based on eligibility criteria. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) is considered a child nutrition program and was included in the 2008 farm bill. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 reauthorized WIC and child nutrition programs through FY2015. Policymakers oversee USDA implementation of these programs. Certain provisions from the Act expired after September 30, 2015. As of the date of this report, Congress has not reauthorized the child nutrition and WIC statutes, but most programs continue due to funding in appropriations laws. WIC and child nutrition programs fall under the jurisdiction of specific congressional committees. For more details on these programs and reauthorizations, refer to CRS reports. The Administration on Aging administers domestic food assistance programs under the Older Americans Act, providing congregate and home-delivered meals to older Americans. The Nutrition Services Incentive Program also supports food purchases for these programs. The Administration on Aging administers domestic food assistance programs under the Older Americans Act, providing congregate and home-delivered meals to older individuals in the community. The purpose is to reduce hunger, promote socialization, and improve the health and well-being of older individuals. Eligible individuals may also access other USDA food assistance programs like SNAP, SFMNP, and CSFP. OAA-funded services offer outreach, education, and referral to help older individuals access these programs. Program coordination exists between HHS-ACL and USDA-FNS at the federal level. At the federal level, program coordination exists between HHS-ACL and USDA-FNS for the NSIP commodity procurement. State aging and disability agencies may jointly administer nutrition services programs targeting seniors under OAA funding. Evaluation shows that most State Units on Aging have a nutrition program administrator responsible for OAA nutrition services, with some also overseeing USDA programs like SNAP and SFMNP. State Units on Aging (SUAs) collaborate with USDA-FNS programs like SNAP and SFMNP, promoting older-adult access and participating in various activities. Older adults in SNAP can contribute benefits towards OAA meals. SUAs have varying levels of collaboration with other USDA-FNS programs. The Older Americans Act (OAA) allows older adults in SNAP to use their benefits for OAA meals if the nutrition provider is authorized by USDA. The 2016 OAA reauthorization made changes to nutrition services programs, requiring states to utilize nutrition experts and promote the use of locally grown food. The 2016 OAA reauthorization added language for states to ensure that the nutrition project encourages the use of locally grown foods in meals programs and identifies potential partnerships with local producers."
