The USDA and APHIS play a crucial role in inspecting and regulating imported agricultural products to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases. APHIS issues import health permits to regulate the import, transit, and release of various products like animals, plants, and genetically engineered organisms. These permits ensure compliance with U.S. import standards and international guidelines. The U.S. has entered into free trade agreements that include sanitary and phytosanitary standards to protect against diseases and contaminants. Since 2000, the United States has signed multiple free trade agreements with SPS chapters outlining import requirements such as product standards, disease-free production areas, quarantine procedures, and residue limits for pesticides and drugs in foods. APHIS collaborates with CBP and other federal agencies to enforce these regulations at ports of entry. The creation of APHIS in 1972 consolidated animal and plant health bureaus within USDA. APHIS has authority over health import permits through statutes like the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA). AHPA gives APHIS broad authority to detect, control, or eradicate pests or diseases of livestock or poultry. The Plant Protection Act of 2000 (PPA) is a federal law governing plant pests in foreign and interstate commerce, authorizing APHIS to regulate imports, exports, and interstate movement of plants and plant products. Both AHPA and PPA give APHIS authority to inspect agricultural imports. After the events of September 11, 2001, congressional concern about agroterrorism led to the strengthening of APHIS and other federal agency agricultural inspection activities. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 was passed to protect the nation's food and water supplies and prevent unauthorized access to disease organisms in laboratories. APHIS-issued health permits are now required for APHIS-regulated agricultural imports to facilitate trade. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees oversee USDA's meat and poultry inspection programs and other food-safety-related measures. The House and Senate committees have jurisdiction over USDA's meat and poultry inspection programs and other food safety programs. They appropriate funds for APHIS, with an average annual budget of $877 million between FY2014 and FY2018. APHIS's appropriations cover four main mission areas: Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response, Agency-Wide Programs, Safe Trade and International Technical Assistance, and Animal Welfare. The Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response portion monitors animal and plant health in the US and globally. The House and Senate committees appropriate funds for APHIS, with an average annual budget of $877 million between FY2014 and FY2018. The Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response portion monitors animal and plant health in the US and globally, representing roughly 85% of APHIS's budget. In May 2018, bills were reported that would have provided $1 billion for the APHIS budget for FY2019, an increase of 7% from the previous year. The Senate passed a bill in August 2018 providing $1 billion for APHIS for FY2019, allowing the administrator to issue Federal Orders for emergency actions. APHIS issues Federal Orders under the PPA to prohibit or restrict plant imports to prevent the spread of plant pests. For example, a Federal Order in June 2018 banned pomegranate arils from Peru due to concerns about the Mediterranean fruit fly. This Order is still in effect as of January 9, 2019. Agricultural imports enter the US through five Customs Districts. APHIS regulations are enforced at ports of entry through health import permits. Plant and animal health import permits are overseen by APHIS's Plant Production Quarantine and Veterinary Services. Importers can obtain permits via the ePermit system or state Department of Agriculture offices. The ePermit system allows officials to issue, track, and verify import permits online, with a cost to the importer for each application. Authorities often request health import permit submissions with supporting documentation, including a biosafety facility inspection. Health import permits are typically processed within 10 business days. After obtaining a permit, APHIS and/or CBP inspect the regulated product as part of the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program. APHIS transfers funds to CBP for AQI activities and collects user fees from international airline passengers. APHIS collects AQI user fees from international airline passengers, commercial vehicle operators, cruise ship passengers, and importers of shipments requiring phytosanitary treatments. The fees recover costs for program activities, with $765 million collected in FY2018. GAO recommended aligning fee division between APHIS and CBP, which APHIS announced implementing in February 2018. In February 2018, APHIS implemented all GAO recommendations for importers to obtain health import permits before inspection. Other federal agencies and state Departments of Agriculture participate in inspecting APHIS-regulated products. FDA collaborates with DHS to protect the food supply from terrorist attacks and emergencies. FDA requires importers to submit \"prior notice\" forms before importing food into the US. Unlike APHIS, FDA does not enforce industry guidelines but reviews APHIS-issued import permits for disease or pest status verification. FSMA created new rules for FDA's food inspection regime. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) established new rules for FDA's food inspection regime, including requirements for importers to present APHIS-issued import permits for inspections. FSIS oversees meat, poultry, and egg products, often requesting APHIS-issued health import permits for inspections. State Departments of Agriculture enforce APHIS regulations, which include animal and plant health import restrictions. States have varying animal and plant health import restrictions for interstate trade, with some imposing stricter regulations based on disease and pest detections. State regulators typically require APHIS-issued import permits for inspections, and collaborate with APHIS and CBP in case of disease outbreaks. Congress plays a role in preventing pest and disease threats through funding for APHIS, legislation on invasive species, and directing CBP to enforce APHIS regulations to prevent agricultural smuggling. APHIS plays a crucial role in preventing agricultural import threats to the United States by enforcing regulations and issuing animal and plant health import permits. In the event of a disease outbreak or pest infestation, APHIS is designated as the lead U.S. agency for informing the international community. They work closely with partner countries to address outbreaks following SPS guidelines under the WTO framework or individual FTAs. In the event of a disease outbreak or pest infestation, APHIS plays a crucial role in informing U.S. importers and working with them to verify health import permits. Regionalization protocols may be applied to specific exporting regions within the United States. APHIS monitors diseases and pests that threaten U.S. agriculture, such as avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease. Agricultural imports can bring pests and diseases that impact public health and agriculture. Congress may allocate funds for APHIS to address specific diseases, like citrus greening disease. Agroterrorism involves intentionally introducing animal or plant diseases. Agroterrorism involves deliberately introducing animal or plant diseases to infect food and cause economic losses. U.S. importers are required to obtain APHIS-issued health import permits to protect against agroterrorism. Congress has directed CDC and APHIS to enforce the Select Agents and Toxins List to address harmful imports that could impact public health or animal/plant health. Invasive species, overseen by HHS and USDA, pose threats to human, animal, and plant health. They can cause economic and environmental harm, disrupt ecosystems, and lead to extinctions. Introduction of non-native species can impact biodiversity, alter habitats, and introduce new pests and diseases. Over 50,000 invasive species have been introduced to the US, costing over $100 billion annually. The APHIS collects information on invasive species and monitors their impacts on agricultural production and forest lands. Health import permits provide specific guidelines for detecting pests in imported agricultural products. U.S. importers work with federal agencies to prevent invasive species infestation, such as vessel ballast water discharge. Federal statutes provide authorities to address invasive species in the United States. Some in Congress are interested in legislation to reduce invasive species, like the \"area-wide integrated pest management\" bill. Concerns include the increase in movement of people and agricultural products, leading to smuggled items that could harbor damaging pests. APHIS works to identify and address these threats. APHIS works to prevent agricultural smuggling by seizing illegally imported products and pursuing penalties. The Lacey Act, dating back to 1900, prohibits the importation of plants traded in violation of laws and requires declarations for imported plant shipments. APHIS collaborates with various agencies to enforce these regulations. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) collaborates with various agencies such as the Marine Fisheries Service, FBI, U.S. Forest Service, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce the Lacey Act through inspection and monitoring activities. APHIS collects health import permits, manages declaration requirements, guides importers, performs compliance checks, and provides information to enforcement agencies. Importers are required to make declarations at the time of import, with approximately 1 million declarations in FY2017, up from FY2016, coinciding with the introduction of an online system for declarations."
