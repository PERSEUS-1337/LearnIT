    "content": "Federal outlays for grants to state and local governments have significantly increased over the years, reaching $509.7 billion in 2013. There are currently over 2,179 congressionally authorized grant programs administered by federal agencies. Congress has shown interest in improving the management of federal grant programs, leading to investigations by the Government Accountability Office. These investigations have revealed challenges in timely grant closeouts, internal controls, and monitoring of grant recipients to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Delays in closing out federal grants can lead to waste, fraud, and abuse. Grant administration tasks, like reviewing expenditures and transferring unspent funds, are crucial for oversight. The Government Accountability Office found over $794 million in undisbursed grant funds, emphasizing the need for timely closeouts to address this issue. The delayed federal grant closeouts contribute to undisbursed funds issue. There may be underlying causes other than inefficient grants management. The estimated amount of undisbursed funds in expired grant accounts may be inflated. The existence of undisbursed grant funds in expired grant accounts indicates a systemic grants management challenge. This report aims to assist Congress in overseeing federal grants-in-aid programs by summarizing relevant laws, processes, and authorities. The report analyzes causes of undisbursed grant funds in expired grant accounts and presents options to reform federal grant administration for better management. The life cycle of a federal grant includes pre-award, grant award, grant administration, and post-award/audit stages. When a grant reaches the end of the grant award period, the grant account is labeled as \"expired\" in the cash management system. GAO defines expired grant accounts as those open more than 3 months past the grant end date. Undisbursed grant funds are those funds obligated for a grant award but not yet spent by the recipient. Expired grant accounts are those open more than 3 months past the grant end date. During closeout, the recipient must meet financial reporting requirements and return unspent funds. The federal agency determines the timeline for closeout procedures. The federal agency has discretion in establishing the timeline for closeout procedures, with the grant recipient required to complete financial reporting within 90 days of the grant award period. The federal administering agency must process closeout documentation within 90 days of receiving it. OMB issues guidance to improve financial management, reduce improper payments, and enhance grants management. The Department of the Treasury issues guidance to CFOs on grant fund disbursement. Federal agencies have discretion in grant administration and can place conditions on grant awards. Noncompliance with grant conditions can result in consequences such as additional monitoring or debarment. The primary grant recipient, typically the state, must comply with grant conditions, including OMB circulars and reporting requirements. Subgrantees at the local level must also adhere to grant conditions and any additional requirements set by the primary recipient. Closeout documentation must be submitted in a specific format at the end of the grant period. To address undisbursed grant funds in grant accounts, it is important to understand the causes of delays in grant closeouts. Delays can occur when closeout documentation is incomplete or not processed by the federal agency. Federal grant funds go through multiple entities before reaching the local level, with the state relying on the local subgrantee for documentation submission. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur financial obligations using government funds. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur financial obligations using government funds for federal grant programs. Congress provides budget authority through appropriations acts, with funds obligated by agencies based on OMB guidelines. The obligation of funds creates a legal commitment for the government to pay for goods and services ordered or received. Budget authority expires once the statutory duration ends, with grants having varying periods of availability. The duration of a grant account may not align with the budget authority that funds it, leading to limitations on reprogramming undisbursed grant funds in expired accounts. The nature of budget authority provided for grant programs influences the amount of undisbursed funds. Identifying the type of budget authority associated with federal grant programs is currently challenging. The extent of delays in grant closeout procedures can be influenced by various factors such as lack of resources, delays by subgrant recipients, and insufficient guidance on proper closeout procedures. Federal agencies may also face challenges in closing out expired grant accounts due to resource constraints and disputes with grant recipients. Federal agencies may have experienced delays in closing out federal grants due to limited resources focused on expediting grant applications and award documentation. Ongoing disputes with grant recipients may involve questions about expenditures or matching requirements. Federal agencies may face challenges in closing out grants due to discrepancies between cash management and grants administration systems, leading to potential misclassification of expired grant accounts. Grant extensions are common, causing delays in disbursing funds. The financial management of federal grants may be impacted by delays in grant closeout, leading to overestimation of undisbursed funds in expired accounts. Solutions to address delays may involve reforming financial management structures and increasing oversight of grant activities. The financial management of federal grants may be impacted by delays in grant closeout, leading to overestimation of undisbursed funds in expired accounts. Congress has attempted to encourage collaboration within federal agencies and grant recipients for management and administration of federal grants. Recent initiatives by OMB raise questions about future collaboration mechanisms. Congress may want to establish a permanent structure for grants management that includes financial and program components. Federal agencies and grant recipients engage in performance and financial monitoring activities after a grant is awarded. Performance monitoring involves reviewing reports to assess progress towards grant goals. Currently, there is a lack of standardized policy for federal grant monitoring, making it challenging to determine best practices. Congress may consider mandating the development of a uniform grant monitoring policy. Federal agencies have discretion in monitoring grant awards, including determining the type and frequency of monitoring activities. The monitoring of federal grant awards involves determining monitoring activities, consequences of noncompliance, and compliance with grant agreements. Grant recipients must comply with terms and conditions, including activities for monitoring subgrant recipients such as performance plans, site visits, and audits. General guidelines exist for financial monitoring activities like audits, but the use of audit findings by federal agencies and their oversight vary. Audit findings are used by federal agencies to ensure corrective actions are taken, but there is a lack of standardized policy for grant monitoring. Noncompliance with monitoring provisions can lead to corrective action plans and consequences like suspension from grant programs. The discretion of the primary grant recipient and federal agency determines the appropriateness of corrective action plans and consequences for noncompliance. Federal agencies lack a centralized list of noncompliant grant recipients, leading to ineffective monitoring. Congress may require agencies to compile a unified list and provide status reports on corrective actions. Monitoring costs are a concern. Grant recipients can use a percentage of grant awards for management and administrative costs (M&A) to fund monitoring activities. The allowable percentage of M&A varies across and within agency grant programs. Congress could establish a higher, uniform percentage for M&A to improve grant management and closeout activities. Federal agencies and grant recipients can use a percentage of grant awards for management and administrative costs (M&A) to fund financial management activities. Congress could consider increasing M&A percentages for programs with grant management issues or require agencies to supplement M&A funding from discretionary funds. Limited capacity for grant closeout activities has been attributed to reductions in appropriations, affecting the completion of grant closeouts. During the closeout phase, federal agencies can reprogram undisbursed grant funds for other grant-related purposes, depending on budget authority. Congress could incentivize expedited closeouts by allowing agencies to reprogram recaptured funds. However, budget authority limits the ability to reprogram funds from expired grant accounts unless they have multi-year or no-year budget authority. Otherwise, funds would be returned to the Treasury. The OMB published new guidance on federal grant management reforms on December 26, 2013, combining requirements into one document. Congress can determine how recaptured funds are reprogrammed for various activities, such as increasing monitoring of federal grants or enhancing oversight capabilities. The OMB published new guidance on federal grant management reforms on December 26, 2013, consolidating administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for federal awards. The final guidance includes clear performance goals, indicators, milestones, internal controls, and grant closeout requirements. It also consolidates circulars regulating cost principles for grant recipients and includes new provisions on audit requirements. The OMB recently reformed grant guidance, impacting federal agencies' audit resolution practices. Congressional interest in financial oversight of federal grants is evident in key legislative efforts dating back to 1921. These laws established a framework for government-wide financial management leadership and uniform requirements. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 and the Single Audit Act of 1984 established uniform requirements for audits of federal grants to ensure efficient financial management of federal funds. The General Accounting Office, now the Government Accountability Office, was created to evaluate federal funds. The Single Audit Act of 1984 and subsequent legislation aimed to streamline audit processes for federal grants, allowing for consolidated financial reviews. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 reformed financial management structures, giving authority to the Office of Management and Budget. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 further enhanced financial monitoring of federal grants. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 (FFAMIA) and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) aimed to improve grant programs, simplify reporting requirements, and increase oversight into federal spending by establishing a publicly available database through USAspending.gov."
