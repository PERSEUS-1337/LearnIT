The \"Fair and Speedy Treatment (FAST) of Medicare Prescription Drug Claims Act of 2007\" requires prompt payment for clean claims submitted under prescription drug plans, ensuring payment within a specified number of days after claim receipt. The \"Fair and Speedy Treatment (FAST) of Medicare Prescription Drug Claims Act of 2007\" mandates timely payment for clean claims related to covered part D drugs, defining clean claims as those without defects or special circumstances hindering prompt payment. The term \"applicable number of calendar days\" specifies 14 days for electronically submitted claims and 30 days for other submissions. The \"Fair and Speedy Treatment (FAST) of Medicare Prescription Drug Claims Act of 2007\" requires timely payment for clean claims related to covered part D drugs. If payment is delayed beyond the specified number of calendar days, interest will be paid at a designated rate until the payment is made. A clean claim for a covered part D drug is considered timely if the PDP sponsor does not notify the claimant of any deficiencies within 10 days of claim submission. The notification of deficiency must detail all defects in the claim and request any additional information or documents. The PDP sponsor must pay any clean portion of a claim for a covered part D drug, even if there is a defect or impropriety in another part of the claim. If a claim for a covered part D drug is not paid or contested by the provider within the specified number of days, it must be processed for payment. The PDP sponsor is required to pay clean claims promptly, with full payment considered received on the date of payment. Electronic transfer of funds is mandated for clean claims submitted electronically. This also applies to MA-PD Plans under Section 1857(f) of the Act. The provisions of section 1860D-12(b)(4) regarding prescription drug plan contract requirements apply to contracts with a Medicare Advantage organization, effective for contracts entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act.
