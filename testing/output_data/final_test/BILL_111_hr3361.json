The Congress finds that Medicare spending could grow significantly, Congress allocated funds for comparative effectiveness research in 2009, and MedPAC suggested using cost-effectiveness analysis for Medicare services. MedPAC has raised concerns about the limitations of cost-effectiveness analysis in Medicare, including potential access restrictions, rationing of care, innovation slowdown, and interference with medical practice. They have also highlighted methodological and reporting flaws in cost-effectiveness analysis, such as not utilizing all clinical evidence, selective reporting, and overemphasis on certain results. Peter Orszag, while at the Congressional Budget Office, mentioned the challenge of assigning a dollar value to determine cost-effective treatments for specific populations. CMS has struggled to incorporate cost effectiveness analysis into NCDs despite recognizing its importance. They consider potential cost savings before narrowing coverage under Medicare. AARP and the Congressional Black Caucus express concerns about the use of comparative effectiveness research to limit access to appropriate healthcare options based on cost or average patient outcomes. Congressional New Democrats also weigh in on the issue. The Congressional New Democrats and the American Heart Association emphasize the importance of protecting patient access to care and focusing on clinical effectiveness in comparative effectiveness research funding. The American Heart Association also calls for patient safeguards to prevent the misuse of cost effectiveness analysis. Congress emphasizes the need to ensure Medicare's financial sustainability without denying necessary care based on cost or limiting access based on age, gender, ethnicity, or disability. It is crucial for the Administrator of CMS to consider clinical expertise when proposing coverage changes. Additionally, a process for certain national coverage determinations is outlined. Requirements for the issuance of certain Medicare National Coverage Determinations are outlined, including restrictions on coverage for items or services previously covered, cost savings implications, controversy in medical literature, and adherence to clinical practice guidelines. The issuance of certain Medicare National Coverage Determinations requires adherence to clinical practice guidelines endorsed by national organizations or state medical societies. If significant differences in expert opinions exist, the Administrator will determine what evidence should be reviewed. The Administrator requests MEDCAC to review scientific evidence for proposed NCDs before the public comment period. MEDCAC convenes a subcommittee for this purpose. MEDCAC convenes a subcommittee to review evidence supporting proposed NCDs, considering subpopulations and patient preferences. The subcommittee under MEDCAC evaluates clinical evidence and risks of technologies affected by NCDs to determine impact on Medicare beneficiaries' access to necessary care. It consists of 15 clinical experts in relevant medical specialties. The subcommittee under MEDCAC evaluates clinical evidence and risks of technologies affected by NCDs to determine impact on Medicare beneficiaries' access to necessary care. It consists of 15 clinical experts in relevant medical specialties, with expertise in the development of clinical practice guidelines. Outside experts may also be included in the subcommittee. The subcommittee must submit a public comment on the NCD evaluating its appropriateness based on their activities. The subcommittee under MEDCAC evaluates NCDs to ensure they are consistent with clinical guidelines and do not adversely impact access to necessary care for Medicare patients. If the NCD could prevent access to medically necessary care, the subcommittee must provide a public comment on its appropriateness. The MEDCAC panel evaluates NCDs to ensure they align with clinical guidelines and do not hinder access to necessary care for Medicare patients. Recommendations against issuing final NCDs with coverage restrictions not in the proposed NCD are made. Medicare beneficiaries can use private funds for supplemental insurance or to directly purchase needed care. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator (CMS head), CMS (Medicare & Medicaid Services), MEDCAC (Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee), and medically necessary services as care provided by a prudent physician according to accepted standards. The term \"MedPAC\" refers to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, while \"national coverage determination\" is defined as per section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act."
