The Senate agreed to the conference report on H.R. 5385 on September 29 by a vote of 100-0. The President signed the bill the same day (P.L. 109-289). Funding for Fiscal Year 2007 was sustained by continuing resolutions, including H.R. 5631 (P.L. 109-289) which continued appropriations through November 16, 2006. Additional resolutions extended funding through December 18, 2006, and February 15, 2007. H.J.Res. 20 (P.L. 110-5) passed by the 110th Congress on February 15, 2007, continued appropriations through the end of Fiscal Year 2007. President George W. Bush recommended an additional $93.4 billion emergency supplemental appropriation for the Global War on Terror in his Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request. The emergency supplemental appropriation for the Global War on Terror in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Appendix includes funds for military construction to build urgent facilities such as buildings, perimeter fences, secure fuel facilities, and roads to improve force protection. The funds will also be used for theater-located operations facilities, housing, maintenance, and training infrastructure to support an expansion of Army and Marine Corps ground combat forces. The FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriation for the Global War on Terror includes funds for military construction to support ground force operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The funding breakdown includes $980.0 million for facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, $85.1 million for Navy facilities in Djibouti and Guantanamo, and $60.2 million for Air Force airfield facilities in Afghanistan. Approximately $100 million is allocated for enhancing ground forces by transitioning Army and Marine units into Brigade Combat Teams. The FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriation for the Global War on Terror includes funds for military construction to support ground force operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Approximately $729 million would build housing and facilities for 92,000 new troops to be added to Army and Marine end strength by the end of 2012. The Committee on Appropriations reorganized its subcommittee structure during the first session of the 109th Congress, resulting in the creation of a new Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies with jurisdiction over appropriations for Department of Defense accounts. The Department of Defense accounts include Military Construction, Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense-wide, Guard and Reserve Forces, Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization, Chemical Demilitarization Construction, Military Family Housing Construction and Operation, Family Housing Improvement Fund, Unaccompanied Housing Improvement Fund, Homeowners Assistance Fund, Basic Allowance for Housing, Environmental Restoration Accounts, Base Realignment and Closure Account, NATO Security Investment Program, and Defense Health Program Account. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies are also included. The Senate Committee on Appropriations dissolved its Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and transferred its responsibilities to the Subcommittee on Military Construction, which was renamed the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. House and Senate appropriators agreed that legislation considered would include appropriations to all relevant accounts. The House and Senate aligned their appropriations subcommittees in the 110th Congress, resulting in a new jurisdictional alignment and renaming of subcommittees. Non-construction defense appropriations were returned to the Subcommittee on Defense, including Facilities Sustainment, Basic Allowance for Housing, and the Defense Health Program. The Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies was renamed to the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies in the 110th Congress. H.R. 5385 considered funding for the Defense Health Program (DHP) in FY2007, totaling approximately $21 million for military health care programs. This funding included support for military medical facilities and contracts with Tricare civilian health care providers. The House approved $21.065 million, while the Senate approved $21.409 million for the DHP. Actions to implement recommendations for defense base closures and realignments began in FY2006. The list includes closing 25 major military bases, realigning 24 others, and carrying out 765 other actions by September 2011. This was the fifth time a commission participated in deciding which military installations to close or reduce. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 authorized multiple rounds of base closures and realignments. The 2005 round was authorized in an amendment to the original law. The BRAC 1990 account funds environmental remediation on federal properties from previous rounds. The BRAC 2005 account funds environmental remediation on federal properties deemed excess, realignment and closure actions, construction of new infrastructure, and accommodation for units redeployed from overseas. Funding amounts for FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 were $246 million, $252.2 million, and $191.2 million respectively. The United States is redeploying military units from overseas garrisons, primarily in Germany and the Republic of Korea, as part of the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy (IGPBS). The BRAC 2005 account funds environmental remediation, realignment and closure actions, and construction of new infrastructure for this purpose. Congress appropriated $1.59 billion for FY2006 and the President requested $5.6 billion for FY2007, following historic patterns for BRAC appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended $5.3 billion and $5.2 billion respectively for FY2007 military construction. BRAC funding for FY2007 had to be included in continuing resolutions due to Congress not passing a separate appropriation. The final appropriation for FY2007 was a year-long continuing resolution that extended appropriations through September 20, 2007. Funding exceptions were made for certain accounts. The 2005 BRAC Commission estimated significant increases in populations at military installations like Aberdeen Proving Ground, Ft. Meade, Ft. Belvoir, Ft. Bliss, and Ft. Sill. Local jurisdictions near these installations are concerned about creating infrastructure to support the population growth, including education for children. Some school boards are worried about receiving federal impact aid in time to build new school facilities for families moving into areas near military installations. The Department of Defense had a slow recapitalization rate in 2001, funding military construction at a rate that would replace its property inventory every 192 years. The Department of Defense had a slow recapitalization rate in 2001, aiming to replace its property inventory every 192 years. The Fiscal Year 2007 budget request supported a recapitalization cycle of 72 years, approaching the goal of 67 years. The NSIP is the US contribution to the NATO infrastructure fund, focusing on construction for defense purposes. The Committee on Appropriations recommended $201.0 million for the NSIP, prioritizing projects for NATO missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President requested $221.0 million for FY2007, the House approved $201.0 million, and the Senate approved $206.0 million. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 provided for the termination of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Senator Russell D. Feingold proposed an amendment to extend the investigative authorities of the SIGIR to cover funds for Iraq reconstruction in 2006. The measure was incorporated into the national defense authorization bill and became part of H.R. 5122. The reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan in 2004 was addressed in the authorization bill conference, with funds for Iraq in 2006 being treated as part of the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. Senator Feingold's amendment extended the investigative authorities of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to cover funds for Iraq reconstruction in 2006, which became part of H.R. 5122. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004, designates funds for Iraq reconstruction in 2006 to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The Office of the Inspector General is set to terminate on October 1, 2007, with transition operations authorized until December 31, 2007. The Senate amendment expanded the authority of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) to include funds for relief and reconstruction in Iraq from the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The House clarified that SIGIR jurisdiction is limited to U.S. funds and set a sunset date of October 1, 2007, with transition operations authorized until December 31, 2007. The conferees support the SIGIR's audit efforts and mandate a transition plan by April 1, 2007, to ensure continuity in overseeing Iraq reconstruction funding. The conferees mandated a transition plan by April 1, 2007, to oversee Iraq reconstruction funding, considering various contingency scenarios. A significant change in assumptions would require adjustments to the plan and timeline. The bill became law on October 17, 2006 (P.L. 109-364), with Senators Collins and Lieberman questioning the termination provision. The conferees, including Senators Collins and Lieberman, were surprised to find a provision in the bill that they were not aware of. Senator Collins had introduced an amendment related to military construction appropriations, but the conferees did not see this provision in the last version they reviewed. They emphasized the need to correct the issue and extend the office's lifespan. The Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 is amended to specify the termination of the Office of the Inspector General based on the expenditure of funds from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction will prepare a final forensic audit report on funds allocated to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund before the office's termination. The Senate approved the amendment by voice vote, and the bill passed on November 14, 2006. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an additional $507 million for military construction projects supporting contingency operations related to the global war on terrorism. These funds were designated for urgent transformation efforts, operations in the theater, and training in urban operations and close quarters combat. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funds for military construction projects supporting contingency operations related to the global war on terrorism, including training in urban operations and close quarters combat. However, a point of order was raised against these appropriations as they violated House Rules. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $50 billion in additional appropriations for the global war on terrorism in Fiscal Year 2007. $897 million was suggested for Army housing allowances. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits to veterans and their dependents through various programs. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides various benefits to veterans and their dependents, including compensation for disabilities, pensions for disabled war veterans, education and training services, loan guarantees for homes, medical care, life insurance, and burial assistance. The Administration's budget for FY2007 proposes $77.9 billion in funding for the VA, a $6.5 billion increase from FY2006. The FY2006 total, including supplemental appropriations (P.L. 109-234), added funds for a replacement VA Medical Center in New Orleans. The Senate and House passed budget resolutions for FY2007, with the House recommending $74.6 billion and the Senate increasing it to $74.8 billion for veterans benefits and services. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill (H.R. 5385) with a similar amount for the VA. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions for FY2007, with the House recommending $74.6 billion and the Senate increasing it to $74.8 billion for veterans benefits and services. The bill, as passed by the House on May 19, 2006, would provide a total of $77.9 billion for the VA budget with $36.5 billion of the bill's $94.7 billion 302(b) allocation going for VA discretionary spending. VA entitlement spending rose from $31.2 billion in FY2004 to $38.1 billion in FY2005 and is projected at $38.2 billion. In FY2005, VA entitlement spending rose to $38.1 billion and is projected to reach $38.2 billion in FY2007. The Veterans Health Administration provides primary care, specialized care, and related services through an integrated health care system, operating hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and outpatient clinics. Additionally, VHA pays for care provided by independent providers and practitioners on a fee basis. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides healthcare services to eligible dependents of veterans under CHAMPVA, grants for construction of nursing homes, and collaborates with the Department of Defense. The President's FY2007 budget proposal requested $32.7 billion for VHA, including legislative proposals for enrollment fees and pharmaceutical co-payments. The House passed the MIL-CON-QUAL-appropriations bill for FY2007, providing $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration. This includes $25.4 billion for medical services, a $2.6 billion increase from FY2006. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a $32.7 billion funding for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2007, including $28.7 billion for medical services, a significant increase from previous years. The bill does not authorize fee increases as proposed by the Administration. The Committee-recommended amount for the MIL-CON-VA-appropriations bill is higher than the President's request and the House-passed amount. It includes funding for medical facilities, prosthetic research, and does not authorize fee increases as proposed by the Administration. The third continuing resolution extended funding for VHA and provided VA with the authority to transfer funds into the medical services account. Since FY2007, VA has used unobligated balances to cover a $250 million monthly shortfall in VHA accounts. Controversy arose during Senate consideration of the FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act regarding funding for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. Congress increased funding for this program in FY2006 due to concerns about brain injuries from IED attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. Final funding for the program in FY2007 will be determined in the conference version of the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, Veterans Affairs & related agencies bill. The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center is funded within the \"Blast Injury Prevention, Mitigation and Treatment\" program, receiving $10.7 million out of $19.6 million appropriated in FY2006. Congress increased funding for blast injuries from $7 million to $19.6 million in FY2006, including money for treatment and research. In FY2007, DOD proposed $7 million for the program, with $4.9 million allocated for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. An amendment to the FY2007 DOD Appropriations bill was adopted by the Senate on September 6, 2007. In FY2007, an amendment to the DOD Appropriations bill allocated $19 million for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. The House maintained DOD's request for $7 million for the Blast Injury Prevention program. Conferees will need to resolve funding differences for the program in the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is responsible for maintaining U.S. monuments and memorials commemorating the achievements of U.S. armed forces since World War I. They maintain 24 military memorial cemeteries and 25 monuments in 15 countries. The ABMC also planned and constructed the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC.
