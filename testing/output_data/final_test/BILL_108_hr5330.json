    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Utah Recreational Lands Exchange Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that the areas surrounding the Colorado River in Grand County, Utah, Dinosaur National Monument in Uintah County, Utah, and the Book Cliffs area of Uintah County, Utah, contain nationally recognized scenic values, significant archaeological and historic resources, valuable wildlife habitat, and outstanding opportunities for public recreation. The State of Utah owns multiple parcels of lands granted by Congress to be held in trust for the benefit of the State's public school system and other public institutions. State trust lands in the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and Book Cliffs areas hold significant natural and recreational values for Utah's public schools and other beneficiary institutions. These lands include Westwater Canyon, Kokopelli and Slickrock trails, natural rock arches, and more. The United States owns lands and interests in lands in Utah that can be transferred to the State of Utah, which could complicate land and resource management in areas with State trust lands like the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and Book Cliffs. Development of Utah State trust lands in these areas may conflict with their recreational, natural, and scenic values. The United States owns lands in Utah that can be exchanged with State trust lands in the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and Book Cliffs areas. The purpose is to dispose of Federal lands with limited values and acquire State trust lands with important recreational and conservation values for public management. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"Offered Lands\" as Utah State school trust lands to be conveyed to the United States, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"Selected Lands\" as public lands to be conveyed to the State, and \"State\" as the State of Utah. The exchange directed by this section shall be consummated if, within 30 days of enactment, the State offers to transfer the Offered Lands to the United States. The State shall convey certain lands in Utah to the United States, subject to valid existing rights. The Secretary shall convey certain land in Utah to the State, comprising approximately ____ acres in Uintah County and ____ acres in Grand and Uintah Counties, as depicted on maps dated October 2004. SEC. 5. EXCHANGE VALUATION, APPRAISALS, AND EQUALIZATION. The values of Offered Lands and Selected Lands in an exchange must be approximately equal, or adjusted to be equal. Appraisals for determining these values should use comparable sales data and follow recognized appraisal standards. The State must contract independent appraisers to assess the Offered Lands and Selected Lands for an exchange, ensuring their values are equal. Appraisals should follow recognized standards and use comparable sales data. The Offered Lands must be appraised within 120 days of selection, with the Secretary and State independently reviewing and approving appraisals within 90 days. Disagreements on land value can be resolved through mutual agreement or by the United States District Court if no agreement is reached within one year. The United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, has jurisdiction to determine the value of lands. No action can be filed sooner than 1 year or later than 3 years after the enactment of this Act. If the final value of Offered Lands exceeds Selected Lands, the Secretary will delete Offered Lands until values are approximately equal. If the final value of Selected Lands exceeds Offered Lands, adjustments will be made. If the final value of Offered Lands exceeds Selected Lands, adjustments can be made by deleting lands or adding additional State trust lands. The lands must be previously appraised and accepted by the Secretary. SEC. 6. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. (a) Land Status.-- Lands acquired by the United States under this Act become part of the administrative unit where they are located. Mineral revenues from these lands are subject to the Mineral Leasing Act. Selected Federal lands are withdrawn from public land laws and mining laws. On exchanged lands, the acquiring party must honor grazing permits for domestic livestock, including terms and conditions, stocking rates, grazing fees, access rights, and range improvements. Upon lease or permit expiration, the holder has a preference right to renew as per Federal or State law. The State can cancel grazing permits if the land is used for non-grazing purposes. Lands conveyed by the State can still qualify as base properties for Federal grazing permits. The Secretary and State must provide access for review of hazardous materials. The State must provide access to review hazardous materials on lands for exchange. The land exchange authorized by this Act must be completed within 330 days unless an extension is agreed upon. This Act satisfies the public interest requirement for land exchanges under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
