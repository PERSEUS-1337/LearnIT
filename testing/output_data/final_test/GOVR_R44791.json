    "content": "The funding authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is set to expire on March 31, 2018. FAA authorization acts typically set policy on civil aviation issues. Most FAA programs are financed through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF). The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was established in 1970 to expand the nation's airports and air traffic system. It provides the majority of FAA's annual funding through various revenue sources such as passenger ticket taxes, air cargo fees, and fuel taxes. In 2016, the AATF had revenues of over $14.4 billion and a cash balance of more than $14 billion. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) had a cash balance of over $14 billion in 2016, with an uncommitted balance of around $5.7 billion. Despite a recent growth in revenue and a projected increase in the near term, concerns remain about the fund's long-term sustainability due to reductions in general fund appropriations to the FAA and changes in airline business practices affecting AATF revenue. Airlines increasingly impose fees for various options and amenities, like checked bags and onboard meals, separate from the base ticket price. These fees are not subject to federal excise taxes, resulting in over $4.17 billion in baggage fees alone in 2016. General aviation operators, particularly corporate jets, are debated to contribute more to the trust fund. Proposals to increase general aviation jet fuel tax were not adopted in 2012. In recent years, FAA funding has totaled between $15 billion and $16 billion annually, divided among four main accounts. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) receives the largest portion of the budget, funding air traffic operations and aviation safety programs. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for projects like runway construction and noise mitigation. No proposals for per-flight user charges have been enacted into law. The Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account funds air traffic facilities and equipment acquisition and maintenance, research on aviation safety and efficiency, and environmental impact reduction. The federal government supports airport infrastructure development through federal grants for capital projects like runways and taxiways, and allows airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC). Congress has authorized airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, which can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds. Investors receive preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued for airport improvements. Airports may also use state and local funds, operating revenues, and different funding sources to finance projects, with small airports more dependent on AIP grants and larger airports more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds. In a 2007 study, GAO found that bonds financed 50% of airports' capital spending, AIP 29%, PFCs 17%, state and local contributions 4%, and airport revenue 4%. The assessment of airport capital needs is crucial for determining federal support to maintain a safe and efficient national airport system amidst bankruptcies and mergers in the U.S. passenger airline industry. Since 2000, major airline mergers have led to a reduction in commercial flights. Carriers have consolidated operations, flying fuller planes with an average load factor of nearly 85% in 2017. The FAA and ACI-NA have projected airports' long-term financial needs, estimating a total of $32.5 billion for FY2017-FY2021. Bonds, AIP, PFCs, state, and local contributions finance airport capital spending. This assessment is crucial for federal support amidst industry bankruptcies and mergers. The FAA and ACI-NA have projected airports' long-term financial needs, estimating a total of $32.5 billion for FY2017-FY2021. The ACI-NA survey resulted in an estimate of $99.9 billion over the same years, with differing views on airport projects to include. The FAA study included designated airports based on aviation activity forecasts and AIP grants, while the ACI-NA study cast a wider net, including projects funded by PFCs, bonds, or state/local funding. The ACI-NA estimate of airport capital needs is significantly higher than the FAA estimate, including security projects funded by airports or TSA, AIP-ineligible projects, and AIP-eligible projects not requesting funding. FAA focuses on evaluating capital needs at major airports, with studies like FACT3 showing improved reliability and reduced congestion in the air traffic system. The study found that while NextGen is helping to manage delays caused by airport congestion, new capacity and other solutions are still necessary to address traffic growth and reduce delays at some of the largest and busiest airports. Capacity constraints across the aviation system may not be as dire as in previous analyses, but several of the busiest airports would continue to be capacity-constrained in the near term. The AIP provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning, ranging from large commercial airports to small general aviation airports. The AIP provides federal grants to small general aviation airports for construction of improvements related to aircraft operations. Commercial revenue-producing facilities are not eligible for AIP funding. AIP funds distribution reflects congressional priorities for airport safety, security, capacity, congestion reduction, noise and environmental mitigation, and financing small state and community airports. AIP grants can provide funds for capital projects without the financial burden of debt financing, with airports required to provide a modest local match. The AIP program provides federal grants for small general aviation airports to fund projects listed in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). Funding levels have fluctuated over the years, with gaps between authorized spending and actual expenditures. The AIP program's funding levels have varied over the years, with increases in authorization starting in FY2001. Funding peaked at $3.47 billion in FY2008 and was authorized at $3.35 billion annually through FY2017. The distribution system for AIP grants is complex, involving formula grants and discretionary funds. The AIP program distributes funds through formula grants and discretionary funds to specific airports. Entitlements are apportioned by formula and can be used for various airport projects. Different categories of airports receive funds through different formulas, and most airports have up to three years to use their apportionments. The AIP program distributes funds through formula grants to specific airports based on passenger boardings. Non-hub commercial service airports have up to four years to use their apportionments. The apportionment for primary airports is based on the number of boardings, with a minimum allocation of $1 million. The AIP program allocates funds based on passenger boardings, with a minimum allocation of $1 million for primary airports. Cargo service airports receive 3.5% of funds, while general aviation airports receive 20%. Remaining funds are distributed based on a state-based population and area formula. The FAA makes project decisions. The FAA controls the distribution of funds for airport projects based on a state-based formula. Some states see these funds as an opportunity to address general aviation needs statewide. Alaska receives supplemental funds to ensure airports receive double the funding compared to 1980. Large and medium hub airports forgo a portion of their AIP formula entitlements if they collect a passenger facility charge of $3 or less. Small airports can receive discretionary grants from a special fund. The discretionary fund receives 87.5% of forgone funds from small airports, while the remaining 12.5% goes to a separate discretionary fund. FAA approves discretionary grants based on project priority and other criteria. At least 35% of discretionary funds are set aside for noise compatibility planning and abatement. Funds are allocated for noise compatibility planning, noise abatement, and compatibility programs. 4% of discretionary funds are reserved for converting military airports. Two-thirds of 1% of discretionary funds are set aside for reliever airports in metropolitan areas with flight delays. The Secretary of Transportation ensures that 75% of grants are used for airport capacity, safety, security, and noise compatibility planning. FAA must allocate $5 million for testing innovative aviation security systems from the remaining 25% of funds. The Secretary of Transportation has discretion in distributing grants from the discretionary fund for aviation security systems. Participating states receive block grants for projects at small airports, with responsibilities including project selection, funding, and compliance with federal priorities. States like Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and New participate in the state block grant program. The federal government shares for airport improvement projects vary depending on the type of airport. Participating states in the block grant program include Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. Large and medium hub airports receive a 75% federal share, while other airports receive a 90% federal share. Certain exceptions and transition periods may apply for specific airport projects. Communities receiving subsidized air service may be eligible for up to a 95% federal share of project costs, with smaller airports paying a lower share than larger airports. Smaller airports heavily rely on AIP grants to meet their capital needs, especially noncommercial airports. Grant applications require assurances for future airport operations, such as public availability without economic discrimination. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires airports to adhere to certain conditions to receive Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants, including non-discriminatory public use, financial reporting, and expenditure of revenue on airport costs. These obligations extend beyond project completion and may last up to 20 years. Airports can request release from these obligations, but federal obligations for land purchased with AIP funds do not expire. Decisions on airport expansion projects funded by AIP grants have implications for reauthorization. Large runway projects can take 10+ years from concept to construction. Runway projects at large and medium hub airports are often funded in part by AIP funds. Airports may need AIP funding for projects required by 2025. Airport sponsors may need to use AIP discretionary funds for runway projects due to restrictions on passenger facility charges. If AIP budget is constrained in the future, large airports' capacity expansion projects may be limited. Congress could prioritize capacity enhancement at large and medium hub airports by shifting AIP funds. One option is to eliminate the requirement for large airports to forgo 75% of their entitlement, giving them a greater share of funding but reducing grants to small airports. Changes in discretionary fund set-asides could provide FAA more flexibility in fund usage. Statutory set-asides of discretionary funds could give FAA more flexibility to use money for capacity enhancement, potentially reducing funding for noise mitigation. The current AIP structure benefits smaller airports more than medium hub airports. Policy changes allowing airports to use entitlements more flexibly could benefit smaller airports but may conflict with reducing congestion at major airports. Allowing large and medium hub airports to opt out of the AIP and rely on PFCs could reduce trust fund revenue needed for the AIP. Large and medium hub airports could opt out of AIP and rely on PFCs for financing capital projects by raising or eliminating the federal cap on PFCs. This would release airports from some AIP grant assurances, potentially reducing AIP spending or redirecting funds to other airports. The PFC was introduced in 1990 as a user charge to supplement AIP funding. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) is a fee imposed on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at airports. Initially capped at $3 per airport and $12 per round trip, the PFC is used to finance eligible airport projects and can also be used to service debt. In 2000, the PFC ceiling was raised to $4.50 with an $18 limit per round trip, requiring airports to demonstrate significant improvements in air safety, competition, or congestion reduction to exceed $3. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) is a fee imposed on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at airports. Large and medium hub airports imposing PFCs above the $3 level forgo 75% of their AIP formula funds. PFCs at large and medium hub airports may not be approved unless the airport has submitted a written competition plan to FAA. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 made permanent the pilot program that authorized non-hub small airports to impose PFCs. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) is a fee imposed on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at airports. PFC revenues are heavily used for landside projects such as terminals and transit systems on airport property, and for interest payments. Annual system-wide PFC collections grew from $85.4 million in 1992 to over $3 billion in 2016, with a broader interpretation of \"capacity enhancing\" projects compared to AIP funds. Air carriers must be notified and consulted about the use of PFC funds. The central legislative issue related to Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) is whether to raise or eliminate the $4.50 per enplaned passenger ceiling. Airports argue for increasing or eliminating the ceiling, while air carriers and some passenger advocates oppose higher limits on PFCs. A GAO study in January 2015 showed that raising the cap would significantly increase PFC revenues. The GAO report suggests that raising the cap on Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) would increase collections for airports but could slow passenger growth. Airport operators want more flexibility in using PFC funds for off-airport projects, while carriers are concerned about the use of funds for low-priority projects. Major carriers also seek more influence over project decisions. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) was established in 1996 to explore privatizing publicly owned airports. Participation has been limited, with only two airports completing privatization. Lack of interest in privatization among U.S. airports may be due to decisions being made by local and state governments or public entities, rather than resident air carriers. Airport privatization in the United States is limited due to various factors such as readily available financing for publicly owned airports, barriers to privatization, implications for stakeholders, and satisfaction with the current system. Most cases of airport privatization in the US involve partial privatization, with full privatization being rare. This can include outsourcing noncore operations to private firms specializing in those functions. Outsourcing of noncore operations to private firms specializing in services such as cleaning, landscaping, shuttle bus operations, and concessions is common in U.S. airports. Management contracts are also utilized for specific facilities or responsibilities like parking, terminal concessions, and airfield signage. Developer financing and operation contracts involve the private sector in providing financing, development, operation, and maintenance services, known as the Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM) model. The DBFOM model involves private sector financing, development, operation, and maintenance services for airport facilities like passenger terminals, parking garages, and rental car facilities. Full privatization can include long-term lease or sale of an airport to a private owner, granting management control in exchange for capital improvements and other obligations. Ownership and responsibility for operation can be transferred to a private buyer in a full sale. Airport privatization in the United States involves major stakeholders like airport owners, air carriers, private investors, and the federal government. Privatization can impact passengers through airport services, efficiency, and pricing. Local governments may see privatization as a revenue source, but federal regulations dictate how privatization revenue is used. Passenger interests are often not formally represented in privatization discussions. Federal regulations require that revenue from airport privatization be used for airport purposes, unless airlines agree otherwise. Privatization involves surrendering control of the airport, potentially leading to loss of public-sector jobs. The APPP grants exemptions to public-sector owners regarding revenue diversion. Air carriers aim to keep costs low and have control over airport revenues. Air carriers aim to keep costs low and control airport revenues. They are interested in low landing fees and rents for facilities, which may conflict with private operators' revenue goals. However, carriers also want well-maintained airports and may support privatization for lower charges and better services. Private investors seek financial returns and focus on growth potential, like increasing flights and improving amenities for additional lease revenue. The federal government, through the FAA, is exploring private capital involvement in aviation infrastructure development to reduce reliance on federal grants. However, FAA must also ensure safety and enforce grant assurances made by airports. Privatization proposals that may impact airport capacity or favor certain users will be carefully scrutinized. The FAA is exploring private capital involvement in aviation infrastructure to reduce reliance on federal grants. Privatization proposals must balance stakeholder interests and comply with regulations. The APPP allows exemptions for participating airports from certain requirements, with the number of airports able to participate increased to 10 in 2012. Only one large hub commercial airport can join the program. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) allows for the privatization of general aviation airports, with only one large hub commercial airport eligible for leasing. The program has seen limited success, with 11 airports applying and only two completing privatization. Westchester County Airport, NY, is the most recent applicant. The APPP has not generated widespread interest in airport privatization due to modest results. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) allows for the privatization of airports, but the process is time-consuming and risky. The application process involves filing a preliminary application with the FAA, which can take years to complete. Once preliminary approval is received, the airport can select a private operator, negotiate an agreement, and submit a final application. FAA review of the final application has no set timeline. After FAA proposes approval in the Federal Register, there is a 60-day public review period. Airport privatization under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) involves a lengthy process with regulatory requirements that may deter interest. These requirements include approval from 65% of air carriers, restrictions on rate increases exceeding CPI, and compliance with previous grant assurances. Post-privatization, the airport can receive AIP formula grants covering 70% of improvement costs, compared to the usual 75%-90% federal share for publicly owned airports. Privatizing an airport under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) involves regulatory requirements that may discourage interest. Post-privatization, airports can receive 70% federal funding for improvements, compared to 75%-90% for publicly owned airports. Lack of resources is less of an issue for airport operators compared to highway and public transportation agencies. Publicly owned airports have access to various funding sources, including federal grants and passenger facility charges. Tax-exempt bonds secured by airport revenue offer cost-effective financing for airport projects. Tenant leases, landing fees, and state/local grants are also important revenue sources. Privatizing a publicly owned airport outside the APPP may result in the private operator facing challenges in accessing federal funds and issuing tax-exempt bonds. The private operator of an airport under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) would have more freedom to impose fees and charges, but would need to provide a 30% match for federal grants. They cannot issue tax-exempt bonds and face limitations on raising fees for air carriers. Airport privatization in the United States has been less attractive due to federal laws, unlike in Europe and Canada where major airports were previously owned by national governments. The tax-favored status of debt issued by U.S. state and local governments also hinders privatization efforts. Congress is interested in privatization to reduce federal assistance dependency and increase aviation capacity. Airport privatization in the United States has faced challenges due to federal laws and the tax-favored status of debt issued by state and local governments. Congress aims to reduce federal assistance dependency and increase aviation capacity. Streamlining the privatization process under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) could make it more attractive, but structural changes to the airport financing system may be necessary to significantly increase interest in privatization. This could include offering the same tax treatment to private and public airport infrastructure bonds. The text discusses potential changes to airport financing to make privatization more attractive, such as extending tax benefits to private airport infrastructure bonds and reducing requirements for private operators to obtain grants. These changes could incentivize shifting airports from public to private ownership. Privatization of airports could be more appealing to investors with AIP funding. However, changes like selling airport property may conflict with federal interests in aviation system capacity and safety. Liberalizing fee rules, allowing more flexibility in imposing charges and fees, and easing limits on revenue use could stimulate privatization interest but may face airline opposition and potentially lead to higher costs for passengers and shippers. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires assessment of noise impacts on aviation infrastructure. Noise concerns have been contentious in airspace redesigns and airport expansion projects. Reductions in aircraft noise levels have been significant over the past 30 years, with a decline in residents exposed to significant noise. Louder Stage 2 airliners over 75,000 pounds have been phased out. The FAA has phased out louder Stage 2 airliners over 75,000 pounds and mandated quieter noise standards for all jet airplanes by 2015. New aircraft must meet Stage 4 noise standards, with plans for even stricter Stage 5 standards. Noise reduction achieved through engine technology, lightweight materials, and aerodynamics. Collaboration with NASA and industry on quiet aircraft technologies. Despite quieter aircraft, air traffic volume has increased around major airports in the past 30 years. The volume of air traffic has increased around major airports in the past 30 years. Congress has allocated 35% of discretionary funding under the AIP for noise mitigation and abatement. There are proposals to grant the FAA flexibility to fund noise mitigation projects in areas with lower noise levels, but this could divert resources from capacity and safety projects. NextGen is a modernization of air traffic technologies and procedures to expand airspace capacity. NextGen is a multiyear initiative to modernize the national airspace system by using satellite-based navigation and aircraft tracking. It aims to reduce air traffic separation, improve airspace utilization, and minimize environmental impacts. The system targets full implementation by 2025. The FAA established the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) to develop and implement the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) by 2025. The JPDO released the Integration National Plan for NextGen in 2004, aiming to improve air transportation safety, security, mobility, efficiency, and capacity. Failure to implement NextGen could lead to increased air travel congestion and costs. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 refined and expanded NextGen implementation, establishing the Chief NextGen Officer position and requiring annual progress reports to Congress. It also directed reviews of ADS-B ground system installation and enterprise architecture for NextGen, aiming to accelerate deployment of technologies and procedures. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 directed FAA to accelerate NextGen technologies and procedures deployment, track national airspace performance metrics, evaluate airport surveillance technologies, establish a NextGen research center, and promote public-private partnerships for NextGen avionics equipage. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 defunded the JPDO and directed FAA to absorb its functions into NextGen operations planning. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 directed FAA to accelerate NextGen technologies and procedures deployment. In May 2014, FAA moved the JPDO functions into a newly created NextGen Interagency Planning Office. NextGen is described as a significant effort of cross-boundary transformation by integrating air traffic control infrastructure with cockpit instrumentation. Cargo airlines played a key role in developing core NextGen technological concepts in the 1990s. Cargo airlines, including UPS, played a significant role in developing core NextGen cockpit technologies in the 1990s. UPS received recognition for its development of ADS-B technology, which is now a key component of the NextGen system. UPS Aviation Technologies, later acquired by Garmin Ltd., contributed to the advancement of ADS-B avionics and GPS navigation devices. Garmin has become a major supplier of ADS-B equipment and advanced avionics in the aviation industry. In 1999, FAA started the Capstone Program in Alaska to test GPS, ADS-B, and advanced avionics for general aviation safety. This program laid the foundation for the NextGen initiative. In 2001, FAA established the Operational Evolution Plan to address future capacity needs in the aviation system. The Operational Evolution Plan (OEP) proposed technology solutions for future capacity requirements in the nation's busiest airports and airspace, including RNAV procedures, WAAS, controller-pilot data link technologies, and reduced vertical separation. These components later became part of the NextGen initiative, which aims to provide increased operating flexibilities and efficiency in air traffic control. The NextGen initiative aims to modernize air traffic control by replacing radar with satellite-based GPS for aircraft tracking. It receives over $1 billion annually in funding through the FAA's Facilities and Equipment account. Key components include Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) for transmitting and receiving aircraft data. The FAA funds the installation, operation, and maintenance of a ground network to receive ADS-B transmissions and relay them to air traffic facilities and aircraft. Most aircraft will need \"ADS-B Out\" capability by 2020. System Wide Information Management (SWIM) is a data sharing system for aviation, similar to the Internet, to share real-time operational information. Data Communications (DataComm) is a digital voice and data network for transmitting instructions and routine communications. NextGen technologies include telephone capabilities for aircraft communication, CATMT for automation tools, NVS for digital voice communications, and NextGen Weather for weather information. Upgrading FAA facilities and equipment is crucial for NextGen implementation, including completing the ERAM program. The Enroute Modernization (ERAM) program is an essential upgrade to automated air traffic systems at FAA's en route centers, supporting NextGen. ADS-B ground receiver stations are deployed, and performance-based navigation (PBN) procedures have been implemented. While over 90% of air carrier fleet is equipped with PBN navigation, less than 20% of airline and air taxi fleet is ADS-B equipped. General aviation fleet has low equipment for NextGen environment. The FAA faces challenges in implementing NextGen due to stakeholder reluctance to adopt new technologies, citing uncertainties about technical details and benefits. Only about 20% of the general aviation fleet has installed compliant ADS-B units as of November 2017. FAA mandated that most aircraft in controlled airspace must equip with approved ADS-B Out equipment by 2020. The FAA mandated that most aircraft in controlled airspace must equip with approved ADS-B Out equipment by 2020, rejecting the no-action alternative due to the radar-based system becoming obsolete. A cost-benefit analysis of the final rule identified benefits totaling $6.8 billion to $8.5 billion over the period from 2009 through 2035, with costs ranging from $3.3 billion to $7.0 billion over the same period. The FAA estimated costs of equipage for ADS-B Out equipment to be between $2.5 billion and $6.2 billion, with a midpoint of $4.4 billion. Small U.S. business operators were found to bear a disproportionate impact, with over 1,500 incurring costs greater than 1% of annual revenues. Additionally, more than 1,000 operators would incur costs greater than 2% of annual revenues. General aviation costs were estimated to total $1.2 billion to $4.5 billion. To offset some of these costs, FAA sponsored a rebate program for operators of single-engine general aviation airplanes installing compliant ADS-B transmitters. The FAA sponsored a rebate program for operators installing compliant ADS-B transmitters, providing $500 reimbursement. The program has ended with no future incentives announced. Aimed at airlines and business jet operators, FAA proposed a \"best-equipped best-served\" concept to promote investment in NextGen technologies. ADS-B offers benefits like traffic and weather data for small general aviation aircraft. FAA plans to encourage more users to adopt NextGen technologies. The FAA aims to encourage more users to adopt NextGen technologies, including ADS-B equipment mandates. There is no formal policy on best-equipped best-served practices, with variations expected regionally. NextGen technologies are expected to provide benefits in efficiency, safety, and cost savings for both commercial and general aviation operators. Airlines are projected to benefit from direct routing, reduced flight delays, and fuel savings under NextGen. NextGen technologies offer benefits such as fuel savings, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced emissions for commercial operators. General aviation operators will also benefit from improved airspace and airport access. NextGen technologies like WAAS improve navigational accuracy for civil aviation by correcting GPS signal errors. WAAS was developed by the FAA in 1995 and allows aircraft to fly instrument approaches using GPS for lateral and vertical guidance. WAAS technology provides guidance for aircraft in poor weather conditions, reducing diversions and fuel costs for operators. FAA has over 3,700 approach procedures using WAAS, allowing pilots to descend to 200 feet above ground with 1.5-mile visibility. Maintenance costs for WAAS are significantly lower than traditional systems like ILS, making it a cost-effective option for airports. The main costs to airports include upkeep of runway lighting and markings for approach certification, addressing impacts of new towers near the approach path, and implementing WAAS for precision NextGen procedures. WAAS enables precision approaches, while ADS-B In provides benefits to operators with equipped navigation equipment. FAA ground stations transmit TIS-B and FIS-B data for free to ADS-B In capable aircraft, including air traffic, weather, and aeronautical information. The FAA is working on implementing technologies like ADS-B In to enhance safety for aircraft. However, there are concerns about the management of the NextGen program and the delivery of promised safety improvements for general aviation. Interagency coordination and uncertainties regarding cost and schedule of NextGen implementation are also significant policy concerns. The challenges for NextGen implementation include future funding, aircraft equipage compliance, air traffic control restructuring, FAA leadership stability, and cybersecurity risks. Despite this, spending has aligned with early estimates and FAA has implemented risk management strategies. Funding for infrastructure and industry equipage remains a significant challenge, with estimated costs of $21 billion for infrastructure development and $14 billion for avionics upgrades. Global harmonization of equipment is also a policy concern. The challenges for NextGen implementation include future funding, aircraft equipage compliance, air traffic control restructuring, FAA leadership stability, and cybersecurity risks. Policy concerns involve achieving global harmonization of equipment and procedural standards, measuring progress from NextGen initiatives, and ensuring reliable backup systems. FAA is consolidating air traffic facilities to control costs, replace outdated facilities, and improve services, primarily focusing on TRACON facilities in major metropolitan areas. FAA is consolidating air traffic facilities by decoupling combined airport tower/approach control facilities and merging approach control functions across larger areas. Outdated combined tower/TRACON facilities are being replaced with towers only, while TRACON components are relocated to consolidated facilities. Low-activity towers losing TRACON components may be outsourced under the FCT program. Facility consolidation, controversial and delayed, is a key concern for FAA labor unions. About half of US airport control towers operate under the FCT program. The FAA's plan for realignment and consolidation of air traffic facilities has been significantly delayed. The agency is focusing on replacing the New York terminal radar approach control facility instead of moving forward with a long-planned integrated control facility for the airspace around New York City. This shift in focus is due to fiscal constraints and political sensitivity surrounding potential job losses in specific congressional districts. Consolidation initiatives in the FAA could lead to job losses in certain congressional districts, impacting air traffic controllers and support personnel. The NextGen system aims to modernize airspace and streamline job functions into fewer facilities. The FAA is required to develop a report with recommendations for realignment and consolidation, including cost savings and timelines, for Congress to review and approve within 30 days. The FAA is required to develop a report with recommendations for realignment and consolidation of air traffic control facilities. Congress has the opportunity to disapprove any recommendations within 30 days. FAA has released documents addressing consolidation options in certain regions, but its future plans remain uncertain. About half of U.S. airports with control towers are operated by private firms. The FAA oversees 253 contract towers operated by private firms under the FCT program, with 16 towers funded by local entities. FAA is responsible for regulation and safety oversight, with contract towers and controllers certified by FAA. The cost-share program allows communities to retain towers if benefits outweigh costs. Except for 16 cost-share towers, FCT program towers are fully funded by FAA at about $140 million annually. The FCT program, overseen by the FAA, has a budget of about $140 million annually, including $10 million for cost-share towers. It was established in 1982 after a nationwide air traffic controller strike. Initially a pilot program at five airports, it grew to 27 towers by 1993. Vice President Albert Gore's National Performance Review endorsed the program in 1993, leading to its expansion to 160 towers by FY1997. Congress funded the cost-sharing program in FY1999. The FCT program, funded by Congress in FY1999, allows airports to maintain contract tower operations with nonfederal funds. Currently, 16 towers are funded through this program at a cost of roughly $10 million annually. However, limiting the local share to 20% of a tower's costs could lead to tower closures in communities unwilling or unable to contribute additional funding. A 2012 audit found that contract towers cost almost $1.5 million less annually than FAA-staffed towers at airports with comparable levels of flight activity. The audit found that contract towers cost $1.5 million less annually than FAA-staffed towers at airports with similar flight activity levels. Contract towers achieved savings through lower staffing levels and controller pay. They also had a lower rate of safety incidents and similar satisfaction levels with services compared to FAA towers. In March 2013, the Budget Control Act of 2011 led to cost-cutting measures, including potential closure of up to 238 control towers at airports with fewer than 150,000 flight operations or 10,000 commercial operations per year. In March 2013, the FAA announced the closure of 149 contract towers due to budget cuts. Congress passed the Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 to provide funding to prevent the closures. The FAA prevented the closure of 149 contract towers by fully funding the program after Congressional intervention. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to reform the contract tower program by increasing transparency and expanding the program, but these provisions were not implemented. The potential safety impacts of long-term tower closures could be mitigated by in-cockpit situation awareness technologies and remote air traffic services. In-cockpit technologies include moving maps and cockpit displays of traffic information, while remote air traffic services could provide a solution for general aviation aircraft. ADS-B technology used in NextGen may offer a cost-effective means for general aviation aircraft to enhance their situation awareness capability. The FAA will require most aircraft to be equipped with ADS-B Out capability by 2020, but there is currently no mandate for ADS-B In capability. Remote air traffic services could provide a solution for general aviation aircraft to enhance their situation awareness capability. Remote or virtual towers are being considered as a cost-effective alternative to manned towers by utilizing data from systems like ADS-B and surface radar. Consolidated facilities could lead to reduced staffing compared to stand-alone towers. Testing of remote tower technologies is ongoing at Leesburg Executive Airport and plans are in place to launch a virtual air traffic control test site at the Fort Collins/Loveland airport. Legislation such as H.R. 2997 and S. 1405 aim to establish pilot programs at airports in small and rural communities. S. 1405 proposes a pilot program for airports with and without control towers, allowing two vendors to participate. An amendment would include airports with remote tower technology in the contract tower program. Physical security risks were highlighted by an arson incident at FAA's Chicago air traffic control center. The importance of redundancy was highlighted during a system disruption at FAA's air traffic control facilities in Chicago. Criticisms have been raised about the physical and cybersecurity measures in place, with recommendations for developing a coordinated approach to cybersecurity and improving preparedness for major disruptions. The fire at Chicago's air traffic control center revealed inadequacies in training, redundancy, resiliency, and flexibility. Recommendations include improving contingency planning, testing emergency safeguards, and assessing NextGen capabilities for enhancing resiliency. P.L. 114-190 mandates FAA to develop aviation cybersecurity principles, address airspace modernization, aircraft automation, and develop a cybersecurity threat model and standards plan for FAA information systems. H.R. 2997 and S. 1405 address cybersecurity measures for FAA information systems and aircraft avionics systems. H.R. 2997 focuses on reviewing and modifying cybersecurity frameworks for air traffic services, while S. 1405 directs FAA to review and revise regulations for aircraft avionics systems and secure flight guidance systems against unauthorized access. Congress has debated transferring air traffic services from FAA to an independent entity for decades. Many proposals and bills have been put forth over the years to transfer air traffic services from the FAA to an independent entity. The main alternatives considered are corporatization, establishing air traffic services as a government corporation, and privatization, involving private ownership and control. Privatization proposals in the United States have faced obstacles, particularly in terms of funding. The proposed entity for air traffic services would be self-sustaining through user fees, but opposition from general aviation and Congress has hindered this. Borrowing costs are another obstacle, as the entity would face higher costs without federal backing. The FAA has taken some steps towards privatization, such as contracting out certain air traffic control operations. The FAA has increased the use of design-build-maintain contracts for air traffic control equipment. In the 114th Congress, there was a proposal to transfer air traffic operations to a government-chartered private corporation funded by user fees imposed on airlines, but it faced opposition. The proposal to transfer air traffic operations to a government-chartered private corporation funded by user fees faced opposition from business aviation interests. The FAA reauthorization measure passed by the Senate did not include language to reform FAA air traffic functions by corporatizing or privatizing activities. The Trump Administration's \"Budget Blueprint\" for FY2018 indicated plans to initiate a multi-year process. The FY2018 proposal, released on March 16, 2017, aimed to shift air traffic control functions from the FAA to an independent, nonprofit private entity funded by user fees. President Trump supported this reform in the AIRR Act, advocating for a professional board to manage the new system, which would be financially self-sufficient and have access to capital markets for technology investment. The framework for privatizing air traffic control calls for a three-year transition period, transferring federal assets and liabilities to a private entity at no cost. It also emphasizes that the corporation should not be charged for radiofrequency spectrum use and should honor existing labor agreements. H.R. 2997 proposes creating an American Air Navigation Services Corporation to control air traffic services in U.S. airspace by FY2021. A governing board selected from the aviation industry and labor organizations would oversee the corporation and set user fees. FAA would handle safety oversight, while airlines and manufacturers would retain their safety responsibilities. The bill has support from airlines, airline pilots, and air traffic. S. 1405, in contrast to H.R. 2997, does not address air traffic control reforms. Recent changes in FAA's controller selection process have sparked controversy. FAA switched to a single nationwide vacancy announcement for all qualified U.S. citizens aged 18-30. The FAA made substantial changes to its air traffic control hiring process, following recommendations from two reports on workplace diversity barriers. The new process evaluates all applicants using a single set of criteria, requiring prior applicants to reapply. Previously, candidates with a specified AT-SAT score were chosen for interviews, but the new process involves a biographical assessment. The FAA implemented a new hiring process for air traffic control, using a biographical assessment to evaluate applicants' experience and aptitude. Approximately 28,000 applications were received in response to a February 2014 announcement, with 8% of applicants passing the assessment and 1,600 receiving conditional job offers. The FAA's new hiring process for air traffic control included a biographical assessment to identify successful candidates and reduce costs. However, concerns were raised by colleges and universities participating in the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program, as some students were not found eligible or did not receive high scores on the assessment. FAA's AT-CTI program faced challenges as job announcements did not receive high scores on the biographical assessment. FAA data showed only slightly higher success rates for AT-CTI graduates in completing training. The Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General found issues with FAA's controller hiring revision, recommending better applicant tracking and addressing delays in the hiring process. P.L. 114-190 limited FAA's hiring process. P.L. 114-190 restricted FAA's hiring process for air traffic controllers, giving preference to experienced controllers and AT-CTI graduates. It prohibited the use of biographical assessments for these applicants and required reevaluation of those disqualified based on the assessments. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 was enacted in response to concerns over regional airline safety. It required the FAA to make regulatory changes addressing pilot fatigue, qualifications, training, oversight, and crew resource management techniques. The act also led to significant changes in flight time and duty time regulations. The FAA issued new regulations in response to the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010, changing flight time and duty time limits for passenger airline flight crews. The regulations, effective in January 2014, set duty limits based on various factors and established a minimum 10-hour rest period between duty periods. Air carriers are also required to implement fatigue risk management programs. Additionally, new qualification standards for first officers were introduced, aligning them with airline captains' requirements. Regulations regarding airline training programs and safety management systems were also revised. The FAA issued new regulations in response to the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010, setting duty limits and rest periods for passenger airline flight crews. P.L. 114-190 mandated changes to air carrier training programs, including mentoring and leadership development for pilots. It also required the FAA to establish a pilot records database by April 30, 2017, and issue guidance on assessing pilot competency in manual flying skills and cockpit automation use. Additionally, the act directed the FAA to consider additional screening and treatment for pilots. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated changes to airline pilot flight time and rest requirements, including limitations on hours of flight and duty time to address pilot fatigue. FAA also required airlines to submit fatigue risk management plans and ensure all airline flight crewmembers obtain an airline transportation pilot certificate within three years. The FAA implemented new regulations on Flightcrew Member Duty and Rest Requirements in response to the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010. These regulations, effective since January 14, 2014, prescribe flight time, duty time, and rest requirements for passenger airline flight crews. Compliance is optional for cargo carriers under 14 C.F.R. Part 121, as they are considered unique operations. Pilot labor organizations advocate for uniform fatigue regulations, while the FAA and airline industry argue for separate rules for cargo operations. Efforts to include all-cargo pilots under the same duty and rest rules as passenger airline pilots were unsuccessful in the 114th Congress. Legislation to increase flight attendant rest periods did not pass either. However, H.R. 2997 and S. 1405 propose requiring the FAA to revise flight attendant duty periods and rest requirements to ensure a minimum 10-hour post-duty rest period. H.R. 2997 prohibits rest period reduction, while S. 1405 allows a single rest period to be reduced to 9 hours under certain conditions. Both bills mandate airlines to develop FAA-approved fatigue risk management plans for flight attendants. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated FAA to modify regulations for pilot certification, requiring pilots to have an airline transportation pilot rating. FAA issued a final rule in 2013, stating that all pilots and first officers operating under air carrier revenue operations must hold an airline transportation pilot certificate. Captains were required to have at least 1,000 flight hours in air carrier operations. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated FAA to modify regulations for pilot certification, requiring pilots to have an airline transportation pilot rating. FAA issued a final rule in 2013, stating that all pilots and first officers operating under air carrier revenue operations must hold an airline transportation pilot certificate. Captains were required to have at least 1,000 flight hours in air carrier operations. Some regional airlines and communities have complained about the limited supply of qualified first officers due to the new regulations, but pilot labor organizations argue that low wages make regional airline first officer jobs undesirable. FAA data shows a 5% growth in certificated airline transport pilots in the US over the past decade, but it is unclear if this growth can meet the demand of the aviation industry, especially regional airlines. GAO found mixed evidence on the supply of qualified pilots available to meet airline needs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated a need for 1,900 to 4,500 newly hired pilots annually over the next decade. While pilot employment and earnings have decreased since 2000, there is concern about fewer students entering pilot training programs. Regional air carriers may be most impacted by changes in the labor market for civilian pilots. The Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General reported in March 2017 that regional carriers have increased pay and offered bonuses to attract and retain pilots. The Inspector General found that regional airlines have increased pay and offered bonuses to attract and retain pilots. However, lengthy labor negotiations and new qualification requirements have led to lagging wage increases and increased pilot attrition. There is a growing trend of hiring pilots with more flight hours but less experience in multiengine aircraft, with an increase in pilots with restricted certificates being provisionally hired as first officers. Military pilots and certain college program graduates are utilizing feeder pathways to airline pilot careers. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation agreed to an amendment allowing non-academic ground training courses to count towards the 1,500-hour requirement for airline pilot certification. Currently, only flight hours can be counted towards this requirement. Concerns about tracking technologies on passenger aircraft were renewed after incidents in 2014, including the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The uncertainty surrounding the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March 2014 and the delayed locating of the crash site of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in December 2014 raised concerns about the reliance on ground-based radar for tracking aircraft. Despite the availability of GPS technology, air traffic control primarily uses radar. The FAA's NextGen initiative aims to implement GPS-based tracking, but it will be limited to the United States and unable to track aircraft beyond its network coverage area, leaving transoceanic and remote flights without continuous tracking. Pilots use radios for position reports during flights, which can also be done through ACARS, a satellite-based messaging system. ACARS is not mandatory for transoceanic flights and its configuration varies among airlines. Enhancements like more frequent position reports or continuous streaming of data could improve tracking over oceans and remote areas, but challenges like bandwidth limitations exist. In May 2014, Inmarsat began offering global aircraft tracking using ADS-C signals for free, but updates are only every 15 minutes. Aireon, a joint venture by NAV CANADA and Iridium Communications Inc., may provide a solution in the future for more frequent tracking updates. Aireon, a joint venture by NAV CANADA and Iridium Communications Inc., aims to offer global air traffic surveillance using 75 low-orbit satellites to track aircraft. By October 2017, 30 satellites were deployed, with full deployment expected by mid-2018. The system requires aircraft to be equipped with ADS-B technology for real-time global flight tracking. This service could be utilized by air navigation service providers, airlines, and aircraft operators to enhance safety and aid in locating downed aircraft. Some U.S. military aircraft have deployable flight recorders that eject before impact, aiding accident investigators. Legislation proposed requiring deployable recorders on commercial aircraft for extended-range operations. The recorder would combine cockpit voice and flight data recording capabilities. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 proposed continuous flight tracking and timely recovery of cockpit voice and flight data recorders for new passenger aircraft with 120+ seats using advanced technologies. Another proposal sought deployable recorder systems on new aircraft over 15,000 kg. H.R. 2997 and S. 1405 propose improvements in aircraft tracking and data retrieval systems, including automatic deployable flight recorders and satellite-based solutions. The bills also call for collaboration with international aviation authorities to develop a global approach to enhancing aircraft tracking standards. The FAA is developing new standards for aircraft tracking and data recovery, including options like underwater locating devices, extended-life batteries, and automatic deployable flight recorders. U.S. air carriers are outsourcing aircraft maintenance to contain costs. Airlines globally spent over $62 billion on maintenance in 2014, representing 9% of their total operating costs. Aircraft maintenance includes heavy maintenance activities like airframe inspections and structural overhauls. Aircraft maintenance involves structural inspection, engine repair and overhaul, component repair, and line maintenance to ensure aircraft functionality and safety for flight. Engine MRO is a complex process that includes disassembly, inspection, repair, and testing. Line maintenance consists of regular checks and defect rectification to keep the aircraft airworthy. Airlines are increasingly outsourcing maintenance to reduce costs. The percentage of outsourced aircraft maintenance work in the U.S. more than doubled from 1990 to 2011. Major airlines like Northwest, United, Delta, and U.S. Airways eliminated their in-house maintenance capabilities through bankruptcy restructurings. Aircraft engine work is often outsourced in North America or Western Europe, while labor-intensive heavy maintenance is done in Asian and Pacific countries like China. All airlines outsource some maintenance, with newer carriers outsourcing a large part of their maintenance. Some newer carriers have outsourced a large part of their maintenance, especially labor-intensive airframe heavy maintenance. The share of passenger carrier MRO outsourced work is expected to increase, with concerns about safety at foreign repair stations. Issues include quality control, regulatory oversight, mechanic skills and training, supervision, language skills, and drug testing programs. Regulatory standards for FAA-certified mechanics and repair workers at foreign repair stations may be necessary to address concerns about the lack of certified personnel. More extensive reporting requirements for air carriers could help identify areas where FAA-approved mechanics are insufficient. Maintenance of U.S. air carrier aircraft should be a priority for regulatory oversight. Maintenance of U.S. air carrier aircraft at foreign and domestic locations is regulated by the FAA. Repair stations must be certified under Part 145 with approved documentation and processes. Foreign repair stations can be approved based on a foreign certification from countries with aviation safety agreements with the U.S. Airframe and engine manufacturers are expanding into MRO services globally, leading to potential standardization of services and specialized MRO centers. The ongoing changes in the MRO industry will have implications for regulators like the FAA, which currently focuses on airlines' maintenance activities. If airlines continue to outsource maintenance, FAA's oversight model may need to evolve. FAA reviews and recertifies foreign repair stations annually, while domestic stations can retain certification indefinitely unless safety concerns arise. The FAA oversees foreign repair stations through bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement with the EU. Regulatory requirements for foreign repair stations are stricter than for domestic ones, but they do not have the same certification requirements for supervisors and authorized individuals. Concerns exist about the FAA's limited resources for inspecting foreign repair stations. The FAA oversees foreign repair stations with limited staff in regional and satellite offices in 13 foreign countries. FAA employs about 4,100 inspectors, with a small percentage dedicated to oversight of foreign entities. Inspectors ensure work at foreign repair stations adheres to regulations. However, the DOT OIG found inconsistencies in FAA's surveillance activities at foreign repair facilities, leading to difficulties in identifying deficiencies and verifying corrective actions. The DOT OIG identified systematic problems at foreign and domestic repair stations, including issues with mechanic training, tool calibration, and work documentation. Foreign regulatory agencies play a crucial role in overseeing maintenance on U.S. air carrier aircraft overseas through bilateral aviation safety agreements. The FAA delegates some inspection functions to foreign regulators and has agreements with about 28 countries, including a comprehensive one with the EU. The EU and the United States have formal procedures for coordinating maintenance oversight, with detailed annexes. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 addressed concerns over bilateral aviation safety agreements, ensuring foreign repair stations are subject to appropriate inspections. Annual inspections at foreign repair stations are required by the act. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated annual inspections at foreign repair stations to comply with international agreements. English proficiency is required for certificated mechanics and repairmen, including reading, speaking, and writing skills. While supervisors and inspection personnel must understand English, there is no formal requirement for other workers. FAA certification is not mandatory for working at a repair station, and there are no regulations on the number of certificated personnel. Repair stations are not obligated to assess or report English language proficiency, except for FAA-certificated mechanics with inspection authority. Aircraft maintenance at foreign repair stations requires English proficiency among FAA-certificated mechanics for inspection and repair tasks. Maintenance manuals and aircraft systems are often in English, but less technical tasks may not require English skills. Limited English proficiency among workers may not be a significant concern, as many countries have their own drug and alcohol testing programs at foreign repair stations. Countries implement drug and alcohol testing programs at foreign repair stations in accordance with ICAO aviation safety standards. Efforts are being made to harmonize these programs globally, but differences may exist due to privacy laws and other factors. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandates controlled substance testing for certain employees at repair stations. The FAA is set to issue rules for controlled substance testing of employees at repair stations outside the US, as mandated by the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The agency has not yet finalized the rule, citing the need for additional coordination. The extension act requires the FAA to focus on oversight of foreign repair stations performing heavy maintenance on air carrier aircraft and to establish a risk-based oversight system. The proposed rule for drug and alcohol testing at foreign repair stations has not been published yet. The FAA has not yet published a proposed rule on on-airport collision risks, which may be delayed due to DOT rulemaking priorities. Safety concerns have been present since the 1977 Tenerife runway collision. FAA has addressed surface movement safety through various investments and technologies like surface radar and electronic flight bags for pilots. Additionally, special pavement materials like Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS) have been installed. The FAA has implemented special pavement materials, known as Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS), at airports to prevent aircraft from colliding with structures or entering bodies of water. P.L. 112-95 mandated the development of a strategic runway safety plan with national goals and actions, including tracking and investigating runway incidents. The plan includes deploying systems to alert air traffic controllers and pilots of potential runway incursions. The FAA's Strategic Runway Safety Plan, published in November 2012, utilizes data collection and analysis tools to mitigate safety risks in airport surface movements and terminal area operations. Additionally, the plan includes the installation of runway status lights at 23 airports. The FAA has committed to installing runway status lights at 23 large airports and Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS) at additional airports to mitigate risks of runway overruns. Delays in implementing NextGen could impact technology needs for alerting controllers and pilots of potential runway incursions. Congress may address surface movement safety in NextGen development in FAA reauthorization. The Senate-passed FAA reauthorization measure included a provision to expedite metrics development for examining runway incursions and assessing runway safety effectiveness. S. 1405 would require FAA to assess available technologies for runway incursion warnings and expedite metrics development. FAA's slow progress in integrating drones into airspace is due to safety issues like avoiding air traffic and landing safely without operator links. The law mandated a test site program to study integration issues under operational conditions in airspace shared with manned flights. FAA selected six test sites in December 2013, and test flights have commenced. H.R. 2997 and S. 1405 would extend the test site program, with S. 1405 also seeking to facilitate testing of government-operated drones at the test sites and evaluate beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations. The FAA established test sites to study UAS integration issues in airspace shared with manned flights. Additionally, a demonstration project in the Arctic certified two commercial UAS systems. The FAA also created a Center of Excellence for UAS research, led by Mississippi State University. Final rules were issued for civilian drones weighing less than 55 pounds, allowing commercial operations with specific regulations in place. The FAA requires operators to obtain remote pilot certification and pass a security assessment to fly drones in controlled areas. While some restrictions can be waived, operations beyond visual line of sight and over crowds are not yet permitted. This limits potential applications such as drone delivery services and inspections of infrastructure. The FAA restricts drone operations to visual line of sight and prohibits flights over crowds. However, requests for waivers for beyond visual-line-of-sight operations and night flights to support various industries have been granted. Future expansion of commercial drone applications may depend on further regulatory actions to allow for routine operations in various conditions and permit multiple drones controlled by a single operator. The relaxing of regulations to allow more diverse commercial drone applications may be a topic of interest during FAA reauthorization debates. The 2012 act prohibits FAA from regulating small model aircraft used for recreational purposes, despite similarities to commercial drones. Concerns arise over recreational users ignoring airspace restrictions. FAA reported a significant increase in drone sightings near manned aircraft and airports. Incidents involving drones colliding with aircraft have raised concerns about unlawful drone operations. The incidents of drones colliding with aircraft have raised concerns about unlawful drone operations. P.L. 114-190 requires FAA to develop standards for remote identification of unmanned aircraft and establish civil penalties for operators interfering with emergency response activities. It also directs FAA to coordinate with NASA on research for unmanned aircraft traffic management. H.R. 2997 would mandate regulations for unmanned aircraft traffic management and low-altitude communication procedures. The bill aims to establish certification standards for low-altitude drone operations and update the UAS integration plan. It also addresses concerns about drone activities near critical infrastructure by setting procedures for imposing restrictions and implementing systems to detect unlawful drone operations. Despite having enforcement tools, FAA faces challenges in enforcing policies regarding unmanned aircraft. The FAA has enforcement tools like warnings and fines, but faces challenges in regulating unmanned aircraft. In 2012, a drone operator was fined for reckless flying at the University of Virginia. In 2014, a ruling by the NTSB regarding model aircraft regulations was reversed. In 2017, SkyPan International agreed to pay $200,000 in penalties for UAS violations. Despite enforcement efforts, there were 400 potentially dangerous UAS sightings in the first three months of 2017. The FAA's enforcement authority has not been highly effective in obtaining drone operator compliance with airspace rules, as shown by 400 potentially dangerous UAS sightings in the first three months of 2017. In December 2015, FAA issued a rule requiring registration for small UAS over 0.55 pounds, but a federal court ruling in May 2017 found that recreational drones are exempt from this requirement. Commercial drone operators still need to register their drones. This ruling has posed challenges for FAA enforcement of drone airspace violations. The ruling exempting recreational drones from registration requirements has posed challenges for FAA enforcement of drone airspace violations. S. 1405 and H.R. 2997 aim to authorize FAA to develop registration requirements for UAS, including model aircraft and hobby drones. Commercial space launches in the United States face global competition from Russia, France, and China. FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation regulates and licenses commercial space launch providers. The FAA's role includes promoting private-sector space launches and ensuring safety. Concerns about potential conflicts of interest led to a focus on safety in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996. The FAA has licensed over 270 space launches since 1989, with 10 active launch site operator licenses currently. Its authority covers launch and reentry of space vehicles, but not orbital activities. The FAA oversees commercial space operations and human spaceflight endeavors, including space tourism. Issues in the 115th Congress may involve liability for mishaps like the fatal test flight accident of SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise. Federal law requires liability insurance for space operations, with the government covering valid claims beyond insured amounts up to $1.5 billion adjusted for inflation. The FAA oversees commercial space operations and human spaceflight endeavors, including space tourism. Federal law requires liability insurance for space operations, with the government covering claims beyond insured amounts up to $1.5 billion adjusted for inflation. The insurance market is willing to provide additional coverage, which could reduce federal government risk. GAO recommended that FAA reassess its methods for determining commercial space launch insurance requirements periodically. The FAA has authority over commercial space operations and human spaceflight, including space tourism. Liability insurance is required for space operations, with the government covering claims beyond insured amounts up to $1.5 billion adjusted for inflation. The FAA issued regulations in 2006 related to human spaceflight requirements, limited to design features posing high risk. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 removed these limitations, allowing for more comprehensive regulations. However, as of now, the FAA has not implemented such regulations, leading to discussions on the need for a more comprehensive regulatory regime in the human spaceflight industry. The 114th Congress sought studies on impacts of construction projects on commercial space activities, but it was not included in legislation. S. 1405 would require these studies. FAA regulations for aircraft safety certification are complex, with efforts to streamline the process since the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. Issues with FAA's approvals process were found by the DOT OIG in 2013. The DOT OIG found in 2013 that issues with FAA's approvals process, limited resources, and communications had led to delays in the certification process. GAO found in 2014 that FAA lacks performance measures to assess progress on certification-related initiatives and that interpretation of regulations is inconsistent at the regional level. FAA has established quality management systems to standardize processes and minimize variations in regulatory interpretation. The regulatory consistency committee at FAA identified root causes of inconsistencies as unclear requirements, inadequate training, and a culture reluctant to resolve issues. Recommendations include better guidance, training, oversight, and communication for certification activities. Progress on these recommendations and regulatory revisions is ongoing, with a need for independent assessment. FAA is authorized to cover official travel expenses for expediting aircraft certification or approval processes. The Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016 called for comprehensive reforms to FAA certification processes, including the creation of an industry advisory committee to provide policy advice on safety certification issues. The bill aimed to establish performance objectives for aviation and industry regarding aircraft. The bill H.R. 4441 aimed to improve aircraft certification by setting performance objectives such as enhancing certification timeframe, accountability, risk management, and transparency. It also proposed routine oversight of organization designation authorization holders and formal procedures for delegation of authority. The bill H.R. 4441 aimed to improve aircraft certification by setting performance objectives such as enhancing certification timeframe, accountability, risk management, and transparency. It proposed routine oversight of organization designation authorization holders and formal procedures for delegation of authority. Additionally, it included establishing an expert review panel to assess the ODA program and streamline the certification process for safety-enhancing equipment in small general aviation aircraft. The FAA's research and development focus on aviation system safety, efficiency, and environmental impact reduction. Funding is divided between efficiency, safety, and energy/environmental projects. Industry advice is provided through the REDAC committee in areas like operations, airport technology, safety, human factors, and environment/energy. The FAA is mandated to create an annual national aviation research plan for congressional review. The FAA's research plan outlines five-year goals and funding needs, with a focus on NextGen. Funding for FY2017 is around $403 million, up from previous years. The Research, Engineering, and Development account is authorized at $166 million annually through FY2018, supporting research at various centers and academic programs. The FAA funds academic research through a joint university program, aviation research grants, and air transportation centers of excellence. P.L. 114-190 does not specify research topics. About 47% of FAA research is funded through the Facilities and Equipment account, which includes advanced technology development and NextGen system development. Funding also comes from the Airport Cooperative Research and Development program and the Airport Technology Research Program, derived from the AIP. The Airport Technology Research Program, funded by the AIP, provides 11% of FAA research funding. The Federal Aviation Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2016 called for a decadal survey and a five-year research plan, focusing on topics like cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and aviation noise. It also addressed the potential implications of air traffic control privatization on FAA research. The Senate's H.R. 636 sought funding for FAA research, engineering, and development activities, including research on various aviation technologies. However, these proposals were not enacted. The House Rules Committee's H.R. 2997 includes provisions for the \"FLIGHT R&D Act,\" authorizing funding for FAA research in the upcoming years. The bill proposes scaling back funding for FAA research and development over the next few years, directing research on various aviation technologies including UAS collision avoidance, cybersecurity, and air traffic surveillance. It also authorizes annual funding for research and development and addresses UAS integration and airfield pavement technologies. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 gave airlines freedom to determine domestic markets and airfares. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 allowed airlines to decide on routes and fares, leading to concerns about smaller communities losing service. To address this, Congress established the EAS program to ensure service to small communities with subsidies if needed. The program is administered by the DOT, setting minimum service levels for eligible communities. Congress has limited the program over the years by reducing subsidy support. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 amended the EAS program by requiring a minimum number of daily enplanements for eligibility. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 did not make changes to the program, but locations must have participated in the EAS program between September 30, 2010, and September 30, 2011, to remain eligible. An EAS-eligible place is defined as a community that received EAS compensation or a 90-day notice of intent to terminate EAS service. The DOT requires carriers to continue providing service to EAS-eligible communities. New communities cannot enter the program after October 1, 2012, unless in Alaska or Hawaii. Eligible communities must be more than 70 miles from a large or medium hub airport, have a subsidy rate per passenger of $200 or less, and meet other criteria. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program requires carriers to continue serving eligible communities located more than 70 miles from a medium or large hub airport. The program is funded through overflight fees and annual appropriations, with Alaska and Hawaii exempt from certain requirements. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 authorized $175 million annually for EAS funding, while the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 provided $155 million for FY2015. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded through overflight fees and appropriations, provides subsidies for air service to over 170 communities. In FY2016, DOT allocated over $298 million for service at 112 communities in the contiguous 48 states, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and 61 communities in Alaska. Some Alaska communities joined the program in 2015 and 2016, increasing the total number of participating communities. EAS subsidies support two to four round trips a day with small aircraft from EAS communities to major hub airports. The DOT issued a tentative order to enforce the 10-enplanement criterion affecting 13 communities with EAS subsidies totaling $25.5 million. Waivers were granted to 12 communities, keeping them EAS-eligible for FY2015. Another order was issued regarding a $200-per-passenger subsidy cap for communities near hub airports, impacting 62 out of 114 EAS communities. In FY2015, 30 communities received more than $200 per-passenger. The DOT granted waivers to 22 communities that received over $200 per-passenger subsidy in FY2015 and failed to meet the 10 enplanements per day requirement. These communities continue to receive subsidized EAS service under the Small Community Air Service Development Program established in the AIR-21 Act. Grants from the program help small communities improve air service at small hubs or smaller airports with significant local financial participation. The DOT's Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded at a lower level than authorized, has awarded 385 grants since FY2002. Despite a drop in new grant applications, the program still faces funding challenges. GAO testimony indicates mixed results, with less than half of grants achieving their goals. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) manages Reagan National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) oversees Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport under a 50-year lease extended until 2067. MWAA is governed by a 17-member board with members appointed by Virginia, DC, Maryland, and the President. MWAA is responsible for airport operations, maintenance, the Dulles Toll Road, and funding the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project to extend the Metrorail system to Dulles Airport and Loudoun County, VA. The federal government has restricted air traffic at Reagan National Airport since the 1960s to reduce congestion and promote growth at Dulles Airport. The FAA controls the number of slots available for takeoffs and landings at Reagan National, with restrictions on flight distances. Legislation in 2000 and 2003 increased slots and exemptions to the perimeter rule, allowing for more flights beyond 1,250 miles. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required the Secretary of Transportation to grant additional beyond-perimeter slots. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to grant eight additional beyond-perimeter slot exemptions based on specific criteria. Dulles Airport has seen a decline in domestic traffic, while Reagan National has experienced steady growth, surpassing 23 million passengers in 2015 for the first time. Dulles Airport's high cost per enplanement of $26 has been identified as a factor making it less competitive than Reagan National. The high cost per enplanement at Dulles Airport, $26, has been identified as a factor making it less competitive than DCA, which has a cost per enplanement of $14. DCA's proximity to central Washington, DC, and convenient transportation links have strengthened its position as the primary facility for domestic flights. Congress plays a significant role in defining and enforcing airline passenger rights. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has intervened in issues related to passengers' rights, particularly tarmac delays. Congressional hearings in 2009 led to DOT issuing rules on tarmac delays in 2010, with further regulations incorporated into the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The 2016 FAA reauthorization defined excessive tarmac delays but also changed how the threshold is measured, potentially giving airlines more flexibility in handling delayed flights. The DOT's Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings monitors airline compliance and investigates violations. The Department of Transportation's Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings enforces airline compliance with DOT regulations, investigates violations, and issues consent orders and fines. In 2016, DOT issued 29 consent orders and assessed $6,355,000 in civil penalties for aviation consumer rule violations. The civil penalty amount is determined based on factors such as harm caused, compliance disposition, financial condition, duration of violations, and case strength. Large air carriers face a maximum penalty of $27,500 per violation, while small businesses or individuals face a maximum penalty of $1,100. The Department of Transportation's Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings enforces airline compliance with DOT regulations, investigates violations, and issues consent orders and fines. Small businesses and individuals face higher maximum penalties for discrimination and engaging in unfair practices. If enforcement action is deemed necessary, OAEP could seek a civil penalty and consent order, which may lead to an enforcement hearing before a DOT administrative law judge. Since the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978, the federal government no longer controls airlines' prices or routes. The deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 removed federal control over airlines' prices or routes. Contracts of carriage, which are legally binding rules airlines apply to passengers, are not federally reviewed or approved. However, a contract that conflicts with federal laws may not be enforceable. Airlines have responded to price competition by charging separately for services like checked baggage and seat changes. These ancillary fees have led to consumer complaints, along with carriers' treatment of passengers on delayed or canceled flights. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 included provisions for passenger rights. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 included provisions for passenger rights, with some provisions not included in the final bill as similar protections were already in place through DOT rulemaking. Key provisions of P.L. 114-190 include GAO reporting on air carrier training programs for persons with disabilities and DOT issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking on accessibility matters. Section 2305 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act requires airlines to refund checked-bag fees for delays of 12 hours or longer on domestic flights and 15 hours on international flights. Section 2308 addresses excessive tarmac delays, defining them as lasting more than three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights, with regulations to be issued by the DOT. The new legislation under Section 2308(a) changes how excessive tarmac delays are defined, measuring the delay from the main aircraft door closure to the return to a disembarkation point. It does not specify a maximum time for deplaning after returning. Section 2309 requires airlines to allow children under 13 to sit with family members over 13 at no extra cost. Section 1102(j) extends the Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection through FY2017, established in 2012 to advise on passenger service improvements. The US has 114 \"open skies\" agreements governing international air services, allowing airlines to offer service between jurisdictions. The US has 114 \"open skies\" agreements allowing airlines to offer service between jurisdictions. One controversy involves US airlines opposing the expansion of Persian Gulf carriers due to alleged subsidies, urging the Administration to freeze flights and renegotiate agreements. Similar protests have occurred in Europe. The controversy involves Norwegian Air International (NAI), an Irish airline approved by DOT to operate transatlantic flights to U.S. destinations, leading to increased discount airline service. NAI is a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS), providing nonstop services to U.S. destinations from Europe under the U.S.-EU air service agreement. Norwegian Air International (NAI) is authorized to operate transatlantic flights to U.S. destinations under the U.S.-EU air service agreement. The airline's business model has faced opposition for potentially sidestepping Norway's labor laws by operating with an Irish air operator's certificate and sourcing crews from Asia, the U.S., and Europe. Despite objections, the DOT approved NAI's application, citing no legal basis for denial. The DOT approved Norwegian Air International's application to operate transatlantic flights despite labor-related concerns. The decision was made after consulting with the Departments of Justice and State. Organized labor groups filed a petition challenging the DOT order and may appeal to Congress and the Trump Administration. Critics may seek to address the decision through reauthorization legislation. Critics of the DOT order may seek to address the controversy through reauthorization legislation."
