    "content": "Under current law, charitable contributions from individuals, corporations, and estates and trusts are tax deductible in the year they are made. Tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organizations, including various types such as religious, educational, social welfare, health, international, and environmental organizations, can receive tax deductible charitable contributions. Individuals can claim deductions up to 50% of their adjusted gross income for qualified contributions to 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. Itemized deductions are phased-out for high income individuals, and unused charitable deductions can be carried forward for up to five years. Cash contributions require proper documentation for deduction. Corporations can deduct up to 10% of their taxable income. In 2008, total charitable giving was $307.65 billion, with individuals giving $229.28 billion, corporations giving $14.5 billion, and bequests totaling $22.66 billion. Grant making foundations gave $41.21 billion. Giving fell by 5.7% from 2007 to 2008 due to poor economic conditions. Religious organizations received 35% of all gifts, human services organizations received 9%, public society benefit organizations received 8%, and organizations focusing on international affairs received 4% of all gifts in 2008. In 2008, tax expenditures for charitable giving deduction were estimated at $47 billion, with a tax revenue loss of $39 billion in 2009 due to the weak economy. Changes in laws were made after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to accelerate income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions. In response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, legislation was passed to allow charitable donations to be deducted on 2004 tax returns. Only cash contributions to charities aiding tsunami victims qualified for the accelerated deduction, while other forms of donations did not. This requirement was made to align with relief organizations' requests for monetary donations to reduce shipping costs. Monetary donations reduce shipping costs for relief items. Accelerating charitable contribution deductibility has quantifiable benefits. For example, a taxpayer who donated $1,000 in January 2005 to aid tsunami victims could save $17 by claiming the deduction on their 2004 tax return. President George W. Bush signed the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 to provide temporary tax relief for Hurricane Katrina victims. The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 (KETRA) provided temporary tax relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina. It suspended giving limits, allowing individuals to deduct cash contributions up to 100% of their AGI and exempting charitable contributions from limitations. Corporations could also deduct cash contributions up to 100% for hurricane relief efforts. Additionally, KETRA expanded charitable deductions for inventory donations made between specific dates. The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 (KETRA) extended tax benefits to S corporations and partnerships, allowing enhanced deductions for donations of book inventory to schools. It also increased the mileage rate deduction for charitable purposes and excluded mileage reimbursements from hurricane relief charities from a volunteer's gross income. Additionally, individuals providing free housing to displaced Katrina victims could claim a personal exemption for such persons. The provisions were in effect from August 24, 2005, to January 1, 2007, with estimated revenue losses outlined in Table 2. The largest estimated revenue loss in KETRA was the suspension of giving limits, totaling over $1 billion. U.S. charitable donations aided relief efforts for natural disasters in 2005, with individuals contributing $5.83 billion and corporate donors giving $936 million. In 2005, corporate donors gave $936 million (13% of total disaster giving) mostly in the form of in-kind donations and services. Giving for natural disasters was concentrated in certain charitable sectors, with more than half going to human services charities for hurricane victims. Overall, inflation-adjusted giving increased by 9.2% between 2004 and 2005, but fell by 2.4% between 2005 and 2006. Giving as a percentage of GDP was 2.4% in 2005, higher than the 2004 level of 2.2%. The HAITI Act's accelerated deduction provision aims to reduce the net cost of contributing to disaster relief in Haiti, encouraging donations. Evaluating the provision involves assessing its impact on economic efficiency, equity, and complexity. The efficiency of the deduction depends on the additional giving induced, compared to the inframarginal impact on those who would have donated regardless. The accelerated deduction provision in the HAITI Act aims to reduce the cost of contributing to disaster relief in Haiti, encouraging donations. Empirical evidence suggests that charitable giving is relatively unresponsive to changes in the price of giving, making the marginal impact of the accelerated deduction likely to be small. The accelerated deduction provision in the HAITI Act aims to reduce the cost of contributing to disaster relief in Haiti. The deduction is likely to have a small impact on increasing donations, and there are concerns about its efficiency in crowding out donations to other charitable organizations. Empirical evidence suggests that donations for disaster relief may crowd out future charitable giving. The accelerated deduction provision in the HAITI Act aims to reduce the cost of contributing to disaster relief in Haiti. Donations for disaster relief did not crowd out charitable giving to other organizations. $470 million was donated to U.S. nonprofits in the 13 days following the earthquake in Haiti. Corporate giving in the 72 hours following the earthquake topped $43 million. The immediate outpouring of support following the Haiti earthquake resulted in over $43 million in corporate donations. Donors, including text-message donors, were motivated by convenience rather than tax benefits. The accelerated deduction provision in the HAITI Act may provide some tax relief, but the impact on behavior is minimal. The \"Hope for Haiti\" celebrity telethon also played a significant role in fundraising efforts. The \"Hope for Haiti\" celebrity telethon raised $58 million for Haiti relief efforts, surpassing the $18.3 million raised after the 2004 tsunami. Concerns about donor fatigue leading to a decrease in charitable giving were addressed with post-Katrina tax breaks for hurricane relief donations. Survey evidence showed that donor fatigue did not impact donations to other charities after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2005, donor fatigue did not cause donations to other charities to decrease significantly. Disaster-related giving made up less than 3% of overall giving, so donor fatigue, if present, was likely not substantial. Congressional actions may have helped mitigate donor fatigue by enhancing incentives for charitable contributions, but there are concerns about equity with provisions expanding charitable deductions. Only taxpayers who itemize deductions can benefit from the accelerated deduction, which may favor higher-income individuals. The standard deduction simplifies tax compliance for individuals not itemizing deductions. Higher income taxpayers are more likely to itemize and benefit from the charitable contribution deduction. Charitable contributions skew towards higher income taxpayers, violating vertical equity principles in a progressive tax system. The value of a deduction depends on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Accelerating charitable deductions for disaster relief can benefit taxpayers in different income tax brackets. The deduction value varies based on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, with higher income taxpayers receiving a larger tax benefit. However, this adds complexity to the tax code and may increase administrative burdens. Taxpayers have the option to claim earthquake-related charitable contributions on either their 2009 or 2010 income taxes, but some may not be aware of this choice. This could also potentially increase monitoring burdens on the IRS. The IRS may face increased monitoring burdens due to taxpayers claiming earthquake-related charitable contributions in both 2009 and 2010. Charitable giving response to the Haiti earthquake exceeded that of previous disasters, with $150 million donated in five days. Charitable donations for Haiti earthquake victims surpassed previous disasters, with $150 million donated in five days. Donations for Haiti now lag behind Hurricane Katrina but continue to outpace the tsunami."
