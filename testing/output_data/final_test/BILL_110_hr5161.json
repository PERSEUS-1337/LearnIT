    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Green Transportation Infrastructure Research and Technology Transfer Act\". Congress finds that transportation infrastructure contributes to water pollution due to impervious surfaces concentrating contaminants during storms. Scientists have developed technologies to control stormwater and mitigate pollution, but there are barriers to widespread implementation. The Federal Highway Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are working together on technical solutions. The Environmental Protection Agency has the expertise to promote green transportation infrastructure technologies through education and outreach programs. SEC. 3. REGIONAL GREEN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH CENTERS. Establishment of Regional Green Transportation Research Centers under title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation will provide grants to universities for green transportation infrastructure research and technology transfer. The objectives include developing innovative approaches to mitigate environmental impacts, integrating green infrastructure into wastewater management systems, and promoting adoption of green transportation systems by governments and the private sector. The Secretary of Transportation will provide grants to universities for green transportation infrastructure research and technology transfer. Nonprofit institutions of higher learning can apply for grants on a competitive basis, with a focus on disseminating best practices to State and local governments and the private sector. The Secretary will ensure regional diversity in grant recipients for transportation research. Selection criteria include expertise in transportation research, technology transfer resources, and partnerships with government and industry. The grant recipient must have the capability to provide leadership in developing national and regional best management practices for green transportation infrastructure, expertise in regional climate characteristics affecting green transportation technologies, ability to disseminate research results, and a strategic plan for grant implementation. The Secretary may support research and development of innovative technologies, construction techniques, and best management processes to mitigate the environmental impact of transportation infrastructure. This includes assessments of lifecycle environmental impact, integration of green elements into existing systems, and testing of new technologies. The Secretary supports research on innovative technologies and best practices to reduce the environmental impact of transportation infrastructure. This includes establishing a regional technology transfer program, studying the impact of regulations on green transportation technologies, and conducting public education campaigns to promote awareness of the benefits of green transportation infrastructure. The Secretary supports research on innovative technologies and best practices to reduce the environmental impact of transportation infrastructure, including activities to raise awareness and foster collaboration among regional governments, private industry, and other stakeholders. An annual meeting is convened to facilitate communication and disseminate best management practices. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of green transportation infrastructure, which includes preserving and restoring natural features to manage stormwater runoff and floodwaters. The text chunk discusses the implementation of green transportation infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff and floodwaters. It emphasizes the use of natural design techniques to infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain water close to its source while minimizing energy consumption and air pollution. The text discusses the establishment of Regional Green Transportation Research Centers and amendments to green transportation infrastructure. Section 504 of title 23, United States Code is amended to include the use of green transportation infrastructure for environmental protection and mitigating environmental impacts of transportation construction. The Institute will coordinate curriculum development with other Federal agencies. Subsection (b)(2)(A)(i) now includes options for green transportation infrastructure."
