    "content": "Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) were authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. They are tax-preferred savings accounts used to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses. To open an HSA, one must have a high-deductible health plan and generally no other health insurance coverage. The goal is to encourage saving for healthcare in retirement and incentivize consumers to be more active in their care. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) were created in 2003 to help individuals save money not spent on health services. High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) offer lower premiums and discourage unnecessary care. However, some argue that HSAs may lead to underutilization of healthcare services. This approach is part of Consumer-Directed Health Care (CDHC), which aims to make consumers more involved in their healthcare decisions. The report analyzes the effects of High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) on consumer-directed health care (CDHC). Data on their impact is now being collected and examined by various organizations and academics. The goal is to encourage consumers to be well-informed and choose cost-effective healthcare options. The report discusses the rules, trends, and policy questions surrounding High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Existing research is fragmented and inconclusive on the effects of HDHPs and HSAs on healthcare quality, retirement savings, uninsurance rates, and aggregate health expenditures. The report aims to document the current literature's strengths and weaknesses in this area. The report analyzes the existing literature on High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), focusing on their popularity and the high deductible associated with HDHPs compared to other insurance plans. The primary difference with HDHPs is the high deductible compared to other insurance plans. HDHPs limit out-of-pocket spending and distinguish between in-network and out-of-network. They are available in individual, small group, and large group markets. HSA-qualifying HDHPs have specific rules, including minimum deductibles and out-of-pocket limits. HSAs are savings accounts used for medical expenses like deductibles and copayments. Individuals can establish and fund Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) when they have qualifying High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and no other coverage. HSA contributions may be made by account owners, their employers, or others up to an annual limit. Contributions may be made at any point in the year, even after health expenditures have been incurred. Unused balances may accrue without limit. HSA contributions and income are tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses or if the account holder is at least 65 years old. Many insurance carriers provide HDHP/HSA plan holders with an HSA card, similar to a debit card, for paying health expenses. Contributions and income in HSAs are untaxed, and account balances can grow without limit. Policies may cover preventive care before meeting the deductible. Consumers can add money to the HSA even after incurring medical expenses. The report discusses insurance premiums and deductibles for those with HDHPs and possibly HSAs. The decision to choose an HDHP and open an HSA are separate but related. Factors influencing the choice of an HDHP may also influence opening an HSA, such as tax benefits for wealthy individuals and lower premiums for lower-income individuals. Individuals may choose an HDHP for lower premiums but may not have the same tax incentive for an HSA. Insurance plan options vary for those on the individual market versus employer-sponsored insurance. The price of the plan influences the decision to enroll in an HDHP and open an HSA. Premiums and deductibles for HDHPs and standard PPOs are provided in Table 1. The data on premiums and deductibles for HDHPs and standard PPOs are presented separately for the individual market, small firms, and large firms. In 2009, the average deductible for HDHPs in the individual market was $3,263, significantly higher than the legal minimum of $1,150. The average deductibles were between 40% and 180% greater than the minimum. In large firms, the HDHP deductible was about 3.4 times the PPO deductible, although the reason for this relationship is unclear. The relationship between HDHP and PPO deductibles is unclear, but HDHPs have high deductibles offset by lower premiums. Premium data is not available for individual health insurance. HDHPs with HSAs appeal to individuals of different health statuses, as they may benefit financially from the high deductibles and coverage of preventive care. Some believe these plans only benefit healthy individuals due to lower health expenditures. The healthy would spend little on health care, increasing tax-exempt savings. Predicting if HDHP/HSA is better financially is challenging. PPO and HDHP comparison in Figure 1 shows uncertainty in total out-of-pocket spending. PPO has $500 deductible and $1,000 max out-of-pocket expenses. The individual's expenditures under different insurance plans vary based on expenditure levels. At low levels, the individual pays the entire bill. At high levels, both plans cover 100% of health expenditures. Between these extremes, savings can fluctuate between a PPO and an HDHP. It is challenging to determine which plan saves money, especially during open enrollment when future health expenses are uncertain. Enrollment in HDHPs has steadily increased since 2004, with over one million lives covered in January 2005 and about 10 million covered lives by January 2010. The growth rate in individuals covered by HDHPs has slowed somewhat in recent years. The number of tax filers claiming an HSA deduction has been increasing, but at a decreasing rate. This trend mirrors the pattern seen with the growth of individuals covered by HDHPs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) analyzed IRS data on HDHP plan holders eligible for HSAs and found that 51% to 58% had opened an HSA between 2005 to 2007. Trustees of HSAs, typically banks, reported an aggregate value of $560 million in 2005, $1.7 billion in 2006, and $3.1 billion in 2007 to the IRS. Data on average balance over time across all HSAs is not available. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) has collected data on about 1.1 million HSAs from five large bank trustees, showing average balance trends by year opened. Accounts opened in 2004 include rollovers from Archer Medical Savings Accounts, making them incomparable. The average balances are similar for accounts opened in 2005 and 2006, with a slight decrease in 2007. This data suggests that account holders are saving money over time, but drawing concrete inferences is difficult due to similarities in 2005 and 2006 values. The literature review on consumer-directed care evaluates the impact of High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) on consumer behavior. HDHPs aim to incentivize cost-conscious healthcare decisions, but empirical studies have conflicting results. HSAs may encourage retirement savings, but data on demographic saving patterns are lacking. Higher income individuals are more likely to open an HSA, potentially benefiting previously uninsured individuals with lower premiums. High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) aim to incentivize cost-conscious healthcare decisions and potentially lower aggregate health expenditures. They alter the incentives of patients and doctors, impacting consumer behavior and healthcare quality. The ultimate health status of consumers depends on their behaviors and how these changes translate into health outcomes. HDHPs and HSAs can change consumer incentives by altering the out-of-pocket cost of care. High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) aim to change the out-of-pocket cost of care, impacting consumer behavior and healthcare quality. Compared to traditional plans, individuals with HDHPs spend their own money until reaching a higher deductible, which should reduce health spending. Individuals with HDHPs may hesitate to visit the doctor due to higher out-of-pocket costs compared to PPOs. This could result in lower health expenditures as they may choose to forgo medical visits. However, the tax savings from an HSA may increase overall willingness to spend on healthcare and other goods and services. The discussion focuses on the impact of HDHPs on healthcare utilization. It questions whether the financial incentives of HDHPs lower expenditures on \"unnecessary\" care while maintaining spending on \"necessary\" care. Consumer understanding of their health insurance plans is crucial for behavior change. The survey found that many consumers did not understand the terms of their insurance plans, but studies showed they behaved according to plan incentives. One study compared patients in HDHPs with those in HMOs regarding cancer screening behavior. Participants in an Aetna health fund were studied to compare the use of preventive services, cancer screening, and diabetic monitoring between those in a standard PPO and those in an HDHP. Plan switchers to the HDHP did not change their cancer screening behavior but may have switched to a fully covered colorectal screening test. During a three-year evaluation period, both PPO and HDHP groups showed similar service utilization. Studies indicate that individuals in an HDHP may not change behavior without incentives. Behavioral changes may take over a year to occur, as seen in an Emergency Department study. Switching to an HDHP led to reduced ED visits for low severity conditions, but only after the initial visit, suggesting a need for better understanding of HDHP workings. If these findings generalize, HDHPs may not effectively promote behavioral changes. Two studies suggest that HDHPs may not worsen consumer health, but another study found that individuals with HDHPs were more likely to avoid seeing a doctor when needed and take lower doses of medication. This behavior change was similar to the results of the RAND health insurance experiment. Individuals in an HDHP from a single insurance company cut back on outpatient services and pharmaceuticals. The varying results of studies on High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) suggest uncertainty in how consumers respond to the incentives provided. Consumer-directed healthcare, including HDHPs and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), has implications for patients, physicians, and healthcare providers. Consumers may be more engaged in directing their healthcare, requiring providers to answer questions and provide necessary information for informed decision-making. This shift towards consumerism may also impact legal doctrines. Some providers may prefer traditional doctor-patient relationships over consumerist ones, as consumerism could lower the average level of care. Consumerist patients may receive more time with providers by asking more questions, potentially reducing care for traditional patients. There is little agreement on measuring care quality and incentivizing health insurance companies to inform patients. Proper incentives for health insurance companies to inform patients of provider quality include objective measures like rates of medical errors and subjective measures like patient satisfaction. Consumer-directed health care may shift responsibility to consumers when purchasing HDHPs and HSAs. The responsibility for treatments typically lies with medical professionals and insurers, but under consumerism, patients may take on more responsibility. This shift could reduce providers' defensive practices. The impact of HDHPs/HSAs on physician behavior is uncertain. If these plans promote more careful healthcare consumption, patients' health may improve. However, there is a risk that focusing on price could lead to inadequate care. The RAND health insurance experiment in the 1980s showed mixed health effects. The RAND health insurance experiment in the 1980s found minimal effects overall, but individuals who were poor and sick experienced reduced health service use and some health consequences, such as increased likelihood of death. It is uncertain if these results would still hold today. Studies focus on the impact of HDHPs on patient tasks like doctor visits and cancer screening, but it is too early to evaluate their effects on actual health. Another goal of supporting HSA legislation is to help individuals save for retirement. The reason for supporting HSA legislation is to assist individuals in saving for post-retirement medical expenses. Analyzing retirement savings requires data on HSAs as HDHPs alone do not facilitate retirement savings. Differentiating between HSA account holders using their accounts for savings versus those depleting their balances annually is crucial. Longitudinal data on HSA balances is limited, so individuals with HSAs are compared to those without to determine if they are saving for retirement. This section explores demographic differences between those with and without HSAs. The demographic characteristics of individuals with HSAs are compared to those without HSAs. Less than 60% of individuals with HDHPs open HSAs, possibly due to low income individuals opting for HDHPs for low premiums or lack of understanding about the benefits of HSAs. HSAs are more popular among higher income individuals who can afford high deductibles. Studies show a direct relationship between income and HDHP and HSA holders. In 2004, 77.7% of Kaiser-Permanente HDHP enrollees had annual incomes of at least $35,000, compared to 62.5% of non-HDHP PPO enrollees. The average adjusted gross income in 2005 was $139,000 for HSA activity filers and $57,000 for others. A study found that HSA holders in 2008 were almost equally distributed across different income tracts. Using exact income measures is preferred over geographic averages for accuracy. The studies show that individuals enrolling in HDHPs and HSAs tend to have higher incomes. Demographic differences exist, with black individuals less likely to have HDHPs and those with higher education levels more likely to have them. Different income levels, races, and education levels impact how individuals save for retirement healthcare. Tax provisions allow for tax arbitrage in health and retirement savings accounts. Tax arbitrage is possible with health and retirement savings accounts, taking advantage of different tax treatments of HSAs and 401(k) plans. Workers may benefit financially by putting money into HSAs instead of 401(k)s if their employer does not contribute to the 401(k). HSAs offer tax-exempt contributions, investment income, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses, with tax-free withdrawals at age 65 and above. In contrast, 401(k) withdrawals are taxable income, making HSAs a potential tax shelter. The impact of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) on retirement savings is not well researched. A study on health plan choices and retirement savings found no relationship between HSA contributions and retirement savings. High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) aim to reduce uninsurance rates by offering lower premiums, but the effect on the aggregate number of uninsured individuals is uncertain. Health insurance options like HDHPs may attract uninsured individuals due to lower premiums, potentially reducing the number of uninsured. However, a significant shift to HDHPs could lead to adverse selection, increasing the uninsurance rate as healthier individuals switch plans. This could result in standard PPOs raising premiums and cost-sharing to compensate for a less healthy pool of members. Two studies using simulation models measure transitions from uninsurance to HDHP insurance, with differing conclusions. One simulation predicts no change in uninsurance rates due to low incomes not benefiting from tax advantages. The other simulation predicts a decrease in uninsurance as individuals without access to public insurance or group markets purchase HDHPs in the nongroup market. Access to public insurance or a group market would lead individuals to purchase HDHPs in the nongroup market due to the appeal of low premiums. Limited research on insurance transitions into HDHPs makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions on their impact on the overall uninsurance rate. New HDHP enrollees, if predominantly healthy, could disrupt the insurance market by increasing premiums for other health insurance products. Studies focusing on single employers show evidence of favorable selection among HDHP enrollees, with lower pharmacy costs and medication usage compared to non-enrollees. Individuals who enroll in HDHPs are more likely to be in excellent health and have fewer chronic health conditions compared to those who do not enroll. Studies on single employers show that those without chronic health conditions and lower health spending are more likely to choose an HDHP. However, the conclusion is weakened by the reliance on single-employer studies. It is too early to determine if HDHP enrollees are generally healthier than average. The fourth policy goal of HDHPs and HSAs is to reduce aggregate health expenditures. Some argue that minimal effects on aggregate expenditures are expected due to a small percentage of individuals accounting for a large portion of health expenditures. Despite this, a significant amount of cost-sharing is possible under HDHPs, with about 35% of total expenditures falling between the standard PPO deductible and the HDHP deductible. The analysis suggests that moving from a standard PPO to an HDHP/HSA would result in lower health expenditures for individuals in the deductible range. However, a significant decrease in overall expenditures would require a majority shift to HDHP plans. The composition of HDHP enrollees also plays a role, as healthier individuals in consumerist plans may offset any savings by less healthy individuals in PPOs. Enrollment in HDHPs has been increasing since the authorization of HSAs in 2003. Enrollment in HDHPs has been increasing since HSAs were authorized in 2003, with 51% to 58% of HDHP holders opening an HSA. Some individuals across health spending levels may have equal or lower costs with an HDHP/HSA compared to a standard PPO. It is too early to determine if HDHPs and HSAs have achieved their original objectives, and the response of consumers to new incentives is mixed. Health providers may change their behavior, but the impact on care quality is uncertain. Research shows that not all eligible individuals are saving for health expenses in retirement, as only about half open an HSA. Some eligible individuals do not save for health expenses in retirement by opening an HSA, possibly valuing tax benefits over future healthcare funds. Those who do open HSAs tend to have higher incomes. While a shift to HDHPs/HSA policies could reduce overall health expenditures, empirical evidence supporting these results is weak. More research is needed on the effects of HDHPs and HSAs on uninsurance, healthcare utilization, and aggregate health expenditures. The literature search process involved using various academic search indexes and websites to locate relevant articles. Criteria for excluding research included focusing on theoretical exercises, health retirement accounts, post-health insurance reform in Massachusetts, or lacking methodology descriptions. Difficulty in calculating enrollment in HDHPs and HSAs was noted due to the lack of comprehensive data sources. Difficulty in calculating enrollment in HDHPs and HSAs is due to the lack of comprehensive data sources. Available data sources are uniquely organized, making it challenging to combine them for a comprehensive view. HDHP data mainly come from AHIP, covering individual, small group, and large group markets. Limited information on HSAs is provided by AHIP, with the latest data available from January 2010. IRS data also offer insights into HSA tax returns. Two types of data on HSAs are available from the IRS: the number of tax returns with HSA deductions and the average deduction value, as well as the number of HSAs and their total market value reported by banks. Data on HSAs can also be obtained from a survey of employers by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, providing information on employer-sponsored health insurance benefits. The sample size in 2009 was 2,054 employers, weighted to represent about 3.4 million employers. Data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) and surveys of individual firms provide information on HDHPs and HSAs. Comparisons prioritize HDHPs in insurance plan structures. Most literature follows this convention. The convention prioritizes HDHPs in insurance plan structures, with comparisons made to PPOs due to their prevalence among employers offering health insurance. The articles often lack sufficient information to calculate conclusions without HDHPs being favored."
