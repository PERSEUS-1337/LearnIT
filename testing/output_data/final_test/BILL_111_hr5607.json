    "content": "The \"Stop Oil Spills Act\" or \"SOS Act\" amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to focus on Offshore Drilling Safety Technology Development, specifically the Innovative Offshore Drilling Safety Technology Program. The \"Stop Oil Spills Act\" defines key terms related to offshore drilling safety, such as Advisory Committee, award, blowout preventer, deepwater, Fund, and remotely operated vehicle. The \"Stop Oil Spills Act\" defines terms like remotely operated vehicle as a submersible used for subsea equipment, secondary control system for emergency shut off, and ultra-deepwater as depths over 1,500 meters. The Secretary must establish a program within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Interior, shall establish a program to provide awards for innovative technologies to prevent large-scale oil discharges from offshore drilling operations. Awards will focus on technologies like blowout preventers, control systems, remotely operated vehicles, and prefabricated systems for stopping or capturing hydrocarbon discharges. The Secretary will issue solicitations for applications for awards under this program based on the potential for commercialization of relevant technology, enhancing industry's capacity to prevent oil discharges, and other factors. The program will be carried out through annual plans prepared by the Secretary. The Secretary shall describe ongoing and prospective activities of the program, considering recommendations from the Advisory Committee and needs identified by independent commissions. Annual plans will be published by November 30 of each year from 2010 to 2016. The Secretary will transmit annual plans to Congress and publish them online for each calendar year through 2016, along with recommendations from the Advisory Committee. A Technical Advisory Committee will be established within 60 days of the enactment of the section, consisting of at least 9 members with expertise in safety technologies related to offshore oil and gas exploration. The Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary, advises on program development and implementation, reviews annual plans, and may serve up to two 3-year terms. Members receive travel expenses but no compensation. The Safety and Offshore Spill (SOS) Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to receive $50,000,000 annually from Federal oil and gas lease income for fiscal years 2011 through 2017. This funding is separate from distributions to States and the Reclamation Fund as required by law. The Mineral Leasing Act allocates funds from Federal oil and gas leasing programs to various recipients, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Historic Preservation Fund, and coastal impact assistance program. The program established under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act allows the Secretary to use funds from the Fund for program administration without fiscal year limitation. Administrative costs are limited to 5 percent of the monies deposited in the Fund for fiscal years 2011 through 2017. Amendments are made to the table of contents of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Subtitle J--Offshore Drilling Safety Technology Development: Establishes an innovative offshore drilling safety technology program under Sec. 999."
