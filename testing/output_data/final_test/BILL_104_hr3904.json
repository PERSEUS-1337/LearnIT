    "content": "The Act titled \"Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1996\" is cited as the short title. It includes findings and purpose. Congress finds that clinical research is crucial for scientific advancement and developing cures. Significant progress in biology provides new insights for research. Despite high healthcare spending, the budget for health research is minimal. Various studies have highlighted issues in clinical research. The Director of the National Institutes of Health is addressing problems in clinical research through an advisory committee. Training and support for health professionals in clinical research are fragmented and underfunded. Young investigators are crucial for the scientific enterprise, but there has been a significant drop in the number of grant applications from them. The number of federally funded research grants awarded to individuals under 36 decreased by 70% from 1985 to 1993. Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise funds for their research programs and a portion of their salaries. Reasons for the decline in active clinical researchers include high debt for medical school graduates and prolonged training periods. The challenges faced by academic medical centers in maintaining a research-friendly environment include decreasing mentorship, unstable funding from federal agencies, lack of clinical research training in training grant programs, and difficulties in securing healthcare coverage for research patients. In 1960, general clinical research centers were established under the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of $3,000,000. By fiscal year 1995, there were 75 general clinical research centers operating with an annual allocation of $136,640,000, providing patients with access to modern clinical research facilities and technologies. Each center received an average of $1,000,000 annually, representing 75 percent of the amounts approved by the Advisory Council of the National Center for Research Resources. The Act aims to enhance and broaden clinical research programs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section establishing the President's Clinical Research Panel. The President shall establish the 'President's Clinical Research Panel' under the Office of Science and Technology Policy, composed of 12 individuals appointed based on recommendations from the President of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Panel members must be highly qualified to assess clinical research both within and outside the Federal Government. The President's Clinical Research Panel consists of distinguished individuals from various sectors, excluding Federal Government officers. Advisors may include Cabinet officers appointed by the President. Panel members serve 3-year terms, with vacancies filled as needed. The President's Clinical Research Panel appoints members to fill vacancies for the remainder of the predecessor's term. Vacancies must be filled within 90 days, and members can serve up to 2 consecutive terms. Initial members must be appointed within 120 days of enactment. The President appoints the Chairperson and Vice Chairperson. The President appoints a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson for the Clinical Research Panel, with terms lasting 1 year. The Panel must meet at least 4 times a year, keeping transcripts of proceedings available to the public. Its duties include evaluating the clinical research environment in the US and submitting progress reports to the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Clinical Research Panel evaluates the US clinical research environment annually and makes recommendations for improvements to the President and relevant government officials. Panel members receive compensation and travel expenses for their duties. The Panel members receive compensation and travel expenses for their services, authorized at rates similar to those for federal agency employees. Appropriations are authorized to fund the Panel's activities. SEC. 4. ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE DIRECTOR ON CLINICAL RESEARCH. Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is further amended by adding a new section for an Advisory Committee to the Director on Clinical Research. The Advisory Committee to the Director on Clinical Research, established by the Director of the National Institutes of Health, will report to the Director and the President's Clinical Research Panel to address deficiencies in clinical research. The committee will terminate five years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a new section on Study Section Review is added to the Public Health Service Act. The President's Clinical Research Panel will direct a review of study section activities related to clinical research proposals at Federal agencies. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Additionally, there is a call to increase the involvement of the National Institutes of Health in clinical research. The Director of NIH is tasked with expanding NIH's involvement in clinical research by increasing FIRST grants for young investigators, implementing pilot projects, and establishing fellowship and training programs. The Director of NIH will support and expand resources for diverse clinical research needs, including inpatient, outpatient, and critical care research. They will also establish peer review mechanisms for intramural clinical research fellowships and career enhancement awards. SEC. 7 of the Public Health Service Act introduces new sections for General Clinical Research Centers. SEC. 409C of the Public Health Service Act authorizes grants for general clinical research centers to support clinical studies and career development. The Director of NIH will expand activities through telemedicine initiatives. $200,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 1997. The Director of the National Center for Research Resources offers grants for clinical research career enhancement awards to support individual scientists. Grants are limited to $130,000 per year for 5 years, with a maximum of 20 grants in the first fiscal year and 40 grants in the second fiscal year. The Director of the National Center for Research Resources offers grants for innovative medical science awards to support individual clinical research projects. Grants are limited to $100,000 per year per grant, with appropriations of $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 and necessary sums for subsequent years. The National Center for Research Resources offers grants for medical science projects, with $30,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 1997 and additional funds for future years. SEC. 8. CLINICAL RESEARCH ASSISTANCE. The National Research Service Awards under the Public Health Service Act are amended to increase the number from 50 to 100. The Loan Repayment Program is also amended to ensure that at least 50 percent of the appropriated amounts are used for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The National Research Service Awards under the Public Health Service Act are amended to increase the number from 50 to 100. The Loan Repayment Program is also amended to ensure that at least 50 percent of the appropriated amounts are used for contracts involving appropriately qualified health professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Additionally, a new definition for 'clinical research training position' is provided, and authorization of appropriations is granted for each fiscal year. SEC. 9 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to define 'clinical research' as patient-oriented research with human subjects or research on disease causes and consequences in human populations."
