    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Online Market Protection Act of 2014\" and includes a moratorium. The \"Online Market Protection Act of 2014\" includes a moratorium on imposing restrictions on cryptocurrency for five years after enactment, suspending any pending statutes and regulations during this period. During the moratorium period, the government cannot impose restrictions on Smart Contract platforms like cryptographic escrow services, multi-signature transactions, and oracles to allow for their growth. Cryptocurrencies are considered exempt commodities similar to gold and silver, not excluded commodities like national fiat currencies. Federal and State Agencies have no jurisdiction over Cryptocurrency Economy Transactions or Bitcoin Economy Transactions. The financial regulations aim to protect users from fraud and misconduct, not virtual losses within a cryptographic network. The Act does not hinder government agencies from enforcing existing statutes and regulations. The Act does not hinder government agencies from enforcing existing statutes and regulations. SEC. 3 defines key terms. An algorithm is a procedure for solving mathematical problems using a computer. An algorithmic chain is a unique data string for cryptographic proof in cryptocurrency transactions, commonly known as a blockchain. Cryptographic proof is based on a distinct algorithmic chain for each transaction. A protocol governs cryptocurrency creation and operation, and the IRS is referred to as a service. The term \"cryptocurrency\" refers to code-based protocols for exchanging value through electronic means. It is used by the Internal Revenue Service for clarity, encompassing digital, virtual, and electronic currencies. Virtual currency or electronic currency is defined, and agencies are identified as regulatory bodies at the federal and state levels. Smart contracts are described as cryptographically encoded agreements that allow for automatic execution of transactions. Multi-signature transactions involve cryptographic contracts on the blockchain finalized by a pre-set number of parties. Cryptographic Escrow Services allow for fund transfers with arbitrator authorization using multi-signature technology. Oracles are automated signatories in multi-signature transactions, executing when a predetermined threshold is met in the Cryptocurrency Economy Transactions. Cryptocurrency Economy Transactions involve financial instruments denominated in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. Bitcoin-denominated credit default swaps referencing Bitcoin-denominated loans are examples of such transactions. SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF MORATORIUM. The public policy of the United States is to not pass new laws or regulations regarding cryptocurrencies until a moratorium expires. It is believed that using cryptographic proof for cryptocurrency transactions without third-party intermediaries will benefit the economy. Developers are working on smart technologies utilizing blockchain as a public ledger. Smart technologies are being developed to eliminate costly intermediaries in various transactions, increasing market efficiency and promoting individual autonomy and liberty. Publicly recorded multi-signature transactions allow for secure property transfers without the need for intermediaries. The text chunk \"SEC. 5. DECLARATION OF NEUTRAL TAX TREATMENT.\" declares neutral tax treatment. The public policy of the United States supports the production, possession, and use of cryptocurrency without discouragement by tax codes or regulations. Current guidance on cryptocurrency is advisory and subject to public comment, with Congress directing the issuance of interim regulations for treating virtual currencies as currency. Virtual currencies should be treated as currency, not property, for equitable tax treatment and to prevent discouraging their use. Taxing cryptocurrency as property does not consider its illiquidity and limited acceptance, unfairly discouraging taxpayers from using it in commerce. This could hinder economic activity, innovation, and growth. Taxing cryptocurrency transactions based on volatile exchange rates deters taxpayers from accepting it for goods or services. The current tax treatment of cryptocurrency may lead to overtaxation due to inaccurate fair market value assessment, discouraging its use in commerce. This contrasts with the tax treatment of secured notes, which recognizes discounts for illiquid payments. Taxpayers should only realize income from cryptocurrency when it is converted into cash. The tax treatment of cryptocurrency should only recognize income when it is converted into cash to ensure accurate assessment and avoid overtaxation. This approach aims to tax actual income received, rather than theoretical income subject to risks like illiquidity or exchange inefficiencies. The United States directs the IRS to revise regulations to define income on cryptocurrency as net proceeds from conversion into dollars, to avoid overtaxation due to liquidity risks. Additionally, the IRS guidance on including the fair market value of mined cryptocurrency in gross income is deemed inequitable, as it fails to account for liquidity risk and discourages income-producing efforts. The United States directs the IRS to revise regulations regarding cryptocurrency taxation to avoid overtaxation and discourage income-producing efforts. Cryptocurrency should be taxed as income only upon conversion into dollars. SEC. 6. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this title, or any amendment made by this title, is found to violate the Constitution of the United States, other provisions of the title will not be affected."
