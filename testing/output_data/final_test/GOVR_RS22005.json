    "content": "Forfeiture law, authorized by Congress and state legislatures for over two hundred years, has its roots in early English law. It is reminiscent of three early English procedures: deodands, forfeiture of estate, and statutory forfeiture. Deodands involved confiscating objects that caused death for religious and charitable purposes. Deodands, a practice involving confiscating objects causing death for religious purposes, were used in early English law. In colonial America, common law forfeitures were rare, and after the Revolution, restrictions were placed on their use for cases of treason. Modern forfeiture, a descendant of English statutory or commercial forfeiture, is primarily a creature of statute. It has been used extensively in cases of smuggling and revenue evasion since precolonial times, with in rem and in personam confiscation proceedings being common. Contemporary American forfeiture law has roots in the law of deodands and forfeiture of estate, but is largely shaped by English statutory forfeiture. Modern forfeiture is primarily a creature of statute, with federal forfeiture statutes varying greatly. Virtually every kind of property can be subject to confiscation under certain circumstances, including contraband, property used to facilitate a crime, and profits of illegal activities. The government can confiscate proceeds of illegal activities and substitute assets when the original tainted property is unavailable. Forfeiture traditionally targeted crimes threatening government revenue or public health, like smuggling, tax evasion, gambling, or drug use. More recently, offenses involving substantial economic gain for the defendant have also warranted forfeiture. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA) allows for the confiscation of crime-related property to enhance government revenues. Forfeiture can be criminal or civil, with criminal forfeitures being part of the criminal proceedings against the property. After 9/11, property owned by certain terrorists can be confiscated regardless of its connection to a crime. Civil forfeitures can be accomplished through civil procedure, treating the property as the offender. The guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant; it is enough that the property was involved in a crime for forfeiture to occur. Some civil forfeitures are done administratively, while others are not. Actual or constructive possession of the property by the court is a necessary first step in the process. In confiscation proceedings, possession of the property by the court is essential. Property can be arrested with a warrant or without if there is probable cause. Administrative forfeiture is sometimes used for expediency in uncontested cases. Administrative forfeitures are not always uncontested, as both the government and claimants face procedural obstacles before a judicial proceeding. The government initiates the process by seizing the property and notifying interested parties to request judicial forfeiture proceedings. Claimants must file a verified claim under the Supplemental Rules within a narrow timeframe. The government can petition to dismiss a claim for lack of statutory standing, requiring the claimant to prove lawful ownership. If no viable claims are made, the property is forfeited without further proceedings. When administrative forfeiture is unavailable or contested, the government may start civil judicial proceedings by filing a complaint or a libel against the property. In cases governed by CAFRA, the government must prove by preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to confiscation. In other cases, probable cause is required. Claimants can challenge confiscation by showing the predicate offense did not occur or that their property is not subject to forfeiture. The government must establish a substantial connection between the property and the offense to prove civil forfeiture. Claimants can defend against confiscation by showing innocence or lack of knowledge of criminal use of their property. CAFRA provides two innocent owner defenses for civil forfeitures, excluding tax or customs cases. CAFRA allows for a judicial reduction of excessive civil forfeiture amounts and criminal forfeiture is now more commonly used when judicial proceedings are necessary. Criminal forfeiture applies to various federal crimes such as money transmission, counterfeiting, and fraud offenses. Criminal forfeiture is a consequence of conviction, punishing the defendant by confiscating their property related to the crime. Unlike civil forfeiture, it targets only the convicted defendant's property and may include substitute assets if the original property is unavailable. The indictment must list the property subject to confiscation, and a jury can determine the forfeiture issue during trial. The court's jurisdiction for forfeiture does not require initial control of the property. Pretrial restraining orders can be issued to prevent property transfer. Defense to criminal forfeiture differs from civil forfeiture, as conviction is needed for confiscation. Third-party interests are less likely to be affected in criminal forfeiture. After the defendant's conviction, the government can choose to confiscate forfeitable property or seek a money judgment. The court determines the nexus between the property and the crime for confiscation or the amount the defendant must pay for a money judgment. A preliminary forfeiture order is issued, and the government notifies third parties with an interest in the property. Third parties with a legal interest in forfeited property are entitled to a judicial hearing by filing a timely petition. Claims can be based on superior interest in the property or being good-faith purchasers. The government can enforce a money judgment against future assets. Disposal of forfeited property is typically governed by statute, which may dictate the use of proceeds or the destruction of unlawfully possessed property. The federal forfeiture statutes allow for the lawful possession of property, distribution of proceeds for victim restitution, and intergovernmental transfers. The Attorney General and Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to transfer confiscated property to various law enforcement agencies to promote cooperation. Adoptive forfeiture occurs when property is forfeitable under both federal and state law. The Department of Justice processes adoptive forfeitures. The Department of Justice adopts forfeiture cases from state or local law enforcement officials for processing under federal law. Federal adoption is chosen for its speed and feasibility compared to state law. The Treasury and Justice Departments require that transferred property be used for law enforcement purposes and not replace existing resources. The Attorney General limits adoption with few exceptions. The majority of confiscated cash and proceeds from confiscated property are now deposited in the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund or the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, totaling over $2 billion annually. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive fines and cruel punishments. Punitive forfeitures are considered excessive if they are disproportionately severe. Civil forfeitures designated by Congress do not raise double jeopardy concerns unless they are excessively punitive. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in criminal proceedings. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial, assistance of counsel, and confrontation of accusers in criminal proceedings. However, this right does not apply in civil forfeiture cases, where there is no constitutionally required right to assistance of counsel. The opinion that there is no right to a jury trial in criminal forfeiture is challenged due to the Sixth Amendment and Rule 32.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Due process requires notice and opportunity for a hearing in forfeiture cases. Actual notice is not necessary, but efforts must be made to inform individuals of their right to contest. The initiation of forfeiture proceedings allows seizing personal property without prior notice or a hearing. However, the owner is entitled to a preseizure hearing for real property, with a probable cause determination required for post-seizure actions. Adversarial determination of probable cause is not necessary, and limitations exist on confiscating innocent owners' property. The Court has not broadly asserted that due process uniformly precludes confiscation of an innocent owner's property. Delay between seizure and hearing offends due process only if unreasonable based on the length of delay, reasons, claimant's assertion of rights, and prejudice. Lower federal courts have found due process permits shifting burden of proof to forfeiture claimant after government shows probable cause, use of probable cause standard in civil forfeitures, postponement of determining third-party interests in criminal forfeiture cases until after trial, an 11-year delay in amending a criminal forfeiture order to reach overseas assets, and dealing with fugitives. The United States Constitution's Article III does not seem to restrict most contemporary forfeiture statutes, as it primarily pertains to treason cases. While some courts have suggested a broader interpretation, the prohibitions of Article III only apply to forfeiture of estate, not statutory forfeitures commonly seen in state and federal law. The key difference between forfeiture of estate and statutory forfeiture is that the former involves all of the defendant's property, regardless of its relation to the offense or when it was acquired. The defendant's property, whether acquired before, during, or after the crime, can be confiscated if related to the offense. Article III of the United States Constitution extends judicial power to certain cases and controversies, requiring standing for litigants to proceed. Civil forfeiture claimants must meet Article III standing requirements by showing injury in fact. The plaintiff must show injury in fact, a causal connection, and likelihood of redress to establish standing. In civil forfeiture cases, claimants can demonstrate standing by proving a colorable interest in the seized property. This satisfies Article III's standing requirement as the owner or possessor of the property has suffered an injury that can be partially redressed by the return of the property."
