    "content": "During presidential transitions, the appointment process can face delays due to the large number of candidates needing selection and vetting. By the end of the first 100 days of different presidencies, the percentage of nominees confirmed for vacant positions varied: Reagan (19%), Clinton (11%), George W. Bush (7%), and Obama (14%). Delays in appointing new leadership can be particularly problematic during the transition period between Presidents. During presidential transitions, the appointment process can face delays due to the large number of candidates needing selection and vetting. The 9/11 Commission identified shortcomings in the appointment process that could compromise national security policymaking in the early months of a new Administration. More than 2,600 political appointees occupied positions in the 15 departments as of June 30, 2016, including top-level policymaking presidential appointees and political managers. During presidential transitions, top political officials in federal departments and agencies serve at the pleasure of the President or agency head. These officials typically resign when the Administration changes. The report describes the processes for filling top-level executive branch PAS positions during a presidential transition, focusing on Selection and Vetting, Senate Consideration, and Appointment stages. These appointments are crucial for a new President. The report discusses processes for filling top-level executive branch positions during presidential transitions, including recess appointments and designations under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. It also provides data on the time taken to fill Cabinet and national-security-related subcabinet positions during past transitions since 1980. The power to appoint top officers is shared by the President and the Senate, with three stages in the appointment process. The appointment process for top-level executive branch positions involves three stages\u2014selection and vetting, Senate consideration, and appointment. The White House selects and clears a prospective appointee before sending the nomination to the Senate. Senators argue they are entitled to provide advice to the President on selections, although the extent of this entitlement is debated. Insufficient pre-nomination consultation has led to concerns among Senators. During the appointment process for top-level executive branch positions, Senators may delay or block a nomination if they feel there was insufficient pre-nomination consultation. The candidate must undergo a clearance process, which includes submitting various forms and undergoing background investigations by the FBI and financial disclosure reviews by the OGE and ethics officials. During the appointment process for top-level executive branch positions, candidates undergo background investigations and financial disclosure reviews by the FBI, OGE, and ethics officials. Conflicts of interest found during the investigation can be mitigated with the help of OGE and agency ethics officers. Candidates typically start preparing for a potential presidency before Election Day by selecting advisors to develop transition plans. The Intelligence Reform Act assists candidates in selecting personnel by providing electronic records on Presidentially appointed positions. The Intelligence Reform Act allows major party presidential candidates to submit security clearance requests for prospective transition team members before the general election. This proactive clearance process aims to accelerate the transition of team members into positions in the new Administration. The Intelligence Reform Act allows presidential candidates to request security clearances for transition team members before the election, speeding up their appointment process in the new Administration. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 was amended to require the President-elect to submit high-level national security position candidates promptly after the election for background investigations before inauguration. The General Services Administration provides resources for the transition process. The Presidential Transition Act was amended to provide support for eligible candidates before the election, aiming to strengthen transition planning for a successful transition. Amendments were made in 2004, 2010, and 2016, with the latest implemented during the 2016-2017 presidential transition. The act directs the President and incumbent Administration to establish transition-related infrastructure and provide pre-election support. The Presidential Transition Act was amended to provide support for eligible candidates before the election, aiming to strengthen transition planning for a successful transition. The statute authorizes candidates to fund pre-election transition activities through their campaigns. Once the President selects and vets a nominee, the Senate confirms the nomination. Each nomination is referred to the relevant committee for review. During the Senate confirmation process, nominations are referred to relevant committees for review. Committee activity includes investigation, hearing, and reporting stages with timetables for each step. Most nominations proceed routinely, taking a median of 52 days during the 111th Congress. No Senate rule mandates action on nominations. The Senate confirmation process involves nominations being referred to relevant committees for review. The committee may hold a hearing and vote on reporting the nomination to the Senate. Confirmation by the Senate requires a simple majority, with no set time limit for consideration. Cloture may be invoked to end debate and proceed to a final vote. The Senate confirmation process involves nominations being referred to relevant committees for review. Cloture can be invoked to end debate and proceed to a final vote on a nomination, requiring a simple majority. The cloture process, established in 2013, can be time-consuming, with a maximum of 30 hours of consideration after cloture is invoked. Senators can place \"holds\" on nominations to delay or prevent their consideration. A \"hold\" is an informal Senate practice where a Senator requests to delay floor action on a nomination. The Senate Majority Leader decides whether to honor the hold or proceed with a vote. Most nominations are confirmed, but some stall in committee due to various reasons. Rarely are nominations voted down on the Senate floor. The Senate may delay nominations for various reasons, including opposition or time constraints. If not acted upon, nominations are returned to the President. The 9/11 Commission recommended a 30-day timeline for confirmation processes. The Senate has developed a flexible process for quick action on nominations during Presidential transitions. This informal process allows for swift confirmation of Cabinet and high-level positions to ensure the President has key personnel in place. During Presidential transitions, the Senate has a method for quick confirmation of Cabinet positions. Committees hold hearings and vote on anticipated nominations before inauguration day, ensuring key personnel are in place for the new administration. Confirmation of nominees for key Cabinet positions is often expedited during Presidential transitions. Senate committees have historically held pre-inaugural hearings and votes on anticipated nominations, allowing for swift confirmation of nominees before inauguration day. This process has been followed during transitions between various Presidents, such as Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Obama. For example, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed Alexander M. Haig, Jr.'s nomination as Secretary of State for President Reagan before full Senate consideration on January 15, 1981. The Senate committees expedite confirmation of nominees for key Cabinet positions during Presidential transitions. For example, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed Alexander M. Haig, Jr.'s nomination as Secretary of State for President Reagan on January 15, 1981. The Senate Finance Committee also acted on Lloyd Bentsen's nomination as Secretary of the Treasury for President Clinton on January 12, 1993. The Senate Armed Services Committee acted on the expected nomination of Donald H. Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense on January 19, 2001. The Senate committees expedite confirmation of nominees for key Cabinet positions during Presidential transitions. The committee voted to recommend the full Senate confirm Donald H. Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense. Other nominations to Cabinet positions have also been approved in advance by committees. In January 2009, Senate committees endorsed anticipated nominations before submission to the Senate by President Obama. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed to report Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's nomination as secretary of State pending formal papers. Members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture unanimously supported a nomination. The Senate Committee on Agriculture unanimously supported the nomination of Thomas J. Vilsack to be Secretary of Agriculture after conducting a hearing and reviewing his credentials. After confirmation, the nominee receives a commission signed by the President and is sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out responsibilities. The time between confirmation and appointment varies based on preferences. Various authorities, such as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and recess appointment power, can temporarily fill vacancies in PAS positions. During a presidential transition or later in the President's term, temporary appointments can be made under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. Appointees can act in an interim capacity for up to 210 days, with exceptions during a transition period or if a nomination is pending in the Senate. The Vacancies Act allows for temporary appointments in executive agency positions requiring confirmation. This can be done by the first assistant assuming the duties or the President directing a confirmed appointee to fill the role. This helps maintain continuity and reduce confusion during transitions. The Vacancies Act allows temporary appointments in executive agency positions requiring confirmation. This can be done by the first assistant assuming the duties or the President directing a confirmed appointee to fill the role. While it may be limited in utility during the early months of a new Administration, it allows for individuals to serve under this provision, including appointees of the President's party in fixed-term membership positions and holdover appointees from the previous Administration who support the President's policy preferences. The President may temporarily fill the vacant position with any officer or employee of the subject agency who meets certain criteria. The Vacancies Act allows temporary appointments in executive agency positions requiring confirmation. The President can select individuals who support his policy preferences from career SES members. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit limits conditions for serving in an acting capacity and as a nominee for the same position. A presidential recess appointment allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses, with appointments expiring at the end of the next session. The duration of a recess appointment can vary, lasting less than a year or nearly two years. Recent Presidents have used this authority sparingly in their first calendar years in office. Recent Presidents have used the recess appointment authority sparingly in their first years in office. President George H.W. Bush, President Clinton, President George W. Bush, President Obama, and President Reagan all made recess appointments at different times during their presidencies. The Senate and House have implemented scheduling practices to prevent the President from making recess appointments. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the President's recess appointment power can only be used under certain circumstances. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the President's recess appointment power can only be used during a recess of 10 days or longer. Congress can determine when to adjourn for a recess, allowing for recess appointments. Various methods are used to temporarily fill vacancies in PAS positions during a presidential transition. An individual serving in an acting or temporary capacity in a Senate advice and consent position may not be paid if nominated twice and the second nomination is withdrawn. The FY2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act prohibits using funds for payment to such individuals after the second nomination withdrawal. Nominees awaiting confirmation may serve as consultants in an advisory role only. The nominee to a Senate-confirmed position serves in an advisory capacity and cannot assume the position's duties until Senate confirmation. Concerns about the lengthy appointment process during presidential transitions have been raised for over 30 years, with the 9/11 Commission recommending changes to expedite the selection and clearance processes, especially for national security positions. Congress responded by enacting new provisions related to the selection and vetting process. The Presidential Transition Act was amended in 2010 and 2016 to establish a transition-related organizational infrastructure and provide support to eligible candidates. Comparing the appointment process during the 2008-2009 Bush-Obama transition with previous transitions helps assess the impact of these changes. The section compares the length of the transition-period appointment process among Cabinet positions and agencies during previous presidential transitions. Data on nominee-level appointments to Cabinet-level and higher-level national security-related and economic subcabinet positions are provided in the appendices. Appendix B details CRS's method for selecting positions in Appendix C. Appendices A and C outline the time intervals between key points in the appointment process. Transition-period Cabinet-level nominees were generally selected and confirmed quickly, with most taking office shortly after the President's inauguration. However, some Cabinet-level offices remained unfilled for over six weeks after inauguration. Transition-period Cabinet-level nominees were generally selected and confirmed quickly, with most taking office shortly after the President's inauguration. However, some Cabinet-level offices remained unfilled for over six weeks after inauguration, with the position of Director of ONDCP taking more than six months to fill in some cases. Comparisons among different transitions showed varying timelines for announcing Cabinet-position selections, but this did not significantly impact the overall appointment process. Initial nominees to subcabinet positions typically took over six months from Election Day to be confirmed. The selection and vetting process for subcabinet positions have been taking longer, with nominees now taking over six months from Election Day to be confirmed. Senate consideration of nominations has also grown longer, with notable differences in the average duration of the appointment process across different transitions and federal organizations. The selection and vetting process for subcabinet positions have been taking longer, with nominees now taking over six months from Election Day to be confirmed. Notable differences in the average duration of the appointment process across different transitions and federal organizations were observed. Intelligence community positions were filled most quickly (median = 92 days), while State Department nominations were submitted and confirmed most quickly (median = 148 days). Cabinet-level PAS positions were analyzed, including heads of departments and positions accorded Cabinet rank. The analysis of Cabinet appointments during transition periods shows that the process has been effective in recent decades. President-elect Obama announced his selections sooner than three of the four preceding Presidents, with a pace similar to President George H.W. Bush. This suggests a timely installation of the Cabinet after a new President takes office. During transition periods, President-elects have historically made Cabinet appointments swiftly. President George W. Bush's selections were announced later due to the unique circumstances of the 2000 election. The median Cabinet appointment was typically confirmed within days of inauguration day for Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. Senate confirmation for these Presidents' Cabinet members occurred shortly after inauguration. The Senate confirmed Cabinet members for four Presidents shortly after inauguration, with the exception of the transition from Reagan to George H.W. Bush. Factors such as party alignment and previous administration involvement may have influenced the slower pace of appointments during this transition. Opposition to specific nominations also played a role in delays. The transition from Reagan to George H.W. Bush saw delays in Cabinet appointments, with key positions continuing from the previous administration. Statistics show variations in the pace of nomination confirmations, with department head nominees moving faster than Cabinet-rank nominees. Department head nominees are confirmed quicker (median = 79 days) than Cabinet-rank nominees (median = 84 days). The appointment process duration varies among department nominees, ranging from 77 days for some positions to 103 days for others. Cabinet-rank nominees for positions like OMB Director have shorter confirmation times. Notably, nominations for Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy face significant delays in the confirmation process. The nomination process for the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy takes much longer than other Cabinet-level nominations. The median interval for filling this position is 309 days, with anomalies in the time taken for past nominations. President Clinton's nomination took 225 days, while President George W. Bush's nomination took 393 days. This leads to a longer overall process for Cabinet-rank nominees compared to department head nominees. The pace of Cabinet-rank nominees is 23 days longer than the median length. A comparison is made among the five transitions for subcabinet appointments and among seven organizational units for these appointments. Data from 126 nominations to 38 positions across transitions is analyzed, focusing on national security and economic policymaking. Figure 2 includes three bar graphs. The comparison among the five transitions for subcabinet appointments shows that the selection and vetting process lengthened over time. The Senate consideration process also grew longer, with the selection and vetting process taking up a larger portion of the appointment process. The median length of the process from election to final disposition is highlighted. The selection and vetting process for subcabinet appointments lengthened over time, with the median length of the process from election to final disposition notably longer during later transitions compared to the Reagan transition. The period between nomination submission and final disposition more than doubled, and the appointment process duration increased across the five transitions. The appointment process for subcabinet positions lengthened over time, with President Reagan's process being notably shorter at 114 days compared to other Presidents at 187-198 days. Half of the nominees were confirmed within approximately six months of election day. The appointment process for subcabinet positions lengthened over time, with President Reagan's process being notably shorter at 114 days compared to other Presidents at 187-198 days. Positions in the intelligence community were filled much more swiftly than in other agencies, with nominations reaching final disposition within 92 days on average. State Department nominees completed the appointment process most efficiently among the departments. On average, State Department nominees completed the appointment process most quickly, with half reaching the end within 148 days of election day. The median interval between election day and nomination submission was 121 days for State Department nominees, shorter than other departments. Department of Defense nominees had the shortest Senate consideration period at 20 days. Department of Justice nominees took the longest to be confirmed, with a median interval of 206 days. The nomination process for subcabinet positions takes longer than Senate confirmation, with a five times longer interval between election and submission compared to submission and final disposition. The report analyzes nominations for higher-level subcabinet positions related to national security and economic matters. The study focused on presidential transitions and the nomination process for national security-related positions, following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Positions in departments such as State, Defense, Justice, Energy, and Homeland Security were analyzed for timely confirmation by the Senate. The study analyzed national security-related positions in departments like State, Defense, Justice, Energy, and Homeland Security for timely Senate confirmation. Exceptions were made for certain positions, such as the FBI Director, due to unique criteria like a 10-year term. The study analyzed national security-related positions in various departments for timely Senate confirmation. Treasury positions were also considered due to government efforts to address economic downturn. Two specific Treasury positions were included in the analysis. Table B-1 lists the selected positions by organization. Subcabinet positions subject to analysis were drawn from this pool. Positions without nominations were excluded from the analysis. The group analyzed national security-related positions for Senate confirmation, including two specific Treasury positions. Positions without nominations in the first year of any of the five Administrations were excluded from the study."
