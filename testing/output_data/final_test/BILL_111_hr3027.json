Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to include a new section 204 for enhancing predisaster hazard mitigation. The section aims to provide grants for hazard mitigation strategies to save lives, improve property integrity after natural disasters, and reduce costs for the Federal Government and States. Grants are authorized by the President on a competitive basis, with eligible entities required to submit applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment.

The President adjusts the amounts annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. An eligible entity receiving a grant for hazard mitigation must adhere to safety standards and codes for construction, renovation, or retrofitting. The Federal share of mitigation costs cannot exceed 75 percent. The President may approve in-kind contributions towards the non-Federal share of activities. Grants under this section must allocate 50% to single-family housing, 30% to multi-family housing, and 20% to small businesses for mitigation needs.
