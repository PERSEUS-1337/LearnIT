    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000\" and includes findings and purposes. In 1800, New York ceded control of Governors Island to the Federal Government for defense purposes. During the War of 1812, the island's fortifications deterred a British attack on New York City. In 1901, fill from the Lexington Avenue Subway excavation was used on the island. Governors Island's area was increased from 90 to 172 acres using fill from the Lexington Avenue Subway excavation. It played a significant role in various wars and was controlled by the United States Army until 1966 when the United States Coast Guard took over for the next 30 years. The Coast Guard ceased operations at Governors Island in 1997, leaving 225 buildings unoccupied and exposed to New York Harbor's elements. Castle Williams is named after Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, who built the fort, and Fort Jay is named after John Jay.
