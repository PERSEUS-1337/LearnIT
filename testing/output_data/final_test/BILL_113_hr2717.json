    "content": "The Act is titled the \"United States-Israel Missile Defense Cooperation Act of 2013\". It includes findings related to missile defense cooperation. Congress finds that Israel is under grave threat from attacks by militants and potential ballistic missile threats from Iran and Syria. The US-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act supports Israel's right to self-defense and military edge. The United States supports Israel's military edge against Hezbollah and Hamas, backed by Iran and Syria. US-Israel missile defense cooperation, like the Arrow Weapon System, has been successful in protecting Israel for over two decades. US industries are equal partners in these cooperative programs. The United States and Israel are equal partners in developing cooperative missile defense systems. The David's Sling Weapon System is designed to intercept various types of missiles and rockets, with successful tests completed on schedule. The Arrow 3 Weapon System aims to intercept long-range missiles at high altitudes to enhance defense capabilities. The Arrow 3 Weapon System, developed jointly by the United States and Israel, successfully completed fly-out tests in February and July 2013. The Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system, with a success rate of over 85%, intercepted rockets targeting various locations in Israel during Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012, preventing significant casualties. Israel's Iron Dome system averted casualties, reducing the need for ground attacks on Gaza terrorists and enhancing operational flexibility. Israel is willing to share Iron Dome technology with the US to strengthen defense capabilities. Currently, Israel has five operational Iron Dome batteries, insufficient to protect all territory. Authorization is given for the US to assist Israel in acquiring the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system and cooperate on the development of other anti-missile defense systems like David's Sling, Arrow, and Arrow 3. This assistance aims to intercept rockets, missiles, and projectiles launched against Israel."
