    "content": "Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. focused on freezing terrorist assets to combat terrorist financing. Initially, significant funds were frozen internationally, but the pace slowed down later. By December 2004, U.S. programs had blocked nearly $10 million of international terrorist organizations' assets, with $1.5 billion frozen through economic sanctions. $1.5 billion in assets have been frozen by U.S. economic sanctions, with the majority belonging to Libya. Analysts suggest focusing on intelligence gathering to combat terrorism rather than solely targeting terrorist finances. The U.S. employs a three-tiered strategy involving law enforcement techniques and intelligence operations to disrupt terrorist financiers networks. The U.S. employs a three-tiered strategy involving law enforcement techniques and intelligence operations to disrupt terrorist financiers networks. Efforts include investigations, diplomatic actions, criminal prosecutions, capacity building programs, and global initiatives to deter terrorist financing. Implementing this strategy requires coordination of national power elements like intelligence gathering, financial regulation, law enforcement, and building international coalitions. The federal government targets money laundering through legislation like the Bank Secrecy Act to combat the process of disguising illegal money as legitimate. The Bank Secrecy Act was passed in 1970 to target money laundering, with subsequent amendments adding criminal and civil sanctions. In 2001, Congress expanded the laws to include terrorist financing as punishable activities. The Act focuses on financial institutions' record-keeping to trace money trails and apprehend criminals. The Bank Secrecy Act, passed in 1970, targets money laundering and terrorist financing through financial institutions' record-keeping. The Act requires institutions to report cash transactions over $10,000 and file suspicious activity reports for transactions over $5,000 involving illegal funds or evasion of reporting requirements. Foreign-based monetary transactions are also subject to significant requirements. The Bank Secrecy Act, passed in 1970, targets money laundering and terrorist financing through financial institutions' record-keeping. It requires reporting of cash transactions over $10,000 and filing of suspicious activity reports for transactions over $5,000 involving illegal funds or evasion of reporting requirements. Citizens must keep records and file reports for foreign-based monetary transactions. The Treasury Secretary must issue regulations in this area. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act grants the President broad powers during a national emergency related to threats outside the United States. The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 criminalized money laundering by defining it as conducting financial transactions with unlawfully obtained property to further or conceal illegal activity. Domestic, international, and attempted money laundering are illegal under this act, with transactions over $10,000 not requiring proof of intent to further illegal acts. The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 increased penalties for violating anti-money laundering laws, authorized filings of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), allowed regulators to place banks in conservatorship for violations, and gave power to revoke charters and terminate insurance for guilty banks. The Annunzio-Wylie Act introduced federal penalties for operating money transmitting businesses without licenses under state law. The Money Laundering Suppression Act of the early 1990s mandated exemptions from reporting requirements to reduce CTR filings by 30% and directed the Treasury Secretary to designate a single agency for suspicious activity report filings. Money transmitting businesses are required to register with the Treasury Secretary under this act, which also clarified the BSA's applicability to state-chartered and tribal gaming establishments. The Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 directed the Treasury Secretary to develop a national strategy for combating money laundering, including prioritizing enforcement efforts in high-risk areas. The USA PATRIOT Act, passed after 9/11, focused on combating terrorist financing. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for prosecution of providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations as a predicate offense for money laundering. The Treasury Secretary can impose special measures on domestic financial institutions to combat money laundering, including obtaining information on beneficial ownership of accounts and restricting certain types of accounts. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act empowers the Secretary to impose restrictions on payable-through and correspondent accounts to prevent money laundering. Financial institutions must establish procedures to detect illicit funds. Correspondent accounts for foreign \"shell banks\" are prohibited, with fines up to $1 million for violations. The act allows for judicial review of seized assets related to terrorism, with exceptions for national security concerns. It also grants jurisdiction over foreign individuals. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for jurisdiction over foreign persons and financial institutions for prosecutions related to money laundering and forfeiture of property. It also requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act mandates financial institutions to implement anti-money laundering measures, including appointing a compliance officer, conducting employee training, and undergoing independent audits. Institutions must provide AML compliance information promptly upon request by the Treasury Secretary. Additionally, merging financial institutions must demonstrate effectiveness in combating money laundering, and they are permitted to disclose suspicions of illegal activity in employment references. The act also extends the requirement to file Suspicious Activity Reports to broker-dealers and allows the Treasury Secretary to share SARs with U.S. intelligence agencies to combat international money laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act mandates financial institutions to implement anti-money laundering measures, including reporting any cash transactions over $10,000 to the Treasury Department. It also makes it a crime to conceal or transport large amounts of cash, with penalties including imprisonment and forfeiture of property. Financial institutions are required to verify the identities of customers and check them against government lists of known terrorists. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act gives FinCEN authority to verify customer identities, maintain secure networks for electronic filing of BSA reports, and regulate the use of concentration accounts to prevent fund movements. The act also criminalizes collecting or providing funds for terrorist activities, regardless of location or citizenship. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 authorized funding for FinCEN's \"BSA Direct\" program to improve data management and access to BSA filings for law enforcement. Additional funding was allocated for telecommunications and analytical technologies. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandates reporting of cross-border transmittals by financial institutions and establishes regulations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It also requires a one-year waiting period for federal financial institution examiners before accepting a job with an institution they previously examined. Additionally, the Act created the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) position and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). The Foreign Terrorist Asset Targeting Group (FTATG) is part of the U.S. Government's counterterrorism organizations under the DNI's control. It assesses intelligence on terrorist financing and provides intelligence assessments to the NSC's Terrorist Finance Policy Coordinating Committee. FTATG collaborates with member agencies to develop actions against suspected terrorist financiers. The group was restructured in November 2004 with a new director from the FBI. In November 2004, the NSC restructured FTATG, appointing a FBI special agent as director and an ICE special agent as deputy director. The focus was narrowed to providing intelligence assessments of terrorist financing targets designated by the NSC's Terrorist Financing PCC. Member agencies committed staff to FTATG, with slightly over half of the staff in place. President Bill Clinton established FTATG's predecessor, the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTATC), in May 2000 as part of a $300 million counterterrorism initiative. President Bill Clinton established the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTATC) in May 2000 with a $300 million counterterrorism initiative, $100 million of which was allocated to target terrorist financing. The initiative was a response to the prevention of planned Osama Bin Laden terrorist attacks the previous year. The establishment of FTATC aimed to improve the government's understanding of how terrorists fund their operations, particularly focusing on their fundraising component. President Bill Clinton established the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTATC) in May 2000 with a $300 million counterterrorism initiative, focusing on targeting terrorist financing. Despite initial skepticism from key agencies like the Treasury Department and the CIA, President Bush's National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice saw value in pursuing terrorist financing proposals by spring of 2001. However, a year had passed since the establishment of terrorist finance analysis as a priority, and the Treasury Department had still not set up a center as envisioned. Despite delays and frustrations, the Treasury Department finally established the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center three days after the September 11 attacks, following over a year of planning and blaming the CIA for inaction. The Treasury Department established the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center after the September 11 attacks, placing it under the control of the Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control. Initially comprised of member agencies from Operation Green Quest, the Center's mission was to provide intelligence assessments on terrorist financing targets identified by Green Quest. Senator Grassley expressed concerns about potential delays indicating larger problems. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence endorsed efforts to exploit financial intelligence for counterterrorism, but raised concerns about coordination with the Intelligence Community. They directed the DCI and Treasury Secretary to assess the feasibility of establishing a government element for analyzing and disseminating foreign intelligence on terrorist finances. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence endorsed efforts to exploit financial intelligence for counterterrorism and directed the DCI and Treasury Secretary to assess the feasibility of establishing a government element for analyzing and disseminating foreign intelligence on terrorist finances. By May 2002, the Executive Branch had not completed the requested report on the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center (FTATC), despite statutory requirements. The FTATC was eventually established at the CIA under DCI control, but later placed under the NSC's Office of Combating Terrorism. After the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act, control of the FTATC was assumed by the DNI. After the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act, the DNI took control of FTATG. The NSC is responsible for coordinating the interagency framework for combating terrorism, including terrorist financing. The NSC staff has significant influence on decision-making, with reliance on interagency Policy Coordination Committees. A PCC specifically on terrorist financing was established post-9/11. A new position on the NSC staff is proposed for combating terrorist financing, chaired by a special assistant to the President. This individual would coordinate Federal efforts, evaluate intelligence on terrorist organizations, and develop strategies to disrupt financial networks. Arguments against creating new positions on the NSC staff include concerns about the size of the White House staff and expanding control of the National Security Council. The NSC staff is debating the desirability of having tactics and strategies developed by them rather than operating departments. The Tower Board recommended that the NSC staff should not engage in policy implementation, as it compromises oversight roles. The best approach may involve the PCC developing strategies against terrorist financing and resolving inter-departmental disagreements, with the NSC resolving differences. Permanent arrangements may be needed to address differing perspectives of agencies and departments. The NSC staff is debating the need for permanent arrangements to address differing perspectives of agencies and departments in developing strategies against terrorist financing. Financial institutions and regulators provide information on financial transactions to detect and prevent the use of the financial system by terrorists. Congress has mandated new reporting to improve terrorist financing detection and control, aiding law enforcement in combating money laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act, set to expire in 2005, includes provisions to combat terrorist financing. Legislation is being considered to reauthorize these sections, with potential expansions to amend financial Title III. Senate hearings on terror finance will continue as part of anti-terror efforts. The Government Accountability Office is conducting a study for the Committee on anti-terror policies and practices, including the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) established in 2004 to counter terrorist financing and money laundering domestically and internationally. TFI also represents the US at international bodies focusing on curtailing financial crime. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a key office within the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), established in 1990 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. FinCEN collects and analyzes Suspicious Activity Reports and Currency Transaction Reports from financial institutions to detect illegal activities and trends, sharing findings with the financial community to aid in further detection efforts. Between April 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, 2175 suspicious activity reports were submitted to FinCEN, with the majority coming from money services businesses and depository institutions. Despite reporting accuracy issues from depository institutions, FinCEN uses data analysis to support investigations and prosecutions of financial crimes, referring cases to law enforcement when necessary. FinCEN submits requests for information to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, resulting in tips and SARs related to possible terrorist financing. However, the Inspector General found issues with the SAR database, including lack of critical information and inaccuracies in reports. The Inspector General found issues with FinCEN's SAR reports, leading to suspicion of illegal transactions. Recent reports continue to show little improvement in enforcing the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act. FinCEN announced plans to collect information on compliance procedures and created an Office of Compliance to support financial regulators. The Office of Foreign Assets Control enforces economic sanctions against targeted foreign entities, including terrorists and narcotics traffickers. It prohibits financial transactions and freezes assets under presidential powers and legislation. OFAC works closely with financial regulators, receives information on questionable transactions, and collaborates with other agencies like the FBI and the Department of Commerce. The Office of Foreign Assets Control enforces economic sanctions against targeted foreign entities, including terrorists and narcotics traffickers. It collaborates with agencies like the FBI and the Department of Commerce, and the most recent IG audit highlighted OFAC's challenges in ensuring financial institutions comply with foreign sanctions. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 addressed financial sector counterterrorism. The Treasury Secretary is required to report on ways to curtail terrorist financing, including organizational and procedural changes. Congress emphasizes the need for sufficient resources to educate the financial services industry on domestic counter terrorist financing activities and how they can combat terrorism while protecting civil liberties. President Bush's FY2006 budget request for the Treasury Department includes increased funding for combating terrorist and illegal financing. FinCEN would receive $73.6 million in funds, with additional funding for TFI's Office of Intelligence Analysis and OFAC. Financial institution regulators are responsible for examining compliance with the BSA. The financial regulators of depository institutions are responsible for examining compliance with the BSA, conducting routine inspections concurrently with BSA examinations. The FFIEC ensures uniformity in BSA enforcement procedures among depository financial institutions. Additionally, the FFIEC has established a Working Group to enhance coordination among regulatory agencies, law enforcement, and private financial institutions. The National Anti-Money Laundering Group (NAMLG) was formed in 1997 to set guidelines for detecting illegal transactions and ensuring compliance in depository institutions. The group, which includes regulatory agencies, law enforcement, and banking industry trade groups, aims to identify institutions at high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. Financial regulatory agencies are self-funding for antiterrorist and money laundering efforts. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regulates over 2,000 nationally chartered banks and conducts on-site examinations at least three times within a two-year period. They review internal controls, audits, and BSA compliance. The OCC conducted about 1,340 BSA examinations in 2003 and nearly 5,000 since 1998. When violations are found, formal or informal actions may be taken. Informal actions are taken when examiners identify limited scope problems and trust management to correct them. These actions include commitment letters or memoranda of understanding. Formal enforcement actions, such as cease and desist orders, are more severe and may involve civil fines or removal from the banking industry. The OCC issued 78 formal enforcement actions related to BSA issues from 1998 to 2003, while informal actions are numerous. The OCC issued numerous informal enforcement actions related to BSA issues, with the most recent severe case involving Riggs Bank, which was fined $25 million in May 2004. The Federal Reserve System supervises state-chartered commercial banks and financial holding companies, using on-site examinations and off-site surveillance. Larger institutions are examined continuously, with coordination by the Board of Governors of the Fed. The Federal Reserve coordinates examination and compliance activities for regional banks. In recent years, enforcement actions have been taken against financial institutions for violations under the Bank Secrecy Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulates state-chartered banks and savings associations, insuring deposits for thousands of depository institutions. The FDIC insures deposits for depository institutions and conducts BSA examinations. Since 2000, they have conducted over 1,100 BSA examinations and issued enforcement actions against institutions and individuals for violations. The Inspector General audited the FDIC twice, finding inadequate guidance for BSA examinations. During the audit period, 2,672 institutions were cited for BSA failures to report, with 458 repeat violations. Many citations were for serious violations like failure to comply with record-keeping and reporting requirements for CTRs. The FDIC took a long time to follow up on violations, with some taking up to five years before action was taken. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) oversees federally chartered savings associations and banks independently within the Treasury. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) conducts on-site examinations of institutions, finding problems at 180 thrifts and taking actions against eleven. The Treasury IG's audit criticized OTS for ineffective actions and reliance on moral suasion over penalties. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulates over 12,000 credit unions. In 2000, the Polish and Slavic Federal Credit Union in New York City was fined $185,000 for failure to file CTRs and granting exemptions improperly. In 2003, NCUA examined 4,400 credit unions and found 334 BSA violations in 261 institutions, mostly due to inadequate policies and customer identification. NCUA reported that 99% of violations were corrected during or after on-site examinations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities markets to protect investors against fraud and deceptive practices. It supervises over 8,000 registered broker-dealers and has authority to examine institutions for BSA compliance. The SEC's approach to BSA monitoring is a joint effort with NAMLG and differs from depository institution regulators. The securities industry is largely overseen by self-regulating organizations (SROs). The SEC, along with self-regulating organizations, oversees the securities industry and conducts joint examinations for BSA compliance. Efforts are focused on educating the industry on compliance responsibilities, with specific regulations released in 2003. The CFTC delegates BSA examinations to designated self-regulatory organizations like the NFA and the Chicago Board of Trade. The National Futures Association (NFA), the Chicago Board of Trade, and New York Mercantile Exchange are key regulatory bodies in the futures industry. NFA membership includes over 4,000 firms and 50,000 individuals. The regulatory process begins with registration, where firms and individuals are screened. Designated self-regulatory organizations (DSROs) monitor business practices and can take disciplinary actions. Covered businesses must report suspicious activity, verify customer identities, and monitor certain accounts. In 2003, the NFA conducted 365 examinations of futures commission merchants and introducing brokers, resulting in 238 audit reports. In 2003, the NFA conducted 365 examinations of futures commission merchants and introducing brokers, resulting in 238 audit reports. 54 reports showed anti-money laundering deficiencies at nine merchants and 45 brokers, mainly due to non-compliance with audit and training requirements. The IRS manages various taxes and fees, processes tax returns, enforces compliance, collects taxes, and provides services to taxpayers. The IRS plays a crucial role in enforcing tax laws, resolving disputes, and supporting efforts to combat funding to terrorist groups. They utilize financial intelligence, diplomatic pressure, and criminal investigations to uncover links between terrorist organizations and financial violations. The IRS enforces compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, money laundering schemes, and fund diversion from tax-exempt charities. Despite receiving $10.236 billion in funds in FY2005, only 43% is allocated for tax law enforcement, including contributions to the campaign against terrorist financing. There is no specific budget line item for activities related to terrorist financing, raising concerns about the priority given to disrupting funds to terrorist organizations. In FY2005, the IRS budget for activities related to terrorist financing may total $31.2 million, up from $20-25 million in FY2004. This amounts to 0.7% of its budget for tax law enforcement. The IRS's efforts against terrorist financing rely on its Criminal Investigation, Small Business and Self-Employed Taxpayers Division, and Tax-Exempt and Government Entities Division. The main division involved is Criminal Investigation, which investigates tax evasion and financial crimes related to tax. The Criminal Investigation division of the IRS investigates tax evasion, financial crimes related to tax, anti-money laundering violations, and financial reporting statutes. They use various statutes to prosecute criminal conduct such as abusive tax shelters, offshore tax evasion, and corporate fraud. Additionally, they investigate failures to report cash payments over $10,000 and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, including structuring deposits to avoid reporting requirements. The division is skilled at uncovering attempts to evade taxes or launder money through illicit activities using nominees, cash, and multiple bank accounts. In response to terrorist financing post-9/11, the IRS Criminal Investigation division has adapted its capabilities to expose, track, and dismantle the sources of terrorist funding. Terrorist groups are evolving their methods to move funds outside formal financial systems, such as using cash couriers and alternative remittance systems. In FY2005, CI's spending on investigating terrorist financing is expected to be $30.5 million, nearly 98% of the total IRS budget for this purpose. In FY2005, the SB/SE Division is expected to work full-time on activities related to terrorist financing, with 182 agents from CI involved. They enforce tax code compliance, monitor non-banking financial institutions for BSA reporting, and conduct examinations of MSBs, casinos, and credit unions. Cases involving suspected money laundering to terrorist groups are referred to CI and Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. A new Office of Fraud/BSA was established within the SB/SE Division in October 2004 to coordinate IRS efforts in enforcing BSA compliance. The director of the office reports directly to the Commissioner of SB/SE and is responsible for BSA policy formation and data management. The TE/GE Division oversees the financial affairs of charities, evaluates tax-exempt status applications, and revised Form 1023 to include relevant information for criminal investigators. Agents from the Exempt Organizations branch assist CI and other federal agencies in cases involving financial crimes or terrorist financing. In FY2004, the Exempt Organizations branch of the TE/GE Division started an educational program to help charities prevent funds from being diverted to support terrorist activities. In FY2005, they plan to establish the Exempt Organization Fraud and Financial Transactions Unit to expose and disrupt the diversion of charitable assets for terrorism. The Division's spending on terrorist financing investigations in FY2005 is unclear. The IRS's Criminal Investigations special agents play a crucial role in combating terrorist financing by utilizing their knowledge, skills, and technology to collect financial information under various statutes. These agents undergo extensive training in accounting, business finance, criminal investigative techniques, and forensic accounting. They also receive specialized training in tracking and thwarting terrorist financing. Experienced agents excel at unraveling complex financial transactions by analyzing detailed financial information. The IRS employs special agents trained in digital evidence preservation and financial data recovery. Some agents are involved in counterterrorism investigations and a pilot anti-terrorism initiative at the Garden City Counterterrorism Lead Development Center. The initiative supports anti-terrorist financing investigations led by the FBI or CI special agents. The IRS employs special agents trained in digital evidence preservation and financial data recovery for counterterrorism investigations. Task Forces led by the FBI or CI special agents at the Garden City Counterterrorism Lead Development Center analyze financial data from tax forms and other sources to track tax evasion and financial crimes related to terrorist groups and tax-exempt organizations raising funds for terrorism. The IRS tracks tax evasion and financial crimes, including illegal money movement to terrorist groups. Non-BSA covered firms must report customer cash purchases over $10,000. US residents and firms with foreign transactions must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. The IRS monitors BSA compliance for non-banking financial institutions like MSBs and casinos. The IRS is responsible for processing and storing BSA documents collected by federal agencies, including FBARs, currency transactions reports, and suspicious activity reports. The CBRS currently holds close to 144 million BSA documents, with plans for FinCEN to take over processing through BSA Direct. Data from BSA documents has been crucial in investigations into terrorist financing, with the IRS being the largest user of this information. The IRS collaborates with various Treasury bureaus and federal agencies to investigate terrorist financing activities. They work closely with the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Office of Foreign Assets Control, FinCEN, and the Working Group on Terrorist Financing and Charities. The IRS contributes to inter-agency initiatives aimed at tracking and disrupting funds to terrorist groups, including the National Counterterrorism Center and the Informal Value Transfer System Working Group. The IRS collaborates with various federal agencies and bureaus to investigate terrorist financing activities. They work with the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, FinCEN, and other groups. The IRS contributes to inter-agency initiatives to track and disrupt funds to terrorist groups, but there is no formal method to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these efforts. The IRS collaborates with other agencies to investigate terrorist financing. The agency's involvement raises policy questions about its effectiveness and use of resources. The IRS tracks anti-terrorist financing investigations, with over 100 leading to indictments and others still ongoing. The IRS has made limited changes in its contributions to combat terrorist financing post-9/11. In 2004, a new senior executive position was established to coordinate activities related to terrorist financing, currently held by Rebecca Sparkman. Her duties include evaluating the agency's efficacy in fighting terrorist financing and overseeing criminal cases related to it. The IRS has made limited changes in its contributions to combat terrorist financing post-9/11. A new senior executive position was established in 2004 to oversee criminal cases related to terrorist financing and ensure coordination with other federal agencies. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, established in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for border security. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for interdicting illicit cross-border traffic and enforcing laws for various federal agencies, including those related to terrorist financing. CBP intercepts illicit material and contraband entering or exiting the country to prevent financial proceeds from reaching terrorist or criminal groups. CBP's Outbound Interdiction and Security activities focus on enforcing U.S. export laws, interdicting illegal exports, enforcing sanctions against terrorist groups, and intercepting illicit proceeds from criminal activities. They also enforce regulations for various federal agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Commerce, and Department of the Treasury. CBP enforces over 400 laws at the border, including those related to criminal violations such as money laundering, smuggling, and false statements. The agency has more than 40,000 employees, with nearly 18,000 front line inspectors. Data on budget and resources specifically for terrorist financing are not readily available. CBP has a budget of $6.5 billion for FY2005 and $6.7 billion requested for FY2006. They have an Outbound Currency Interdiction Training program with an anti-terrorism component. CBP also has the largest Canine Enforcement Program with over 1,200 teams trained to detect currency. In FY2004, CBP made 1,320 seizures of unreported currency valued at $45.9 million. CBP's Canine Enforcement Program made 1,337 seizures valued at $51.7 million for violations of ITAR, EAR, and sanctions. They also seized U.S. currency worth $28.2 million in FY2004. CBP sets targets based on outbound currency seizures and coordination with other agencies like ICE, Coast Guard, and TSA. CBP's National Targeting Center houses staff from various agencies including ICE, Coast Guard, USDA, TSA, and FBI to support frontline operations in detecting terrorists. OINT maintains relationships with intelligence agencies like ICE, FBI, CIA, TTIC, and TSC. ICE is the main investigative branch of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE, the main investigative branch of the Department of Homeland Security, was established in March 2003 and is composed of various investigative components. ICE's Financial Investigations Division (FID) focuses on investigating financial crimes and working with the financial community to address vulnerabilities in the country's financial infrastructure.ICE played a significant role in fighting terrorist financing after the September 11, 2001 attacks through initiatives like \"Operation Green Quest.\" ICE's Operation Green Quest was a taskforce focused on countering terrorist financing. After the creation of DHS, ICE's investigations overlapped with the FBI's Terrorist Financing Operation Section. To avoid duplication, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed designating the FBI as the lead agency for terrorist financing investigations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between ICE and the FBI ensured ICE's involvement in terrorist financing investigations by detailing personnel to each other and developing collaborative procedures to determine links to terrorism. ICE created a vetting unit staffed by both ICE and FBI personnel to review investigations and leads for any connections to terrorism, referring cases to the FBI's Terrorist Financing Operation Section when necessary. ICE has combined the authorities and jurisdictions of the legacy Customs Service and legacy INS to create the Financial Investigations Division. This division includes the Financial Investigations Program and Cornerstone, focusing on investigations related to drug and 'non-drug' money laundering, human smuggling, telemarketing fraud, child pornography, counterfeit goods trafficking, and other financial crimes. The Money Laundering Coordination Center (MLCC) serves as the central clearinghouse for domestic financial leads. The Money Laundering Coordination Center (MLCC) is the central clearinghouse for domestic and international money laundering operations within ICE. Cornerstone's mission is to coordinate and integrate ICE's financial investigations targeting terrorist and criminal organizations' illicit funding methods. It involves mapping and coordinating financial, commercial, and trade crime investigations, collaborating with the private sector to identify vulnerabilities, and gathering and distributing intelligence. ICE's Office of Intelligence supports all investigations, including financial ones through its Illicit Finance Unit. ICE has investigatory jurisdiction over violations of 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957. ICE has investigatory jurisdiction over violations of 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 related to international financial crimes, including money laundering from drug smuggling, trade fraud, and human trafficking. They also have attache offices in foreign countries and lead a Foreign Political Corruption Unit to combat the laundering of proceeds from foreign political corruption. ICE focuses on combating money laundering from foreign political corruption, bribery, and embezzlement. They provide training and assistance to foreign governments through programs like the International Law Enforcement Academy and the Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics Law Enforcement. ICE conducts money laundering-related training in various countries and collaborates with organizations like the Organization of American State's Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission Program. ICE's Financial Investigations Division received significant funding in FY2003 and FY2004, with a total of 277 personnel assigned to JTTFs. The Office of Investigations, including FID, had a budget of $1.1 billion in FY2005 and requested $1.3 billion for FY2006. Data on ICE investigations related to terrorist financing are not readily available, but information on financial investigations is accessible. ICE's Financial Investigations Division received significant funding in FY2003 and FY2004, with a total of 277 personnel assigned to JTTFs. Recent information published by ICE indicates that through Cornerstone, ICE has seized nearly $300 million in currency and made 1,800 arrests for financial crimes. ICE maintains strong relationships with other U.S. agencies involved in financial investigations, as well as with foreign governments and international organizations. The United States Secret Service, now part of the Department of Homeland Security, has historical roots dating back to 1865 as a small anti-counterfeiting force. The Secret Service, originally part of the Department of the Treasury since 1865, now combats terrorism and financial crimes, including anti-terrorist financing. Despite no longer being under the Treasury Department, it still maintains connections and responsibilities from its previous home. The agency's authority, functions, and jurisdiction were continued when it moved to the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service's involvement in combating terrorist financing stems from its missions of protection and criminal investigations. It investigates various financial crimes such as counterfeiting, access device fraud, and computer-based attacks on the nation's financial infrastructure. The agency's authority and functions were maintained when it moved to the Department of Homeland Security. The Financial Crimes Division within the Secret Service is crucial for combating terrorist financing, focusing on financial institution fraud, money laundering, forgery, and access device fraud. Task forces involving the division target international organized crime groups and their proceeds, which are often diverted towards other criminal activities. These task forces collaborate with other federal agencies and international organizations like INTERPOL. The Secret Service collaborates with various task forces and agencies like INTERPOL to combat terrorist financing. However, detailed information about their operations is limited due to secrecy and sensitivity. They provide more information to Congress in confidential settings. The federal involvement in combating terrorist financing is evolving, with changes in organizational structure and interagency coordination. Actual practices may differ from expected ones, and formal institutional arrangements may not reflect informal relationships. The Secret Service's role in combating terrorist financing may not be adequately described in the public record, leading to uncertainty and confusion. Changes in roles and practices have occurred since the Service's move into Homeland Security from Treasury, and further changes may occur based on Treasury's responsibilities, TFI's involvement, or the Secret Service's priorities. The FBI, as the lead agency in the Department of Justice, is responsible for protecting national security and combating criminal activities. Its priorities include investigating organized crime, drug trafficking, public corruption, white collar crime, civil rights violations, and significant federal crimes such as kidnapping and child exploitation. Additionally, the FBI provides training and operational assistance to state agencies. The FBI's top priorities are counterterrorism and counterintelligence. They have the responsibility to counter criminal money laundering and terrorist financing. The investigation of illicit money flows is a key focus within the FBI. The FBI's Criminal Investigative Division, specifically the Financial Crimes Section and Money Laundering Unit, specialize in tracing illicit proceeds associated with money laundering. They work with various agencies to identify emerging trends and methods in money laundering. The FBI's Money Laundering Unit analyzes suspicious activity reports to generate new investigations. In 2001, the FBI accounted for over one-quarter of criminal cases referred for prosecution involving money laundering. The FBI also leads investigations into terrorist financing as a distinct crime from money laundering. The FBI's responsibility for tracking terrorist financing was enhanced with the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act in 1994. Prior to 9/11, the FBI lacked a centralized approach to terrorist financial matters, but in April 2002, the Terrorist Financing Operations Section was established to integrate various elements for a proactive approach. The FBI's Terrorist Financing Operations Section (TFOS) conducts financial analysis of terrorist suspects, coordinates with private, government, and foreign entities, utilizes intelligence to further investigations, and develops predictive models to identify unknown suspects. TFOS was established in 2002 after the USA PATRIOT Act enhanced the FBI's responsibility for tracking terrorist financing. TFOS at the FBI conducts financial analysis of terrorist suspects, coordinates with various entities to access electronic data sources, and provides operational and educational support for counterterrorism efforts. The FBI's TFOS group provides proactive operational support by working with document exploitation personnel to generate leads. Projects include the Proactive Exploits Group, Suspicious Activity Report Project, and Terrorist Risk Assessment Model for identifying potential terrorists through data mining and analysis. The FBI's TFOS group utilizes predictive pattern recognition algorithms to identify potential terrorists and terrorist financing activities. They have enhanced access to real-time information domestically and internationally through various sectors such as banking, securities, insurance, and telecommunications. TFOS investigators have supported investigations leading to the exchange of personnel between the FBI and foreign countries. The State Department has requested TFOS to provide training to countries on countering terrorist financing. FBI measures success through deterrence, disruption, and prevention of terrorist attacks. The FBI measures success in countering terrorist financing through deterrence, disruption, prevention, and identification of terrorist suspects and organizations. They also focus on analyzing financial information post-attack, generating leads, making arrests, and seizing terrorist assets. The FBI has highlighted its achievements in collaboration with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The FBI has achieved success in countering terrorist financing through various operations, including disrupting Hezbollah's fundraising network, blocking assets of the Holy Land Foundation linked to Hamas, and shutting down the Benevolence International Foundation for funding Al Qaeda. They have developed intelligence requirements to address concerns raised by the GAO regarding alternative financing mechanisms. The FBI implements requirements to track terrorist financing mechanisms and coordinates with domestic and international agencies through Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The FBI participates in various task forces and working groups to coordinate efforts to counter terrorist financing domestically and internationally. This includes collaboration with state and local law enforcement, as well as other federal agencies such as the National Security Council, State Department, Treasury, and Homeland Security. In 2003, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed to clarify and de-conflict the FBI and DHS's activities in combating terrorist financing. The FBI and DHS signed a Memorandum of Agreement in 2003 to coordinate efforts in investigating terrorist financing. The FBI was designated as the lead agency for these investigations, while DHS focused on protecting the financial system. Existing DHS terrorist financing investigations were reviewed jointly to determine if there was a terrorism nexus. Cases with a terrorism nexus were transferred to the FBI-led JTTF, where DHS-ICE officers played a crucial role. Cases without a terrorism nexus remained with DHS-ICE and could become part of \"Operation Cornerstone.\" The FBI and DHS signed a Memorandum of Agreement in 2003 to coordinate efforts in investigating terrorist financing. The FBI leads investigations with a focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system through \"Operation Cornerstone.\" Internationally, the FBI collaborates with the International Terrorism Financing Working Group and the Joint Terrorist Financing Task Force to gather information on terrorist financing activities. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal laws related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives, and arson. They work to prevent crime, regulate industries, support law enforcement, and provide training programs. The information gathered on terrorist financing in the Near East region is provided to Task Force on Terrorist Financing (TFOS) and FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) for investigation. The ATF supports law enforcement efforts, including preventing terrorism and promoting national security. They participate in joint terrorism task force initiatives and counterterrorism partnerships. Operations show terrorist organizations may be using tobacco and alcohol to fund criminal activities. The ATF aims to disrupt criminal and terrorist organizations by investigating illicit alcohol diversion and contraband cigarette trafficking. The ATF aims to disrupt criminal and terrorist organizations by investigating contraband cigarette and illegal liquor trafficking, conducting financial investigations, preventing criminal encroachment on legitimate industries, and assisting law enforcement agencies in interstate trafficking investigations. ATF teams conduct complex investigations of multi-state criminal violations and have found terrorism links in some cases. Several ATF investigations have uncovered terrorism links, such as a case in 2003 where an organization in North Carolina trafficked cigarettes to Michigan to fund Hezbollah. ATF collaborates with various federal agencies to prevent unlawful trafficking in firearms and explosives, as well as the diversion of alcohol and tobacco for terrorist activities. The ATF collaborates with federal agencies like the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Joint Terrorism Task Force to prevent unlawful trafficking in firearms and explosives. They also work with the FBI Strategic Intelligence Operations Center and participate in the Law Enforcement Information Sharing group. Additionally, ATF maintains agreements with six Regional Information Sharing Systems agencies. DEA's mission is to enforce laws against illegal drug activities, with estimates of the global illicit drug market reaching $300-$500 billion annually, providing opportunities for drug proceeds to fund terrorism through money laundering. The DEA has authority to investigate monetary transactions related to unlawful drug activities under U.S. money laundering statutes. DEA's enforcement jurisdiction is contingent upon funds being derived from illegal narcotics trafficking. DEA Administrator Karen Tandy mandates that every DEA investigation includes a financial investigative component. Tandy mandates that every DEA investigation includes a financial investigative component to potentially uncover monetary links to terrorist entities. DEA has designated components with anti-money laundering responsibilities at headquarters and field divisions, as well as in multi-agency sections coordinating money-laundering investigations.

DEA's investigations focus on activities involving narcotics and precursor materials with the potential to fund terrorist activities. The DEA focuses on combating terrorist financing by investigating activities involving narcotics and precursor materials that could fund terrorist organizations. Operations like Mountain Express and Northern Star have uncovered potential links between drug trafficking in the US and terrorist groups. The SOD-SCU coordinates responses to terrorism-related requests and shares information with other federal agencies like the National Joint Terrorism Task Force and Department of Homeland Security. Extremist/terrorist information from domestic field investigations is documented for further action. Information on extremist/terrorist activities from domestic and foreign office investigations is documented in teletypes and immediately shared with relevant U.S. government agencies and local enforcement counterparts. All cooperating sources in DEA investigations are debriefed quarterly for any terrorist-related information. The Department of State is responsible for fighting terrorism through various means, including counterterrorism finance programs. The Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism (S/CT) is one of the bureaus within State that focuses on blocking the flow of terrorist financing.

In response to 9/11 Commission concerns, the U.S. government aims to persuade other countries to adopt financial regulations for tracing financial activities. Some observers recommend a counter-terrorist financing certification regime to enhance international cooperation. Legislative proposals like H.R. 1952 aim to establish a regime requiring Treasury to identify non-compliant countries and withhold assistance. The Vienna Convention criminalized money laundering internationally in 1988, promoting collaboration among governments in investigations. This aligns with H.R. 1952's goal of enhancing international cooperation on anti-money laundering issues. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was created by the Group of Seven nations in 1989 to facilitate cooperation on anti-money laundering issues globally. The UN's International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, in force since April 10, 2002, requires countries to criminalize funding of terrorist activities and implement measures to prevent the flow of terrorist funds. United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, established measures to combat terrorism, focusing on financing, intelligence sharing, and restricting terrorists' travel. It mandated states to criminalize Al Qaeda financial activities, freeze their assets, and exchange intelligence. Compliance is mandatory for all member-states under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. UNSCR 1267, passed in October 1999, established the \"1267 Committee\" to monitor sanctions on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan for supporting Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Member states must freeze assets of listed individuals/entities. Resolution 1526 (2004) expanded the mandate to freeze economic resources from Al Qaeda and Taliban-controlled properties, cut funds from non-profit organizations, and informal remittance systems to terrorist groups. Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body housed at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris. It develops policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, setting standards for its 33 members. FATF focuses on non-traditional methods of financing terrorism and money laundering, such as cash couriers and non-profit organizations. FATF sets standards and recommendations for member countries to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In 2001, it released Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing, including criminalizing financing of terrorism, freezing terrorist assets, and reporting suspicious transactions. The Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) was established in November 2004 to implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing standards among 14 Middle Eastern member states. MENAFATF aims to prevent cross-border movements of currency related to terrorist financing and enhance information-sharing between countries. The Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) was established in November 2004 to implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing standards among its 14 Middle Eastern member states. The regional body, headquartered in Bahrain, serves as a forum for sharing knowledge and expertise on terrorist financing issues and assessing progress in combating terrorist financing in the region. The IMF and World Bank have also integrated counter-terrorist financing activities into their work. The IMF and World Bank conducted a pilot program in 2003-2004 to evaluate countries' compliance with FATF recommendations. The program was made permanent in March 2004, leading to deeper collaboration between the IMF, World Bank, FATF, and FSRBs. Recommendations for improvement include closer coordination with FATF, equitable burden sharing, and broadening staff responsibilities for assessment missions. The IMF and World Bank, through their technical assistance function, offer advice on issues related to terrorist financing, but it is up to national governments to implement any new laws suggested by FATF, IMF, or World Bank recommendations. Efforts to regulate and introduce transparency into the global financial system are welcomed, but may not completely reduce the availability of significant funds for terrorists. Efforts to regulate and introduce transparency into the global financial system are welcome steps; however, they may not fully reduce terrorists' capacity to strike due to challenges in separating them from other lawbreakers. Policy questions arise regarding the U.S. strategy to counter terrorist financing and reorganize the government for its implementation. Key questions include whether to prioritize freezing assets or following financial trails, and who should lead the U.S. Government's terrorist financing strategy. The U.S. Government's current terrorist financing strategy is debated, with suggestions that Treasury should lead the effort due to its expertise. Questions arise about the jurisdiction among federal departments and agencies involved in combating terrorist financing, potential overlaps, and budget allocations. Efforts to enhance inter-departmental and inter-agency coordination are also considered for future improvements. Efforts are being made to enhance inter-departmental and inter-agency coordination on policy-setting and enforcement for countering terrorist financing. Congressional oversight mechanisms are being evaluated for effectiveness in coordinating functions among various departments and agencies. Reforming congressional jurisdiction may lead to more effective Executive Branch action in the fight against terrorism and terrorist financing. The use of alternative remittance systems by terrorists raises questions about regulation. The increased use of alternative remittance systems by terrorists raises questions about regulation. Registering informal money-transmitters to comply with USA PATRIOT Act requirements may be costly. Making alternative remittance systems illegal could create resentment among immigrant communities. Cooperation with other countries is essential to enforce national regulations on terrorist financing. Entities based in the U.S. or with U.S. operations are subject to U.S. jurisdiction. When outside U.S. jurisdiction, the U.S. relies on other governments to enact and enforce legislation against terrorist financing. Various agencies and acts are involved in this effort. Various U.S. agencies and entities are involved in combating terrorist financing, including the FBI, DEA, DHS, and FinCEN, among others.
