The \"Tobacco Tax Equity Act of 2015\" equalizes excise tax rates for different tobacco products, including pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. The amendment adjusts the tax rates to ensure parity among these products. It defines a \"discrete single-use unit\" as a product containing tobacco not intended to be smoked, such as lozenges, tablets, pills, pouches, dissolvable strips, or other single-dose units. Additionally, the tax on large cigars is amended to $24.78 per pound. The tax rates for large cigars are set at $24.78 per pound with additional guidance on weight determination. The amendment also addresses tax parity for roll-your-own tobacco and certain processed tobacco, as well as clarifying tax rates for other tobacco products. The amendment clarifies tax rates for other tobacco products determined by the FDA, aligning them with cigarette tax rates on a per-use basis. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish tax rates for tobacco products equivalent to cigarette tax rates per use. The definition of tobacco products is clarified to include cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. The tax rates for tobacco products will be adjusted for inflation starting in 2015. The dollar amounts provided in the tax code will be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $0.01, it will be rounded up. Effective dates for these changes will be specified. The amendments made by this section will apply to articles removed after specific dates, with different effective dates for various tobacco products. The amendments made by subsection (e)(1) will apply to other tobacco products removed after the issuance of final regulations establishing the tax level."
