    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Transportation Financing Improvement Act of 1993\". It establishes State Transportation Investment Loan Funds. Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to allow states to establish transportation investment loan funds for eligible projects. The enactment of an appropriations Act allows the Secretary of Transportation to establish a schedule for deposits and payments for a transportation investment loan fund. States can deposit funds from apportioned amounts to meet their obligations. The discretionary funds apportioned to the State under the surface transportation program, along with the difference between allocated and obligated amounts, are considered expenditures by the State. Cash management requirements do not apply to this section. State matching requirements are also outlined. State matching requirements mandate that a State must deposit additional funds from non-Federal sources into a transportation investment loan fund, equal to the sum of the amount deposited under subsection (a) and a proportional non-Federal share determined according to section 120(b). State matching requirements dictate that a State must provide a percentage of non-Federal share for a project, determined according to section 120(b). Investment income earned on amounts in the transportation investment loan fund is credited back to the fund and can be used for providing loans and assistance. From the fund, a State can loan an amount equal to the project cost to a public or private entity. The public or private entity can receive assistance for a qualifying project, subject to compliance with federal laws. The loan amount can be subordinated to other project debt financing. The loan or assistance for a project must not be subordinated to other loans. Repayment must start within 5 years of project opening, with a maximum loan term of 30 years. The loan should have interest rates at or below market rates determined by the State. The loan or assistance for a feasible project can be repaid and reused for any transportation purpose. The Secretary will establish procedures for making loans and providing assistance from a transportation investment loan fund. \"Other assistance\" includes refinancing debt for a qualifying project if certified by the State. The transportation investment loan fund can be used for various purposes, including refinancing debt for qualifying projects, guaranteeing or purchasing insurance for borrower debt, and providing loan guarantees. Additionally, states can use funds from the loan fund as security for bonds and notes issued for capital in addition to what is already available. The transportation investment loan fund allows states to use up to 2 percent of federal funds for administrative costs. Loans of federal funds are available for the construction of nontoll facilities. Loans of Federal funds for the construction of nontoll facilities can be made by a State to a public or private entity if repayment is from a dedicated revenue source. The term 'qualifying project' refers to a project meeting these requirements. The public or private entity receiving a loan must ensure project compliance with relevant laws. Loan amounts can be subordinated to other debt financing, except for loans from the State or public entities. Funds loaned can be used for qualifying projects. The loan repayment for qualifying projects must start within 5 years of project completion, with a maximum loan term of 30 years. The loan interest rate should be at or below market rates determined by the State. Repaid funds can be reused for refinancing debt or other purposes related to the qualifying project. The Secretary shall establish guidelines for making loans for qualifying projects, including financing, debt enhancement, and loan guarantees within 180 days of enactment. SEC. 4. TOLL ROADS. Amendment to section 129(a) of title 23 allows states to loan the Federal share of a toll project to public or private entities. The qualifying project must comply with federal laws and regulations. The loan amount for a qualifying project can be subordinated to other debt financing, except for loans from the State or public entities constructing the project. Funds loaned can be obligated for qualifying projects, and repayment of the loan is required. The repayment of a loan for a qualifying project must start within 5 years of the facility opening. The loan term cannot exceed 30 years, with interest rates determined by the State. Repaid funds can be reused for any purpose. The loaned funds can be used for refinancing outstanding debt, guaranteeing or purchasing insurance for borrower debt, or providing a loan guarantee. Guidelines must be established within 180 days of the State Transportation Act's enactment. The Secretary shall establish procedures and guidelines for making loans under the State Transportation Financing Improvement Act of 1993. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENT TO TABLE OF CONTENTS. The chapter analysis in title 23, United States Code, is amended to include new items related to state transportation investment loan funds and loans of Federal funds for nontoll facilities."
