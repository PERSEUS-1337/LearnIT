    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act of 2009\". Between 1990 and 2000, the Chesapeake Bay watershed saw an 8% increase in population and a 41% increase in impervious surface cover. Urban stormwater runoff is the main source of pollution in the area, while pollution from point sources and agriculture is decreasing. Various techniques have been developed since the late 1990s to retain stormwater and pollutants using infiltration, plants, and stormwater harvesting. The National Academy of Sciences recommends strong new regulations and funding for local stormwater regulation efforts, finding that low impact development stormwater management techniques are more cost-effective and effective at protecting and restoring stable hydrology than traditional methods. Local governments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed are implementing retention techniques and strict new requirements to reduce stormwater runoff. Data from various jurisdictions in Chesapeake Bay tributaries show a negative correlation between impervious surface cover and stream health. The Chesapeake Bay watershed is losing 100 acres of forest daily, leading to a decline in forest cover from 95% to 58%. Forests play a crucial role in capturing airborne nitrogen pollution and preventing stormwater runoff pollution. Reduction of pollution from impervious surfaces is addressed in Section 3. Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to address the reduction of pollution from impervious surfaces in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Local governments must obtain and comply with permits by January 1, 2009, to ensure stormwater discharge compliance. The amendment to Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires local governments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to ensure that development projects on land over one acre and less than 5% covered by impervious surfaces manage stormwater effectively. This involves infiltrating, evapotranspirating, or harvesting water on-site after project completion to meet the 95th percentile precipitation event criteria. The Administrator can make grants to local governments with permits for compliance and low impact development projects. Grants can cover costs for permit compliance and project implementation up to 75%. The Administrator will issue guidance on on-site stormwater retention practices by June 1, 2010. By January 1, 2012, plans will be developed to increase forest cover in the Chesapeake Bay watershed on Federal land. The subsection defines a unit of local government as a county, city, or other political subdivision with jurisdiction over land use. It authorizes $1.5 billion to the Administrator for reforestation plans on disturbed or developed land."
