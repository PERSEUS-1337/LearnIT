Disposal of munitions can also be dangerous if not properly neutralized. Chemical constituents in munitions can leach and cause additional risks. Chemical constituents in munitions can leach into the environment, posing potential health risks through exposure pathways in air, soil, groundwater, or surface water. Long-term exposure to contaminants can increase health risks, with perchlorate being a common substance of concern. The Department of Defense has historically addressed risks from munitions without a consolidated effort to track progress and costs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 required the Department of Defense to establish a program to clean up munitions on former military training ranges and properly dispose of discarded munitions in the US and its territories. This led to the creation of the Military Munitions Response Program within the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. The Military Munitions Response Program, established by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, addresses the cleanup of former training ranges and munitions disposal sites on active and closed military installations in the United States. Cleanup of operational training ranges is managed separately on an installation basis, with minimal cleanup done on operational ranges as long as they remain in use. Once munitions are removed from operational ranges, they are subject to federal disposal regulations. Extensive cleanup may be necessary if contaminants migrate off-site. The Military Munitions Response Program does not cover training ranges at U.S. military installations in other nations. Cleanup responsibilities at these installations abroad are governed by Status of Forces Agreements, which vary in terms of U.S. government responsibility. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) generally governs the investigation and cleanup of former military training ranges and munitions disposal sites in the United States. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) governs cleanup at individual sites and specifies requirements for disposal facilities. Cleanup decisions are based on potential risks, with multiple actions allowed. The EPA and states oversee DOD's cleanup efforts to ensure compliance with these laws. Cleanup requirements vary depending on exposure pathways and means to prevent exposure. The means to prevent exposure during cleanup of munitions sites vary, with some sites requiring clearance to a certain depth while others only need surface clearance. \"Blow in Place\" (BIP) is often used to safely detonate munitions in place instead of transporting them. Access restrictions may be used to manage risks, allowing munitions to be left in place in some cases. DOD identified 3,537 potentially contaminated sites on former training ranges and munitions disposal sites in the US by FY2007. Most are on Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) from pre-1988, with fewer on BRAC-closed installations. DOD prioritized response actions based on risks, considering factors like munitions type and location. The Department of Defense (DOD) identified 3,537 potentially contaminated sites on former training ranges and munitions disposal sites in the US by FY2007. Response actions were complete at 920 sites, not needed at 470 sites, and ongoing or planned at 1,113 sites. Evaluation of potential risks was not completed at 1,034 sites, leading to uncertainty about necessary actions and funding. Funding for the Military Munitions Response Program comes from various defense appropriations accounts. The Military Munitions Response Program is funded by various defense appropriations accounts, depending on the status of the installation and military branch jurisdiction. There are five Defense Environmental Restoration Accounts, with specific allocations for active installations of the Army, Navy, Air Force, defense-wide sites, FUDS sites, and BRAC accounts for closed bases. DOD prioritizes and allocates funds from these accounts for cleanup at contaminated sites. DOD spent 6% of estimated total costs for munitions cleanup at contaminated sites by FY2007. From FY1997 to FY2007, $1.24 billion was spent on cleanup, with an estimated $19.23 billion needed for future cleanup actions. Historical data before FY1997 lacks specific breakdowns of costs for munitions cleanup. Cleanup actions at FUDS sites make up 68% of future costs, while active installations account for 27%. BRAC sites, though only 5% of costs, are crucial for civilian reuse. Munitions cleanup on land is a priority, but underwater munitions have received less attention. The cleanup of munitions underwater is more challenging and costly than on land, with potential risks that may outweigh removal efforts. Concern is growing about risks in coastal areas where surplus munitions were disposed of by the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. This issue has gained attention due to the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. DOD has released recent information on the disposal of chemical weapons off U.S. shores, with concerns about locating and removing them due to uncertain coordinates and ocean currents. Congress has funded a pilot program to identify weapons off the coast of Hawaii. There are worries about the adequacy and pace of cleanup efforts at current sites, and questions about the presence of munitions at unidentified locations. The capability of current technologies to locate and neutralize munitions is also being questioned. The cleanup of FUDS sites, including closed bases and active installations, has raised concerns about locating and neutralizing munitions efficiently. Public desire for greater funding to speed up the cleanup process is driven by potential risks on these lands. While there is less concern about munitions sites on active installations, some communities near these sites have expressed worries about health risks. Some communities near active installations are concerned about health risks from munitions contaminants migrating off-site through groundwater. DOD's estimates of cleanup costs are uncertain due to varying cleanup requirements at different sites, leading to changing cost projections as more information is gathered. DOD's estimates of cleanup costs are uncertain due to varying cleanup requirements at different sites, leading to changing cost projections as more information is gathered. Actual costs could be higher than estimated if more munitions and contamination are discovered than expected, and more extensive cleanup is needed than anticipated. New or more stringent cleanup standards could also cause costs to rise. The development of cost-effective technologies to locate and neutralize munitions could help control costs, but inflation over time could cause actual costs to differ from current estimates. In carrying out its statutory authorities, DOD works with regulators to determine cleanup needs for human safety, health, and the environment. More information will be available to assess resources needed for potential risks and munitions cleanup technologies."
