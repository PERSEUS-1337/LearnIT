    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Streamlining of Energy Facilities Act of 2001\" amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to include environmental review of energy facilities. The \"Environmental Streamlining of Energy Facilities Act of 2001\" defines key terms related to the authorization process for energy facilities, including applicant, authorization, energy facility, and integrated review process. The \"Environmental Streamlining of Energy Facilities Act of 2001\" defines key terms related to the authorization process for energy facilities, including lead agency and participating agency for environmental review and authorization of construction, operation, or maintenance of energy facilities under Federal law. The purpose of this section is to promote timely completion of Federal environmental reviews for energy facilities, consistent with public safety, efficiency, and socioeconomic values. It includes an integrated review process with a designated lead agency for overall authorization. The Federal agency responsible for issuing an authorization for an energy facility will lead the environmental review process and prepare necessary documents. If multiple agencies have authorization authority, the applicant can request a lead agency to conduct the review for construction, operation, or maintenance of the facility. The lead agency, designated by Federal agencies or the Council on Environmental Quality, will be responsible for the environmental review process for the construction, operation, or maintenance of an energy facility. The lead agency conducts environmental review and prepares necessary documents for energy facility construction, operation, or maintenance. Participating agencies provide input on project impacts and data based on sound science for authorization issuance. The lead agency coordinates environmental review for energy facility projects with participating agencies to streamline the authorization process. The lead agency coordinates environmental review for energy facility projects with participating agencies to streamline the authorization process, ensuring integration of all relevant Federal, State, and local requirements for the facility's environmental impact statement or assessment. The lead agency establishes deadlines for completion of environmental reviews and documents required for energy facility construction, operation, or maintenance under this Act. The integrated review process for an energy facility aims to streamline authorizations required by Federal law, ensure compliance with established deadlines, and minimize duplication of activities among participating agencies. The integrated review process for an energy facility aims to streamline authorizations required by Federal law, ensure compliance with deadlines, and minimize duplication among participating agencies. The lead agency must identify participating agencies within 45 days of receiving the application from the facility owner or operator. The lead agency for an energy facility must notify and request input from participating agencies, and enter into a memorandum of understanding with them regarding the integrated review process for the application. Each participating agency must communicate early with the lead agency about any potential issues, commit to involvement at key decision points, and avoid causing delays in the authorization process. The lead agency and the Governor of each State must conduct early environmental screening for an energy facility application to address any environmental concerns. Additionally, agencies should refrain from raising new issues after the memorandum of understanding is executed. The lead agency must ensure maximum public participation and present comprehensive environmental information during the integrated review process for energy facility authorization. If unresolved environmental concerns persist after a deadline, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality may intervene. The Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, in consultation with the lead agency and participating agency, must resolve any unresolved matters within 30 days. Participating agencies can delegate authorization power to the lead agency. State agencies with jurisdiction over energy facility siting may participate in the integrated review process. Governors can request federal delegation to states. Federal Delegation to States allows a Governor to request delegation of authority to a State agency for preparing environmental impact statements or assessments for energy facilities within the State, with guidance from the lead agency. The responsible Federal official evaluates environmental impact statements or assessments prepared by the State agency before approval. Early notification and solicitation of views from affected State or Federal land management entities are required for actions with significant impacts. If there is disagreement, the State agency must provide a written assessment of the impact. The lead agency evaluates environmental impact statements or assessments prepared by the State agency for incorporation into the environmental impact statement. Financial assistance may be provided to the Governor of a State assuming responsibility for environmental review. No preemption of State laws relating to siting or construction of energy facilities."
