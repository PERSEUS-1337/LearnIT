    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, renew FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire in FY2007. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007. The FDA faced funding uncertainty leading to a hiring freeze and potential layoffs due to the expiration of key user fee programs. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aimed to reauthorize FDA programs and address concerns related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. This report compares S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, focusing on differences in prescription drug user fees, medical device regulation, pediatric incentives, drug safety, clinical trials, conflicts of interest, and other provisions amending FDA's authorities.
