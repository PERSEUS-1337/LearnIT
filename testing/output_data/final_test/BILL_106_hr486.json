The Congress finds that low-power television license holders have provided beneficial broadcasting to their communities despite severe license limitations, hindering their access to capital. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has created uncertainty for low-power television stations regarding the permanency of their licenses and their transition to digital television, impacting their ability to provide quality programming. It is important to promote diversity in television programming, especially for foreign-language communities. SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF LOW-POWER COMMUNITY TELEVISION BROADCASTING. Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to preserve low-power community television broadcasting by creating class A licenses for qualifying low-power television stations. The Commission is required to establish regulations for these licenses within 120 days of the enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 amended Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 to create class A licenses for qualifying low-power television stations. The Commission must establish regulations for these licenses within 120 days. Class A licensees have the same terms and renewal standards as full-power television stations, with primary status as long as they meet qualifying requirements. Licensees receive notice and certification within specific timeframes. Licensees seeking class A designation must submit a certification of eligibility within 60 days of enactment. The Commission will grant certification of eligibility if no material deficiencies are found. A licensee can apply for class A designation within 30 days of final regulations being adopted. The Commission must award a class A television station license to a qualifying low-power television station licensee within 30 days of receiving an acceptable application, except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7). The Commission will preserve the service area of each low-power television licensee while resolving technical problems that may arise after granting certification of eligibility for a class A license. The Commission will modify parameters to ensure replication of full-power digital television service areas. Qualifying low-power television stations must meet broadcasting requirements to be eligible. Qualifying low-power television stations must meet broadcasting requirements, including producing local programming within the market area served. Compliance with the Commission's rules for low-power and full-power television stations is necessary for eligibility for a class A license. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 allows low-power television stations to be treated as qualifying stations for specific reasons determined by the Commission. Common ownership with other media outlets does not disqualify a low-power television station from obtaining a class A license. The Commission is not obligated to issue additional licenses for advanced television services to television translator stations or qualifying low-power television stations. The Commission may not issue additional licenses for advanced television services to low-power television stations or television translator stations. Licensees of these stations can choose to convert to providing advanced television services on their analog channels, but the license will be forfeited after the digital television service transition period determined by the Commission. The Commission may not grant a class A license to a low-power television station operating between 698 and 806 megahertz, but temporary operation in that bandwidth may qualify for a class A license. This subsection does not preempt section 337 of this Act. The Commission may issue a class A license simultaneously with assigning a channel within the core spectrum. However, a class A license cannot be granted to a low-power television station operating on certain off-limits channels within the core spectrum. Within 18 months of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, the Commission must identify eligible channels for class A licenses. The Commission must identify 175 channels by location and technical parameters. A class A license cannot be granted if it causes interference within the Grade B contour of any analog TV station. The Commission must identify 175 channels by location and technical parameters for class A licenses. Interference within the protected contour of low-power television stations is prohibited for class A license applications. The Commission prohibits interference within the protected contour of specified areas for certain frequency bands."
