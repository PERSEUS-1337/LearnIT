    "content": "The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA; P.L. 113-28) replaced the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and supports workforce development by increasing coordination among federal programs. It was enacted in 2014 and includes provisions for job training, education services, and governance systems. Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorizes adult education services to improve basic skills and transition to postsecondary education. Title III integrates the U.S. Employment Service into the One-Stop system. Title IV authorizes vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities. Title V specifies transition provisions from the previous act to WIOA. Workforce development programs offer education and training services to prepare individuals for the labor market. The federal government supports workforce development activities through WIOA, focusing on increasing employment and earnings. Title I of WIOA authorizes job search, education, and training programs, establishing the One-Stop delivery system and performance accountability. Title I of WIOA authorizes job search, education, and training programs through the One-Stop delivery system. Title II and IV programs are not covered in detail in this report, while Title III briefly discusses the role of the Employment Service in the One-Stop system. AEFLA supports adult education and literacy services to help individuals gain necessary skills for employment and postsecondary education. The report discusses the critical role of Employment Service (ES) in the One-Stop system, authorized by separate legislation under Title IV of WIOA. It covers vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities and the programs related to employment and independent living. Additionally, it provides an overview of WIOA Title I programs, the One-Stop delivery system, Workforce Development Boards, state formula grant programs, and national programs authorized under Title I of WIOA. The Manpower Development Training Act (MDTA) in 1962 was one of the first federal training programs postwar. It provided funding for retraining workers displaced by technological change, focusing on classroom and on-the-job training for low-income individuals. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 decentralized federal workforce development programs, transferring decision-making authority to local governments. CETA funded about 470 \"prime sponsors\" to administer job training activities targeting low-income populations, welfare recipients, and disadvantaged individuals. Services included on-the-job training, classroom training, and public service employment. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 supported jobs for low-income populations, welfare recipients, and disadvantaged youth. In 1978, CETA created private industry councils (PIC) to involve the private sector in program development. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 decentralized workforce development, providing training to low-income and dislocated workers through 640 service delivery areas. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 decentralized workforce development, emphasizing targeted job training and reemployment. JTPA required at least 70% of funding for service delivery areas to be used for training, later reduced to 50% in 1992. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) replaced JTPA, establishing the One-Stop system for training and employment activities through Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) brought changes to the design of services for participants, including universal access, a demand-driven system, a work-first approach, and consumer choice through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs). Title I of WIOA supports job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals. Title I programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provide funding for state formula grants, Job Corps, and national programs to support employment and training services for youth, adults, and dislocated workers. The programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Labor through the Employment and Training Administration. Funding for Title I programs totaled $4.8 billion in FY2015, comprising 53% of all WIOA appropriations. This section of the report details the structure, services, allotment formulas, and performance of the WIOA Title I state formula grant program. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) aims to create a demand-driven workforce development system by providing employment and training services responsive to local employers' needs. This is achieved through elements such as Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) with a majority of business representatives, and local plans identifying in-demand industries. WIOA emphasizes coordination and alignment of workforce development services through a Unified State Plan for core programs. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) emphasizes local control and regional planning, with a focus on One-Stop centers for efficient access to employment and training services. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requires certain programs to be partners in One-Stop centers, providing universal access to career services with priority for low-income individuals. WIOA emphasizes sector partnerships and career pathways, offering consumer choice through Individual Training Accounts for eligible participants. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) for participants to choose training and providers. WIOA implements a performance accountability system based on primary indicators negotiated between states and the Secretary of Labor. One-Stop centers play a central role in providing access to employment and training services under WIOA. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requires each state to establish a One-Stop delivery system providing career services, training access, and labor market information. Colocation of the Employment Service with One-Stop centers is mandatory, with at least one physical comprehensive center in each local workforce investment area. Services can be accessed through affiliated sites or electronically linked partners. The WIOA One-Stop system establishes a central point of service for employment, training, and related services. Partner programs must provide access to career services in the One-Stop system, with additional programs allowed to operate in it. Required partner programs are listed in Table 1, and other partner programs may be incorporated, such as those administered by the Social Security Administration and the Small Business Administration. Work programs for able-bodied adults under SNAP are also included. The WIOA One-Stop system serves as a central hub for employment and training services, including partner programs like the Food Stamp program for able-bodied adults. The Employment Service (ES) plays a crucial role in matching job seekers with employers and is a required partner in the One-Stop delivery system. The Employment Service (ES) is crucial for matching job seekers with employers and is a key part of the workforce development system under WIOA. ES administers State Grants and National Activities, providing services like labor exchange, job search assistance, and referral to other workforce resources. WIOA integrates ES into the One-Stop system, requiring colocation of services to deliver career services. The \"career services\" established by WIOA include three tiers of service delivery: Self-Service, Facilitated Self-Help, and Staff-Assisted Services. These services provide job seekers and employers with access to job openings and self-service tools, available both in One-Stop centers and online. The resource room at One-Stop centers provides self-service tools like computers, resume-writing software, and Internet-based tools. Staff-assisted services include one-on-one assistance for job seekers and employers, as well as group services such as job clubs and workshops on resume preparation and job search strategies. Other services offered include screening and referring job seekers. Services provided by Employment Service activities include screening and referring job seekers to job openings. Funding for these services is allotted to states based on factors like civilian labor force and total unemployment. 90% of the funding can be used for labor exchange services such as job search assistance, while the remaining 10% is for other activities. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) oversee WIOA programs, including designating One-Stop operators. Eligible operators must go through a competitive process and can be entities like higher education institutes, nonprofit organizations, or government agencies. Elementary and secondary schools are not eligible, but nontraditional public secondary schools and career and technical education schools can compete for certification. The MOU between the local WDB and One-Stop partners outlines services, costs, referrals, accessibility, and funding for infrastructure. WIOA provides detailed methods for funding One-Stop centers, including local and state approaches. The MOU between local officials, the local WDB, and One-Stop partners determines infrastructure funding shares. If no local agreement, the state method is used, where One-Stop partners contribute administrative funds to the governor for allocation to local areas. WIOA amends governance structures for workforce development programs. WIOA specifies the composition of State and local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs), with a majority of board members being representatives of private businesses. State WDBs are appointed by the governor and local WDBs by local elected officials. WIOA reduced the minimum number of required board members for State WDBs from 61 to 33 and for local WDBs from 51 to 19, mainly by decreasing One-Stop partner program representatives. The composition of State and local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) is specified in WIOA, with a business majority and workforce representation of at least 20%. Local WDB members are appointed by the chief elected local official, with the governor certifying one local WDB every two years. The governor can also appoint members and decertify WDBs for fraud or nonperformance. The state WDB is authorized to decertify local WDBs for fraud, failure to function, or nonperformance. It assists the governor in developing and implementing a Unified State Plan, reviewing statewide policies, coordinating workforce programs, designating local workforce investment areas, and improving technology for One-Stop services. The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) plays a key role in implementing programs under WIOA, including developing workforce investment plans, analyzing labor market conditions, engaging employers, creating career pathways, and utilizing technology to enhance the local workforce system. The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) is responsible for overseeing programs for youth, adult, and dislocated workers, negotiating performance measures with the governor, selecting One-Stop operators and training providers, coordinating workforce development activities with education providers, managing funding to service providers, and ensuring accessibility for disabled individuals at One-Stop centers. State and local WDBs develop plans outlining workforce development goals and strategies, with states required to submit a unified state plan to the Secretary of Labor every four years. The Unified State Plans (USPs) for WIOA must be submitted every four years, outlining workforce strategies for six core programs. Modifications can be made at the end of the first two years, with strategic and operational planning elements included. The Unified State Plans for WIOA must be submitted every four years, outlining workforce strategies for six core programs. Strategic planning elements include vision, goals, industry analysis, labor market analysis, capacity assessment, performance indicators, and program alignment. Operational planning involves implementing the strategic plan and coordinating with other workforce and economic development systems. The state operating systems for WIOA include assessment procedures, priority of service provisions, and compliance with WIOA requirements. States can choose to submit a Combined State Plan (CSP) which covers core programs and One-Stop partner programs. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) must submit a comprehensive four-year plan to the governor, with modifications at the end of the first two years. The local plan outlines how WDBs will support the state strategy specified in the Unified State Plan. Local WDBs will develop strategic planning elements, align workforce development programs, expand access to career pathways and recognized credentials, coordinate activities with economic development, design and implement the One-Stop system, provide Title I authorized training services, and negotiate local performance levels under WIOA. The purpose of workforce systems under WIOA is to increase employment, retention, and earnings of participants, improve workforce quality, reduce welfare dependency, and meet employer skill requirements through state formula grant programs for youth, adults, and dislocated workers. Funding for employment and training activities is provided through One-Stop centers by service providers in local communities. The adult and dislocated worker programs offer employment and training services to individuals aged 18 and older through state formula grants. These programs have different eligibility criteria and allotment formulas. Individuals aged 18 or older are eligible for services funded by the Adult Activities program, while dislocated workers must meet specific criteria such as being terminated or laid off. The definition of a \"dislocated worker\" under WIOA includes being sufficiently attached to the workforce, eligibility for unemployment compensation, and unlikely to return to previous industry. Eligibility is also granted for anticipated facility closings and self-employed workers. The core requirement is displacement due to termination or facility closing, with no requirement related to the cause of dislocation. The classification of \"adult\" or \"dislocated\" does not affect services received under WIOA. Governors can reserve up to 15% of state allotments for Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities. The Governor can reserve up to 15% of state allotments for Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities, known as the \"Governor's Reserve.\" Additionally, funds in the 15% reserve must be used for required and allowable activities. Up to 25% of the state allotment for dislocated worker activities must be reserved for rapid response activities. Overall, a portion of state allotments for Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Worker Activities are reserved for statewide activities, with the remainder allocated to local areas within each state. Statewide employment and training activities are funded by 15% reserve funds from each youth, adult, and dislocated worker state allotments. These activities include disseminating the state list of eligible providers, evaluating workforce investment programs for improvement, providing assistance to local areas for planning and coordination, offering technical assistance to areas not meeting performance measures, and helping establish One-Stop delivery systems. Statewide employment and training activities funded by 15% reserve funds from each youth, adult, and dislocated worker state allotments include operating a fiscal and management accountability system, providing assistance to local areas with high concentrations of eligible youth, and carrying out rapid response activities for dislocated workers. Allowable activities also involve administering state programs, offering incentive grants for performance, conducting research projects, supporting financial literacy, implementing innovative training programs, and providing technical assistance for pay-for-performance strategies. The Governor's Reserve is a fund set aside for permanent closures or mass layoffs, providing services like onsite contact with employers, access to employment and training programs, labor-management agreements, emergency assistance, and aid for the local community. After state-level allocation, remaining funds go to local areas for training and employment activities. The WIOA program requires funds to be used for establishing a One-Stop delivery system, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. Career services are divided into basic and individualized services, with a focus on skills assessment and case management. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides universal access to career services for adults aged 18 and older. Basic services are available to all, while individualized services are offered to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Eligibility for training is based on the need to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, with a focus on skills and qualifications for successful participation in training linked to local occupations. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides career services for adults aged 18 and older, with training eligibility based on the need for employment leading to self-sufficiency. Priority is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies for career services. Consumer choice in training involves eligible providers and Individual Training Accounts (ITA), determined by the local Workforce Development Board (WDB) in consultation with the state governor. The governor and state WDB establish criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce areas, offering choice to WIOA service users. Eligible providers include higher education institutions, apprenticeship programs, and public or private training providers. Provider eligibility includes initial and continued approval. Training providers must apply for initial eligibility to the governor and local WDB. Existing providers need to follow procedures for continued eligibility. WIOA specifies information required for continued eligibility, including performance and cost data. The governor must receive performance and cost information for participants in WIOA training programs, including employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, cost of attendance, and program completion rates. Participants can choose training services with guidance from a case manager. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) have the authority to establish Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) for eligible participants to choose training services from a list of providers. WIOA allows for various training delivery mechanisms, including on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent worker training, and transitional employment, through contracts for services if consumer choice requirements are met. WIOA authorizes formula grants for Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, as well as Youth Workforce Investment Activities. The program allows for Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) established by Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) for training services. The Youth Activities program under WIOA provides assistance to youth in achieving academic and employment outcomes. Eligibility criteria differ for out-of-school and in-school youth, with various factors such as being a school dropout, low-income, involved with the justice system, homeless, pregnant, disabled, or needing additional assistance. The WIOA Youth Activities program prioritizes out-of-school youth, allocating at least 75% of funds for their activities. Local areas design programs to assess needs, develop service strategies, and provide activities for educational and skill attainment. Eligibility criteria include being low-income, basic skills deficient, English language learner, offender, homeless, pregnant, parenting, disabled, or needing assistance for education or employment. The WIOA Youth Activities program focuses on providing activities for youth to attain a secondary school diploma or postsecondary credential, prepare for further education or employment, and connect with employers through a pay-for-performance contract strategy. Local Workforce Development Boards award funds to organizations for job training services for youth, including tutoring, study skills training, dropout prevention, work experiences, and pre-apprenticeship opportunities. The WIOA Youth Activities program offers occupational education, summer employment, pre-apprenticeship programs, leadership development, mentoring, follow-up services, guidance and counseling, financial literacy education, entrepreneurial skills training, labor market information, and postsecondary education preparation for youth. Local Workforce Development Boards must provide all 14 program elements, but individual youth do not need to participate in all of them. The WIOA Youth Activities program requires local areas to allocate at least 20% of funds for in-school and out-of-school youth work experiences with academic and occupational components. Funding for state and local workforce activities is distributed by formula based on population factors. Within-state allocations are also determined by formulas. WIOA allows local WDBs to transfer up to 100% of the local fund allocation between Adult and Dislocated Worker Activities, an increase from the 20% transfer allowed under WIA. Funds for adult employment and training activities are allotted to states based on factors like total unemployment, excess unemployment, and economically disadvantaged adults. The state formula allocation for WIOA Adult Activities includes a reservation for outlying areas of not more than 0.25% of the total Adult Activities appropriation. The state formula allocation for WIOA Adult Activities includes a reservation for outlying areas of not more than 0.25% of the total Adult Activities appropriation. A minimum grant amount equal to 0.25% of the total allotment to all states in a given program year is ensured. States are protected from large swings in funding with \"hold harmless\" and \"stop gain\" provisions. Governors can reserve up to 15% of the Adult Activities state allotment for statewide employment and training activities. The state formula allocation for WIOA Adult Activities includes a reservation for outlying areas of not more than 0.25% of the total appropriation. Governors can reserve up to 15% of the state allotment for statewide activities, with funds used for required and allowable activities. Local areas receive funding based on a three-factor formula, with a hold harmless provision ensuring a minimum allocation percentage. Funding for the Dislocated Worker program in WIOA consists of a National Reserve account and state formula grants. 20% of the funding is allocated to the National Reserve for National Dislocated Worker Grants, while the remaining 80% is allotted to states based on factors like total unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment. The WIOA Dislocated Worker formula grant program includes provisions for minimum and maximum allotments to prevent large swings in funding for states. States may receive between 90% and 130% of their prior year funding share. Unlike Adult and Youth formula grants, there is no small-state minimum for Dislocated Worker grants. Governors must reserve up to 15% of the state allotment for statewide employment and training activities. Not more than 40% of dislocated worker state allotments are reserved at the state level for statewide activities, with the remainder allocated to local areas based on specific criteria. Additionally, governors must reserve up to 15% for statewide employment and training activities, and not more than 25% for rapid response activities. Under WIOA, local areas must receive an allocation of at least 90% of the average allocation percentage for the two previous fiscal years. Funds for youth employment and training activities are allotted to states based on factors such as total unemployed, excess unemployed, and economically disadvantaged youth. The state formula allotment for WIOA Youth Activities includes a 4% reservation for youth migrant and seasonal farmworker workforce activities. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for youth migrant and seasonal farmworker workforce activities, including reservations for Native American workforce activities and outlying areas. It also mentions minimum grant amounts and \"hold harmless\" provisions to ensure consistent funding for states. The governor of each state must reserve up to 15% of the Youth Activities funds after allotment by formula. The governor of each state must reserve up to 15% of the Youth Activities state allotment for statewide youth activities or \"employment and training activities\" for adults and dislocated workers. The remaining funds are reallocated to local areas based on specific allocation formulas that consider factors like youth poverty and unemployment rates. Additionally, there is a \"hold harmless\" provision to ensure consistent funding for local areas. The Job Corps program aims to provide disadvantaged youth aged 16-24 with skills for employment, education, or military service. Participants must face barriers like basic skills deficiency, homelessness, or being a parent. Local areas must receive a minimum allocation of 90% of their average for the past two years. The Job Corps program enrolls 41,000 to 54,000 participants annually for academic, employment, and social services. It is funded by the DOL and operates 126 centers, including 27 Civilian Conservation Corps Centers focused on natural resource conservation. Job Corps centers are located on federal government-owned or leased property and can be operated by various entities. New centers are authorized through a competitive process based on criteria such as workforce system coordination, training opportunities, and performance indicators. High-performing centers have an advantage in competitive selection processes. Job Corps centers provide a variety of services to students, including academic, employment, and social skills training, work-based learning, counseling, and residential support services. Centers rely on outreach and admissions contractors to recruit students. Admissions contractors, including One-Stop centers and community organizations, recruit students for the Job Corps program. Placement agencies help graduates find jobs, and vocational training may be outsourced. WIOA offers competitive grants for employment and training services for special populations. The competitive grant program under WIOA Section 166 provides workforce investment activities to assist Native American participants in entering or retaining unsubsidized employment for self-sufficiency and community development. Funding is distributed every four years through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements with specific organizations. The Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program, also known as the National Farmworker Jobs Program, offers training, housing services, and technical assistance to disadvantaged migrant and seasonal agricultural workers and their dependents. It aims to improve their ability to secure or maintain unsubsidized employment. Funding is distributed every four years through a competitive grant process or contracts with organizations familiar with the challenges faced by this population. Technical assistance is also provided as required by WIOA Section 168. The Secretary provides technical assistance for workforce development programs, including training, coordination, and staff development. Assistance can be funded through grants or contracts. A portion of the Dislocated Worker National Reserve is reserved for states not meeting performance measures. States can share information on successful practices. Section 169 of WIOA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to conduct evaluation and research activities on WIOA programs. This includes providing continuing evaluation through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements using appropriate methodology. The Secretary must also publish a plan every two years outlining research priorities for the Department of Labor, focusing on solving employment and training problems. Studies on career pathways for healthcare providers are required. The Secretary of Labor is required to conduct studies on career pathways for healthcare providers and equivalent pay for men and women. Multistate projects may address specialized employment and training needs, industry-wide skill shortages, and dissemination of best practices. A portion of the Dislocated Worker National Reserve is allocated for demonstration and pilot projects related to dislocated worker employment and training needs. 20% of funding for the Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program is designated for a National Reserve account. The National Reserve account, funded by 20% of the Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program, supports National Dislocated Worker Grants (NDWG) and other services for dislocated workers. It is used for outlying areas, technical assistance, projects, and primarily NDWG activities. These grants are awarded to states and local Workforce Development Boards to assist eligible individuals, including dislocated workers and civilian employees affected by closures. The National Dislocated Worker Grants (NDWG) program provides 24 months of eligibility determination for Department of Defense employees at risk of dislocation. It offers job search assistance, training, and direct employment for up to 12 months related to disasters. The YouthBuild grant program supports disadvantaged youth in developing occupational and educational skills for economic self-sufficiency and community service. The YouthBuild grant program aims to provide opportunities for meaningful work and service to communities, develop employment and leadership skills among youth in low-income areas, expand affordable housing for homeless individuals and low-income families, and improve the energy efficiency of public facilities. Services include education, workforce training, mentoring, and housing rehabilitation. Housing units renovated through YouthBuild projects are designated for homeless individuals or low-income families. The YouthBuild program offers housing and career training for homeless individuals and low-income youth aged 16-24. Eligibility criteria include being from a low-income family, in foster care, a youth offender, disabled, child of an incarcerated parent, migrant youth, or a school dropout. Those who are basic skills deficient despite having a high school diploma or GED may also qualify. Up to 25% of participants may be eligible based on these criteria. Section 116 of WIOA outlines performance accountability for state and local programs. The WIOA performance accountability system, effective from PY2016, includes indicators and levels of performance negotiated between states, localities, and the Departments of Labor and Education. Primary indicators of performance are required measures specified in statute. The WIOA performance accountability system includes primary indicators of performance such as employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, and skill gains. The WIOA performance accountability system includes primary indicators of performance related to postsecondary credential or employment, measurable skill gains, and effectiveness in serving employers. States can establish state-adjusted levels of performance for these indicators in their state plans. The negotiation process between governors and Secretaries of Labor and Education determines state-adjusted levels of performance for primary indicators in the WIOA state plan. Factors considered include relative state levels, an objective statistical model, promoting continuous improvement, and assisting states in meeting performance goals. WIOA requires the use of a statistical adjustment model to determine adjusted levels of performance for states based on economic conditions and participant characteristics. States set performance goals relative to other states and revise levels based on actual conditions. Glossary term: Areas of Substantial Unemployment (ASU) is used in state formula grants for Youth and Adult Activities. Areas of Substantial Unemployment (ASU) are designated based on specific criteria, including a minimum average unemployment rate of 6.5% for the most recent 12 months. States submit ASU designations for approval by the Department of Labor annually. Additionally, economically disadvantaged individuals are considered in the allocation of grants for Youth and Adult Activities under Title I of WIOA. The state formula grants for Youth and Adult Activities define \"disadvantaged youth\" and \"disadvantaged adult\" based on income levels. Excess unemployment is a factor in the grants, defined as the number of unemployed individuals exceeding 4.5 percent. Excess unemployment is a factor in state formula grants for Dislocated Worker Activities, defined as the number of unemployed individuals exceeding 4.5 percent of the civilian labor force in the state. For example, in a state with a civilian labor force of 100,000 and an 8.0% unemployment rate, the excess unemployment would be 3,500. Grants for Dislocated Worker Activities are based on long-term unemployment, defined as individuals unemployed for at least 15 weeks. The state formula grants consider the \"relative number\" or \"relative share\" of factors like regular unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment. Nevada's PY2015 allotments for Dislocated Workers show values for these factors. Nevada's PY2015 allotments for Dislocated Workers were calculated based on factors like regular unemployment, excess unemployment, and long-term unemployment. Nevada's total share was 1.31%, resulting in funding of $13,272,377 from the total Dislocated Worker state funding of $1,012,728,000. Table B-4 displays the authorized appropriations for programs under WIOA from FY2015 to FY2020. Unlike the Workforce Investment Act, WIOA specifies funding levels for each year. Actual appropriations may vary from the authorized levels."
