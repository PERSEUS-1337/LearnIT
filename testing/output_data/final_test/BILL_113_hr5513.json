    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Electric Charging Advancement Reform Act\" or the \"E-Car Act.\" It extends and modifies the credit for electric car recharging property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Electric Charging Advancement Reform Act\" allows a 50% tax credit for qualified electric vehicle recharging property placed in service during the taxable year. The credit is limited to $100,000 or $10,000 multiplied by the number of devices, with a maximum of $2,000 in other cases. Qualified electric vehicle recharging property, as defined in this section, must meet specific criteria including being depreciable, installed on the taxpayer's principal residence, having the original use begin with the taxpayer, and being used for recharging electric vehicles. The text discusses how business credit related to depreciation is treated as a general business credit, while personal credit is subject to limitations based on the amount of tax. In the case of a taxable year not covered by section 26(a)(2), the credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, over the credits allowable under subpart A and section 27. Special rules apply, including basis reduction for property cost taken into account under subsection (a). The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus credits allowable under subpart A and section 27. Special rules apply, such as basis reduction for property cost considered under subsection (a). Property used by tax-exempt entities must disclose any allowable credit to the user. No credit is allowed for property used outside the United States. The credit allowed under subsection (a) is limited by regular tax liability plus tax imposed by section 55. Special rules apply, such as basis reduction for property cost considered under subsection (a). No credit is allowed for property used outside the United States. The term 'device' in subsection (b)(1) refers to an individual item of property that functions to recharge one vehicle at a time. Joint ownership of qualified electric vehicle recharging property is also addressed. The section discusses the treatment of qualified electric vehicle recharging property, even if it serves multiple dwelling units. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary to implement these provisions, and the section will not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2017. The amendment made by this section applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2013, with an exception for hydrogen refueling property placed in service after December 31, 2014."
