    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Doctors' Bill of Rights Act of 1999\". Congress acknowledges the importance of working with physicians to combat fraud in the Medicare program and appreciates the role they play in providing high-quality healthcare to senior citizens. The majority of physicians are law-abiding citizens who offer essential services to patients daily. The complexity of Medicare regulations poses challenges for healthcare providers. Many physicians are leaving the Medicare program due to regulations and the risk of government investigations. The Health Care Financing Administration should focus on educating physicians to reduce billing errors and alleviate the burden of Medicare regulations on patient care. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as physician, fiscal intermediary, carrier, Secretary, and HCFA. The Act defines key terms such as physician, fiscal intermediary, carrier, Secretary, and HCFA. HCFA refers to the Health Care Financing Administration, the Medicare program is under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and the Medicare integrity program is under section 1893 of the Social Security Act. SEC. 3. EDUCATION. SEC. 3. EDUCATION. Each carrier, fiscal intermediary, and the Medicare integrity program must allocate a minimum of 3% of funds towards physician education to disseminate information about the Medicare program effectively. Additionally, the Secretary must ensure that 10% of funds from the Medicare integrity program are used for physician education annually starting from 2000. Physicians must receive timely and accurate information about changes to Medicare laws and regulations. Attendance lists for education purposes cannot be used as evidence of wrongdoing or lead to fraud investigations. Physicians have the right to receive information about local carrier guidelines through various means such as electronic or certified mail, check stuffers, bulletins, letters, and seminars. The Secretary will conduct additional educational outreach for physicians in Medicare coverage areas with frequent billing errors, including issue-specific emails, faxes, mailings, and phone calls. If errors persist after 9 months, carriers will visit physician offices in person. Physicians have the right to request a telephone conversation or in-person visit with carriers regarding billing practices under Medicare. SEC. 4. INFORMATION. Carriers must provide clear answers to physicians' billing questions under Medicare. Physicians can request assistance in addressing questionable codes and procedures in writing, and carriers must respond within 30 business days with the correct billing information. Written statements can be used as proof in future audits or overpayments under Medicare. Restoration of Toll-Free Hotline: HCFA will restore a toll-free hotline for physicians to inquire about the Medicare program. Physicians have the right to submit up to 15 claims for review by the carrier without penalty. Physicians can submit claims for review without penalty. If overpaid, they can repay without penalty; if underpaid, carrier will adjust payment. Submission for review will not lead to fraud targeting unless history of fraud or abuse. Policy development regarding evaluation and management guidelines is outlined in Section 4. HCFA must follow specific steps before implementing new evaluation and management guidelines for the Medicare program, including physician assessment, goal establishment, pilot projects in different regions, and meeting specified objectives. Each pilot project must be of sufficient length for consultation. The pilot projects under this subsection must be conducted in consultation with medical societies and focus on peer review methods by physicians evaluating medical records for statistical outlier services relative to CPT guidelines. The pilot projects will examine the impact of E&M guidelines on different physician practices and costs of compliance, patient, and physician satisfaction. HCFA will submit a report on the objectives met to relevant committees and councils. The objectives for E&M guidelines include enhancing documentation accuracy, reducing administrative burdens, decreasing non-clinical documentation, improving reviewer accuracy, educating physicians, promoting appropriate code use, and ensuring adherence to coding rules. SEC. 5. OVERPAYMENTS. If a carrier conducts a post-payment audit of a physician under Medicare, they must provide the physician with personalized notice of billing issues within 3 months. Physicians can repay Medicare overpayments within 3 months without penalty or interest. If a physician identifies an overpayment before being notified by the carrier, they can reimburse without penalty and the Secretary cannot audit or target them based on that. If a physician's Medicare billing error is a first-time error and they have not been previously audited, the carrier cannot fine them through extrapolation unless a fraudulent claim is submitted. The carrier must inform the physician of potential claim problems within one year before using extrapolation for reimbursement or penalties. Physicians can dispute charges by submitting additional information. Following a post-payment audit, a carrier conducting a pre-payment screen on a physician service under Medicare cannot delay reimbursements for more than one month. Once the physician submits a corrected claim, the carrier must remove the pre-payment screen. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. Inspectors from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services cannot enter a physician's office with a gun or deadly weapon for arrest, and must have a valid warrant unless the physician is fleeing or dangerous."
