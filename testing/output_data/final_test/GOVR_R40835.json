The Department of Defense faces new challenges in Afghanistan and Iraq, relying heavily on private security firms. Private security contractors are considered vital for U.S. efforts in the region, with various entities employing them in these countries. The use of private security contractors has increased in Afghanistan and Iraq, with many nations and organizations, including the United Nations, relying on them for security and other functions in stabilization and reconstruction efforts. This has led to the growth of the private security industry globally, with debates on the definition of private security contractors and their roles. Private security contractors (PSCs) provide armed and unarmed services, including static security, convoy security, security escorts, and personal security details for high-ranking individuals. Their services go beyond just armed security, such as coordinating movements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Private security contractors (PSCs) offer unarmed services like operational coordination, intelligence analysis, hostage negotiations, and security training. The number of contractors varies based on how the term is defined. For example, in December 2009, there were 11,095 PSC employees in Iraq, with 1,664 (15%) providing unarmed services. Data on armed versus unarmed personnel was no longer provided by the Department of Defense in June 2010. In June 2010, the Department of Defense stopped differentiating between armed and unarmed personnel in their data on private security contractors (PSCs). Historically, over 90% of PSC personnel working for DOD were armed. Security contractors from around the world work in Afghanistan and Iraq, with citizens from approximately 30 countries involved in Iraq alone. PSC employees are categorized into U.S. nationals, third-country nationals, and local nationals based on nationality, with U.S. and coalition nationals typically having military or law enforcement backgrounds. Third-country nationals are often more cost-effective, despite some having extensive military experience. Local nationals are the least expensive to hire as security contractors, providing benefits like job opportunities and better understanding of the region. In Iraq, there were 100 registered PSCs with over 30,000 armed employees, including Iraqi and foreign companies. However, local nationals can be difficult to screen and vulnerable to infiltration by hostile forces. The number of Iraqi PSCs has increased in the past two years, with a shift in primary clients from the U.S. government to private industry and NGOs. In Afghanistan, there are 52 licensed PSCs with legal restrictions on employee numbers. Regulations for PSCs are mainly enforced in Kabul, with limited government reach outside the capital. In Afghanistan, there are around 70,000 security contractor personnel, with limited government enforcement outside Kabul. The Karzai government has taken steps to reduce the number of private security companies (PSCs), disbanding some and allowing licenses to expire. An agreement with the international community allows PSCs to operate for one more year while the Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF) is being strengthened. The Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF) is being developed to enhance security capabilities, with Congress focusing on private security contractors (PSCs) due to high-profile incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq. Concerns include shooting civilians, using excessive force, and lack of sensitivity to local customs. Congressional hearings have addressed the management and oversight of PSCs by the Department of Defense. The Senate and House Committees have conducted hearings on private security contractors in Afghanistan, with a focus on their support for the Taliban and subcontracting to warlords. Legislation has been enacted to address these concerns, including regulations in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2009 NDAA included regulations for managing private security personnel in combat operations, tracking employees, authorizing weapons, and reporting incidents. The FY2011 NDAA further revised and expanded these regulations to cover other military operations. Private security contractors can provide operational benefits to the U.S. government by being hired and deployed quickly, allowing for easier adaptation to changing environments. They also serve as a force multiplier for the military, freeing up uniformed personnel for combat missions. Private security contractors can provide operational benefits to the U.S. government by being hired and deployed quickly, serving as a force multiplier for the military, and offering unique skills that government workforce may lack. They can save money by being hired only when needed and can be crucial for executing missions in Afghanistan and Iraq according to government officials. The DOD started collecting data on private security contractors in 2007, but there are concerns about the accuracy of the data. GAO reported in 2010 that DOD's contractor reports are not precise. By March 2011, there were over 28,000 private security contractor personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq, making up 18% of DOD's total contractor workforce. As of March 2011, there were 18,971 private security contractor personnel in Afghanistan, the highest number used by DOD in any conflict. Local nationals comprised 95% of security personnel. The number of security contractors in Afghanistan increased by over 400% from December 2008 to March 2011. The number of security contractors in Afghanistan increased by over 400% from December 2008 to March 2011, reaching 18,971 personnel. This increase was attributed to the operational tempo and efforts to stabilize forward operating bases. Security contractors made up 21% of all DOD contractors and were equal to 19% of the total U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. Additionally, 319 private security contractor personnel were killed in action from June 2009 to November 2010, compared to 626 U.S. troops. Adjusting for the difference in personnel numbers, PSC employees in Afghanistan are 2.75 times more likely to be killed in action than troops. More fatalities occurred among mobile security providers, despite being a smaller percentage of the workforce. Local nationals made up 90% of security contractors in Afghanistan, compared to just 6% in Iraq. The number of security contractors in Afghanistan increased by 152% from 2007 to 2009. The number of security contractors in Iraq decreased by 40% from June 2009 to March 2011, with DOD officials expecting further reductions as troops withdraw. The Department of State will hire more PSC personnel, with an estimated increase to 5,500 contractors, focusing on personal and perimeter security. Despite State's reliance on PSCs, the overall number of PSC personnel in Iraq for the United States is not increasing. The number of PSC personnel working for DOD in Iraq has decreased by 40% from June 2009 to March 2011, despite an overall decline in contractor and troop levels. PSC personnel represent approximately 14% of all DOD contractors in Iraq. From September 2009 to November 2010, four private security contractor personnel working for DOD were killed in action in Iraq, compared to 26 U.S. troops. A PSC employee in Iraq was 1.2 times more likely to be killed than uniformed personnel. Contracting local nationals is crucial for DOD's counterinsurgency strategy, aiming to strengthen the Iraqi economy and address root causes of insurgency. The memorandum highlighted the need to increase the percentage of local national contractors. As of March 2011, there were 563 local national PSC personnel compared to over 7,700 third-country nationals. In Afghanistan, 95% of security contractor personnel are local nationals, emphasizing the importance of establishing security and winning local support. Abuses by security forces can escalate insurgencies, making it crucial to address contractor misconduct. Abuses by contractors, including those working for DOD and U.S. civilian agencies, can strengthen anti-American insurgents. Reports of abuse include shootings of local nationals and prisoner mistreatment at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Incidents involving private security contractors working for the Department of State have been high-profile. Private security contractors working for the Department of State have been involved in high-profile incidents, including the shooting of Iraqi civilians and controversial behavior in Afghanistan. These incidents, mostly committed by U.S. companies and nationals, have raised concerns about the conduct of security contractors in conflict zones. In Afghanistan, there have been reports of contractors killing and injuring innocent civilians, leading to confrontations with U.S. forces. Additionally, Afghan security contractors protecting NATO supply convoys have been accused of firing indiscriminately into villages, causing further tensions. NATO supply convoys in Kandahar have been firing into villages, hindering coalition efforts. U.S. government investigations found that American taxpayer funds may have been paid to Taliban fighters for security in Afghanistan. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs found evidence of U.S. contractors making protection payments to local warlords and possibly even to the Taliban. The Senate Armed Services Committee also reported U.S.-funded prime contractors supporting the Taliban and subcontracting to warlords, which has undermined the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and Iraq. Private security contractors in Iraq are known as Americans and their actions can turn communities against the U.S. mission. Analysts argue that private security contractors pose a direct threat to legitimacy. Some analysts argue that private security contractors (PSCs) can undermine the legitimacy of local governments by operating without accountability. The recent dismissal of a case against former Blackwater employees is cited as an example of how PSC actions can erode government legitimacy. Major General Nick Carter discussed how the \"culture of impunity\" surrounding PSCs in Afghanistan has harmed coalition efforts. The \"culture of impunity\" surrounding private security contractors (PSCs) in Afghanistan is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. This culture can lead to anti-American sentiment and strengthen insurgents, even without actual abuses taking place. Reports of PSCs running amok and armed Americans harassing residents in Pakistan have fueled an anti-American campaign. Additionally, ties between the Department of Defense (DOD) and groups that kill civilians or government officials can undermine U.S. efforts, as seen in the case of the provincial police chief of Kandahar, Afghanistan, who was killed by a group working as a private security contractor for DOD in June 2009. Private security contractors in certain countries can undermine fragile governments, potentially leaving behind well-organized paramilitary organizations motivated by profit and difficult to control by the government. Analysts and officials have called for limiting the use of private security contractors in combat and stability operations to prevent destabilizing influences in the future of Iraq. Some analysts argue for restricting private security contractors (PSCs) in combat and stability operations to prevent potential abuses. Suggestions include limiting PSCs to support functions in areas with rule of law and only allowing static security in combat zones, with convoy and personal security handled by the military. This targeted approach aims to address concerns about PSCs committing abuses or atrocities compared to the military. Some analysts believe that contractors are more likely to commit abuses than military personnel due to the military's mission-focused culture. Lax contractor oversight has contributed to these abuses, according to DOD officials. Improved oversight and accountability could align the behavior of private security contractors with that of uniformed personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq. DOD has improved management and oversight of contractors in Afghanistan and Iraq, including implementing training, increasing acquisition workforce, and updating doctrine. Specific steps have been taken to enhance oversight of Private Security Contractors (PSCs), such as issuing an Instruction in July 2009. DOD has improved management and oversight of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in Iraq through the establishment of policies, procedures, and oversight mechanisms. This includes the creation of Contractor Operations Cells and the Armed Contractor Oversight Division to coordinate and monitor PSC activities. The management of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in Iraq has seen significant improvements, recognized by various oversight bodies. Despite progress, analysts point out remaining gaps in DOD's management of PSCs, especially in Afghanistan. International efforts to develop a code of conduct for PSCs have been actively supported by DOD, with 58 companies signing the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers to promote responsible practices. The U.S. government actively participates in developing a governance mechanism for the code of conduct signed by 94 companies. 66% of PSCs working for DOD in Iraq and Afghanistan have signed the international code of conduct. Analysts warn of risks posed by armed private security contractors in combat operations. Efforts to define the role of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in supporting military operations aim to minimize risks of undermining U.S. efforts. Proponents argue that oversight in combat zones may deteriorate, restricting the use of deadly force to the military. Opponents claim that limiting armed security contractors hinders military flexibility due to insufficient forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Restricting armed security contractors limits military flexibility by preventing them from being used in convoy and personal security roles outside secure locations. This approach aims to reduce incidents involving armed contractors shooting at civilians. Opponents argue that restricting armed security contractors limits military flexibility in convoy and personal security roles, impacting missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Allowing local national contractors to participate could minimize this impact. Proponents believe reserving an exception for local nationals provides flexibility without significant risk, aligning with DOD's counterinsurgency strategy. Local nationals understand the language and local jurisdiction, reducing incidents between PSCs and civilians. Opponents argue that restricting armed security contractors limits military flexibility in convoy and personal security roles, impacting missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. To address this, Congress could empower a Combatant Commander to waive this restriction in initial phases of an operation. Using primarily uniformed personnel on convoy security movements is also suggested. Using primarily uniformed personnel (51% or more) on convoy security movements could give DOD actual command and control of security operations and contractor behavior, aligning with OMB policy on inherently governmental functions. This approach allows for benefits of armed security contractors while maintaining control over critical functions. Opponents argue that restricting contractors limits DOD's forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, hindering flexibility to mobilize tailored security forces for specific situations in a fluid environment."
