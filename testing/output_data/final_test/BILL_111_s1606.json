    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act of 2009\". Congress finds that many people in the United States are injured by defective products from foreign entities, causing harm to both consumers and businesses. Victims often struggle to recover damages due to difficulties in bringing foreign manufacturers into US courts and enforcing judgments against them. Foreign manufacturers and producers pose obstacles to holding them liable for injuries in the United States, undermining US tort laws. This difficulty gives them a competitive advantage over US manufacturers who must invest resources to comply with safety standards. If foreign entities know they won't be held accountable, they can avoid expenses to ensure product safety. Businesses in the United States face challenges in holding foreign manufacturers accountable for product safety violations and tort liability. Serving process on these manufacturers in US courts is a major obstacle for injured parties seeking compensation for economic or personal injuries caused by foreign entities. Foreign companies located in countries that are signatories to the Hague Convention must rely on their government for process serving in the US. Injured parties in the US facing companies from non-signatory countries must use the cumbersome letters rogatory system for service, which may not be enforceable. The procedures in paragraphs (11) and (12) increase time and costs in US litigation, deterring valid lawsuits by injured individuals against foreign manufacturers. Foreign companies often claim lack of personal jurisdiction to avoid US court cases. Personal jurisdiction in US courts is governed by the due process clauses of the Constitution. Consent to jurisdiction satisfies due process requirements. US markets offer numerous opportunities. When foreign manufacturers choose to import products into the United States, they subject themselves to the laws and personal jurisdiction of US State and Federal courts. This violates the principles of US trade agreements and creates a competitive advantage that goes against the rules. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the need for foreign manufacturers and producers of products sold in the United States to register an agent in the country for liability purposes. This is to prevent them from avoiding accountability by claiming lack of jurisdiction in US courts. Importers of products into the United States must adhere to US legal jurisdiction and safety standards. Foreign manufacturers are accountable for contracts with US companies and must act responsibly. Foreign manufacturers importing products into the United States must recognize and adhere to US legal jurisdiction. They should act responsibly and be subject to US laws and courts to ensure fair competition with domestic companies. Foreign manufacturers importing products into the United States must adhere to US legal jurisdiction by registering an agent for service of process, thereby consenting to the jurisdiction of the State where the agent is located. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"applicable agency\" refers to specific agencies for different types of products, \"commerce\" is defined as trade or transportation, and \"covered product\" includes various items. The term \"covered product\" includes drugs, devices, cosmetics, biological products, consumer products, chemical substances, new chemical substances, and pesticides. The term \"distribute in commerce\" under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136) includes selling, introducing for sale, or holding for distribution after introduction into commerce. SEC. 5. Registration of agents of foreign manufacturers authorized to accept service of process in the United States. Foreign manufacturers of covered products distributed in the US must establish a registered agent in the country to accept service of process for civil and regulatory actions in State and Federal courts. Foreign manufacturers of covered products distributed in the US must have an agent registered in a State with a connection to the products. The agent registry is maintained by the Secretary of Commerce in collaboration with relevant agencies. The Secretary of Commerce maintains a registry of agents for foreign manufacturers of covered products. By registering an agent, manufacturers consent to the jurisdiction of State or Federal courts. Regulations must be prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce and relevant agencies to implement this section. Beginning 180 days after regulations are prescribed, importing covered products without a registered agent in the US is prohibited. The Secretary of Homeland Security will enforce this prohibition through regulations. SEC. 7 of the Act requires a study on the feasibility of foreign food producers having a registered agent in the US for legal purposes. SEC. 8 clarifies the relationship with other laws. SEC. 8 clarifies that this Act does not override State laws on service of process or personal jurisdiction unless there is inconsistency."
