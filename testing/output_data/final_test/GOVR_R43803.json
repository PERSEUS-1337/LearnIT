    "content": "The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) was reauthorized on September 30, 2015, with the enactment of the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54). Several key provisions of the law were extended until September 30, 2020, including authority for appropriations, authority to charge fees, an administrative/supervisory cost cap, and authority for an advisory committee. The reauthorization also addressed disruptions in inspection and weighing services. The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) was reauthorized on September 30, 2015, with provisions addressing disruptions in inspection and weighing services, geographic service boundaries, and inspection and weighing authorities. The House and Senate reauthorization bills were approved by voice vote, with the Senate amending the House-passed Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015 to include reauthorization provisions for USGSA, Mandatory Price Reporting, and the National Forest Foundation. The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) authorizes the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) to establish official marketing standards for certain grains and oilseeds. These standards define each grain, classes, and grades based on physical characteristics to facilitate grain marketing. The USGSA requires official inspection of exported grains and oilseeds for quality control, conducted by federal or state agencies. Domestic grain inspections are optional and can be done by state agencies or private companies. All official inspections are funded by user fees as per the USGSA. The USGSA requires official inspection of exported grains and oilseeds for quality control, funded by user fees. FGIS activities are financed with congressionally appropriated funds. Prohibitions under the USGSA include altering certificates and adding foreign material to grain. Policy officials support nationally uniform grades and mandatory official inspections for exported grain. Table A-1 in the report contains links to the USGSA's statutory provisions, regulations, and official service providers. FGIS oversees the inspection of over half of the grain produced in the US, with an average annual amount of 273 million metric tons inspected during FY2011-FY2013. 62% of the inspected grain is for domestic shipment, while the rest is for export. Domestic shipments receive voluntary official grain inspection from state and private agencies under the USGSA. The USGSA oversees about 50 official agencies throughout the country, ensuring they cover specific geographic areas and meet federal standards. User fees for services must be approved by FGIS and deemed \"reasonable.\" Additional fees are charged for supervision of inspection and weighing services. FGIS oversees official inspection and weighing services for exported grain, with two-thirds directly inspected by FGIS. Exporters must use FGIS field offices or delegated state agencies at export ports. FGIS provides mandatory export inspection and weighing services at 45 export elevators, with additional oversight by delegated state agencies at 13 export elevators. Fees are specified in 7 C.F.R. Section 800.71. In 2013, USDA increased fees for inspection services to ensure full funding. Fee revenue did not keep pace with costs in FY2012 and FY2013 due to drought-reduced crops, resulting in a negative balance. However, with higher fees and increased grain volumes in FY2014, fee revenues substantially increased, leading to a positive fund balance. FGIS operates the National Grain Center in Kansas City, MO, and has multiple field offices and sub-offices. The U.S. grain inspection network consists of approximately 2,000 staff members at federal, state, and private laboratories. Prior to the enactment of current grain standards law, local grain markets operated with their own grades and grading methods, leading to chaotic marketing conditions and disputes between producers, traders, and buyers. The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) was enacted in 1916 to address charges of poor quality and unfair practices in the grain industry. It established standards for corn initially, required official inspection for certain grain shipments, and mandated licensing for inspectors. The act has been amended 18 times, including additions for soybeans and measures to prevent false certificates. In 1968, Congress eliminated the requirement for interstate shipments to be inspected if sold by grade, reducing inefficiencies and costs. The lead time to initiate changes in standards was extended to one year, and penalties for violations of the act were increased. In the mid-1970s, the federal role was elevated due to reports of misgrading, \"short\" weighing, bribery, and other irregularities in grain inspection and weighing, leading to indictments and convictions. In response to incidents threatening the credibility of the U.S. grain marketing system, amendments to USGSA were enacted in 1976. These amendments established official weighing services, required recordkeeping by elevators, registration of grain exporters, and user fees to cover federal supervision costs. The 1976 amendment also established the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) and required federal or state agency inspections for export, aiming to address conflicts of interest and improve oversight. Legislation in the late 1970s and early 1980s focused on funding and advisory issues, including a repeal and reinstatement of user fees. Legislation in the 1980s focused on funding and advisory issues, including the establishment of an industry advisory committee, limits on administrative costs in user fees, and authorization of appropriations through FY1984. Congressional focus then shifted to grain quality, with measures enacted in 1985 and 1986 to address grain export standards, foreign material reintroduction, and incentives for high quality. In the 1990s, legislation continued to emphasize grain quality, with the establishment of a grain quality committee within USDA and provisions for improving cleanliness of grain. Congress also extended authorization for grain inspection services, collection of user fees, and directed USDA to develop a cost containment plan. In 2000, a pilot program was reauthorized to allow multiple official agencies to carry out inspections and weighing services within the same geographic area. The USGSA was reauthorized in 2005 with no changes except for extending certain authorities through FY2015. Congress considered giving USDA authority to contract export inspections to private companies but USDA already had that authority. The USDA evaluated the cost effectiveness of using existing contract authority for contractors to provide official inspection and weighing services at export port locations. It was concluded that this would not result in savings for the industry or enhance the competitiveness of U.S. grain exports. Analysis by the North American Grain Export Association suggested that a competitive model of inspection service delivery could lower overall costs for the industry. The 114th Congress had options to reauthorize provisions of the U.S. Grain Standards Act, including simply extending the expiration date or making program modifications such as fee changes. Congressional action to reauthorize the USGSA began with H.R. 2088, introduced on April 29, 2015, by the bipartisan House Agriculture Committee leadership. The bill was approved without amendment and passed by voice vote in the House on June 9, 2015. A similar process occurred in the Senate, with S. 1417 being approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee but not receiving floor action. The Senate eventually passed an amended version of the bill by unanimous consent on September 21, 2015. On September 21, 2015, the Senate passed an amended version of the House-passed Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015 (H.R. 2051) that included reauthorization provisions for the USGSA, Mandatory Price Reporting, and the National Forest Foundation. The Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54) was enacted on September 30, 2015, permanently authorizing most of the USGSA, including mandatory export inspections and USDA's authority to establish grain standards. The committee recommended a minimum 10-year reauthorization for the USGSA, while others suggested a shorter 5-year authorization due to the dynamic nature of the grain industry. Four provisions were extended until September 30, 2020, in the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015. Appropriations fund GIPSA for developing standards and agency costs, with inspections covered by user fees. The FGIS activities are funded by user fees, not appropriations. FGIS has the authority to charge fees for federal supervision of state agencies' export inspections and weighing. Official inspections and weighing services are done by FGIS or official agencies under FGIS supervision. A 30% cap on administrative and supervisory costs is maintained to encourage cost cutting. The advisory committee meets regularly to advise FGIS on programs and services, with recommendations aimed at improving customer needs. Policy issues considered during reauthorization included fees, agency designation period, approval process for state agencies, geographical boundaries, and response to export service interruption in Washington in 2014. Table 1 provides a comparison of provisions in H.R. 2088 and S. 1417. In July 2014, a labor dispute at the United Grain Corporation terminal in Washington led to the discontinuation of export inspections. The USDA was urged to restore inspection services by using federal or qualified inspectors from other agencies. The Grain Advisory Committee also called for the restoration of grain inspection services. The Grain Advisory Committee resolution in July 2014 urged USDA to immediately restore official grain inspection and weighing services in case of disruptions, either by replacing absent inspectors with FGIS personnel or inspectors from other qualified providers. The USDA has the authority to grant waivers for export inspections in emergencies, as seen when United Grain obtained a waiver during a labor dispute. In August 2014, USDA declined to use federal inspectors at the United Grain Corporation terminal in Vancouver due to safety concerns. The grain companies and union later reached an agreement, and inspections resumed. Despite the resolution, industry and congressional concerns persisted into 2015. FGIS reported having a safety plan in place for the Port of Vancouver in March 2015. FGIS has a plan for entrance and exit at the Port of Vancouver, Washington to improve response time for sending federal inspectors in case of incidents. They are prepared to relocate inspectors quickly and have safety plans for all grain export facilities in the US. Industry and congressional concerns remain despite these steps. The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA), North American Export Grain Association (NAEGA), and American Farm Bureau are advocating for legislative language to reinforce USDA's obligation for timely export inspections. There is a debate over using private inspectors as a \"safety valve\" when state agency inspections are disrupted, with some groups supporting private inspectors for cost-effectiveness, while others prefer FGIS or delegated state agencies for restored services. In the 1970s, private export inspection agencies faced serious problems, leading to a more prominent federal role in official export inspections. H.R. 2088 and S. 1417 addressed service disruptions in export inspections, with the House bill requiring mandatory waivers and the Senate bill giving more discretion to the Secretary. The final reauthorization act (P.L. 114-54) mandates USDA to take immediate action during a disruption but leaves the decision on how to resume services to the Secretary. The USDA is required to report disruptions in inspection and weighing services to Congress within 24 hours, with daily updates until services resume. State agencies must give 72 hours notice before suspending services. USDA must also report to Congress on factors leading to disruptions in federal inspection of grain exports at the Port of Vancouver in 2014, including security needs and policy changes to prevent future disruptions. Each official agency covers a specific geographic area authorized by the USGSA. The USDA authorizes specific geographic areas for inspection and weighing services to ensure economic viability. Customers can request waivers for geographic restrictions under certain circumstances. Legislation addresses allowing agencies to perform services outside their boundaries. The USDA reauthorization act allows official agencies to conduct inspections across geographic boundaries under certain conditions, including timely inspections and probe inspections. The provision for inspections in adjacent geographic areas with customer consent was included. State and private entities can provide official inspection and weighing services on behalf of the federal government, with a three-year designation period that can be renewed. The USDA reauthorization act extended the designation period for official inspection agencies from three to five years. The American Association of Grain Inspection and Weighing Agencies advocated for the longer period to secure better financing and control costs. The National Grain and Feed Association and the North American Export Grain Association pushed for more transparency in the approval process for delegated state agencies. The USDA reauthorization act extended the designation period for official inspection agencies from three to five years. Industry groups advocated for a periodic and public review of state inspection agencies. H.R. 2088 and S. 1417 included provisions for certifying delegated state agencies. The final reauthorization act (P.L. 114-54) requires state agencies to be certified every five years. USDA is to develop a certification process for delegating authority to state agencies within one year of enactment. Private agencies may serve as a backup for state agencies in a contingency plan. The NGFA and NAEGA propose allowing private agencies to conduct official inspections at export elevators to potentially reduce inspection costs. Foreign buyers often require additional testing beyond U.S. grade certificates, leading to duplicate assessments by private agencies. Consolidating official inspections and testing under a single entity could result in cost savings, although some opponents are concerned about reducing the federal role in direct inspection. Opponents are cautious about reducing federal supervision in direct inspection and prefer to maintain the current system. The final reauthorization act did not include provisions for using private inspectors. The President's FY2016 budget proposed replacing $6 million in appropriated funds with user fees for FGIS standardization activities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have not accepted this proposal, stating that policy changes should be addressed by the authorizing committees. The grain industry benefits from standardization services, leading to a debate on charging fees for these services. The final reauthorization act did not include provisions for user fees. The Grain Inspection Advisory Committee has requested a suspension of fee increases when revenue exceeds the agency's reserve level. The National Grain and Feed Association and the North American Grain Export Association advocate for tonnage fees based on a flexible calculation to prevent excessive buildup in the trust fund. The Advisory Committee recommends publishing financial information for FGIS user fee accounts monthly. The final reauthorization act specifies a method to determine fees for inspection and weighing services at export ports based on a rolling five-year average of exports. The USDA is required to maintain a three- to six-month operating reserve and adjust fees annually. A comparison of provisions in H.R. 2088 and S. 1417 with current law is provided in Table 1. Congress appropriates funds to GIPSA for FGIS activities, and there are considerations for funding if provisions lapse. Renewed authority for appropriations would eliminate uncertainty about funding for FGIS activities not covered by fees. In 2012, unauthorized appropriations occurred during a lapse in the farm bill, resulting in over 100 programs losing authorization before receiving $2.3 billion in appropriations. Fees collected for supervising inspections and weighing support FGIS's oversight activities. The authority to collect user fees for federal supervision of export and weighing services would have expired, potentially ending the use of state agencies and official agencies for these services unless alternative funding was secured. The expiring provisions of USGSA would not necessarily shut down export inspection and weighing services, as FGIS could have performed all services financed by user fees without administrative costs, or alternative funding for federal supervision could have been secured. FGIS could have taken over all export inspections and weighing services, funded by user fees, potentially disrupting the current system and requiring additional staff. Alternatively, a mix of federal and state agencies could have been maintained for these services. The agency could have maintained the current mix of federal inspection and supervision of export inspections and weighing services if alternative funding had been secured. Expiration of provisions could disrupt the grain inspection program, requiring significant adjustments to cope with loss of authority to collect user fees. No estimates are available for potential changes in user fees or appropriations if FGIS performs all services. Additional appropriations might have been unlikely due to budget austerity. The cap on administrative and supervisory costs was set at 30% to encourage cost cutting by FGIS. If the cap expired, total costs for inspections and weighing might have increased, leading to higher user fees. The authority for an advisory committee, which advises FGIS on programs and services, would have expired as well. The advisory committee advises FGIS on programs and services, representing various segments of the grain industry. Elimination of committee authority would sever the formal communication link between the industry and FGIS established by Congress."
