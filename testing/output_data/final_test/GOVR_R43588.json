Year-round schools reorganize the traditional school year by redistributing summer break days throughout the year, operating on a \"balanced calendar.\" Year-round education on a balanced calendar can be implemented in schools using a single track approach, with shortened summer vacations and intersessions for remediation or enrichment. Schools may follow a 45-15, 60-20, or 45-10 calendar structure for instruction and breaks. Multi-track year-round education divides teachers and students into tracks with their own schedules to address capacity issues without building new facilities. Common calendars include 45-15, 60-20, or 90-30 structures, with each track having the same schedule for instruction and vacation periods. Year-round schools with multiple tracks divide students into groups to accommodate more students without expanding facilities. The number of year-round public schools grew significantly from the mid-1980s to 2000, but decreased slightly by the 2006-2007 school year. During the 2011-2012 school year, there were 3,700 public schools operating on a year-round calendar cycle, accounting for 4.1% of all public schools in the country. The South had the highest concentration of year-round schools at 40.5%, followed by the West at 24.3%, and equal proportions in the Northeast and Midwest at 16.2% each. The majority of year-round schools were traditional public schools (3,300) compared to 400 charter schools. During the 2011-2012 school year, 57% of schools on a year-round calendar were elementary, 900 were secondary, and 600 were combined. Most had 200+ students, with 47% having 75% or more eligible for free/reduced lunch. 60% had at least 50% eligible. Schools with year-round calendars averaged 189 instructional days, varying by region, school type, level, and enrollment. During the 2008 school year, 17 states had policies on year-round schools, with 30 states having school districts with year-round schools. Some states had a majority of their school districts operating on a year-round schedule. Definitions of year-round schools varied among states. Year-round schools in different states have varied definitions regarding the number of school days and months in session. Research on the impact of year-round schooling on student achievement is inconclusive and lacks methodological rigor. Research on the impact of year-round schooling on student achievement is inconclusive and lacks methodological rigor. Wu and Stone's study found that year-round schools in California did not affect Academic Performance Index scores. Cooper et al.'s meta-analysis suggested that past studies had poor designs leading to random findings, but there is some evidence that year-round schools may improve academic achievement for economically disadvantaged students. Year-round schools may improve academic achievement for economically disadvantaged students and can result in cost savings, particularly in capital expenditures for schools operating on multi-tracks. Studies have shown significant cost savings in settings like Clark County, NV, with the implementation of multitrack year-round schools. The implementation of multitrack year-round schools can result in significant cost savings, particularly in real estate and operations. Arguments for and against year-round education include preventing summer learning loss, addressing socioeconomic disparities, and providing remediation and enrichment activities throughout the school year. The use of a balanced calendar in year-round education can potentially increase student achievement and prevent staff burnout by providing more breaks. There may be cost savings in operating multitrack year-round schools, and teachers could earn extra money by substituting during breaks. Initial implementation of a year-round school program may be costly due to facility preparation. Opponents of year-round education argue that the positive effects are inconclusive and suggest focusing on effective teaching and parent involvement instead. Operating on a year-round schedule may increase operational costs and lead to staff burnout, especially for principals. Families may struggle with different schedules if year-round schooling is not offered districtwide or if children are placed on different tracks in a multitrack school. Several disadvantages of year-round schooling are highlighted, including challenges with summer jobs for older students, complications with extracurricular activities, economic concerns for organizations like amusement parks, difficulties in offering remediation in multitrack schools, lack of convenience for teachers without regular classrooms, and disrupted communication among staff. Maintenance projects may be harder to conduct, leading to overtime costs for routine maintenance done at night or on weekends. Disrupted communication and training among staff due to staff frequently being out of school."
