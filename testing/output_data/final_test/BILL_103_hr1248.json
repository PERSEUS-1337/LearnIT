    "content": "The Trade Agreements Compliance Act of 1993 may be cited as the \"Trade Agreements Compliance Act of 1993.\" It introduces a new section for requests for review of foreign compliance in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Agreements Compliance Act of 1993 defines key terms like 'interested person' and 'trade agreement' for requesting reviews of foreign compliance under the Trade Act of 1974. An interested person can request a review by the Trade Representative to determine if a foreign country is complying with a trade agreement. The review request can only be made during specific time periods. The Trade Representative must start a review if the request is made. If a request is made in writing with information on a foreign country's failure to comply with a trade agreement, identifying the economic impact and extent of the adverse effect, it will be reviewed by the Trade Representative. Multiple requests regarding the same trade agreement will be consolidated into a single review. Within 90 days after receiving requests regarding a foreign country's noncompliance with a trade agreement, the Trade Representative will assess if the country is in material compliance. Factors considered include adherence to commitments, achievement of agreement objectives, and any actions contributing to noncompliance. The Trade Representative will assess noncompliance with a trade agreement, which may involve structural policies, tariff barriers, or other actions. The review may involve consulting with relevant departments, seeking advice from the US International Trade Commission, and allowing public input. If noncompliance is confirmed, further action will be taken. The Trade Representative will determine actions under section 301 if a foreign country is found to be noncompliant with a trade agreement. The focus will be on minimizing negative impacts on US business relations and economic interests. This section does not require actions that conflict with international obligations. The Trade Representative will take actions under section 301 if a foreign country is noncompliant with a trade agreement, focusing on minimizing negative impacts on US business relations and economic interests without conflicting with international obligations. SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include section 306A(c) in congressional notification and adds a new section 306A for requests for review of foreign compliance."
