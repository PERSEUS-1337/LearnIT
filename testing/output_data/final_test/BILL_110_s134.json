    "content": "The \"Arkansas Valley Conduit Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that Public Law 87-590 authorized the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, including the Arkansas Valley Conduit, which was never built due to funding issues. Separate authorization is needed for its construction to ensure the viability of southeast Colorado. The Arkansas Valley Conduit aims to provide safe, clean, and affordable water to southeast Colorado communities. The Act's purposes include ensuring a water supply for identified beneficiaries and establishing cost-sharing for the conduit's construction. The Arkansas Valley Conduit in Colorado aims to provide safe, clean, and affordable water to southeast communities. The Act establishes cost-sharing for the conduit's construction. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with planning, designing, and constructing the Arkansas Valley Conduit water delivery pipeline from Pueblo Reservoir to Lamar, Colorado. The Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District is designated as the lead non-Federal entity for the project. The lead non-Federal entity for the Arkansas Valley Conduit project is responsible for acting as the official agent, paying the non-Federal share of costs, and handling operations, maintenance, and replacement. The Secretary is required to collaborate with other agencies and entities during planning and construction. The Corps of Engineers, Federal agencies, and non-Federal entities are involved in estimating and apportioning costs for constructing the Arkansas Valley Conduit. The Secretary collaborates with the lead non-Federal entity to prepare the cost estimate and final design, ensuring agreement between both parties. The Federal share of the Arkansas Valley Conduit project costs is 80%, with 100% for any increased costs due to design changes requested by non-Federal entities. The non-Federal share is 20%. The Arkansas Valley Conduit construction requires a 20% non-Federal share, which can be in the form of in-kind contributions. The lead non-Federal entity is responsible for any increased costs due to design changes. The Federal share for costs not related to fundamental design changes is 80%, with the non-Federal share at 20%. Within 180 days of completing the cost estimate, the Secretary can agree to pay 100% of the non-Federal share on behalf of the non-Federal entity. The non-Federal entity must reimburse the Secretary for funds paid, with payment due within 50 years of the Arkansas Valley Conduit's water delivery capability. Upon completion of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, ownership will be transferred to the lead non-Federal entity. Public Law 87-590 and related documents apply to the project, and State water laws or compacts are not affected. Authorization of appropriations is granted for carrying out the Act, with limitations on using funds for the operation or maintenance of the Arkansas Valley Conduit."
