    "content": "Sourcing policy involves determining whether public or private sectors will perform agency functions, creating a blended workforce. This policy has been a subject of debate since the 1950s, shaped by statutory provisions and guidance from presidential administrations. Sourcing policy, a subject of debate since the 1950s, involves determining public or private sector involvement in agency functions. The evolution of sourcing policy has been complex, with two major strains emerging in different eras. The first strain, dating back to the 1950s, emphasizes governmental reliance on the private sector for goods and services. The second strain, seen during President Obama's Administration, has not necessarily replaced the first strain, leading to a somewhat murky picture for outside observers. The sourcing policy emphasizes government reliance on the private sector for goods and services, leading to public-private competitions. Circular A-76 provides guidance for these competitions, with the current revision released in May 2003. Competitive sourcing, introduced during the George W. Bush Administration, is associated with this policy. The history of sourcing policy has focused on public-private competitions, with only commercial functions eligible for competition. The government's reliance on the private sector for goods and services has led to an emphasis on contracting rather than in-house provision. As government needs have grown, contracting for services has increased in both spending and types of services provided. The federal government's response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to a significant growth in service contracting. This included the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, the creation of a new department for homeland security, and the implementation of various new initiatives in intelligence, transportation security, and cybersecurity. Challenges arose in determining who should perform federal government work, with controversies surrounding practices like using private companies for passenger screening and incidents involving private security contractors. The federal government's response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to a significant growth in service contracting. Concerns arose about contractor employees performing inherently governmental work. The Obama Administration introduced multi-sector workforce management to ensure the best mix of federal and contractor employees for agency functions. This approach expands the typology of functions to determine who should perform which tasks. The Obama Administration introduced multi-sector workforce management to ensure agencies perform inherently governmental functions and retain control over their operations. This approach contrasts with the Bush Administration's competitive sourcing initiative, highlighting different facets of sourcing policy. The 112th Congress discusses policy issues related to federal government sourcing policy, distinguishing between commercial and inherently governmental functions. Agencies may choose to subject commercial activities to public-private competitions to determine future work performers. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 governs public-private competitions for federal government sourcing policy. The definition of commercial activity and inherently governmental functions were established in policy documents dating back to 1955 and 1979. The determination of whether an activity is commercial can be based on the Standard Industrial Classification Manual and ordinary business practices. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 governs public-private competitions for federal government sourcing policy. The definition of commercial activity was established in policy documents dating back to 1955 and 1979. Commercial activities are those operated by an executive agency providing products or services obtainable from a private source. The current definition of commercial activity, as outlined in Circular A-76, refers to recurring services that can be outsourced to the private sector. Agencies must submit inventories of their commercial activities to OMB annually, including the number of full-time employees needed for government performance. This definition was not included in sourcing policy documents until 1979. The term \"governmental function\" was introduced in 1979, 24 years after \"commercial\" was defined in Circular A-76. It refers to functions that must be performed in-house due to a special relationship in executing governmental responsibilities. The term \"inherently governmental function\" was introduced in 1992, defining functions that are inherently governmental in nature. The term \"inherently governmental function\" refers to activities that require discretion or value judgments in government decision-making. There are three primary definitions of inherently governmental, but the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) selected the definition from the FAIR Act. The term \"inherently governmental function\" refers to activities that require discretion or value judgments in government decision-making. The definition from the 2011 policy letter includes functions intimately related to the public interest and requiring performance by Federal Government employees. Agencies were required to submit inventories of their civilian inherently governmental positions under the Bush Administration. Circular A-76 (2003) provides the current definition of commercial activities. The federal government has a long history of relying on businesses for goods and services, dating back to the colonies. This reliance is outlined in OMB Circular A-76, first published in 1966, which continues the policy of utilizing the private sector. The current definitions of commercial and inherently governmental activities can be found in Circular A-76 (2003) and P.L. 105-270, respectively. The federal government has a history of relying on businesses for goods and services, as outlined in OMB Circular A-76. The policy allows for government employees or contractors to perform commercial functions, with a preference for contractor performance. This preference is supported by language in Circular A-76 stating that a public-private competition is not required for private sector performance. The federal government relies on businesses for goods and services, with a preference for contractor performance. A public-private competition is required to determine if government personnel or contractors should perform a new requirement. The private enterprise system is emphasized for government reliance on the private sector. The American economy relies on the private enterprise system, with a preference for government procurement from commercial sources. Circular A-76 emphasizes the importance of the private sector as the primary source of national economic strength. The 2003 revision of Circular A-76 acknowledges the longstanding policy of relying on the private sector for commercial services. The deletion of the \"reliance\" statement in the revised Circular is not meant to diminish the private sector's contribution. The revised Circular A-76 does not intend to diminish the private sector's contribution or signal a retreat from a market-based government. The deletion of the \"reliance\" statement aims to avoid a presumption against government competition for work and ensure the best service provider is chosen regardless of sector. The justification for competitive sourcing in the 2003 revision is based on market ideology and financial considerations to maximize value for taxpayers. The revised Circular A-76 aims to avoid a presumption against government competition for work and ensure the best service provider is chosen regardless of sector. H.R. 1474, Freedom from Government Competition Act of 2011, emphasizes that the Federal Government should not compete with its citizens in supplying products and services. The sourcing policy documents acknowledge exceptions to governmental reliance on the private sector for commercial goods and services, citing reasons such as national security, public interest, cost, and program disruption. Federal employees are identified to perform functions like combat support, patient care, and national defense, while the Commercial Activities Panel notes the need for federal employees in warfighting, judicial, enforcement, regulatory, policymaking, and acquisition functions. The sourcing policy acknowledges exceptions to governmental reliance on the private sector for commercial activities. President George W. Bush's Administration designated competitive sourcing as opening government functions to competition for market-based pricing and innovation. The Administration's plans for competitive sourcing included expanding A-76 competitions and directing agencies to conduct public-private competitions for at least 5% of FTEs in FY2002. The government dropped its government-wide competitive sourcing goals in favor of agency-specific targets. The PMA included a scorecard for tracking agency progress on initiatives. In December 2003, OMB outlined criteria for agencies to achieve a \"green\" rating for competitive sourcing, including completing competitions, meeting timeframes, and justifying exemptions. This was part of the PMA initiatives to improve government efficiency. The Bush Administration imposed a requirement for agencies to report their inherently governmental positions along with commercial activities inventories. OMB revised Circular A-76 in 2003 to include inventory processes, competition types, and provisions for negotiated contracting. The Bush Administration revised Circular A-76 in 2003, excluding language permitting government performance in certain cases. Critics suggested the administration did not support public-private competition for contractor work. The Bush Administration revised Circular A-76 in 2003, excluding language permitting government performance in certain cases. For FY2006, directed that Circular A-76 contain procedures for public-private competitions. Section 842(b) allows agencies to evaluate converting work from contractors to Federal employees. The Bush Administration's response to this provision indicated its views on the matter. The OMB official stated that insourcing language in H.R. 3058 was unnecessary, and there were no plans to change the competitive sourcing initiative. Circular A-76 remained unchanged after the enactment of H.R. 3058. In 2001, the Commercial Activities Panel was convened by the Comptroller General, including key government officials and union representatives. The Commercial Activities Panel was tasked with studying the transfer of commercial activities from government personnel to federal contractors. They developed principles for federal sourcing policy, emphasizing support for agency missions, human capital practices, and the performance of certain functions by federal workers. The Commercial Activities Panel developed principles for federal sourcing policy, emphasizing support for agency missions and human capital practices. The policy should create incentives for high-performing organizations, be transparent, avoid arbitrary goals, and involve fair competitions between public and private sources. Competitions should consider quality and cost factors, ensuring accountability in sourcing decisions. The Bush Administration emphasized competitive sourcing for accountability in sourcing decisions. However, the enactment of insourcing provisions in the successor's first year marked a significant shift. Pursuant to Section 736 of P.L. 111-8, civilian agencies must develop insourcing guidelines. This amendment amends Section 739 of P.L. 110-161, requiring agencies to implement their own insourcing procedures. Section 739(b) of P.L. 110-161, as amended, requires agencies to consider using federal employees for functions currently performed by contractors. Agencies must provide special consideration for using agency employees for certain functions, including those previously performed by government employees, closely related to inherently governmental functions, or awarded on a non-competitive basis. The provision in Section 739(b)(3) of P.L. 110-161 requires agencies to consider using federal employees for functions currently performed by contractors. Special consideration should be given to using federal employees for new requirements closely associated with inherently governmental functions or similar to activities previously performed by federal employees. This provision prohibits public-private competitions before assigning, converting, or expanding functions performed by federal employees. The provision in Section 739(b)(3) of P.L. 110-161 requires agencies to consider using federal employees for functions currently performed by contractors. Agencies were required to implement their guidelines and procedures within 120 days after the date of enactment of Section 736 (Division D) of P.L. 111-8. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that, as of July 9, 2009, none of the nine civilian agencies it had visited had finalized their guidelines for insourcing. Agencies cited reasons such as waiting for OMB guidance or lacking capacity to address multiple management initiatives. The Obama Administration initiated efforts to develop policy and guidance for managing a workforce consisting of both federal employees and government contractors. The Obama Administration initiated efforts to develop policy and guidance for managing a workforce consisting of both federal employees and government contractors. OMB advised agencies to identify the proper role of each sector and achieve the best mix of public and private labor resources. Concerns were raised about contractor employees performing inherently governmental work, which is reserved for federal employees. President Obama emphasized the need to focus on the appropriate composition of the government's multi-sector workforce. Government outsourcing for services raises concerns about the blurred line between inherently governmental activities and commercial activities that can be outsourced. The lack of clear definitions has led to contractors potentially performing inherently governmental functions. Agencies and departments must operate under clear guidelines to ensure proper oversight. Government outsourcing for services raises concerns about the blurred line between inherently governmental activities and commercial activities that can be outsourced. Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is appropriate. Concerns have been raised about the ability of agencies to retain control over their operations, including the performance of inherently governmental functions. The Acquisition Advisory Panel highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the proper scope and application of the term \"inherently governmental,\" particularly in service contracting outside the ambit of OMB Circular A-76. It is essential for agencies to have sufficient in-house expertise and experience to perform critical functions and make important decisions as the federal workforce shrinks. The OMB required agencies to develop a framework for managing the multi-sector workforce, conduct a pilot human capital analysis, and comply with insourcing guidelines. OFPP's Policy Letter 11-01 may not align entirely with OMB's guidance. Agencies are expected to make sourcing determinations based on the policy letter, but it is unclear if the differences have been reconciled. OMB's framework includes workforce planning and sourcing. The OMB's framework for managing the multi-sector workforce includes workforce planning, sourcing determination, and management. Agencies review their mission, goals, functions, and workload to determine workforce needs. Functions are categorized as inherently governmental, critical, or essential, with federal employees or contractors performing the work based on cost analysis. The OMB's framework for managing the multi-sector workforce includes workforce planning, sourcing determination, and management. Management involves facilitating collaboration, addressing organizational needs, and engaging senior leadership. Agencies conduct pilot human capital analysis to address reliance on contractors and weaknesses. The OMB's framework for managing the multi-sector workforce includes workforce planning, sourcing determination, and management. Agencies conduct pilot projects to analyze workforce gaps and develop plans for improvement. OMB reported that 24 agencies had launched pilot projects by December 2009. In 2009, 24 agencies launched pilot projects, with one-third involving acquisition or IT functions. Some agencies heavily rely on contractors, leading to concerns about maintaining control and knowledge. Insourcing is seen as a tool to achieve the best mix of federal and contractor employees. The OMB memorandum and Section 739 of P.L. 110-161 represent initial efforts to develop insourcing policy. Agency personnel are advised to review contractors' activities regularly and insource inherently governmental work. Agencies should be prepared to develop in-house capability when internal control is at risk due to contractors and must have resources to oversee them. OMB advises agencies to conduct ongoing management reviews to improve operations, including evaluating functions for insourcing based on cost analysis and performance considerations. Insourcing guidelines should include factors for evaluating performance and risk, with special consideration given to situations where federal employee performance outweighs cost considerations. OMB provides guidelines for agencies to evaluate functions for insourcing based on cost analysis and performance considerations. Agencies should consider if work performed by contractors hinders internal expertise and control, and if public sector performance is more cost-effective and feasible with federal employees. If an agency determines that work should be performed by its employees but faces challenges in recruiting, it should award a temporary contract while continuing recruitment efforts. OMB also addresses scenarios where a contractor is underperforming, giving the agency the option to conduct a new competition or consider insourcing. The agency has two options: conduct another competition or consider insourcing. OFPP's policy letter on inherently governmental and critical functions provides definitions and guidance for these functions. The policy letter on inherently governmental and critical functions outlines agency responsibilities to ensure control over core functions essential to their mission and operations. It defines inherently governmental functions as those requiring Federal employees and critical functions as necessary for agency effectiveness. For more details, refer to CRS Report R42039. The Obama Administration's policy letter addresses the need for agencies to control core functions essential to their mission. It introduces multi-sector workforce management as a new approach to sourcing policy, different from competitive sourcing. This policy shift aims to examine the unintended consequences of relying solely on the private sector for agency work. The Acquisition Advisory Panel's final report highlighted the lack of attention to agencies contracting out critical functions traditionally performed by federal workers. Competitive sourcing and multi-sector workforce management are different but related policies, with the former emphasizing the private sector's importance and the latter safeguarding the government's responsibilities. Multi-sector workforce management emphasizes safeguarding the government's responsibilities and missions, expanding federal employees' roles in commercial functions, enhancing government oversight of contractors, and ensuring only federal employees handle inherently governmental functions. This approach contrasts with the traditional emphasis on outsourcing and requires a shift towards insourcing and a 'total workforce' approach. Developing a clear, coherent, integrated policy that balances reliance on the private sector with safeguarding the government's operations and mission is a challenging task. Competitive sourcing and multi-sector workforce management face the issue of the policy name being conflated with potential outcomes. Competitive sourcing is the policy, while outsourcing is a specific outcome, and multi-sector workforce management is the policy, while insourcing is a possible outcome. The mislabeling of multi-sector workforce management as insourcing can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. Using incorrect terms like outsourcing and insourcing for competitive sourcing and multi-sector workforce management can misrepresent the policy and create negative perceptions. The misuse of terms like insourcing and outsourcing can create negative perceptions of policies. Table 3 compares competitive sourcing and multi-sector workforce management. Concerns have been raised about government reliance on the private sector, with the Obama Administration highlighting the issue of \"overreliance on contractors.\" The Bush Administration's emphasis on competitive sourcing may have contributed to the overreliance on contractors, as highlighted by the Obama Administration. Lack of in-house capacity, loss of institutional knowledge, inadequate management of contractors, and performance of inherently governmental functions are all consequences of excessive reliance on contractors. This phenomenon can lead to a loss of control over mission and operations, accountability, and restrictions on the size of government. The Bush Administration's focus on competitive sourcing led to an overreliance on contractors, as noted by the Obama Administration. Agencies were rewarded for outsourcing functions, but this approach raised concerns about the loss of institutional memory and control over mission-critical functions. The Acquisition Advisory Panel warned about potential pitfalls of using lead system integrator contracts. The risks of relying heavily on contractors include loss of institutional memory, uncertainty in contractor performance and pricing, potential influence on government decisions, interference with agency missions, harm to the public and government, loss of public confidence, and excessive expenditure of public funds. The expansion of sourcing policy is another development in this area. The expansion of sourcing policy includes a more nuanced typology of government functions, adding categories like critical functions and functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. This development aims to recognize the complexities of federal agencies' responsibilities and may lead to further refinement of sourcing policy by adding categories like personnel sustainment or considering institutional characteristics when determining which sector should perform a function. Designating certain positions within an agency as personnel sustainment positions can help meet human resources needs and objectives, ensuring agencies are better equipped to perform their missions. This can aid in recruiting, retaining, and training agency employees, providing opportunities for career and leadership development. While Policy Letter 11-01 does not suggest creating this category, strategic human capital planning aligns with an agency's personnel needs and objectives. Capital planning aligns with agency personnel needs and objectives, requiring dedication to building competencies in federal employees. OFPP identifies continuity of operations and knowledge as reasons for employee performance. The type of sector, whether federal agency or private business, may determine the preference for federal employee or contractor performance. Government agencies differ from the private sector and businesses in various ways. Research centers like the Brookings Institution's Center for Public Service confirm public perceptions of differences between agencies, nonprofits, and profit-making institutions. They explore when federal agency performance may be preferable to contractor performance and vice versa. Factors such as organizational structure, culture, incentives, statutes, relationships, and accountability mechanisms play a role in determining performance outcomes. Factors like organizational structure, culture, incentives, statutes, relationships, and accountability mechanisms influence performance outcomes in federal agencies, nonprofits, and profit-making institutions. Rogene Buchholz's comparison of the market system and public policy process highlights key differences between the government and private sector. Implementing multi-sector workforce management and related policies could strengthen performance. Implementing multi-sector workforce management and related policies, such as insourcing, can strengthen performance in federal agencies. Insourcing is intended as a management tool to address overreliance on contractors, but determining if a contractor's employees are performing inherently governmental functions may not always lead to insourcing. The policy letter on insourcing emphasizes government control over inherently governmental responsibilities, suggesting strengthening contract oversight with government employees. The head of OFPP stated that the letter should not result in a widespread shift away from contractors, as agencies have been following similar principles informally. Proper management and oversight tools can still allow contractors to perform functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The policy letter on insourcing emphasizes government control over critical functions, suggesting strengthening contract oversight with government employees. Overreliance on contractors can be corrected by allocating additional resources to contract management. Rebalancing does not always require insourcing, and practical considerations may mitigate against it. Agencies are advised to prioritize reviewing work performed by small businesses when considering insourcing. The \"rule of two\" should be applied for work remaining in the private sector. Small business goals may reinforce these considerations if agencies are hesitant to take steps. OFPP advises agencies on insourcing critical functions to maintain government control, suggesting termination of contracts or synchronizing insourcing with non-exercise of option periods. However, insourcing may not be recommended if it disrupts agency operations or compromises small business goals. OFPP advises agencies on insourcing critical functions to maintain government control. Insourcing may not be recommended if it disrupts agency operations or compromises small business goals. Mitigating circumstances could delay efforts to insource functions, requiring time to secure funding and establish in-house capacity. Agencies may need to compile data on outcomes for a centralized database to ensure accurate information for policy evaluation. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) advises agencies on insourcing critical functions to maintain government control. Agencies may need to compile data on outcomes for a centralized database to ensure accurate information for policy evaluation. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) may be modified or a new system created to improve data collection.OMB required federal agencies to develop a multi-sector workforce planning pilot to map out current workloads and usage of in-house and contracted labor. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) advises agencies on insourcing critical functions to maintain government control. Agencies are required to develop a multi-sector workforce planning pilot to map out current workloads and usage of in-house and contracted labor. OMB stated that agencies should prepare a summary of their pilots for public sharing, but it is unknown if all agencies complied. Compliance with this requirement allows agencies to gain experience in assessing a portion of their workforce and identifying useful information for future workforce planning. OFPP advises agencies on insourcing critical functions and developing a multi-sector workforce planning pilot. Agencies must compile annual inventories of service contracts, including descriptions of services purchased, role in achieving objectives, total dollar amounts, funding sources, and contract types. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is the federal government's system for agencies to report information about their contract actions, including the total dollar amount invoiced for services, contract type and date of award, contractor name and performance location, number and work location of contractor employees, personal services contract status, and noncompetitive award status. Agencies' service contracts inventories are available on their websites and can provide insight into an agency's multi-sector workforce when combined with information about the type of functions contractors perform. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is a government system for agencies to report contract information, including details like contract actions, solicitation numbers, and contracting officer determinations. Developing a data collection system to properly classify agency functions could be beneficial for planning and compliance efforts. Making this system available to the public may also be advantageous. Developing a data collection system to classify agency functions could aid in compliance efforts. Making the system public could enhance transparency by providing information and training to aid in understanding. Collecting and publicly sharing data may help alleviate concerns about agencies' decisions, dispel misperceptions, and support evidence. However, additional resources may be needed for system development, and data alone may not address all concerns. Both the OMB memorandum and OFPP's Policy Letter provide guidance on using cost analysis to determine whether the public or private sector should perform agency functions. The OMB memorandum and OFPP's Policy Letter provide guidance on using cost analysis to determine the most cost-effective source for agency functions, addressing challenges such as lack of standard processes, resources for data collection, and methodological issues. In Policy Letter 11-01, OFPP advises agencies to consider cost comparisons when deciding whether to use federal employees or contractors for critical functions. The guidance emphasizes the importance of analyzing full costs and making like comparisons to determine the most cost-effective source of support. The GAO and OFPP reports highlight the lack of guidance on conducting cost analysis, leading to confusion and lack of standardization among agencies' policies. OFPP acknowledges the need for additional guidance in this area. The lack of guidance on conducting cost analyses has led to confusion and lack of standardization among agencies' policies. OFPP is reviewing the need for such guidance, which may define the full costs of government and private sector performance and provide explicit criteria for cost inclusions and exclusions. Developing a rigorous methodology for cost analysis could ensure valid and reliable results, although challenges in data availability and identification may arise. The costs of using federal and contractor employees for security services in Iraq is an example of the lack of guidance on conducting cost analyses. The GAO dropped the DOD from its study due to the Defense Department's inability to provide necessary information on personnel numbers, ranks, and training costs. GAO then compared the State Department's base year obligated amounts for task orders and security contracts to total annual costs. The State Department compared costs of using federal employees versus contractors for security services in Iraq. The comparison included salary, benefits, overseas costs, training, recruitment, and background screenings. Some costs related to federal employee performance were difficult to quantify. Administrative costs were omitted as the State Department couldn't provide an estimate. The government's experience with Circular A-76 and the development of the 12% overhead rate for in-house cost estimates is highlighted. The lack of documentation for actual overhead costs has led to uncertainty in expected savings and controversial results in A-76 studies. The overhead rate remains 12%, and the government's experience with Circular A-76 is highlighted. Five cases illustrate difficulties in calculating costs and savings, showing diversity among methodologies. The Bush Administration required agencies to report estimated savings from competitive sourcing efforts. The Government Accountability Office found issues with the Labor Department's savings calculations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the Department for excluding certain costs from its calculations related to competitive sourcing activities. GAO highlighted that these costs, such as staff time spent on competition activities, transition costs, and post-competition review activities, are substantial and should not be overlooked as they contribute to the overall cost of the competition process. Additionally, GAO found that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) failed to include some costs, like workers' compensation and insurance, in its cost comparison between Screening Partnership Program (SPP) and non-SPP airports. The Government Accountability Office criticized the Transportation Security Administration for not including costs like workers' compensation and insurance in its cost comparison between Screening Partnership Program (SPP) and non-SPP airports. The Commission on Wartime Contracting studied federal agency contracting for reconstruction and security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan, noting that the methodology used was not replicable. The Commission on Wartime Contracting studied federal agency contracting for reconstruction and security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on measuring support costs associated with contingency operations for service members, federal civilians, and contractors. The calculation for estimating the cost of one military FTE included various components such as basic pay, housing allowance, subsistence allowance, and other miscellaneous expenses. Adjustments were made for Defense costs based on Directive-Type Memorandum 09-007. The Commission on Wartime Contracting studied federal agency contracting for reconstruction and security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on measuring support costs associated with contingency operations for service members, federal civilians, and contractors. The total cost for federal civilians in a contingency operation included base salary, overtime, post differential pay, danger pay, benefits, overhead, and federal taxes recouped. For contractors, the Commission considered direct-labor cost per FTE and billing-cost per. The Commission on Wartime Contracting studied federal agency contracting for reconstruction and security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on measuring support costs associated with contingency operations for service members, federal civilians, and contractors. The Commission considered two measures: \"direct-labor cost per FTE and billing-cost per FTE.\" Motivated by claims of private sector savings for the federal government, the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) compared compensation rates for federal, private sector, and contractor employees performing comparable services at government sites for 35 occupations. POGO used base salaries and benefits to determine federal employee compensation. POGO compared compensation rates for federal, private sector, and contractor employees for 35 occupations at government sites. Benefits were included in contractor billing rates, but POGO's methodology did not account for all governmental cost factors. To calculate private sector salaries, POGO used BLS data. POGO analyzed compensation rates for federal, private sector, and contractor employees using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Compensation Survey. They added a 33.5% load factor to reflect full fringe benefits and calculated average annual contractor billing rates based on GSA schedule contracts. The billing rates include employee compensation, overhead, administrative expenses, and profits. The Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS developed a cost estimation methodology focusing on government performance costs, including personnel, material and supply, facilities, and capital. They drew upon Circular A-76 and DTM 09-007 for this purpose. CSIS developed a cost estimation methodology for government performance costs, including personnel, material, facilities, and capital. The cost of contractor performance could be calculated using base contract price, income tax adjustments, cost of administration and oversight, and cost of converting work from public to private sector performance. The guidance on multi-sector workforce management emphasizes using cost analysis as a tie-breaker when performance by either sector is acceptable. Cost savings is not the main goal of insourcing, but may result from proper workforce management. The decision between federal employees and contractors should prioritize government interests over cost considerations. The shift to a more appropriate employee-to-contractor ratio may save money for the Department and taxpayers. Policy Letter 11-01 emphasizes the importance of dedicating work to federal employees for building competencies and retaining institutional knowledge. Strategic human capital planning should be considered before conducting a cost analysis. When conducting a cost analysis, agencies should consider additional personnel needs for implementing policy letter provisions, including pre and post-award tasks, small business contracting, developing procedures, training, and managing responsibilities. Additional federal employees may be required for inherently governmental functions, critical functions, contract administration, and oversight. The policy letter addresses personnel issues related to strategic human capital planning, emphasizing the need for agencies to ensure competency building, knowledge retention, and operational continuity using federal employees. Limited budgets and resources may hinder insourcing efforts and workforce management improvements. The policy letter emphasizes the need for agencies to maintain sufficient personnel to manage contractors' performance and evaluate work products. Agencies must consider funding and workforce size when deciding to use federal employees for tasks reserved for them. Agencies' acquisition workforces will need to manage contractors closely associated with agency functions. The federal government has not invested enough in the acquisition workforce to cope with the growth in contract spending and the increased complexity of agencies' missions. Contract spending doubled from 2001 to 2008, reaching over 500 billion dollars, while the acquisition workforce remained relatively flat. This lack of investment hinders agencies' ability to comply fully with the policy letter emphasizing the need for agencies to maintain sufficient personnel to manage contractors' performance. The Department of Homeland Security's Balanced Workforce Strategy aims to manage its multi-sector workforce by ensuring no inherently governmental work is done by contractors, implementing review procedures to reduce reliance on contractors, and coordinating workforce assessments to improve services and reduce contractor reliance. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer oversees this effort through the Balanced Workforce Program Management Office. The Balanced Workforce Strategy (BWS) is a risk analysis and workforce planning process managed by the Program Management Office. It involves identifying work performed by contractors or federal workforce, analyzing it using the BWS Tool with 55 questions, and recommending sourcing decisions such as federal employee performance, contractor performance, or temporary contracting. The Department of Homeland Security is implementing the Balanced Workforce Strategy System, which involves executing existing acquisition and workforce planning processes to establish the appropriate workforce for the function. The system includes a new version of the questionnaire in the BWS Tool, aiming for consistent application of relevant guidance across all department components. The Balanced Workforce Strategy System implemented by the Department of Homeland Security involves using the BWS Tool to determine the mix of federal employees and contractors for service contracts. The tool's validity and reliability are still being evaluated, and if proven effective, other agencies may benefit from adopting it. DHS's guidance on the Balanced Workforce Strategy is outlined in Section 3007.751 of the acquisition manual. The BWS tool is used by DHS to analyze service contracts for acquisition and workforce planning. Starting August 1, 2011, it will also be used to analyze new work to ensure control of DHS's mission. Results from the BWS analysis should be provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract file. The analysis will determine the skills and expertise needed for critical functions and those closely associated with inherently governmental functions. Management controls and oversight activities will be considered to reduce the risk of contractors performing work closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The acquisition plan must address whether a cost analysis is performed for work that may be done by Federal employees or contractors, especially for functions closely associated with inherently governmental and critical functions. Proper oversight of service contracts is essential, following OFPP guidance. For more information on Balanced Workforce Planning, refer to the Balanced Workforce Connect site. The introduction of multi-sector workforce management, Policy Letter 11-01, and insourcing guidelines represent a new chapter in sourcing policy. The government's reliance on the private sector may be challenged as budget constraints and policy issues arise. Congressional and executive involvement in sourcing policy is expected to continue. Selected government documents on sourcing policy are listed in chronological order. The government's sourcing policy is evolving with the introduction of multi-sector workforce management, Policy Letter 11-01, and insourcing guidelines. Budget constraints and policy issues may challenge the government's reliance on the private sector. Congressional and executive involvement in sourcing policy is expected to continue. Various government documents on sourcing policy have been issued over the years. The government's sourcing policy has evolved with the introduction of multi-sector workforce management, Policy Letter 11-01, and insourcing guidelines. Budget constraints and policy issues may challenge the government's reliance on the private sector. Various government documents on sourcing policy have been issued over the years, including revisions of Circular A-76 and the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act. Sean O'Keefe, Deputy Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, issued a memorandum on performance goals and management initiatives for the FY 2002 Budget. This was followed by a circular on the performance of commercial activities and the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of FY2009. President Barack Obama also issued a memorandum on government contracting in 2009. Peter R. Orszag, Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, issued policies regarding the performance of inherently governmental functions by federal government employees. These policies were published in Federal Register documents and are outlined in Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations."
