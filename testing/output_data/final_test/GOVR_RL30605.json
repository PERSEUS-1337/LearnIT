    "content": "Members of Congress have a continued interest in U.S. contributions to the United Nations regular budget, focusing on the overall cost, comparisons with other member states, and payment history. In 2010, the U.S. was the largest contributor, paying $532,435,102, or 22% of assessed contributions. The top contributors to the U.N. regular budget in 2010 were the U.S. (22%), Japan (12.530%), Germany (8.018%), the United Kingdom (6.604%), and France (6.123%). Seventeen countries, including the U.S., were assessed at over 1%, accounting for 83% of the total budget. Ten countries were assessed between 0.5% and 1%, making up 7% of the budget, while the rest of the U.N. membership (167 countries) accounted for 8% of the regular budget. The report details payments and outstanding contributions of top contributors over the past 20 years. The U.N. regular budget from 1990 to 2010 shows outstanding contributions from various countries, including the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine, and USSR/Russian Federation. The tables categorize countries into the United States, Other Major Contributors, Middle Contributors, and Rest of Membership based on their assessment percentages. The U.N. regular budget tables show country assessments, payments, and outstanding contributions as of December 31 each year. China became a major contributor in 2001 when its assessment level exceeded 1%. The five permanent U.N. Security Council members are listed in each table, with China's information provided in a footnote."
