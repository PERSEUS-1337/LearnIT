    "content": "Congress is interested in U.S. innovation and technology's impact on the economy, national security, and public health. The federal government historically supports research and development, but private investments now surpass public ones. Some suggest new approaches to maintain U.S. leadership in innovation, including creating additional agency-related entities. The potential establishment of new agency-related entities in statute raises questions about past organizational models in the federal government and the opportunities and risks of developing a new entity for federal R&D. The varied organizational arrangements in the executive branch reflect diverse viewpoints and policy preferences over the years. During the mid-20th century, hybrid organizational forms known as \"quasi-governmental entities\" emerged, blending public and private characteristics. These entities vary in features, relationship to the federal government, funding, accountability, and use of private sector incentives. Agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations are examples. Congress has established many of these entities, influenced by political and policymaking dynamics specific to the time and issue at hand. Quasi-governmental entities emerged during the mid-20th century, blending public and private characteristics. They provide stable funding, freedom from government management laws, and flexibility in financial management. These entities aim to drive government-driven solutions with entrepreneurial incentives and greater flexibility compared to traditional government agencies. Quasi-governmental entities offer managerial flexibility, increased employee input, and entrepreneurial incentives. Critics question the exemption from government management laws, highlighting the need for accountability and transparency in their operations. Stakeholders may struggle to ensure these entities prioritize public good over private gain without proper legal frameworks in place. Some laws and regulations provide processes for action, criticized as \"red tape\" when applied excessively. Federal agencies are funded through appropriations, with Congress influencing priorities. Agency heads are appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, allowing for accountability and transparency mechanisms. Some quasi-governmental entities lack congressional influence and funding, raising concerns about oversight and accountability. Critics question the use of private sector management techniques in government functions. Public administration scholars suggest that public enterprises can benefit from certain practices. Public administration scholars agree that public enterprises can benefit from private sector management mechanisms, but caution against blindly applying them due to differences like constitutional law. Differences in the \"bottom line\" and measuring performance add complexity. This report focuses on agency-related nonprofit organizations established by statute. Nonprofit organizations established by statute to advance federal agency R&D missions have been created by Congress. These entities aim to facilitate partnerships with industry and academia to overcome barriers. The report examines their performance, praises, criticisms, and potential oversight issues. Congress has established agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations to address federal R&D needs. Nonprofit organizations established by Congress aim to facilitate public-private R&D partnerships, increase technology transfer, attract scientific talent, and enhance public education on federal R&D. These entities receive federal funding and support federal agency missions. The discussed foundations and corporations are federally funded and support public-private R&D partnerships. They are associated with various federal agencies like NIH, CDC, FDA, USDA, USU, and VA. The level of public support and governing board composition varies among these organizations. Additionally, other entities have been created by federal agencies and Congress to address R&D needs. In 1990, Congress directed the establishment of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) to support NIH's mission and collaboration. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) supports NIH's mission through public-private partnerships and alliances with researchers. FNIH raises funds, provides scientific expertise, and administers research programs to address health challenges. One project is the Biomarkers Consortium, aiming to improve drug development through biomarker identification and regulatory approval. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) supports NIH's mission through public-private partnerships and alliances with researchers. FNIH raises funds, provides scientific expertise, and administers research programs to address health challenges. In 2018, FDA approved a new biomarker supported by FNIH to improve kidney injury detection in clinical drug trials. FNIH is governed by a board of directors with specified powers and structure, including appointed members serving 3 to 5-year terms. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) is governed by a board of directors with appointed members serving 3 to 5-year terms. The board is empowered to establish bylaws for the foundation's operations, including policies for donations and grants. They are accountable for the integrity of the foundation's operations and must enforce standards of conduct, financial disclosure statements, and conflict of interest policies. Funding for FNIH comes from private donations and other sources. Since its inception in 1996, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) has raised over $1 billion to support NIH's mission. FNIH receives funding from private donations and a share of NIH appropriations, with annual assistance to NIH ranging from $16.9 million to $22.6 million. Congress authorized NIH to provide facilities and support services to FNIH, transferring between $1 million and $1.25 million annually for administrative expenses. In the President's FY2020 budget, NIH requested $1.1 million for this purpose. In the President's FY2020 budget, NIH requested $1.1 million for this purpose. Additionally, FNIH has received $602,803 in federal grants since FY2008. Congress authorized the establishment of the CDC Foundation in 1992 to support disease prevention and public health. The House committee report highlighted CDC's struggles with budget constraints and personnel limitations. The committee aims to create a mechanism for a private non-profit to support CDC's mission. The CDC Foundation was established in 1992 to support disease prevention and public health. It aims to create a mechanism for a private non-profit foundation to provide innovative activities in public health in association with the CDC. The foundation can seek private support for endowed positions, programs for public health officials, forums for information exchange, and funding for research studies. It helps CDC pursue innovative ideas with the support of external partners. CDC Foundation partnerships support CDC in launching new programs, expanding existing ones, or piloting projects before scaling up. External support allows CDC to collaborate with experts and access necessary resources to address public health challenges. For instance, a partnership in 2018 with UNICEF funded the development of a dissolving measles and rubella microneedle vaccination patch by researchers from CDC, Georgia Tech, and Micron Biomedical. This innovation aims to overcome challenges in vaccine delivery, such as the need for refrigeration and trained medical professionals for administration. The CDC Foundation is governed by a board of directors appointed by Congress, with a five-year term of service. Vacancies in the board are filled through appointment by the board. The CDC Director serves as a liaison between the agency and the CDC Foundation. The CDC Foundation's board of directors, appointed by Congress, includes the CDC Director as an ex officio member to ensure independence from CDC. Congress mandated the establishment of bylaws and policies for ethical standards, donations, and operations, with funding from private donations and CDC. Since 1995, the CDC Foundation has raised over $800 million to support CDC's mission, with $5.6 million transferred to CDC in 2015 and 2016. Noncash donations totaling $38.5 million were provided, including insecticides and contraceptives for Zika virus response. The CDC Foundation receives $1.25 million annually from CDC for operating expenses since 2012, and has received $55.4 million in federal grants since FY2008. Congress also established the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA in 2007. The Reagan-Udall Foundation was established by Congress in 2007 to advance FDA's mission of modernizing product development, accelerating innovation, and enhancing product safety. Its duties include identifying unmet needs, supporting regulatory science research, and improving the development and evaluation of FDA-regulated products through public-private collaborations and leveraging outside resources. In 2017, the foundation launched the IMEDS program. The Reagan-Udall Foundation launched the IMEDS program in 2017, providing access to healthcare data for evaluating medical product safety and effectiveness. The foundation is governed by a board of directors, including the FDA Commissioner and the Director of NIH. Congress directed federal officials to appoint key members to oversee the foundation's operations. The Reagan-Udall Foundation's board of directors, including the FDA Commissioner and the Director of NIH, appoint initial members from various organizations. The board is composed of no more than 17 members, with representation from different industries and organizations. Congress directed the board to establish ethical standards and policies for the foundation. The Reagan-Udall Foundation oversees ethical standards, conflicts of interest, donations, grants, and contracts. It has received $21 million in support since 2009, with annual funding from FDA. Additionally, it has received federal grants and contracts. Congress also established the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research in 2014. The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) was created by Congress in 2014 to support the research mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) by focusing on agricultural issues of national and international significance, including food security and safety. It aims to foster public-private partnerships in the agricultural research community to address pressing needs. The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) was established by Congress in 2014 to address key agricultural issues by collaborating with corporations and donors. FFAR aims to complement USDA research efforts without replacing funding, award grants, and coordinate with USDA to avoid duplication. It currently supports research in six challenge areas, including soil health. The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) supports research in six challenge areas, including soil health, sustainable water management, next generation crops, advanced animal systems, urban food systems, and the health-agriculture nexus. In 2017, FFAR awarded researchers at the University of Illinois $15 million to improve photosynthesis efficiency and crop yields in soybeans and other critical crops for food security in developing countries. This investment was matched by $30 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom Department for International Development. FFAR funds public-private partnerships through competitive grants or direct contracts. The governance structure of FFAR is specified in the statute establishing the foundation and further defined by the foundation's bylaws. FFAR is governed by a board of directors composed of appointed and ex officio members. The day-to-day operations of FFAR are overseen by an executive director, who is appointed by the board. Congress required the ex officio members of the board to select the initial appointed board members from lists of candidates provided by the National Academy of Sciences and by industry. The board of directors of FFAR must consist of 15-21 members, with 5-year terms that can be renewed for up to 10 years. They are responsible for creating bylaws, ethical standards, and conflict of interest policies. Advisory councils are also established for each challenge area. FFAR's advisory council members offer advice on program development, partnerships, and other significant matters. The foundation's activities are funded through a mix of public and private funds, including $200 million from the Agricultural Act of 2014 for agricultural research. Matching funds from non-federal sources are required for federal funds to be used. Dr. Sally Rockey highlighted FFAR's advantages over other research foundations in a Senate testimony. FFAR leverages public funding for diverse partnerships, focusing on results and measurable outcomes. In 2017, FFAR awarded 39 grants totaling $45.8 million, and in 2018, 55 grants totaling $32.2 million. USDA's Agricultural Research Service received three grants. In 2018, USDA's Agricultural Research Service received three grants and $1.7 million in funding from FFAR, totaling $3.6 million with matching funds. Congress directed an additional $185 million to FFAR for public agricultural research, contingent on a strategic plan for self-sustainability. FFAR released the plan in 2019, outlining actions for diversification. The Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (now known as the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine) was created by Congress in 1983 to support medical research and education projects with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Federal funds are a critical component of the foundation's model, and it channels private resources to support advanced scientific teaching and research in military medicine. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine supports international research collaborations and medical education programs with military schools. It provides research support, program administration, staffing, and technology transfer services to military research centers. The foundation is authorized to enter into contracts with the Uniformed Services University for cooperative medical research, consultation, and education projects. In FY2018, over 1,100 employees of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF) participated in collaborative research and education projects at the Uniformed Services University (USU). HJF, USU, and Profectus BioSciences are working together to develop a human vaccine for the Nipah virus, supported by the NIH. HJF is governed by a council of directors, including members from the Senate and House Committees on Armed Services and the Dean of USU. In 2018, Congress increased the number of appointed members on the council of directors of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF) from four to six. HJF's revenue comes from managing grants and contracts for USU and other military research centers. In FY2018, HJF received $483.9 million in grants and contracts and spent $468.7 million on program services. Since FY2008, HJF has received $6.1 billion in federal grants and contracts. Since FY2008, HJF has received $6.1 billion in federal grants, primarily from the Department of Defense, to provide research and management services to VA medical researchers. Congress authorized the establishment of nonprofit corporations at VA medical centers to facilitate approved research and education activities. The establishment of nonprofit corporations at VA medical centers was authorized by Congress to support VA medical researchers conducting projects using non-VA funds from various sources. This allows for the acceptance, administration, retention, and spending of non-VA research funding by NPCs on behalf of VA investigators, reducing overhead costs compared to funds channeled through affiliated medical schools. Non-VA research funding can be used by nonprofit corporations at VA medical centers to support VA investigators. The governance structure of NPCs includes a board of directors appointed by the VA Secretary. Each board must include the director of the VA medical center, the chief of staff, and associate chief(s) of staff. The governance structure of nonprofit corporations at VA medical centers includes a board of directors appointed by the VA Secretary, which must include key personnel from the medical center. The NPCs are overseen by VA's Inspector General and required to conduct audits and provide annual reports to VA. VA also conducts oversight through the Nonprofit Program Oversight Board and the Nonprofit Program Office. The Nonprofit Program Office (NPPO) and the Veteran Health Administration's Chief Financial Officer (VHA CFO) oversee the activities of Nonprofit Corporations (NPCs) at VA medical centers. The NPPO serves as a liaison, provides oversight and guidance, conducts reviews, compiles data for reports, and ensures compliance with VA policies. The VHA CFO provides financial oversight. There are currently 83 NPCs generating revenue, with majority spent on research. Nonprofit Corporations (NPCs) at VA medical centers generate revenue primarily from federal sources like NIH and DOD grants. In 2018, NPCs generated $236 million in revenues. A report suggested that federal R&D agencies could benefit from establishing nonprofit research foundations to seek donations and facilitate technology commercialization. The establishment of agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations has facilitated technology commercialization and revenue generation for R&D. However, exemptions from management laws may hinder transparency and accountability. Congress should consider issues like transparency, independence, and effectiveness before extending this authority to more federal agencies and laboratories. Affiliated nonprofit research foundations and corporations in the field of medicine and public health have varying conflict of interest policies. Recent concerns have been raised about industry influence in public-private R&D partnerships managed by these foundations, potentially eroding public trust. Industry involvement in R&D partnerships can impact public trust in federal agency decision-making. Conflict of interest issues are debated, with some arguing they are rare and overstated. Policy responses to these concerns are seen as burdensome and hindering R&D translation. Examples like the NFL attempting to influence grant selection for a CTE study highlight these concerns. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce investigated allegations that the NFL tried to influence NIH research applicants funded by a $30 million donation. Despite the NFL's attempts, the peer review process integrity was maintained, and funding decisions were based on research merit. The report included recommendations for FNIH on managing R&D partnerships between NIH and the private sector. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce investigated allegations of the NFL trying to influence NIH research funded by a $30 million donation. Recommendations were made for FNIH to establish clearer guidelines for donor communications with NIH and to address concerns about donors acting improperly. The FNIH responded to concerns about donors acting improperly by stating they acted appropriately and transparently in fulfilling their mandate under the SHRP. The FNIH has strengthened protocols around communications to prevent unauthorized contact among parties and ensure the success of future scientific partnerships. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce raised concerns about potential undue influence by the NFL in a grant award, prompting a request for a thorough review by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. This review aims to assess compliance with public-private partnership policies and procedures under the authority of FNIH, with a focus on identifying necessary revisions or reforms. In 2018, NIH, FNIH, and potential donors, including pharmaceutical companies, were discussing a public-private partnership to address the opioid crisis. Concerns about conflicts of interest and ethics were raised. The FNIH Board decided that a partnership relying heavily on pharmaceutical companies' input and financing was not appropriate. The FNIH Board decided that seeking monetary donations from pharmaceutical companies for the research plan to address the opioid crisis poses a high risk of public skepticism and conflicts of interest. They recommended using only Federal funds to support the research efforts in the public-private partnership. The FNIH Board recommended using only Federal funds for the public-private partnership to address the opioid crisis, emphasizing that industry funding should be provided without preconditions. NIH launched the HEAL Initiative in April 2018 to combat the national opioid crisis, with the Director stating that government funds should be used instead of cash contributions from the private sector. NIH and biopharmaceutical companies are working together to address the opioid crisis through public-private partnerships. The ACD guidance will be used to ensure transparency and appropriate oversight in any initiatives pursued. Concerns have been raised about industry influence on CDC and FDA decision-making through donations. Some have questioned donations made by the Coca-Cola Company to the CDC Foundation for research on obesity and diet issues. Congress members requested an investigation into the relationship between CDC and Coca-Cola, citing concerns about industry influence. Recommendations were made to manage conflicts of interest in public-private partnerships facilitated by nonprofit foundations associated with federal agencies. Some concerns have been raised about the financial benefits the CDC Foundation receives from grants managed on behalf of the CDC, highlighting the importance of transparency and conflict-of-interest policies in public-private partnerships. Calls for increased transparency in agency-related nonprofit research foundations have been made to maintain public confidence in decision-making processes. The Advisory Committee to the Director of the CDC recommended that the CDC Foundation provide a complete record to the agency. The CDC Foundation should provide a \"complete record of evidence\" and a \"fully reasoned analysis\" for proposed public-private partnerships. The CDC should only enter into such partnerships if they align with CDC priorities, benefit public health more than risks public trust, and do not primarily benefit the private funder. Calls have been made for harmonizing policies and standards for evaluating public-private partnerships to address conflict of interest concerns. The CDC Foundation and FNIH were directed to disclose all monetary and property gifts in their annual reports to address conflict of interest concerns. Officials claim compliance with disclosure requirements similar to other nonprofits. The CDC Foundation and FNIH, as quasi-governmental entities, are independent from the federal government but are associated with and reliant on federal agencies. The level of independence varies, affecting congressional oversight and influence. The variability in the financial strength of organizations like HJF and VA NPCs is closely tied to their primary function of providing research and grant management services to USU and VA medical researchers. The governance structure includes Members of Congress and federal officials on the boards of these entities. The HJF and VA NPCs have less independence compared to other agency-related nonprofit foundations due to their governance structure involving Members of Congress and federal officials. Questions arise about the necessity of these entities and if they should seek more private funds. In contrast, organizations like FNIH, CDC Foundation, and Reagan-Udall Foundation have more autonomy as they primarily raise funds from the private sector. However, interconnectedness with federal agencies is crucial for the success of these entities. The FNIH, CDC Foundation, and Reagan-Udall Foundation receive support from federal agencies, allowing for influence and oversight. FFAR, like these organizations, aims to advance USDA's research mission but operates independently as a grant-making entity. Congressional oversight is facilitated through the use of federal funds in supporting these entities' operating expenses. FFAR executes its R&D agenda by leveraging federal funds with non-federal sources, aiming to become self-sufficient as per Congressional intent. The strategic plan emphasizes the need for Congressional funding to maintain relevance and impact in addressing food and agriculture challenges. In the event of reduced public funding, FFAR's ability to fund transformative research projects would be limited, hindering its capacity to bring partners to the table and mobilize private funding. The foundation plans to increase non-federal matching requirements, diversify co-funders, develop fundraising programs, pursue service fees, and expand consortia to ensure sustainability. The effectiveness of agency-affiliated nonprofit research foundations or corporations has not been formally assessed. GAO noted in a 2002 report on the VA NPCs that VA headquarters has not evaluated nonprofit corporations to measure their effectiveness. It is unclear what constitutes success for these organizations, with some suggesting that the Reagan-Udall Foundation is less successful than the CDC Foundation and FNIH based on private funds raised. The Reagan-Udall Foundation's fundraising efforts have been lower than expected, leading to questions about its purpose. Federal agencies engage in public-private partnerships through various mechanisms, including agency-affiliated nonprofit research foundations. The Senate energy and water appropriations bill for FY2020 directs the Department of Energy to assess existing agency-affiliated nonprofit research foundations. The report discusses agency-affiliated nonprofit research foundations created by Congress to support R&D missions of federal agencies. These foundations engage in activities such as soliciting private funds for R&D by federal scientists, supporting non-federal researchers, and managing research funds from federal and non-federal sources through public-private partnerships. Public-private R&D partnerships are formed and managed by agency-related nonprofit research foundations or corporations. While these partnerships are effective for advancing science and technology commercialization, the effectiveness of agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations in managing such partnerships is unclear. Federal science agencies have the authority to create partnerships and accept gifts for R&D, but they are not allowed to solicit private funds, leading to challenges in establishing public-private partnerships. The establishment of public-private partnerships by federal agencies is a deterrent, raising questions about the effectiveness of agency-related nonprofit research foundations. Congress could consider creating a general nonprofit research foundation authority for agencies, supplementing existing authorities, or creating tailored nonprofit research foundations for specific needs. The establishment of public-private partnerships by federal agencies raises questions about the effectiveness of agency-related nonprofit research foundations. Congress may need to create additional agency-related nonprofit research foundations with clear purpose, role, and governance structure to maintain a balance between flexibility and accountability. Federal agencies and Congress have established venture capital firms in the last two decades, including In-Q-Tel. Several venture capital (VC) firms have been established by federal agencies, such as In-Q-Tel (IQT), the Army Venture Capital Initiative (AVCI), and Red Planet Capital (RPC), to ensure access to cutting-edge technologies and input into technology development for mission needs. Factors like a shift in research funding to the private sector, the role of small start-ups in driving innovation, and expanded commercial market opportunities have led to the creation of these organizations. In-Q-Tel, the first federal government-sponsored VC firm, was established by the CIA in 1999. In-Q-Tel (IQT) is a VC firm established by the CIA in 1999. It is an independent, not-for-profit company that works closely with intelligence community entities and the Department of Defense. IQT's portfolio includes investments in data analytics, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technology solutions. The CIA provides funding to IQT, which then invests in selected firms based on the needs articulated by the CIA. In-Q-Tel (IQT) provides investments to selected firms based on CIA needs. IQT investments range from $500,000 to $3 million, with a $1 investment attracting $16 from private investors. They adapt technology to meet IC needs and deliver solutions within 6 to 36 months. Approximately 75% of deals involve multiple agencies for cost efficiency. The Army Venture Capital Initiative was established in January 2002 with $25 million from Congress for basic and applied research. The AVCI is managed by the Army and Arsenal Venture Capital through OnPoint Technologies, with the Army serving as a strategic investor and providing guidance on technology priorities. The Army Venture Capital Initiative (AVCI) was established in 2002 with funding from Congress. AVCI, managed by the Army and Arsenal Venture Capital through OnPoint Technologies, invests in innovative technologies such as power, energy, autonomy, cyber, and health information systems. Congress provided $25 million in FY2002, $12.6 million in FY2003, $14.3 million in FY2005, and reprogrammed $10 million in FY2004 for AVCI. Since FY2005, Congress has not allocated funds to AVCI. AVCI invests $500,000 to $2 million alongside other VC firms, with a $1 investment attracting $22 from private investors. The Army Venture Capital Initiative (AVCI) was established in 2002 with funding from Congress to invest in innovative technologies like autonomy, cyber, health information systems, and advanced materials. AVCI aims to transfer these technologies to soldiers while generating returns for investing organizations. AVCI partners with technology firms beyond the traditional reach of DOD. In 2006, NASA partnered with Red Planet Capital to establish a venture capital fund to support dual-use technologies for NASA's mission and future commercial use. NASA provides strategic direction while Red Planet Capital manages investments. NASA partnered with Red Planet Capital in 2006 to establish a venture capital fund aimed at supporting dual-use technologies for NASA's mission and future commercial use. The fund was intended to identify investment opportunities, perform due diligence, and manage equity investments, with NASA planning to invest approximately $75 million over five years. However, in FY2008, President George W. Bush proposed terminating the program, citing concerns about conflicts of interest and market distortions. Congress provided $6 million for the fund in FY2007, but no further appropriations were made, leading to the elimination of the fund before it could take an equity stake in any private firms. Red Planet Capital (RPC) was a venture capital firm established by NASA in partnership with Red Planet Capital in 2006. The fund was intended to support dual-use technologies for NASA's mission and future commercial use. However, the fund was eliminated before making any equity investments, with only one investment made before its termination. Several federal agencies and Congress have established venture capital firms like RPC to ensure access to cutting-edge technologies and input into technology development. This initiative was driven by a shift in research and development funding from the government to the private sector, the role of small start-ups in driving innovation, and expanded commercial market opportunities. In 1999, the CIA established In-Q-Tel, a federal government-sponsored VC firm focused on investing in data analytics, cybersecurity, AI, and other technology solutions. IQT works closely with the intelligence community and the Department of Defense. The CIA used a DOD approach for funding, and IQT's portfolio includes various technology sectors. In 1999, the CIA established In-Q-Tel, a federal government-sponsored VC firm focused on investing in data analytics, cybersecurity, AI, and other technology solutions. IQT has a management team and a board of trustees, with the CIA as the executive agent. Federal agencies, primarily the CIA, provide funding to IQT, which then invests in selected firms based on CIA needs. The In-Q-Tel Interface Center (QIC) serves as a liaison between the CIA and IQT. IQT investments range from $500,000 to $3 million, with a focus on adapting technology to meet intelligence community needs. IQT asserts that its model delivers rapid, cost-effective solutions by identifying and adapting \"ready-soon\" technologies. IQT identifies and adapts \"ready-soon\" technologies for use within 6 to 36 months. Approximately 75% of deals involve multiple agencies from the IC and defense communities, leading to cost-efficient use of taxpayers' dollars. Profits from IQT investments are allocated for additional investing activities and strategic IT initiatives defined by the CIA. The Army Venture Capital Initiative was established in 2002 with $25 million for venture capital investments managed jointly by the Army and Arsenal Venture Capital. The Army Venture Capital Initiative (AVCI), managed by OnPoint Technologies, LLC (OPT), with guidance from the Army's Communications Electronics Command (CECOM), invests $500,000 to $2 million alongside other VC firms. Congress appropriated $12.6 million in FY2003 and $14.3 million in FY2005 for AVCI, with Army funds supporting investments and expenses. Liquidation proceeds pay Arsenal Venture Capital and fund new investments, but no funds have been appropriated since FY2005. AVCI, managed by OnPoint Technologies, invests $500,000 to $2 million alongside other VC firms. They focus on innovative power and energy technologies, expanding to autonomy, cyber, health information systems, and advanced materials. AVCI aims to develop and transfer technologies to the soldier while achieving returns from commercial and defense markets. They engage technology firms beyond the traditional reach of DOD. Red Planet Capital (RPC) was a fund created to support innovative technologies for NASA's mission and future commercial use. NASA was to provide direction and input, while RPC's principals identified investment opportunities. Congress allocated $6 million for RPC in FY2007, but President George W. Bush proposed terminating the program in FY2008 due to concerns about conflicts of interest and market distortions. The Administration decided to eliminate the Red Planet Capital (RPC) fund, stating that the funds would be better used for NASA's current priorities. Congress did not provide any further appropriations for RPC, and NASA confirmed that the fund was dissolved before making any equity investments. A study by RAND Corporation mentioned that RPC only made one investment before its termination, without specifying the amount."
