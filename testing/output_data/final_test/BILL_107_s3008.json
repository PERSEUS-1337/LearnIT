    "content": "The Act titled \"Teacher and Nurse Support Act of 2002\" is established for the purpose of supporting teachers and nurses. Congress finds that the United States will need over 2,000,000 new teachers in the next 10 years to replace those retiring or leaving. A comprehensive plan is recommended to avert a shortage of high-quality teachers. 20% of new teachers leave within 3 years, and providing loan forgiveness could help retain teachers in need. The American Hospital Association reports over 126,000 unfilled nurse positions in hospitals and a 20% vacancy rate in nursing homes. Student loan debt has nearly doubled from $9,200 in 1992 to $16,928 in 2000. The purpose of this Act is to address the shortage of teachers and nurses to improve access to quality education and healthcare services in the United States. Loan Forgiveness for teachers and nurses is addressed in the Higher Education Act of 1965, with the aim of tackling the shortage of educators and healthcare professionals in the US. The Higher Education Act of 1965 aims to encourage individuals to enter and continue in the teaching and nursing professions by offering loan forgiveness for qualified borrowers who have worked as full-time teachers for 5 consecutive school years.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 offers loan forgiveness to full-time teachers and nurses who meet specific criteria related to their teaching subject area or nursing work. Teachers must complete five school years, while nurses must work for five years in a clinical setting or as a nursing faculty member. Loan forgiveness is limited to $17,500 on outstanding loans. Borrowers cannot receive loan reduction under both this section and section 460. Consolidation loans may qualify for loan forgiveness if used to repay specific types of federal loans. For borrowers meeting requirements under section 428 or 428H, loan holders must grant forbearance in annual increments if the expected forgiveness amount will cover the remaining loan balance. Other forbearance options may also be offered. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations for the provisions of this section, and nothing in this section allows refunding of loan repayments. If the list of eligible schools is not available before May 1, the previous year's list may be used. Teachers can remain eligible for forgiveness if they meet certain requirements while serving in a qualifying school. In any year during service, a teacher failing to meet requirements may still teach and be eligible for loan forgiveness. No borrower can receive benefits under this subsection and other specified acts for the same service. The term 'eligible nurse' refers to a nurse who graduated from a specified program. An eligible nurse must have graduated from an accredited nursing school, hold a valid nursing license, and possess a graduate degree in nursing or equivalent. An eligible nurse must have graduated from an accredited nursing school with a nursing degree from a collegiate, associate, or diploma school of nursing as defined in the Public Health Service Act. Loan cancellation under the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to define an academic year as per the Public Health Service Act. Loan cancellation for teachers and nurses is addressed in Section 460 of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The purpose of this section is to encourage individuals to enter and stay in teaching and nursing professions. The Secretary is authorized to cancel repayment obligations for qualified loans for borrowers who have worked as full-time teachers for 5 consecutive school years in qualifying schools. The section allows for cancellation of Perkins loans for teachers in qualifying schools based on specific criteria such as teaching relevant subjects and demonstrating certification from school administrators. The borrower can qualify for loan cancellation by working as an administrative officer in a public or nonprofit private elementary school, demonstrating knowledge and teaching skills in various subjects, or as a full-time eligible nurse for 5 consecutive years in a clinical setting or as a member of the nursing faculty at an accredited school of nursing. The Secretary can cancel up to $17,500 of a Federal Direct Stafford Loan or Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan after completing five years of teaching or nursing. Borrowers cannot reduce loan obligations under both this section and section 428J. The borrower can qualify for loan cancellation on a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan if it was used to repay specific types of loans. The loan holder must grant forbearance in annual increments for each year of qualifying service. The borrower may qualify for loan cancellation on a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan if used to repay specific loans. The loan holder must grant forbearance annually for each year of qualifying service. The Secretary can issue necessary regulations, and no refunding of canceled loans is allowed. If the list of eligible schools is not available before May 1, the previous year's list can be used for service determination. Teachers who continue to work in a school that initially met eligibility requirements but later fails to do so can still qualify for loan cancellation. Borrowers cannot receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service. In this section, an eligible nurse is defined as someone who graduated from an accredited school of nursing, holds a valid nursing license in the state of practice, and has a graduate degree in nursing.
