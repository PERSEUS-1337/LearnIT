    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the average life expectancy in the United States has increased to 80 years, leading to a higher demand for medical care. Medical school enrollment numbers have remained stagnant for the past 25 years, while tuition and fees at medical schools have significantly increased. The Association of American Medical Colleges has called for an increase in National Health Service Corps program awards to address the need for physicians in underserved populations and rising medical student debt. The National Health Service Corps program has a proven record of supplying physicians to underserved areas, playing a crucial role in expanding access for rural and inner city communities. Continued expansion of the program is strongly recommended as the growing debt incurred by graduating medical students is likely to increase interest in applying for funding. Additionally, one-third of active physicians are over 55 and likely to retire in the next ten years, while the population will have increased by 24 percent. The population is projected to increase by 24 percent by 2020, leading to a shortage of 90,000 full-time physicians. This will result in a peak in the population-to-physician ratio and a decline in the number of primary care physicians, exacerbating healthcare access shortages in rural areas. Difficulty in recruiting qualified medical students from underserved areas and a lack of access to high-quality healthcare services, especially in rural areas, are major concerns. The shortage of physicians is projected to worsen by 2020, leading to healthcare access disparities in rural areas. Collaboration between hospitals and non-hospital settings is crucial to enhance non-hospital healthcare training. The Public Health Service Act is amended to provide scholarships for medical students under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. Additionally, eligibility for Medicare graduate medical education funding of a non-rural hospital with a training program that includes an integrated rural track is clarified. The Social Security Act is amended to define an accredited training program with an integrated rural track as a medical residency program in an urban area offering a specific curriculum for all residents. The program requires a minimum of 3 block months of rural rotations, a stated mission for training rural physicians, 3 months of obstetrical training, and 4 months of pediatric training including various experiences. The amendments require a minimum of 2 months of emergency medicine rotations for hospitals, effective for cost reporting periods starting on or after January 1, 2011."
