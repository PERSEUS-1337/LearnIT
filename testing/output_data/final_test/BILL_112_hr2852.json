    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Action Plan for Public Lands and Education Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that Western States are falling behind in education funding compared to the original States due to a common provision in Acts enabling territories to form State governments, which allocated a percentage of land sale proceeds for the support of common schools. The growth of real per pupil expenditures in Western States from 1979 to 2007 was substantially lower compared to other States, leading to higher pupil-per-teacher ratios. Enrollment growth is projected to be much higher in Western States over the next 10 years. The enrollment growth in Western States is projected to increase dramatically, with higher State and local taxes as a percentage of personal income compared to other States. Despite similar tax rates and budget allocations for education, Western States have lower real growth in per pupil expenditures and higher pupil-per-teacher ratios, with the Federal Government owning untaxed land in these States. The Federal Government owns a significant amount of land in Western States, with an average of 51.9% federally owned land compared to 4.1% in Eastern States. The enabling Acts originally stated that public land would be sold after the admission of States into the Union, but this changed with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, which declared a policy of retaining public land in Federal ownership. This decision was seen as breaking a compact with Western States and breaching a fiduciary duty. The current shortfall in funding public education in Western States requires immediate Congressional action to remedy discriminatory Federal land policy and prevent further disadvantaging of school children. Granting 5 percent of remaining Federal land to Western States is the most efficient remedy available. SEC. 3. Quantity grants to Western States for education improvement. Quantity land grants are provided to Western States for education improvement, granting land equal to 5 percent of federally owned land within each state as of January 1, 2011. States select land from unappropriated public lands based on the acreage of federally owned land. The Secretary calculates the exact acreage of federally owned land. The Secretary will calculate the acreage of federally owned land in each Western State as of January 1, 2011, and designate unappropriated public land eligible for selection by the State. This selection and transfer of land will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. Mineral, oil, and gas rights to the selected land will belong to the Western State unless specified otherwise. The Western State will own mineral, oil, and gas rights to selected land unless the Federal lessee is making royalty payments. Upon termination of the leasehold interest, the rights will transfer to the Western State. If the land is generating payments to the United States, the State can only select the surface rights. Upon expiration of production, the entire mineral, oil, and gas estate will belong to the Western State. The Western States will hold selected land in trust for the Permanent School Fund, with proceeds used for public education. Definitions include Western States, Secretary, State educational agency, and federally owned land. The term \"federally owned land\" includes all land held by the United States or its agencies, such as military reservations, Indian Reservations, and land used for Federal purposes.
