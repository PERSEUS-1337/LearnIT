Section 30515 of the Penal Code in California is amended to include specific criteria for defining an \"assault weapon,\" such as features like pistol grips, folding stocks, grenade launchers, and high-capacity magazines for rifles, as well as threaded barrels and second handgrips for pistols. The amended Penal Code in California defines an \"assault weapon\" based on specific features like pistol grips, folding stocks, high-capacity magazines, threaded barrels, and second handgrips. It includes criteria such as a shroud to protect the bearer's hand, capacity for detachable magazines, and characteristics of semiautomatic shotguns. The California Penal Code exempts pistols designed for Olympic target shooting from the definition of \"assault weapon.\" Pistols sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and USA Shooting, used for Olympic target shooting before January 1, 2001, are exempt. Specific pistol models from manufacturers like Benelli and Hammerli are also excluded from the definition of \"assault weapon.\" The California Penal Code exempts specific pistol models like Benelli, Hammerli, Pardini, and Walther used for Olympic target shooting from being classified as assault weapons. The Department of Justice will create a program to exempt new competitive pistol models based on recommendations from USA Shooting or other relevant organizations. Section 30680 of the Penal Code exempts individuals who lawfully possessed an assault weapon before January 1, 2017, and meet certain criteria from the restrictions outlined in Section 30605. These individuals must register the assault weapon by January 1, 2018, as per Section 30900. Section 30900 of the Penal Code requires individuals who lawfully possessed assault weapons before specific dates to register them with the Department of Justice by certain deadlines.

The registration must include a unique description of the firearm, owner's information, and any other details required by the department. The department may charge a registration fee of up to $20 per person to cover processing costs. Fees will increase annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment but will not exceed the department's reasonable costs. Fees collected will be deposited into the Dealers\u2019 Record of Sale Special Account. Any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon without a fixed magazine from 2001 to 2016 must register the firearm by January 1, 2018, using an online application provided by the department.
