Supreme Court justices convicted of a felony punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding one year involving moral turpitude shall be suspended from office. Supreme Court justices convicted of a felony shall be suspended from office without pay, effective upon the verdict of guilt.

The table of sections for chapter 1 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by changing the item relating to section 3.

A convicted circuit judge of such offense shall be suspended without pay. The circuit judge shall be suspended without pay upon a felony conviction, effective from the date of guilt. Reversal of conviction results in reinstatement with back pay, unless impeached. Impeachment without conviction leads to reinstatement without back pay. District judges' tenure excludes felony offenses, and \"good behavior\" does not include any committed offense.

Reversal of conviction results in reinstatement with back pay, unless impeached. Impeachment without conviction leads to reinstatement without back pay. If a federal justice or judge is convicted of a felony punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding one year involving moral turpitude, their age and years of service at the time of conviction will be considered for retirement purposes. Reversal of the conviction upon final appeal results in no application of this rule, unless impeachment occurs. If a federal justice or judge is impeached or articles of impeachment are reported to the House of Representatives without resulting in a conviction in the Senate, retirement benefits will be determined based on their age and years of service at the time of conviction for a felony."
