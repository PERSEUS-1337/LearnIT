The Entrada and Southern High Plains Aquifers in East Central New Mexico provide water for communities and agriculture but are declining in quantity and quality. Despite conservation efforts, groundwater use in some areas may not be sustainable beyond 12 to 25 years. In 1959, New Mexico began building the Ute Dam and Reservoir on the Canadian River to secure a water supply for eastern New Mexico. Public Law 89-561 authorized a feasibility study for a water project in the region. Various studies have been conducted, including one in 1994 estimating an annual water yield of 24,000 acre-feet from Ute Reservoir. In 1997, an agreement was made for the purchase of 24,000 acre-feet of water per year for use in eastern New Mexico. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority was established to plan, finance, develop, and operate the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System. The conceptual design report for the system was finalized in August 2003 and underwent a peer review process resulting in a final report in December 2003. The State of New Mexico strongly supports the development of the project. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority strongly supports the development of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System. Completion of the system would provide Quay, Roosevelt, and Curry Counties with a reliable source of water to sustain current economic activity and support future growth in the region. The purpose of this Act is to authorize financial and technical assistance from the Secretary of the Interior. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority is supported in developing the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System to provide a reliable water source for Quay, Roosevelt, and Curry Counties. Financial and technical assistance will be provided by the Secretary of the Interior for planning, designing, and constructing the system. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority is developing the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System with support from the Secretary of the Interior for planning, designing, and constructing the system. The Act defines key terms related to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority, including the Authority itself, Conceptual Design Report, Logan sewer project, and plan. The Act defines key terms related to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority, including the operation, maintenance, and replacement plan, Portales energy recovery system, Secretary of the Interior, State of New Mexico, and the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System. The Act defines key terms related to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority, including the operation, maintenance, and replacement plan, Portales energy recovery system, Secretary of the Interior, State of New Mexico, and the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System. The System includes the Logan sewer project, Tucumcari advanced wastewater treatment facility, and Portales energy recovery system, providing water to communities in eastern New Mexico from the Ute Reservoir. The Tucumcari advanced wastewater treatment facility aims to improve water quality in the Ute Reservoir. The Ute Reservoir is a key component of the water system. The Ute Reservoir, created in 1962 by the Ute Dam on the Canadian River, is located 32 miles upstream of the New Mexico-Texas border. SEC. 4. EASTERN NEW MEXICO RURAL WATER SYSTEM. Financial assistance may be provided by the Secretary to the Authority for planning, designing, and constructing the System, with limitations on its use to ensure alignment with the Conceptual Design Report. The Federal share of the total cost of any construction under this Act is 80%, with development costs included. No funds can be used for System construction until a plan is developed. Title to the infrastructure of the System will be held by the Authority, the Town of Logan, New Mexico, or the City of Tucumcari, New Mexico, as specified under State law, once a plan is developed and environmental requirements are met. The Authority is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of the System. They must develop a plan with the Secretary to establish rates and fees for beneficiaries to ensure proper maintenance and water delivery. Modifications can be made to adjust water allocation and fees. Administrative provisions are outlined in Section 6. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements, including financial assistance, with the Authority for planning, design, and construction of the System. Responsibilities of both parties must be specified in the agreement. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to the Authority for planning, designing, constructing, and operating the System. This Act does not affect State water law or interstate compacts related to water allocation. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to the Authority for planning, designing, constructing, and operating the System. This Act does not affect State water law or interstate compacts related to water allocation. The allocation of water or conferring of Federal rights to non-Federal entities regarding stream water or groundwater resources is prohibited. Authorization of appropriations for the System is granted. The Secretary is authorized $250,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2016. Adjustments for cost increases will be made using engineering cost indices. The Federal and non-Federal shares of cost increases will follow cost-sharing requirements. Amounts allocated to the Authority will be nonreimbursable and nonreturnable to the United States. Funds allocated under this Act are nonreimbursable and nonreturnable to the United States. Unexpended funds at the end of each fiscal year will be retained for future use consistent with the Act's purposes."
