During World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt commissioned around 250,000 troops from the Philippines into active service for the United States. The United States War Department formed the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), which included the Filipino Infantry Regiment composed of first-generation immigrants and second-generation Filipino-American soldiers. The Philippine Scout units were directly recruited by the United States Army. During World War II, Filipino soldiers responded to President Roosevelt's call-to-arms and fought under the American flag. They shared the same fate as American troops at Bataan, Corregidor, and the \"Death March,\" making many sacrifices. During World War II, Filipino soldiers fought alongside American troops in the Far East and as guerilla fighters during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. The Rescission Act of 1946 later denied them recognition as active military members, but Congress acknowledges their courage and bravery. The United States is forever grateful for their dedication and sacrifice. The commitment and sacrifice of Filipino soldiers during World War II demonstrate exceptional patriotism and honor.
