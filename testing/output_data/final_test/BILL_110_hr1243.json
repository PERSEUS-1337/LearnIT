    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf Coast Back to Business Act of 2007\". Congress finds that 43 percent of businesses that close after a natural disaster never reopen, with an additional 29 percent closing permanently within 2 years. Hurricane Katrina and Rita negatively impacted small businesses in the Gulf Coast, leading to disruptions in commerce. Over 125,000 small- and medium-sized businesses were affected by these hurricanes according to the United States Chamber of Commerce. Businesses impacted by Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast urgently need increased access to capital and technical assistance for recovery and prosperity. Without full recovery, the region and the rest of the United States will suffer negative impacts. The Act defines key terms such as \"Disaster Area,\" \"major disaster,\" and \"small business concern.\" It aims to provide recovery grants for small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005. The Act authorizes $100,000,000 for the Economic Development Administration to make grants to Louisiana and Mississippi. $75,000,000 is allocated to Louisiana and $25,000,000 to Mississippi in direct proportion to the allocation. Grants awarded to a State under subsection (a) shall be used to provide assistance to small businesses in Disaster Areas impacted by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita of 2005 for purposes such as paying employees, bills, repairs, inventory, and restarting operations in the community. Grants awarded to a State under subsection (a) shall be used to provide assistance to small businesses in Disaster Areas impacted by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita of 2005 for purposes such as compensating for direct economic injury, covering additional costs, and helping businesses obtain funding through insurance claims or Federal assistance programs. The State may use its own criteria for grant distribution. The Department of Commerce may use up to $1,500,000 to administer grants to designated States for small businesses impacted by Hurricane Katrina or Rita. States cannot exclude small businesses based on revenue increases during a specific period. SEC. 5. DISASTER LOANS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA OR HURRICANE RITA. After Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita, disaster loans were provided in response to the major disasters declared by the President. Qualified borrowers, defined as individuals receiving loans due to the hurricanes, were eligible for deferment of loan payments. Payments of principal and interest on disaster loans to qualified borrowers made before December 31, 2006, shall be deferred for 1 year from the date of enactment of this provision. No interest shall accrue during this deferral period, which may be extended to 2 years from the loan distribution date. The Administrator may extend the deferral period for disaster loan payments to 2 years from the loan distribution date. The resumption of payments will require periodic installments of principal and interest, subject to the same terms and conditions as any other loan. The Administrator is authorized to increase collateral requirements for loans. The Administrator may not require collateral for covered loans of up to $35,000 made under specific conditions after Hurricane Katrina or Rita. SEC. 6. OTHER PROGRAMS. The Small Business Act is amended to include areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita as HUBZones. Time period for this designation is specified. The time period for the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program Act of 1988 is specified to be a 2-year period, with a possible extension to 3 years at the discretion of the Administrator. The Program shall not apply to contracts related to relief or reconstruction from Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita during a 2-year period, extendable to 3 years at the Administrator's discretion."
