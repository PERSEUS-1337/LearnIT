    "content": "The Trump Administration and Congress are dealing with a high number of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras at the U.S. Southwest border. Critics call the process of releasing apprehended asylum seekers into the U.S. interior while they await immigration hearings \"catch and release.\" This is due to immigration court backlogs and limited detention space for families. The Department of Homeland Security's Alternatives to Detention programs are gaining congressional interest as a way to monitor and supervise foreign nationals released into the United States while awaiting immigration hearings. Proponents highlight lower costs, high compliance rates, and a more humane approach for low-flight-risk individuals, including asylum applicants. Critics argue that these programs create opportunities for participants to abscond and incentivize migration by allowing extended stays in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security's Alternatives to Detention programs are being questioned for their effectiveness in monitoring and supervising foreign nationals awaiting immigration hearings. Critics argue that these programs incentivize migration by allowing extended stays in the U.S. Immigration statistics show a shift in the demographic profile of individuals apprehended at the Southwest border, with a focus on detention for compliance. Apprehensions of aliens from Northern Triangle countries, fleeing violence and seeking asylum in the United States, have exceeded those from Mexico in the past five years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported a sharp increase in apprehensions at the Southwest border since 2017, with a significant rise in family units and unaccompanied alien children. In May 2018, there were 22,000 apprehensions, increasing to 100,569 in April 2019, a 357% increase. The number of single adults apprehended or found inadmissible at the U.S. border rose from 24,493 to 43,637, a 46% increase. Foreign nationals from the Northern Triangle are overwhelming federal agencies with asylum requests. U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration at borders between ports of entry, while CBP's Office of Field Operations handles responsibilities at ports of entry. Aliens may legally request admission at a port of entry, but some attempt illegal entry between ports on the southern border. If caught, they are briefly detained by Border Patrol and placed into removal proceedings. Depending on detention space availability, individuals apprehended at the U.S. border are either transferred to ICE custody or released into the U.S. Removal proceedings vary based on factors like entry method, country of origin, and asylum requests. Expedited removal is used for inadmissible individuals lacking proper documentation or committing fraud. Unaccompanied children are not subject to expedited removal and go through standard removal procedures if deemed removable. Aliens arriving in the United States without valid documentation may request asylum if they fear persecution in their home country. If they establish a credible fear, they are placed in standard removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Aliens placed in standard removal proceedings under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7240 can pursue an asylum application before an immigration judge. A negative credible fear determination can be reviewed by an immigration judge. If overturned, the alien goes through standard removal proceedings; otherwise, they face expedited removal and deportation. Immigration judges from the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) determine removal eligibility or relief. ICE decides on initial detention or release during these proceedings. ICE makes custody decisions for aliens, deciding whether to detain or release them pending removal proceedings. Asylum seekers in family units are often released into U.S. communities for their immigration hearings. DHS is authorized to arrest, detain, remove, or release foreign nationals. ERO is responsible for detaining and removing aliens. Detention is discretionary for aliens not subject to mandatory detention, but mandatory for certain classes of aliens, such as those convicted of specified crimes. The ICE Risk Classification Assessment tool is used to standardize custody decisions. ICE uses the Risk Classification Assessment (RCA) software tool to evaluate whether a foreign national should be detained or released based on factors like criminal history, gang affiliation, and humanitarian conditions. Detention decisions can result in release on recognizance, bond, or parole for humanitarian reasons. DHS has the discretion to parole aliens into the U.S. pending removal proceedings, including asylum seekers subject to mandatory detention. DHS has the discretion to parole aliens into the United States pending removal proceedings, especially for family units with minors due to limited detention facilities. Family units requesting asylum and receiving a positive credible fear determination are typically released, while Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) are transferred to the custody of ORR for their removal proceedings. UAC are usually transferred to ORR custody for removal proceedings, similar to family units. Once released from DHS custody, they are placed in the non-detained docket. All aliens released into the U.S. interior must report to ICE annually. The non-detained docket currently has around 3 million cases, with some enrolled in an ATD monitoring program. The number of initial book-ins to ICE detention facilities has exceeded 300,000 annually, peaking in 2014 at 425,728. In FY2019, the number of detention beds authorized by Congress was set at 45,274, up nearly 5,000 from the previous year. ICE reported 54,082 aliens were detained on June 22, 2019. The ICE caseload includes all detained and non-detained aliens that ICE supervises. Non-detained aliens are released on various orders or were never detained. The non-detained docket has around 3 million cases. The ICE non-detained docket includes aliens in law enforcement custody, at-large aliens with removal orders, and those released from ICE custody. They must report to ERO annually, with monitoring until their cases close. The non-detained caseload was around 3 million foreign nationals in June 2019, with 54,082 detained aliens, making up less than 2% of the entire ICE caseload. Additionally, 101,568 aliens are enrolled in ISAPIII, approximately 3% of all cases. The goal of the ICE ATD program is to monitor and supervise certain individuals. The ICE ATD program, specifically ISAP III, aims to monitor and supervise certain aliens in removal proceedings more frequently than those released with annual supervision. Participants must report to ERO annually and are subject to varying levels of supervision. DHS emphasizes that ATD programs are not removal programs or substitutes for detention but enhance ICE's ability to monitor foreign nationals more intensively in communities. Eligibility for ISAP III requires participants to be 18 years or older. The ICE ATD program, ISAP III, monitors and supervises aliens in removal proceedings. Participants must be 18 years or older. There were 101,568 active participants in ISAP III, a 283% increase from FY2015. BI, Inc. provides case management and technology services to ensure compliance with release conditions. ERO ATD officers determine supervision methods on a case-by-case basis, including face-to-face meetings, home visits, and GPS monitoring. The ICE ATD program, ISAP III, uses various monitoring methods such as telephonic reporting, GPS monitoring, and the SmartLINK smartphone application. Around 42% use telephonic reporting, 46% use GPS monitoring, and 12% use SmartLINK. Compliance with the program's terms is closely monitored, with supervision levels adjusted based on compliance benchmarks. ICE's ISAP III program supervises alien participants until their case is resolved through removal, voluntary departure, or relief from removal. Statistics show that most enrollees are female, part of family units, aged 18-34, from Northern Triangle countries, and have no criminal convictions. Ninety percent of foreign nationals in ISAP III had no criminal convictions, with 86% not having a final removal order. In 2014, GAO evaluated ISAP II, the predecessor program, noting limitations in data for assessing effectiveness. The GAO found high rates of compliance with court appearances among ISAP II enrollees, with 99% appearing at court hearings. Data was not collected for technology-only component participants. ICE began collecting court compliance data for 88% of participants. ICE added a performance measure based on removals in 2011. ICE consistently surpassed 99 percent in meeting removal goals for the ISAP II program in FY2012 and FY2013. Despite high court appearance rates, data limitations hindered GAO's evaluation of ISAP II's performance. ICE's performance measures for the ISAP II program were based on termination data, but incomplete record keeping made it difficult to track compliance. The Family Case Management Program (FCMP) was an alternative to detention for vulnerable families, with compliance rates similar to other ICE monitoring options. The FCMP prioritized families with young children, pregnant or nursing women, individuals with medical or mental health considerations, and victims of domestic violence. It aimed to increase compliance with immigration obligations through case management supported by community-based organizations. GEO Care, Inc. partnered with local CBOs to provide services. Each family received three sets of services, including initial stabilization services like legal referrals and English language training. The program aimed to support stable families by providing medical and food assistance, English language training, and legal orientation programs. Participants had to attend presentations on immigration proceedings and U.S. laws, with frequent reporting requirements and monthly appointments to reinforce information. Case workers built trust and provided planning assistance for potential return or removal. The program enrolled 952 heads of households with 1,211 children, totaling 2,163 individuals in five metropolitan areas. Most families in the program were headed by women (92%) from the Northern Triangle countries, with 55% of participants being children under 18. Participants in the program were mainly children under 18, with 21% under age 6. Assessments showed that 73% had experienced trauma, 11% were victims of domestic violence, and 6% were pregnant or nursing. Evaluation data indicated high compliance rates with attendance at appointments and court hearings, with 99% attendance at immigration court proceedings. The Family Case Management Program (FCMP) had high compliance rates with court proceedings and ICE monitoring requirements, with 4% of participants absconding. 65 families left the program, with various outcomes such as removal by ICE, leaving the country on their own, or receiving immigration relief. The program's success rates were limited due to its short duration, and its compliance rates were consistent with other ICE programs. The cost of the FCMP was also an important factor in evaluating its effectiveness. The FCMP cost $38.47 per family per day in FY2016, compared to $4.40 per person per day for ISAP III. Family detention costs $237.60 per day, while adult detention costs $79.57 per day in the same cities. The FCMP is more expensive due to comprehensive case management, targeting vulnerable families, and smaller caseloads for case managers. Case managers had experience, used outreach, spoke Spanish, and developed individualized plans for families. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 includes $30.5 million to resume the FCMP, which aims to improve compliance with immigration court obligations by providing families with community-based support for basic needs. ICE is directed to prioritize the use of ATD programs, including the FCMP, for families and to develop a program managed by nonprofit organizations to connect families with services. ICE has introduced a new program called Extended Case Management Services (ECMS) to connect families with community-based services. This program incorporates principles from the Family Case Management Program (FCMP) into the Alternative to Detention (ATD) program, offering services in more locations at a lower cost. As of June 22, 2019, 57 family units and 59 adults are enrolled in ECMS. Supporters of ATD programs highlight their effectiveness in managing foreign nationals' compliance with immigration court obligations. ICE's Extended Case Management Services (ECMS) program aims to address the issue of overcrowded detention facilities by providing community-based services to foreign nationals in removal proceedings. The program targets individuals who are not considered security threats and face challenges in being removed due to issues with their countries of citizenship. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Zadvydas v. Davis limits the government's ability to detain aliens indefinitely. Advocates of Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs highlight the lower cost compared to detention, with ICE spending $137 per adult per day in detention in FY2018. The cost of enrolling individuals in the ISAP III program was $4.16 per participant per day in FY2018. GAO found that in FY2013, the average daily cost of ATD (ISAP II) was $10.55, while detention cost $158 per day on average. The cost of maintaining an enrollee in ISAP II would exceed detention costs if the enrollee stayed in the program for 1,229 days, much longer than the average participant's 383 days. GAO also found that an individual would need to spend 435 days in ISAP II before exceeding the average detention cost of 29 days. Concerns exist about ATD programs leading to absconding and unauthorized residency. ATD enrollees may wait years for their cases to be heard, leading to absconding and loss of contact with ERO. Failure to show up for removal hearings can result in inadmissibility and ineligibility for relief for a certain period. Asylum-seeking families are often placed in ATD programs. Asylum-seeking families placed in ATD programs create incentives for others to travel to the US with children to avoid detention. Concerns over adults using children as \"human shields\" to enter the US illegally have prompted DHS to take biometric data from children. Arguments against ATD programs include limited effectiveness measures and concerns over fraudulent claims or harm to children. The feasibility of scaling up a small pilot program for asylum-seeking families requesting asylum remains uncertain."
