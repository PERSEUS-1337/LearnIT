    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for elementary and secondary education, with Title I-A being the largest program funded at $15.5 billion for FY2017. It provides educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education allocates Title I-A grants to local educational agencies using four funding formulas. The ESEA was reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015 with minimal changes to the Title I-A formulas, effective in FY2017. In FY2017, Title I-A funds were allocated to LEAs through four formulas: Basic Grants (42%), Concentration Grants (9%), Targeted Grants (25%), and EFIG (25%). Once received by LEAs, the amounts allocated under the formulas are combined and used jointly. The four Title I-A formulas are combined and used jointly, with maximum grants calculated based on formula child count and expenditure factors. Grants are reduced to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs must meet minimum criteria to be eligible for grants under specific formulas. Some LEAs qualify for grants under multiple formulas. In FY2017, Title I-A grants were calculated at the LEA and state levels using multiple formulas. California received the largest share of funds among states. The percentage share of funds allocated under each formula was calculated for each state. Total Title I-A grants for each state were also shown in the report. Overall, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount ($1.8 billion) and the largest percentage share (12.00%) of Title I-A grants. Vermont received the smallest total grant amount ($35.3 million) and the smallest percentage share (0.23%). Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation formulas, with the Basic Grant formula generally receiving a greater share of funds than the Concentration Grant formula. Texas, for example, has a larger population of children included in the calculations compared to North Carolina. Florida and New York received a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants compared to their overall Title I-A funds, indicating the Targeted Grant formula favors them. This suggests that certain formulas may be more favorable to specific states based on their funding allocation. In four states receiving minimum grants under all formulas, Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas provide higher shares than Basic Grant or Concentration Grant formulas due to higher state minimums. Minimum grant amounts are denoted with an asterisk in Table 1."
