    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of Army and Air Force for law enforcement, but not Navy or Marines. National Guard is exempt unless in federal service. Courts have ruled on military assistance to civilian police. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of Army and Air Force for law enforcement, but not Navy or Marines. Courts have ruled on military assistance to civilian police, outlining violations of the PCA and exceptions provided by Congress. Section 331 allows the President to use the military to suppress insurrection at a state's request to protect against domestic violence. Section 332 delegates Congress's power to the President to enforce laws or suppress rebellion. Section 333 permits the President to use the armed forces to suppress insurrection, domestic violence, or unlawful acts if law enforcement is hindered. The Insurrection Act allows the President to use the military to suppress civil disturbances if law enforcement is unable to protect individuals or if the unlawful action obstructs the execution of US laws. It does not require the governor's permission and has been used in history during events like the 1992 Los Angeles riots and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The President must issue a proclamation ordering insurgents to disperse, and if the situation persists, the armed forces can be deployed. The President can use the military under the Insurrection Act to suppress civil disturbances if law enforcement is unable to protect individuals or if the unlawful action obstructs US laws. Congress has authorized the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies, but prohibits armed forces personnel from making arrests or conducting searches and seizures. The Department of Defense has emergency powers to ensure the preservation of public order and carry out governmental operations within its territorial limits. The Insurrection Act allows for the use of military forces to prevent loss of life or property during civil disturbances or disasters when local authorities are unable to control the situation. Military action can be taken without prior authorization in emergency situations. The Stafford Act authorizes federal aid for states in disasters, including use of armed forces for relief operations. This authority does not bypass the Posse Comitatus Act. The Stafford Act authorizes federal aid for states in disasters, including the use of armed forces for relief operations. However, federal military forces cannot be used to maintain law and order, such as acting as traffic controllers or providing security for relief facilities. Patrolling civilian neighborhoods for security purposes is not allowed, but patrolling for humanitarian missions like rescue operations and food delivery is permitted. Military resources can be deployed upon the request of the governor for emergency work essential for preserving life. The DOD can provide emergency work deemed essential by the President for up to ten days before a declaration of emergency or disaster. This assistance includes debris removal and restoration of public facilities. The provision is for situations where communication issues hinder the ability to declare an emergency. The governor of the affected state must first determine the severity of the situation before a presidential declaration under the Stafford Act. The governor of the affected state must determine the severity of the situation and make a detailed request for federal assistance. This includes activating the state's National Guard units and providing information on committed resources. The prerequisites for a major disaster declaration are similar to those for an emergency, with the governor needing to execute the state's emergency plan and determine that state capabilities are insufficient to handle the circumstances. The governor must provide information on committed resources and certify compliance with cost-sharing provisions under the Stafford Act. If the state's National Guard units are called into federal service for disaster relief, their role is limited to operations authorized under the Stafford Act. DOD doctrine allows commanders to assist civil authorities in overwhelming disasters to save lives and prevent damage. The immediate response actions authorized under the Stafford Act include rescue, evacuation, medical treatment, restoring public services, debris removal, controlling contaminated areas, food distribution, and emergency communications. DoD components can perform these functions without a request from state or local officials under conditions of Immediate Response, with the goal of facilitating the reestablishment of civil responsibility as soon as possible. This authority is not provided for in any statute but has historical roots. The immediate response authority, with deep historical roots, allows DOD to assist in disaster relief and law enforcement simultaneously, even in civil disturbance situations. This was exemplified during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake when troops were deployed to stop looting, protect federal buildings, and assist firefighters."
