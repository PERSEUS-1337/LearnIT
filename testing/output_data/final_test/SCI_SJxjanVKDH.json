The proposed 3D-SIC approach utilizes a novel end-to-end 3D neural network architecture for efficient inference in large indoor environments. The 3D-SIC approach aims to detect individual object instances in incomplete RGB-D scans and infer their complete geometry, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in mAP@0.5 on ScanNet and SUNCG. Understanding 3D environments is crucial for tasks in computer vision, graphics, and robotics, requiring instance-level object segmentation and complete object geometry for tasks like grasping and spatial arrangement estimation. The approach focuses on predicting object detection and instance-level completion for partial 3D scans, termed semantic instance completion. It emphasizes individual objects for enabling interaction in environments and object-level understanding. Our new 3D semantic instance completion network enables object-level understanding and interaction in 3D environments by predicting complete object geometry. It integrates instance detection and object completion in an end-to-end, fully differentiable manner, leveraging features from color images and 3D geometry for accurate predictions. The fully-convolutional, end-to-end 3D CNN formulation presented predicts 3D instance completion, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 15.8 in mAP@0.5 on real-world scan data and 18.5 in mAP@0.5 on synthetic data. The task of semantic instance completion for 3D scans is introduced, along with a novel 3D convolutional network that predicts object bounding boxes, class labels, and complete object geometry. It is shown that this task can benefit semantic instance segmentation performance. Several approaches have been introduced for object detection and instance segmentation in 3D data, utilizing point clouds and joint color-geometry feature learning. Anchor-based object proposal mechanisms are leveraged for detection, with object completion playing a key role. Object completion is used to predict instance completion and improve instance segmentation performance in 3D shape processing. Traditional methods focus on filling small holes in broken mesh models, while surface reconstruction approaches optimize for missing surfaces. Shape completion approaches leverage symmetry, structural priors, and CAD model retrieval for completing shapes. Recent advancements in 3D shape processing have led to the development of methods using generative deep learning to predict complete geometry and voxel occupancy. A new approach for data-driven scan completion of full 3D scenes has been introduced, showing improvements in 3D semantic segmentation. This method enables new applications requiring instance-based knowledge of a scene and demonstrates the benefits of instance completion for instance segmentation. Instance segmentation can benefit from instance completion by combining features from RGB-D scans and 3D geometry. The network uses a truncated signed distance field (TSDF) to encode the 3D scan and merges color information with geometric features. An encoder-decoder backbone with 3D residual blocks is used for semantic instance completion, with objects detected through anchor proposal and bounding box regression.

It uses an encoder-decoder backbone with 3D residual blocks for object detection through anchor proposal and bounding box regression. Five losses are employed for supervision: objectness, box location, classification, per-instance completion, and proxy completion. The method operates on a unified backbone for detection followed by instance completion, enabling object completion to inform.

The backbone encoder consists of five 3D residual blocks, with skip connections linking encoder and decoder features. Two sets of anchors are defined on feature maps F2 and F3 for 3D object bounding box regression. A k-means clustering method is used to select anchors, with larger anchors associated with larger receptive fields. Objectness scores are outputted for each anchor using convolution layers. The network predicts 3D bounding box locations and object class labels using features from different feature maps. It uses a region of interest pooling layer to standardize feature map sizes before inputting them into an object classification MLP. Per-voxel occupancies are predicted for each object by cropping features from the backbone's feature map F5. The network predicts 3D bounding box locations and object class labels using features from different feature maps. Features from feature map F5 of the backbone are processed through 3D convolutions to predict voxel occupancy. Ground truth bounding boxes and masks are defined, and predicted bounding boxes and masks are trained based on overlap. Instance completion loss is defined for each pair, and a global geometric completion loss is introduced on the entire scene level.

Evaluation of the method is done using mean average precision metric on complete masks, with comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches for semantic instance completion shown in tables and figures. Our end-to-end approach for semantic instance completion combines scene completion and 3D instance segmentation methods, resulting in improved performance. The ScanComplete model used on ScanNet data is trained on synthetic data due to the lack of complete ground truth scene data for real-world scans. The semantic instance completion predictions can also be evaluated for semantic instance segmentation by intersecting the predicted complete mask with the input partial scan geometry. Our method combines scene completion and 3D instance segmentation for improved performance. Evaluating on ScanNet and SUNCG scans, we find predicting instance completion enhances segmentation. The geometric completion proxy loss improves semantic instance completion and segmentation on real and synthetic data. The addition of a color input stream is also evaluated for its impact on performance. The color input stream significantly improves semantic instance completion performance on real and synthetic scans, outperforming alternative approaches. Our approach for semantic instance completion shows potential but has limitations. It outputs a binary mask for object geometry, which may limit detail. Using different 3D representations could improve geometric detail. Additionally, predicting object orientation and improving object detection methods could enhance the approach further. In 2019, a state-of-the-art approach for 3D semantic instance segmentation was introduced, which benefits from predicting instance completion. The approach was evaluated without completion, color input, and completion proxy loss. The task of semantic instance completion was introduced along with 3D-SIC, a new 3D CNN-based approach that jointly detects objects and predicts their complete geometry. The approach considers object movement over time in dynamic environments, showing significant opportunities for semantic instance completion. Our proposed 3D CNN learns from color and geometry features to detect and classify objects, predicting voxel occupancy for complete object geometry. Outperforming alternative approaches on real and synthetic scan data, this approach advances scene understanding and object-based interactions. Tables detail anchor sizes and network layers used in the backbone. Leveraging residual blocks, the approach shows promise for new research avenues. The backbone and mask completion head are fully-convolutional, with residual blocks utilized. The classification head includes fully-connected layers and 3D RoIpooling for processing large 3D scans efficiently. Anchor sizes for region proposal are determined through k-means clustering of ground truth bounding boxes. Inference timing with and without color projection is presented in Tables 7 and 8, with the color projection layer projecting the color signal into 3D space. The color projection layer in the model can be optimized using CUDA to project color features back to 3D space in parallel, which could significantly improve inference time for scans containing hundreds of images. The physical size of the model is 4.7 x 7.7 x 7.9 x 9.6 x 10.7."
