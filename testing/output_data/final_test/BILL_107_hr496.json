    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independent Telecommunications Consumer Enhancement Act of 2001\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to accelerate the deployment of services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will enable them to deploy advanced services and competitive initiatives in less populated regions, benefiting consumers. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide. It seeks to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources towards increasing investment in initiatives. SEC. 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines. SEC. 4 provides regulatory relief for these carriers. \"Reduced regulatory requirements for two percent carriers under SEC. 281.\" The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. This section does not mandate a separate evaluation if the rules do not apply to two percent carriers. The section includes a savings clause stating that size-based differentiation among carriers is allowed under certain circumstances. It also specifies that the provisions apply to rules adopted after the enactment date. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports. However, they must certify compliance annually. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 prohibits the Commission from mandating two percent carriers to maintain separate affiliates for various services or operations. The text discusses the ability of a two percent carrier to participate or withdraw from a common line tariff without obligation for other study areas. It also mentions the option for carriers to elect price cap rate regulation for specific study areas. The Commission allows carriers to withdraw from regulation for specific study areas without being obligated to do the same for other areas. A carrier's election under this subsection is binding for one year. The Commission permits two percent carriers to deploy new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for rate structures. This includes services that expand service options for ratepayers. Additionally, competing carriers are allowed entry under Section 286. \"(a) Pricing Flexibility.--Two percent carriers can adjust interstate rates, file tariffs with one day's notice, and offer contract-based tariffs for switched or special access services upon certification of competition. Rate-of-return regulation applies to services with pricing flexibility. (b) Pricing Deregulation.--Upon certification, two percent carriers can deregulate pricing under Commission approval.\" Upon certification by a two percent carrier of facilities-based entry by a local exchange carrier in its service area, the Commission will regulate the two percent carrier as non-dominant, exempting it from tariffing interstate service offerings. Additionally, a two percent carrier meeting certain requirements can participate in the common line tariff by including its study areas. Definitions include facilities-based entry for this section. Facilities-based entry refers to providing local telephone exchange switching and service to at least one unaffiliated customer within a two percent carrier's service area. A contract-based tariff is a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and its customers, including contract terms, service descriptions, and volume commitments. The curr_chunk discusses the contract terms for a two percent carrier, including minimum volume commitments, contract prices, volume discounts, and other regulations. The term 'service area' is defined in relation to section 214(e)(5). The curr_chunk discusses the savings provisions related to the authority of the Commission and the rights of rural telephone companies. It also includes a limitation on merger review. The curr_chunk amends Section 310 of the Communications Act of 1934 by adding a deadline for making public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must make determinations and rule on petitions within 60 days of receiving an application for such mergers. The Commission must approve or deny applications for mergers involving two percent carriers within 60 days. If no action is taken, the application is deemed approved without conditions. Two percent carriers can elect to make decisions regarding local exchange facilities acquired through mergers. Applications submitted to the Commission after the enactment of this Act will be subject to new requirements. Pending applications on the enactment date will also be subject to these requirements as if they were filed on that date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being deemed granted. The Commission must issue an order on petitions within 90 days, with relief deemed granted if no action is taken. Enforcement of rules sought for reconsideration by a party is stayed until the Commission issues an order. Final orders can be appealed. Effective for petitions submitted after the enactment date. Petitions for waiver pending with the Commission on the date of enactment of this Act will be subject to the requirements of this section as if filed on the enactment date. Passed the House of Representatives on March 21, 2001."
