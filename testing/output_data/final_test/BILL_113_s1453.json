    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Diagnosis Act of 2013\". The findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerous levels, leading to heart enlargement and failure. Patients experience severe limitations in physical activity and may become completely bedridden in a matter of months. Patients with pulmonary hypertension often experience functional deterioration, leading to job loss and reliance on family and disability benefits. Early diagnosis is crucial for prognosis, but the disease is often not detected in routine medical exams. The average time to accurate diagnosis is 2.8 years, resulting in advanced disease for three out of four patients. While incurable, scientific advancements have led to the development of treatments. The development and FDA approval of nine innovative therapies have significantly improved outcomes for pulmonary hypertension patients. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in determining the effectiveness of treatment options, reducing the need for more drastic measures like transplants. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes the Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee to coordinate efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services concerning pulmonary hypertension. The Committee is responsible for developing and updating a summary of advances in medical research and treatment, monitoring Federal activities, and making recommendations to the Secretary. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee is tasked with making recommendations to the Secretary on changes to activities and stakeholder participation. They also develop a strategic plan to improve health outcomes for pulmonary hypertension patients, including recommendations for professional education and transplantation criteria. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee is responsible for making recommendations to improve public awareness, healthcare delivery, and biomedical research for pulmonary hypertension patients. They are also required to submit a strategic plan to Congress and update it as needed. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee includes key officials from various health agencies such as the Health Resources and Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and Food and Drug Administration. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee includes key officials from various health agencies appointed by the Secretary, with at least 6 non-Federal public members, including individuals with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and their caregivers. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee includes non-Federal public members appointed by the Secretary, with at least one member representing a leading organization serving individuals with pulmonary hypertension. The Committee receives administrative support and members serve for 4-year terms, with the possibility of reappointment for additional terms. The Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee meets regularly, with meetings called by the chairperson or Secretary. Meetings are public with time for public input. The Committee can establish subcommittees composed of members to carry out specific duties. SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Secretary, in coordination with the Committee, must submit a biennial progress report to Congress on activities to improve health outcomes for pulmonary hypertension patients. The report will include data on the incidence of pulmonary hypertension, trends since 2013, average time to diagnosis, and the stage of the disease at intervention. The curr_chunk provides information on pulmonary hypertension interventions, outcomes, research breakthroughs, innovative treatments, and support services for patients. It includes data on mortality rates, treatment options, research activities, and diagnostic tools. The Act regarding pulmonary hypertension interventions and support services will end on September 30, 2018, terminating the Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee."
