The \"Underground Gas Storage Safety Act\" mandates the Secretary to establish strong safety standards for underground gas storage facilities within 180 days of enactment, in consultation with relevant federal agencies. These standards must include comprehensive processes, procedures, plans, mitigation measures, and periodic assessments. The \"Underground Gas Storage Safety Act\" requires the Secretary to establish safety standards for all underground gas storage facilities, including periodic assessments, emergency plans, and compliance with recommendations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. States can adopt additional safety standards if needed. The \"Underground Gas Storage Safety Act\" mandates safety standards for intrastate underground gas storage facilities. Until final standards are set, facilities must comply with specific requirements, including following the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1171 for depleted hydrocarbon and aquifer reservoirs. The \"Underground Gas Storage Safety Act\" requires compliance with specific standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, including following the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1170 for solution-mined salt caverns. The \"Underground Gas Storage Safety Act\" mandates adherence to standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, including compliance with Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission guidelines and recommendations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The Secretary may grant variances from these requirements. The Secretary is required to establish a program for underground gas safety research, including grants for improved safety in underground gas storage and the development of a detectable and nontoxic odorant additive for gas. The definition of an underground natural gas storage facility includes storing gas in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifer reservoirs, or solution-mined salt cavern reservoirs. SEC. 3. USER FEES. Amends Section 60301 of title 49, United States Code to include underground gas storage facilities in user fees."
