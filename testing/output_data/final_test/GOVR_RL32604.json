    "content": "Most economic sanctions between the United States and Libya were lifted on September 21, 2004, after the national emergency was ended by the President. However, restrictions remain due to Libya being identified as a state sponsor of international terrorism or not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. These restrictions include the need for a validated license to export certain goods or technology to Libya, prohibition of exporting defense articles and services, denial of non-humanitarian foreign assistance, and opposition to loans or funding from international financial institutions. Additionally, certain contracts for diplomatic security construction by the State Department may not be awarded to Libya. The United States has maintained economic sanctions on Libya since Muammar al-Qadhafi rose to power in 1969. In response to Libya's alliance with the Soviet Union, the US terminated military sales, suspended export licenses, and labeled Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism. Libya's sanctionable activities included military involvement in Lebanon and Chad. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Libya supported revolutionary efforts in various countries, engaged in terrorist activities such as aircraft hijackings and bombings, and provided safe haven to Palestinian terrorists. Libya was also implicated in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 and French UTA flight 772, resulting in numerous casualties. In September 1989, Flight 772 from Niger to Paris was bombed, killing 177 people. In 1992 and 1993, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya for their involvement in the airline bombings. The sanctions were lifted in 2003 after Libya took responsibility and paid a settlement to the victims' families. Libya later admitted to possessing materials for weapons of mass destruction. Libya decided to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and comply with international treaties. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair expressed cautious optimism about lifting sanctions. President Bush announced the removal of economic and diplomatic sanctions on Libya for arms control violations and support of terrorism. This decision was based on Libya meeting the terms required by UN Security Council resolutions after the Lockerbie incident in 1991. Sanctions under the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act were lifted, and restrictions on licensing and transactions were eased. The US also agreed to lift objections to Libya's accession to the World Trade Organization, work towards resuming full diplomatic ties, and pursue further cooperation. On February 23, 2004, the Secretary of State removed restrictions on the use of U.S. passports in, to, or through Libya as a reward for Libya's changed stance on settling complaints and turning away from nuclear weapons pursuit. On June 28, 2004, the State Department announced the opening of a U.S. Liaison Office in Libya's capital to replace the Interests Section in the Embassy of Belgium. President Bush revoked four Executive Orders restricting trade with Libya since 1985, citing Libya's commitment to eliminating weapons of mass destruction programs. The new sanctions imposed on September 10th did not affect Export-Import Bank activities due to Libya's status as a state sponsor of terrorism. Executive Orders issued between 1985 and 1992 imposed various restrictions on trade with Libya, including prohibiting the importation of petroleum products, declaring a national emergency, blocking Libyan property in the US, and banning aircraft from landing or taking off in US airspace. Libya is listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism, making it ineligible for foreign assistance, trade in defense articles, and support in international financial institutions. Export to Libya requires a validated license under the Export Administration Act of 1979, with a presumption of denial for items that could enhance the country's military potential or support terrorism. The Secretary of State must notify Congress in advance of any exports to Libya. The Secretary must notify Congress before issuing any validated license for exports to Libya, a state sponsor of international terrorism. The President can only rescind the Secretary's designation if certain conditions are met, including a certification that the government has not supported terrorism and will not do so in the future. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the Export Administration Act (EAA) contain provisions regarding government-to-government and commercial sales of defense articles and services. Section 40 of the AECA allows Congress to block sanctions rescission, while Section 40(g) permits the President to waive prohibitions for specific transactions deemed essential to national security after consulting with Congress. Prior to the proposed transaction, the President consults with Congress and submits a report detailing the transaction. Section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act prohibits providing defense articles and services to a foreign country not cooperating with US antiterrorism efforts. Libya has been on the country list since 1996. The President can waive Section 40A for specific transactions important to US national interests, potentially lifting economic sanctions on Libya. The Section 6(j) list triggers restrictions on countries supporting terrorism, with the President having waiver authority for national security or humanitarian reasons. The waiver can lift economic sanctions on countries like Libya. The waiver authority for national security or humanitarian reasons may justify a waiver, but it is limited and cannot be used to provide assistance restricted under Section 40 of the AECA. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 restricts exports to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, with limited licenses and restrictions on government financing. The President can waive financing restrictions if it is in the national security interest, as was done for Libya in 2004. The President has the authority to restrict trade or transactions with state supporters of international terrorism under certain laws, including the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945. The President found it in the national interest for the Export-Import Bank to support United States exports to Libya in 2004. The Export-Import Bank funding for Libya is currently blocked under the requirements of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Secretary of the Treasury is mandated to oppose any financial support for countries designated under specific acts. There is no waiver authority for this restriction. The Woods Agreements Act Amendments of 1978 and other related acts prohibit U.S. support for countries supporting international terrorism. Waivers may be granted for national security or humanitarian reasons. Foreign assistance designated for International Organizations and Programs cannot fund efforts in Libya and other countries, except for programs of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Section 507 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006, prohibits direct assistance or reparations to Libya and other countries, with exceptions for certain organizations like the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNICEF. Libya has been on the list of prohibited states since 1982. In FY2006, there were specific allowances for certain activities in Libya by organizations like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import Bank. Despite restrictions on investment in Libya due to its designation as a supporter of international terrorism, the Director of the Office of Foreign Buildings is authorized to establish a contract system for new diplomatic facilities. However, Section 406(c) prohibits any person doing business with Libya from being awarded a contract under this act, with no waiver available. This restriction was enacted following a U.S. national emergency declaration in response to Libya's terrorist activities and the April 1986 Berlin nightclub bombing. Most sanctions on Libya can be lifted if it is removed from the terrorist list or if the President waives the restrictions. Certain assistance programs are exempt from the sanctions, including food aid, health and disease prevention funds, and assistance for human rights improvements. Assistance in these areas can continue despite the sanctions. The current foreign operations appropriations allow for assistance in nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining, and related programs despite economic sanctions. Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the President to provide assistance without regard to certain laws, in furtherance of the act's purposes. The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) authorized the President to impose sanctions on those investing in Libya's oil resources. President Bush lifted restrictions on Libya in 2004 after meeting UN requirements. Section 504 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 also plays a role in foreign assistance. Section 504 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 authorized the President to prohibit imports from, or exports to, Libya. Executive Order 12538 was issued on November 15, 1985, banning the import of petroleum products refined in Libya. The restriction on the use of U.S. passports for travel to or through Libya was in place since 1981 but was removed by the Secretary of State on February 23, 2004. The President has the authority to ban imports from countries supporting terrorism under the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985. While there is no explicit provision for lifting restrictions, it is assumed that the President also has the authority to do so. The application of Section 505 on Libya may have been rescinded, as all other import and export restrictions were lifted."
