YEAR-ROUND PELL GRANTS. Section 401 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) is amended to establish a year-round Pell grant pilot program for up to 200 institutions of higher education. Preference will be given to institutions with high completion and graduation rates for associate's and bachelor's degrees. The year-round Pell grant pilot program allows eligible students to receive two Pell grants in one calendar year, totaling up to 133 percent of the maximum Pell grant amount. This program aims to help students accelerate their progress towards degree or certificate objectives by enrolling in academic programs for 12 months at participating institutions. The year-round Pell grant pilot program offers additional Pell grants to students attending associate's and bachelor's degree-granting institutions meeting specific criteria. For associate's degree-granting institutions, the completion rate must have improved by at least 10 percent over the past 3 years. For bachelor's degree-granting institutions, the graduation rate must be at least a certain level over the past 5 years. The year-round Pell grant pilot program offers additional grants to students at qualifying institutions based on completion and graduation rate criteria. The program will be evaluated by the Secretary and will end on October 1, 2009. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL FIPSE PROGRAM. The purpose of this section is to allow a monitored demonstration program by the Department of Education to improve higher education availability for part-time students, increase access for them, and determine effective assistance. A new program is authorized to create a holistic approach for addressing the needs of part-time students at select institutions. The Department of Education is implementing a program to enhance higher education opportunities for part-time students at specific institutions through grants, leveraging funds, child care, and tailored remedial courses. Eligible entities must submit applications for grants, and the Secretary will establish selection procedures. The Secretary will evaluate the program annually to review the institution's goals, student participation, and potential changes in law to support part-time students in higher education. Increased graduation rates and education improvements are the focus of the program, with separate authorizations of appropriations totaling $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and additional funding for the following five years."
