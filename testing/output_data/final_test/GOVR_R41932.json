    "content": "Concerns about sovereign default risks in developed countries have increased post-2007-2008 financial crisis, especially in some Eurozone countries facing fiscal pressures. US Treasury securities, traditionally seen as risk-free, are now under scrutiny due to growing federal deficits and revenue-outlay imbalances. Standard & Poor's downgraded the US sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA+ in 2011, citing political brinksmanship in debt ceiling negotiations as a factor. Debt ceiling negotiations raised concerns about a potential US default if the debt limit wasn't raised by August 2. Despite the S&P downgrade, Treasuries are still considered a safe haven. Rising federal debt and policymakers' ability to address fiscal challenges could increase borrowing costs and impact capital markets. Some economists believed risks were underestimated before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, with recent analysis highlighting previously underappreciated financial risks. Recent analysis and commentary have emphasized the importance of managing and understanding financial risks, particularly sovereign default risks. Various indicators, including credit default swaps (CDSs), are used by financial analysts to evaluate these risks, which can be influenced by macroeconomic conditions, government policies, and international factors. Sovereign defaults have historically been common, and market prices of CDSs can provide insights into market assessments of default probabilities. The market for U.S. CDSs is small and thinly traded, reducing its reliability as a measure of the federal government's fiscal condition. A credit default swap is a financial contract where one party promises to pay another if a third party defaults, with the U.S. government as the reference entity in the case of sovereign debt. Buyers pay a fee for protection against default, receiving cash settlement if a credit event occurs. Credit default swaps (CDS) involve a payment between the fair market value and par value of an asset in case of a credit event. Recovery values for widely held CDSs are determined through an auction-based procedure by ISDA. CDSs are part of credit derivatives, allowing investors to hedge against or speculate on financial risks. The market for credit derivatives has grown significantly since the mid-1990s, with CDS being a bilateral derivative contract traded in the OTC market. The credit default swap (CDS) market involves transferring the risk of a credit event from one party to another. The protection buyer pays a fee to the seller for compensation if a credit event occurs, such as failure to pay or debt restructuring. In sovereign CDS, like for the United States, there is a grace period of three business days after a missed payment before a credit event is triggered. For CDS payments, the grace period is applicable even if not specified in the debt instrument. A credit rating downgrade of the U.S. does not trigger a credit event in standard CDS contracts. CDS maturity does not have to match the underlying asset's maturity. CDSs act as tradable insurance or put options on debt instruments, with 5-year CDSs being the most traded. CDS markets allow investors to exploit negative information, potentially preventing pricing bubbles in asset markets. Sovereign CDSs offer a way for financial institutions to hedge risks associated with regions or national economies. However, concerns exist that CDS markets could destabilize asset markets or financial institutions. Investors can buy a CDS without owning the underlying debt, becoming eligible for compensation in case of a credit event. Investors can hold a \"naked CDS\" without owning the underlying bond to hedge against financial risks. This is similar to short selling, where a seller profits from a fall in asset prices. Critics argue that heavy buying of CDS protection without owning the bond can fuel market panics and restrict credit availability. Some argue that trading in naked CDSs helps determine more accurate credit protection prices, reflecting actual risks. CDS prices can reveal risk differences, potentially increasing borrowing costs for higher-risk entities but offering investors a hedge. Restrictions on certain information, like genetic testing, can benefit society by maintaining health insurance market viability and spreading costs of rare genetic conditions. Some lawmakers in the United States and European Union have questioned whether trading of naked CDSs could destabilize the market for a country's debt, particularly for distressed sovereign debt like Greece. The European Parliament discussed restrictions on CDSs and short selling, eventually adopting a report calling for short-selling restrictions. On August 11, 2011, several European countries imposed temporary restrictions on short selling of financial stocks. Greece had already imposed restrictions on August 8. The U.S. SEC temporarily banned stock short sales of certain securities in 2008. The SEC banned short selling for stocks in financial institutions in 2008 and also banned short selling for stocks in 799 financial institutions in 2008. Credit default swaps for U.S. Treasury securities emerged, indicating some investors believed in a small default risk. Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating in 2011. The U.S. sovereign credit rating was downgraded from AAA to AA+ in 2011. Despite the downgrade, Treasuries are still seen as a safe haven in financial markets. U.S. CDS prices have risen since 2009, indicating potential risks of a sovereign default. The Economist noted a significant increase in U.S. CDS prices in 2011 due to unresolved debt ceiling discussions in Congress. In 2008, U.S. CDS rates were influenced by events like the failure of IndyMac Bank, Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, and AIG's negotiations for a loan from the Federal Reserve. Prices for five-year CDSs on federal debt are around 55 basis points, similar to Germany and major corporations. The net notional value for U.S. CDSs was $4.6 billion in 2011, costing $25.3 million to insure. The Depository Trust and Clearinghouse Corporation (DTCC) reported 1,004 U.S. CDSs for the week ending July 8, 2011, traded on a small and illiquid market. The number of CDSs on U.S. sovereign debt has grown noticeably since mid-May due to the debt ceiling debate. Legal barriers make it challenging for creditors to sue governments, with sovereign immunity imposing limits on seeking redress through courts. A 1937 Supreme Court decision made it difficult for federal debt holders to seek interest payments as damages, while holders of corporate debt have more recourse through the judicial system. Sovereign and corporate debt restructurings may be treated differently under ISDA protocol for CDS payments, complicating sovereign CDS holders' efforts to compel payment. Sovereigns under severe fiscal stress typically restructure their obligations rather than declare outright default, using changes in laws, taxes, and monetary systems to alter financial obligations. The CDS market for U.S. Treasuries is relatively small and illiquid, with a small number of contracts traded compared to the amount of debt issued. Trading volumes and gross notional values are generally low, with only a few reference entities exceeding $250 million in a typical week. The number of CDS outstanding contracts on U.S. debt is small compared to other sovereigns like Italy and Portugal. The U.S. CDS market is small and illiquid, with only 1,004 contracts totaling $4.6 billion outstanding as of July 8, 2011. Unlike other markets, there are no market makers in the U.S. CDS market, which may reduce liquidity. Some analysts track measures like spreads with German bonds to gauge relative riskiness. The U.S. CDS market is small and illiquid, with limited liquidity due to the absence of market makers. Analysts use measures like spreads with German bonds to assess riskiness. Some ratings agencies evaluate political processes' effectiveness in addressing fiscal challenges. The lack of liquidity may deter financial institutions from offering U.S. CDSs, leading to imprecise calculations of credit event probabilities. Buyers may pay a premium for low-volume contracts, impacting the accuracy of U.S. CDS prices in predicting credit events affecting Treasury securities. Investors holding U.S. CDSs may have different business models than those holding more widely traded sovereign CDSs. The limited supply of U.S. CDSs is due to concerns about major U.S. banks being credible counterparties in the event of a Treasury default. Counterparty risk makes U.S. banks less attractive suppliers of U.S. CDSs. Demand for CDS on emerging market government debt is higher than for Treasuries and most developed countries. Borrowing costs for banks are typically higher than for the U.S. Treasury, but many major banks can borrow more cheaply than some EM governments, making holding Treasuries not a profitable strategy for banks. Banks may find it profitable to borrow and hold emerging market government debt with yields higher than borrowing costs. They can hedge against default risks by holding matching CDSs. Demand for CDSs on EM debt is stronger than for developed-country debt. Capital regulations encourage purchase of CDSs for riskier assets, but provide little incentive for U.S. Treasuries. Large banks under Basel II regulations face risk-based adjustments to asset holdings. During the housing price increase from 2000 to 2007, some banks met capital requirements by buying CDS protection on mortgage-backed securities. Basel II assigns a 0% risk weight to banks' holdings of highly rated sovereign debt. ISDA committees determine credit events for CDS holders, impacting payment timing. A credit event can occur due to various situations like failure to pay, bankruptcy, or restructuring. The recovery rate is the gap between fair market value and par value. If the asset's value is at or above par, the recovery rate is 100%, resulting in no payment to the CDS buyer. The ISDA committee determines credit events for sovereign CDS holders. The ISDA committee determines credit events for sovereign CDS holders based on ISDA documentation. Credit events for U.S. sovereign CDS include failure to pay, repudiation, or debt restructuring, with a three-day grace period for missed payments before triggering a credit event. For CDS purposes, a missed payment triggers a credit event, even without a specified grace period. A credit rating downgrade for US debt does not count as a credit event. ISDA reviews potential credit events for Greek sovereign CDSs and certain types of restructuring may not trigger a credit event. Jean-Claude Juncker mentioned in May 2011 that a \"kind of reprofiling\" of Greek debt could be considered to avoid CDS payments. The European Council announced a voluntary framework to support Greece in July 2011, including austerity measures, bond obligations stretchout, and financial support totaling 109 billion euros. Implementation would require further action by member states and EU institutions. This arrangement was labeled as a \"bailout\" and \"a kind of default\" by a financial journalist. No query has been filed with ISDA to determine if certain types of restructuring would trigger a credit event. As of this writing, no query has been filed with ISDA to determine if the support package for Greece constitutes a credit event. Credit rating agency statements and decisions are not considered credit events for CDS payments. The ISDA definition of restructuring is broader than some credit rating agencies, and an ISDA committee may not declare a credit event even if it affects a security's credit rating. S&P downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA+ in 2011 due to concerns about the fiscal outlook. In 2011, S&P expressed concerns about the federal government's fiscal outlook and cited \"political brinksmanship\" in debt ceiling negotiations as a factor in its decision. Moody's confirmed the federal government's Aaa rating but kept it on \"negative outlook.\" Fitch Ratings also confirmed its AAA rating. S&P made an error in its downgrade announcement, overestimating the federal government's debt accumulation by $2 trillion over the next decade. On April 18, 2011, Standard and Poor's affirmed the U.S. government's AAA rating but expressed concerns about large budget deficits and rising government debt. By July 14, 2011, S&P placed the federal debt rating on negative watch due to budgetary negotiation concerns. CBO criticized the error as \"remarkably sloppy\" and noted that the current-law baseline used for scoring legislation may be overly optimistic about the government's fiscal condition. Standard and Poor's warned that the U.S. government's AAA rating could be at risk if a $4 trillion fiscal consolidation plan is not agreed upon. An analyst criticized the warning, stating that resolving the fiscal imbalances would take a long time. Fitch also announced a negative watch on the U.S. sovereign rating. Fitch announced on June 8, 2011, that the U.S. sovereign rating would be placed on negative watch if the federal government's borrowing ceiling was not raised by August 2. They also mentioned the possibility of a restricted default if a coupon payment was missed on August 15. Moody's and S&P had issued similar warnings, but Fitch was the first to directly suggest a downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities. Moody's later announced a likely review of the U.S. government's Aaa bond rating in mid-July if debt limit negotiations did not progress adequately. On July 13, 2011, Moody's stated it would review the U.S. government's Aaa bond rating due to potential risks. Moody's placed the U.S. government's Aaa bond rating on review due to concerns about the debt limit not being raised in a timely manner. A default, even if brief, could result in a downgrade to the Aa range. Credit rating agencies, including S&P, have faced criticism for their role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Critics argue that rating agencies tend to assign higher ratings to corporate securities than public sector securities, despite lower historical default rates in the public sector. Ratings agencies claim they have adjusted their scales to address these concerns. Credit rating agencies have recalibrated their scales to ensure similar risk characteristics for securities with the same rating. Sovereign credit ratings are more tied to reputational indicators than predictive factors of default. Moody's ratings and Institutional Investor scores were poor predictors of crises. Past optimism does not imply current pessimism about the federal government's fiscal situation. The U.S. Treasury missed a payment on Treasury bills only once in 1979. In 1979, the U.S. Treasury missed a payment of $122 million on Treasury bills, leading to a class action lawsuit by small investors. The case was dismissed in 1980, and a compensation measure introduced by Representative Gephardt was not enacted. In the 1930s, the United States and other countries left the gold standard, which some economists view as a de facto sovereign default. The Supreme Court's 1935 ruling in Perry v. United States allowed Congress to adjust repayment conditions on bonds from gold to legal tender. In the early 1840s, several state governments defaulted on debts due to economic downturns after investing in infrastructure projects like canals and turnpikes. In the 1840s, states struggled to pay bond debts, some southern states repudiated debts after the Civil War, and others defaulted post-Panic of 1873. Sovereign defaults have occurred historically, with markets like CDSs providing insight on event probabilities. Market prices convey economic signals, but predictions from engineered markets may not always be accurate. Default probabilities can be inferred from CDS prices under technical assumptions, but reliability may be low due to market conditions like thin trading and large bid-ask spreads. CDS prices on U.S. Treasuries may not accurately reflect actual sovereign default risks. In thin markets, traders with strong information but weak financial backing may struggle to turn insights into profits. Seeking financing can lead to conflicts between revealing information for credibility and maintaining a trading advantage. This may deter some traders, hindering information flow. CDS prices on firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers can react sharply before bankruptcies, serving as indicators of credit events. However, CDSs likely offer a more reliable indicator of sovereign default risks. Sovereign CDSs are a more reliable indicator of default risks for countries with actively traded CDSs. Markets for countries like Greece and Portugal facing fiscal challenges are more informative. CDS markets are more active for Eurozone countries like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, as well as Spain and Italy due to Eurozone fiscal pressures. Emerging market government debt CDS markets are typically more active than those for developed countries. The CDS market for U.S. CDSs is illiquid and thinly traded, with the one-year CDS spread for the United States higher than Brazil. Concerns about the debt ceiling have led to rising costs of insuring U.S. debt against default. Italy has the largest net CDS notional value outstanding. Italy has the largest net CDS notional value outstanding at $23.8 billion, followed by France, Spain, Brazil, and Germany. The United States has a lower total CDS notional value outstanding at $4.6 billion. Trading in sovereign CDSs on Eurozone countries has been heavier than in the U.S. despite the U.S. having a higher total debt amount. The U.S. has a lower total CDS notional value outstanding compared to Eurozone countries, despite having a higher total debt amount. Italy had the heaviest CDS trading volume, while the U.S. had fewer CDS contracts traded. Trading in CDS contracts remains small compared to other markets like foreign exchange swaps or interest rate swaps. The introduction of the euro in the Eurozone aimed to deepen ties among European countries through a common monetary policy controlled by the European Central Bank. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was established to prevent member states from having overly expansionary fiscal policies, but many countries have exceeded the set deficit and debt levels. The 2007-2008 financial crisis had a strong impact on public finances in many advanced economies, leading to deficits reaching over 7% of GDP in 2010. European countries, like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, face long-term fiscal challenges due to high levels of public debt and weak economic growth prospects. The Eurozone countries are facing high public debt and weak economic growth, receiving financial support to avoid default. Concerns about fiscal contagion exist, especially with larger economies like Italy and Spain experiencing selling of stocks and bonds. Differences in the market for U.S. CDSs compared to Greece and other EU countries under fiscal pressure are noted by economists. The U.S. has low CDSs on its debt compared to other countries. The U.S. dollar's reserve currency status allows for additional seignorage. U.S. debt in dollars gives control over supply, potentially leading to higher inflation rates. Inflation could reduce the real value of debt but also increase government expenses. The U.S. has low CDSs on its debt compared to other countries, and the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status allows for additional seignorage. Despite the upward trend in U.S. CDS prices, U.S. Treasury yields remain low due to its \"safe haven\" status. The Federal Reserve has a more accommodating monetary policy than the European Central Bank. The U.S. faces long-term fiscal challenges, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 to raise the debt limit and reduce costs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted on August 2, 2011, to raise the debt limit and reduce deficits. Market concerns focused on debt limit constraints facing the U.S. Treasury, leading to increased demand for shorter-term securities. U.S. CDS prices rose before the act but fell after its passage, trading at about 55 bps in mid August 2011. U.S. CDSs have been trading in the same price range as Germany's, but far below CDS prices for Greece, Portugal, and Ireland. Prices for Treasuries suggest that financial markets still view federal debt instruments as a safe haven despite the S&P downgrade. After the Budget Control Act was enacted, there was a shift in Treasury price trends, with shorter maturity Treasury yields increasing slightly while longer maturity yields fell. Market participants remain concerned about the U.S. government's long-term fiscal challenges. The U.S. government is facing fiscal challenges that are considered unsustainable by various agencies and experts. Discussions about the debt limit have raised concerns among credit rating agencies. Measures are needed to align spending and revenues to protect the government's credit in the long term."
