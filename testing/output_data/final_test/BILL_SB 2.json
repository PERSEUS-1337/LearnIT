    "title": "SB 2",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the valuable service provided by congressionally chartered veterans' organizations since 1899. These organizations help preserve memories of past conflicts, promote comradeship among members, and provide safe havens for veterans and their families to gather, share stories, and seek support. This contributes to the healing process and ensures the well-being of returning veterans. The United States Internal Revenue Service granted special tax exemption to veterans' organizations under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code. This exemption applies to posts or organizations of war veterans, their auxiliary units, trusts, or foundations that engage in various programs for the benefit of veterans and their families. Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts buildings and real property used exclusively for charitable purposes by veterans' organizations chartered by Congress. The Chief Counsel of the State Board of Equalization determined that only certain parts of American Legion halls are exempt from property taxation. The State Board of Equalization's 1994 memorandum clarified that only specific areas of veterans' organizations' buildings are eligible for tax exemptions, hindering their ability to provide facilities for veterans and threatening their economic viability. The charitable activities of veteran service organizations require facilities for various programs such as counseling, memorial services, religious gatherings, and social events for members. These activities necessitate spaces that can accommodate different group sizes, from small gatherings to events with hundreds of attendees. The State Board of Equalization's interpretation of the Revenue and Taxation Code lacks understanding of veterans service organizations' purpose and programs, harming their support for the veteran community. Section 215.1 of the Code is amended. Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to exempt buildings and real property used exclusively for charitable purposes by veterans' organizations chartered by Congress and exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code. The exemption in this section applies to organizations meeting specific requirements and shall not be denied based on fraternal, lodge, or social club use. The Legislature acknowledges this exemption for property used for charitable purposes by veterans' organizations. The Legislature recognizes that veterans' organizations have unique exempt activities focused on honoring deceased veterans, conducting charitable programs, and promoting patriotic activities. The use of real property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is essential to their exempt purposes and activities. The use of real property by veterans' organizations for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is considered exclusive charitable use under California Constitution. The exemption does not apply to areas serving alcoholic beverages. Organizations must file a claim with a valid certificate. This exemption is known as the \"veterans' organization exemption.\" The \"veterans' organization exemption\" is established by this act, which provides for a tax levy and immediate effect without state reimbursement for lost property tax revenues by local agencies."
