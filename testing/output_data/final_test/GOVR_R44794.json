    "content": "Prior to the FSLMRS, federal employees could engage in collective bargaining under Executive Orders 10988 and 11491. These orders granted rights to form employee organizations, establish negotiation agreements, and prohibited unfair labor practices. The FSLMRS, enacted in 1978, recognized the right to collective bargaining for federal employees. It established the FLRA to oversee union elections, handle unfair labor practice complaints, and determine the negotiability of bargaining proposals. Once a union is elected as the exclusive representative through a majority vote, it represents all employees in the bargaining unit, even non-members. In 2016, 27.4% of federal employees were union members, higher than the 6.4% rate for private-sector employees. Federal employees cannot strike and some agencies are excluded from the FSLMRS. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants collective bargaining rights to certain agencies like GAO, but not to others like FBI, CIA, NSA, TVA, FLRA, FSIP, Secret Service, and Secret Service Uniformed Division. The President can exclude agencies involved in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work from FSLMRS coverage. The FSLMRS grants collective bargaining rights to certain agencies, excluding others like the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Employees have the right to form or join labor organizations without fear of penalty. Collective bargaining covers conditions of employment broadly, but not matters specifically provided for by federal statute. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants collective bargaining rights to certain agencies, excluding others like the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Employees have the right to form or join labor organizations without fear of penalty. Collective bargaining covers conditions of employment broadly, but not matters specifically provided for by federal statute. The scope of the duty to bargain is subject to important limitations, notably those matters that are provided for by federal law. Management rights identified by the FSLMRS are generally not negotiable, except for procedures to implement agency proposals. Non-negotiable aspects include the agency's mission, budget, organization, number of employees, internal security practices, and actions related to hiring, assigning, directing, laying off, retaining, suspending, removing, reducing in grade or pay, or taking disciplinary action against employees. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants collective bargaining rights to certain agencies, excluding others like the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Management rights identified by the FSLMRS are generally not negotiable, except for procedures to implement agency proposals. Section 7106(a) ensures that the collective bargaining system does not undermine government effectiveness through unwarranted intrusion on management prerogatives. Section 7106(b) allows negotiation on procedures which management officials will observe. The FSLMRS and subsections aim to establish a balance between management's substantive rights and negotiable procedures. In a case, a bargaining proposal addressing management changes was deemed negotiable as it did not prevent management from taking action. In a case involving the Dep't of Defense, the court upheld the proposal as not preventing management from acting at all, as it only required the use of existing review procedures. The court emphasized that management's authority under section 7106(a) could be limited by procedures under section 7106(b) as long as they did not eliminate management authority. Additionally, the court ruled that job assignment proposals based on seniority were not negotiable as they were considered substantive matters. The court upheld the proposal involving the Dep't of Defense, stating it did not prevent management from acting and only required the use of existing review procedures. Job assignment proposals based on seniority were deemed non-negotiable as they were considered substantive matters that directly interfered with the agency's discretion in assigning work. The D.C. Circuit distinguished between procedural and substantive proposals, with substantive ones directly impacting how work is performed. The D.C. Circuit distinguishes between procedural and substantive proposals, with the \"acting at all\" standard used to evaluate agency proposals involving management procedures under section 7106(a). The court emphasized the importance of specifying criteria for decision-making and highlighted that procedural proposals do not directly interfere with agency actions. The D.C. Circuit distinguishes between procedural and substantive proposals, with the \"acting at all\" standard used to evaluate agency proposals involving management procedures under section 7106(a). In a case, the court found that a proposal allowing union participation in decision-making directly interfered with management's rights. Section 7121(a)(1) of the FSLMRS requires collective bargaining agreements to include grievance settlement procedures. A grievance includes complaints related to employment, collective bargaining agreements, and laws affecting conditions of employment. However, certain issues like violations of specific laws, retirement, and health insurance grievances cannot be resolved through a negotiated grievance procedure. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) requires a negotiated grievance procedure for resolving grievances that are not satisfactorily resolved. This procedure allows for binding arbitration and may offer advantages to employees, as the arbitrator is selected by both the agency and the union. Most arbitration awards can be reviewed by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) under section 7122(a) of the FSLMRS. The FLRA can review awards for deficiencies, taking necessary action if needed. Its decisions are not subject to judicial review unless involving unfair labor practices. Prohibitions under Section 7116 of the FSLMRS include agencies discriminating against union membership and unions coercing employees. The FLRA investigates unfair labor practice charges and may issue a complaint if necessary. If no settlement is reached, an Administrative Law Judge conducts a hearing to determine the facts. The General Counsel must prove the allegations by a preponderance of evidence. The ALJ prepares a written decision after a hearing, including findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommended order. The decision can be reviewed by the FLRA, and if not reviewed, becomes the agency's final decision. Violators of unfair labor practices may be ordered to cease misconduct, with possible reinstatement and back pay. Judicial review of FLRA orders can be sought in the U.S. court of appeals or the D.C. Circuit. The FSLMRS grants official time for union representation in collective bargaining agreements. Section 7131(d) of the FSLMRS allows negotiation of additional official time beyond assigned government duties, limiting management's ability to assign work. The FLRA has interpreted this section to require negotiation of official time proposals for labor-management activities. This exception to management's right to assign work allows for negotiation of official time provisions. The FLRA has identified various activities for which official time may be used, including resolving employee grievances, participating in grievance procedures, attending meetings, and discussing contract administration. Other activities related to labor-management may also qualify for official time. The FLRA found negotiable a proposal involving official time for employees who serve as union representatives and respond to media inquiries about matters affecting the bargaining unit's conditions of employment. Additionally, the FLRA concluded that official time may be negotiated for employees to lobby elected officials in support of or opposition to legislation that could affect their working conditions, citing the FSLMRS provision allowing employees to present the views of the union to Congress. The FLRA allows official time for union representatives to lobby on employment-related matters. In AFGE Council of Locals 214 v. FLRA, the D.C. Circuit ruled that employees could spend 100% of their time on union functions, negotiable at the agency's discretion. The D.C. Circuit ruled that the FLRA's interpretation of the FSLMRS failed to give effect to section 7131(d), requiring agencies to negotiate official time proposals with unions. The court emphasized that agencies are not obligated to abandon their best interests during negotiations, but there are limits to what can be considered official time, as seen in AFGE Local 2761 where a proposal allowing union representatives to attend employee funerals was deemed non-negotiable. The FLRA ruled that a proposal allowing union representatives to attend employee funerals was non-negotiable. OPM began requiring federal agencies to report official time hours used by employees. OPM's most recent report was published in 2014, with plans to issue future reports biannually. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to require OPM to submit official time reports. Two bills introduced in the 115th Congress regarding official time: H.R. 1293 requires OPM to report total official time granted, activities, and compensation; H.R. 1364 prohibits official time for lobbying activities. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered two bills in the 115th Congress regarding official time to be reported in March 2017. H.R. 1293 requires OPM to report total official time granted, activities, and compensation, while H.R. 1364 prohibits official time for lobbying activities. Additionally, the bills aim to prevent official time, in excess of 365 days, from being counted towards an employee's retirement benefits."
