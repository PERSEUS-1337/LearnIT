    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"MediFair Act of 2008\". Congress finds that regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement create barriers to care for seniors and the disabled, penalize states with cost-effective healthcare systems, and result in significant cost differences and varying levels of care for beneficiaries based on location. Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have created disparities in access to benefits and cost sharing for beneficiaries based on where they live. This has also given an unfair advantage to healthcare providers in states with higher reimbursement rates, allowing them to offer better salaries in a competitive market. These inequities are not limited to rural versus urban areas, affecting many states with large urban populations. Many states with large urban centers have below-average per beneficiary costs, indicating a regional disparity in Medicare reimbursement. Improving fairness of payments to providers under the Medicare fee-for-service program by amending Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to address payment equity. The Secretary is required to establish a system for adjusting payment amounts to entities and individuals for Medicare services under parts A and B. If a state's average payment per beneficiary is below the national average, the Secretary will increase payments to ensure parity. The Secretary will adjust payments to states with average per beneficiary amounts above the national average to maintain budget neutrality and quality care. The Secretary will adjust payments to states with average per beneficiary amounts above the national average to maintain budget neutrality and quality care, with limitations on reducing payments to states with higher average amounts. The Secretary determines State average per beneficiary amounts annually based on Medicare fee-for-service expenditures to improve beneficiary access to quality care. The Secretary annually determines the national average per beneficiary amount based on State average per beneficiary amounts for Medicare fee-for-service expenditures under parts A and B. The term 'applicable payments' refers to payments made for items and services provided to beneficiaries residing in the State. The Secretary will promulgate regulations in consultation with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to carry out the provisions of this section, with special consideration given to rural areas. This section does not affect a beneficiary's entitlement to items and services under Medicare, including liability for such items and services. MEDPAC will develop recommendations on policies to promote healthy outcomes and quality care in states with reduced Medicare payments. Recommendations on efficient use of Medicare payments will also be submitted to Congress within 9 months of the Act's enactment."
