    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific-facing nations, pending congressional approval. It aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, potentially benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber, such as wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton, almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts, contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income. This positive impact extends to rural communities, farm input industries, commodity processors, and food manufacturers. Rising farm productivity, market-oriented U.S. farm policies, and the potential for competing in developing countries' food markets drive negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade. Negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade among TPP countries have garnered interest from U.S. agriculture and food industry. TPP countries account for a significant portion of U.S. agricultural exports and imports. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, enhancing competitiveness. The deal also provides TPP partners with greater access to U.S. product markets, potentially increasing competition. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the TPP agreement on the U.S. economy, including agriculture and food sectors. Four key considerations for U.S. food and agriculture are highlighted, along with projected effects of TPP implementation. The agreement also includes changes in market access for agricultural products and provisions beyond market access. The TPP agreement includes provisions beyond market access that are of interest to stakeholders in food and agriculture. The United States lacks FTAs with five TPP countries, including Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, which offer potential for boosting U.S. farm and food exports through lower tariffs. These countries impose higher agricultural tariffs than the U.S., providing an advantage for American exports. The TPP agreement presents opportunities for U.S. farm and food exports as agricultural tariffs are higher in Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia compared to the United States. Japan, with its protected markets and high GDP per capita, is a key market, while Vietnam offers future growth potential. The TPP agreement provides growth opportunities for U.S. farm and food exports by lowering tariffs in Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. However, concerns arise over potential competition in markets like Mexico for products such as rice. Key export expansion opportunities for beef, pork, and dairy products are to be phased in over years or decades in countries like Japan, Canada, and Vietnam. Safeguard measures in certain countries like Japan and the United States allow for additional tariffs if imports exceed specified thresholds. Failure to implement the TPP agreement could give U.S. agricultural export competitors an edge, as seen with Australia's preferential tariff rates. The TPP aims to level the playing field for U.S. beef exports to Japan, aligning them with Australia's preferential tariff rates. The EU is also negotiating FTAs with key markets, potentially impacting its competitive position. The agreement does not address domestic subsidy regimes, a focus of multilateral trade negotiations under the WTO. The impact of Brexit on these negotiations remains uncertain. The TPP aims to provide significant benefits for U.S. agriculture by eliminating tariffs and expanding markets. A report by the ITC projected that in year 15 (2032) with TPP, U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion (2.6%), while agricultural imports would rise by $2.7 billion (1.5%). Other effects include a $10 billion gain (0.5%) in U.S. agricultural output and a 0.5% increase in agricultural employment. U.S. dairy product exports would also see a significant increase. The TPP aims to benefit U.S. agriculture by eliminating tariffs and expanding markets. A report projected that with TPP, U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion, with gains in dairy products, processed foods, and beef. Imports of processed foods, beef, and dairy products would also increase. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports TPP, stating it would boost U.S. agriculture. The TPP agreement is projected to boost U.S. farm income by $4.4 billion annually compared to a scenario without TPP. Stakeholders in the food and agriculture industry have varied views on TPP. The agreement would impact market access for various agricultural commodities, including beef. Japan is the largest export market for U.S. beef. Under the TPP agreement, Japan would reduce tariffs on beef from 38.5% to 27.5% in year one, with further reductions to 9% by year 16. A safeguard duty would be applied if imports exceed specified quantities, gradually decreasing each year. Japan would also lower tariffs on other beef products, while the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on beef and beef products within 15 years. Japan and Vietnam are making changes to their tariffs on pork and poultry products under the TPP agreement. Japan will reduce its tariff on pork cuts immediately and phase out the residual over nine years. Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on pork and pork products within 10 years. Canada will allow incremental increases in access to its poultry and egg markets over five years. Canada will allow incremental increases in access to its highly protected poultry and egg markets over five years via new duty-free, TPP-wide TRQs. Vietnamese tariffs on poultry will be eliminated within 13 years, while U.S. tariffs on poultry will be eliminated within 10 years. Opening dairy markets to greater import competition was a challenging issue to resolve, with Canada allowing incremental additional access to its highly protected dairy product markets. Canada and other TPP countries will increase access to dairy markets through phased-in TRQs over several years. This will include duty-free entry for in-quota dairy products, with Canada eliminating its over-quota tariff on whey powder. Japan will also reduce tariffs on cheese and whey imports over time. The US will establish TRQs for dairy products from Australia and New Zealand, gradually phasing out tariffs and providing perpetual access for Australian dairy products. Under the U.S.-Australia FTA, products would be transferred to perpetual TRQs. New U.S. TRQs for Canadian dairy products would increase gradually each year until year 19, plateauing at that point. The individual TRQs provided for Canadian dairy products include various items such as cheese, milk powder, yogurt, and butter. Japan would establish a new CSQ for U.S. corn and potato starch, increasing over time, while Vietnam and Malaysia would reduce tariffs on corn products. Under the U.S.-Australia FTA, products would be transferred to perpetual TRQs. New U.S. TRQs for Canadian dairy products would increase gradually each year until year 19, plateauing at that point. Japan would establish a new CSQ for U.S. corn and potato starch, increasing over time, while Vietnam and Malaysia would reduce tariffs on corn products. Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on soybeans and soybean products, as well as wheat and wheat products, over varying timeframes. Japan would establish a new duty-free quota for U.S. wheat and processed wheat products, with gradual increases over time. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on wheat and barley products, with varying timelines for tariff reduction. Japan would establish a new TPP-wide TRQ for barley of 25,000 metric tons expanding to 65,000 tons over nine years, with a reduction in maximum markup from 7.6 yen to 4.4 yen. Japan would also eliminate its tariff on feed barley and create duty-free quotas for U.S. unroasted and roasted malt. Additionally, Japan would establish a duty-free quota for U.S. rice starting at 50,000 tons and rising to 70,000 tons in year 13. Japan would eliminate tariffs on cotton, ranging up to 10%, within four years. U.S. tariffs on cotton products, up to $0.314 per kg, would be phased out within 10 years. Japan would also immediately remove tariffs on certain tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, and pecans. In the context of trade agreements, tariffs on dried nuts and citrus fruits are being negotiated. The tariffs on almonds, walnuts, and pecans would be reduced or eliminated over a period of time. Japan would also reduce tariffs on oranges over a span of six to eight years. The trade agreement includes reducing tariffs on citrus fruits and non-citrus fruits over a period of time. Tariffs on grapefruit, orange juice, and grapefruit juice would be phased out in six to eight years, while tariffs on fresh apples, cherries, grapes, and other fruits would be eliminated immediately or gradually over the next five to ten years. The trade agreement involves immediate elimination of tariffs on various fruits like plums, strawberries, raspberries, cranberries, kiwifruit, avocados, grapes, apples, raisins, cherries, apricots, mangoes, papayas, peaches, pears, and sugar. The United States would also expand access to its sugar market with new quotas for sugar and sugar-containing products. Australia and Canada would receive new duty-free quotas for sugar as well. The trade agreement includes duty-free quotas for sugar, with potential expansion for Australian and Canadian TRQs. Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam would split the remaining quotas. Japan would provide new TRQs for sugar and sweetener-related products, eliminating tariffs on various sweetener products over time. U.S. tariffs on tobacco would be eliminated within 10 years, while Japan would eliminate tariffs on tobacco as well. The trade agreement involves the elimination of tariffs on tobacco products over varying periods for different countries. Vietnam would implement a TRQ for unmanufactured tobacco imports, gradually increasing annually. There is a controversy over excluding tobacco product manufacturers from ISDS protections for claims related to tobacco control measures. The TPP agreement includes provisions for tariff elimination on various food and agricultural products, with a timetable provided in Table 1. It also addresses trade measures beyond tariffs and TRQs, such as sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. The agreement may impact sales of leaf tobacco, but the optional exclusion does not apply to it. The TPP agreement includes provisions for tariff elimination on food and agricultural products, with criteria for determining TPP origin and eligibility for preferential tariff rates. Key elements in the agreement for U.S. agriculture include provisions on SPS, TBT, and biotechnology. The TPP agreement outlines criteria for determining TPP origin of goods, including animals and agricultural products. A de minimis provision allows for goods to be considered of TPP origin if non-TPP content does not exceed 10% of the value. Exceptions to this rule include certain agricultural goods like dairy products and edible oil-bearing crops of non-TPP origin. The TPP agreement addresses non-tariff barriers to trade, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) for food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. The SPS obligations in TPP go beyond the WTO SPS agreement in areas such as risk assessment, transparency, and rapid response to issues. The TPP agreement includes commitments on sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) for food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. It establishes an SPS committee, requires measures to be based on international standards or scientific evidence, and allows for public comment on SPS measures. Rapid notification of import restrictions is also mandated, with disputes to be resolved through technical consultations before turning to dispute resolution mechanisms. The TPP agreement includes commitments on sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) for food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. It establishes an SPS committee, requires measures to be based on international standards or scientific evidence, and allows for public comment on SPS measures. If technical consultations fail to resolve issues, parties can resort to dispute settlement procedures. The agreement promotes transparency and notification of national laws on agricultural biotechnology products, encourages information sharing on low-level presence of biotech material, and requires importers and exporters to exchange information to minimize trade disruptions. A working group on agricultural biotechnology is established within the TPP Committee on Agricultural Trade for exchanging information on trade-related laws, regulations, and policies. The agreement includes information on national laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade in biotech products. Parties are not obligated to change existing laws. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect products from specific regions, like Parmesan cheese and Champagne. GIs can provide relief from infringement and unfair competition. GIs are controversial in international trade. The TPP agreement includes provisions on Geographical Indications (GIs), which protect products from specific regions. GIs can be controversial in international trade, as some consider them protected international property while others see them as generic names. For example, \"feta\" is a protected GI in the EU but considered generic in the US, leading to restrictions on its use. The agreement obligates members to recognize GIs and provides a process for objections and cancellation of GI protection. The TPP agreement includes provisions on Geographical Indications (GIs) to protect products from specific regions. Reasons for opposing a GI include confusion with trademarks, pending applications, or if the GI is the customary term in a country's language. TPP members are not required to recognize a GI if it's identical to a grape variety's name in their territory. Criteria for determining a customary common name include usage in dictionaries, newspapers, websites, and trade references. Members are to make GIs protection available as per other international agreements involving TPP members. The TPP agreement requires members to provide information on GIs in other agreements and allow comments on their recognition. Export subsidies are to be eliminated, setting a standard for future reform. Cooperation on export credits, guarantees, and insurance programs is also encouraged. The TPP agreement encourages cooperation to develop multilateral disciplines and discourages restrictions on food and agricultural exports. It limits restrictions to 6 months and requires consultation for restrictions over 12 months. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) include regulations and standards affecting goods trade. The TBT chapter includes annexes relevant to food and agriculture, such as parameters for labeling wines and distilled spirits. The TPP agreement sets guidelines for labeling wines and distilled spirits, including permitted information and terms that cannot be excluded. It also addresses proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and food additives, emphasizing the protection of commercial interests. Additionally, it encourages the exchange of rules and regulations for organic products among TPP members. The TPP agreement encourages the exchange of information on organic production and certification among members. It also urges members to consider requests for recognition or equivalence of standards. Various food and agricultural organizations have expressed their support for the TPP agreement. Several food and agricultural organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Soybean Association, and others, have expressed support for the TPP agreement. Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees also provided input to key stakeholders on the completed agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables endorsed the TPP as positive for growers, packers, and marketers. Members included representatives from various agricultural associations. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners also expressed unanimous support for the TPP agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised aspects of the TPP agreement but did not endorse it outright. Criticisms included lack of meaningful market access for dairy products and a product-specific exception for tobacco. Opponents of TPP include various agricultural associations and unions like the UFCW. The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised some aspects of the TPP agreement but did not fully endorse it. Criticisms included lack of market access for dairy products and a tobacco exception. The agreement was signed by trade ministers from 12 countries on February 4, 2016, but Congress needs to pass implementing legislation for it to take effect. The agreement is faulted for lacking an enforcement mechanism against currency manipulation, which could lead to job losses in the US. USA Rice has not taken a clear stance on the TPP agreement. Following the introduction of implementing legislation, Congress would have up to 90 days to take an up or down vote on the bill without amendments."
