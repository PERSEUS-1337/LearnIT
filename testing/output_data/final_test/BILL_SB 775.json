    "title": "SB 775",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1947.8 of the Civil Code is amended to establish permissible rent levels for registered rental units under an ordinance or charter controlling residential rental prices and requiring rent registration by local agencies. The ordinance, charter, or regulation must establish and certify permissible rent levels by specific deadlines. No action can be taken against property owners for excess rent if certification is not completed, unless delays are caused by the owner or court proceedings. The local agency must establish and certify permissible rent levels within a year of adopting the ordinance, charter, or regulation. Landlords and tenants can request a certificate reflecting the permissible rent levels, which can be appealed. The determination of permissible rent levels is binding unless there is intentional misrepresentation or fraud. The determination of permissible rent levels is binding and conclusive upon the local agency unless being appealed. After establishing permissible rent levels, the local agency must provide a certificate to the landlord and tenant upon request. The certificate is issued within five business days and is binding unless appealed within 15 days. The local agency must notify the landlord and tenant of its decision within 60 days of the appeal being filed. The local agency may charge a fee to cover costs for issuing a certificate. The absence of rent certification does not affect legal proceedings or property transactions. The record of rent levels is public under the California Public Records Act. Notices of rents given to comply with regulations are not considered rent registrations. The term \"local agency\" refers to the public entity responsible for implementing the ordinance. This section does not give any new power to control rental prices, except as specified. On January 1, 2016, new regulations apply to tenancies starting from January 1, 1999. Property owners can establish initial rent under specific guidelines. If the initial rent is provided to the local agency in writing, there is a presumption of correctness. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
