    "content": "A variety of computer vision tasks can be seen as non-linear optimization problems, traditionally solved using numerical optimization like Gauss-Newton. Recent research has explored using deep neural networks with residual connections to mimic Gauss-Newton steps. A new residual block inspired by Newton's method in numerical optimization shows faster convergence. The Newton-ResNet is evaluated on image and speech classification as well as image generation across 4 datasets. Experiments on image and speech classification and image generation using 4 datasets show that Newton-ResNet requires fewer parameters for the same performance as the original ResNet. Various computer vision problems are framed as nonlinear optimization problems, historically tackled with numerical optimization methods like Gauss-Newton. Recently, the idea of learning descent directions for nonlinear least square problems through cascade regression has emerged, combining deep learning with traditional optimization approaches. In this paper, the authors explore extending residual learning by incorporating ideas from Newton's numerical optimization method to improve convergence rates. ResNet, a popular architecture for learning non-linear functions, utilizes residual blocks as linear difference equations. The study shows that Newton-ResNet requires fewer parameters than the original ResNet while maintaining performance in image and speech classification tasks. The authors propose a novel residual block in Newton-ResNet that utilizes second-order information to accelerate convergence in approximating non-linear functions. This approach requires fewer residual blocks compared to original ResNet, as shown in Fig. 1. The authors introduce a novel residual block in Newton-ResNet that utilizes second-order information to accelerate convergence in approximating non-linear functions. This approach requires fewer blocks compared to the original ResNet, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Newton-ResNet in image generation without activation functions. Research focuses on theoretical understanding, alternative architectures, and modifications of the transformation path in ResNets. Studies show that deep linear residual networks have no spurious local optima, and networks with residual connections outperform those without. The authors focus on reducing the number of residual blocks required in deep learning. They propose a framework that generalizes both residual and dense connections, experimenting with large scale problems and linear blocks. Their work offers a new perspective on higher order correlations compared to previous studies. The authors explore different modifications to the transformation path in residual networks, such as group convolutions, nested residual blocks, and increased block width. These approaches are complementary to their framework, which focuses on reducing the number of parameters by not modifying the transformation path modules. Residual networks have various applications like object detection, face recognition, and generative models, but typically have many residual blocks. Pruning the network is a research direction to reduce the number of parameters. The authors explore modifications to the transformation path in residual networks to reduce parameters. Pruning the network is a research direction to decrease parameters, but it lacks solid theoretical understanding. The study delves into linear residual blocks and extends the formulation with activation functions commonly used in ResNet. The residual block introduced by He et al. (2016) consists of a transformation path with operations denoted by C and a shortcut path. It allows the input representation to pass through unchanged by introducing a two-pathway block. This innovation enables a composition of linear layers in neural networks to include a shortcut path and a transformation path for each layer. The proposed new residual block captures second order information by introducing a scalar parameter \u03b1 for scaling the significance of interactions. Parameters of S and C can be shared to reduce the number of parameters, with normalization operators N1 and N2 included in the quadratic term. Activation functions and two convolutions are used in conjunction with the residual block for the transformation path. The proposed residual block introduces a scalar parameter \u03b1 for capturing second order information in the transformation path. Activation functions and convolutions are used with the residual block. Implementation details remain the same as in the original ResNet, with experiments conducted 5 times on four datasets. The datasets used in this work include CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, and Speech Commands. CIFAR10 contains 60,000 images classified into 10 classes, CIFAR100 has 100 classes, ImageNet has 1.28 million training images from 1000 classes, and Speech Commands has 60,000 audio files with 35 different words. In this study, various experiments were conducted on image classification using CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets. The experiments included modifying activation functions, utilizing ResNet architectures, and training models for 120 epochs with batch size 128. Additionally, a residual block was proposed for image generation, and an experiment on audio classification was also performed. Newton-ResNet, a model built with proposed residual blocks, outperforms ResNet18 by a significant margin when removing activation functions. It has 40% fewer parameters than the respective baseline models. Test accuracy for ResNet18 and Newton-ResNet are similar throughout training, as shown in Fig. 3. Similar results are observed for ResNet34 in Fig. 6. Newton-ResNet outperforms ResNet18 significantly without activation functions, with a 7% performance difference. The proposed method includes x_proj and lin_proj convolutions for normalization. Test accuracy on CIFAR100 shows similar results for ResNet34 and Newton-ResNet, with the latter having 44% fewer parameters. The experiment with linear blocks on CIFAR100 also removes activation functions for training. On CIFAR100, ResNet performs poorly without activation functions, being outperformed by Newton-ResNet. A large-scale ImageNet classification experiment is conducted with data augmentation techniques. Models are trained on a DGX station with Mxnet 4. The models are trained on a DGX station with four Tesla V100 GPUs using Mxnet 4 and float16 for acceleration and reduced GPU memory consumption. Optimization is done with SGD, momentum 0.9, weight decay 1e\u00b44, and a mini-batch size of 1024. The learning rate is initially set to 0.4 and decreased at specific epochs. Models are trained for 90 epochs with a linear warm-up of the learning rate. For different batch sizes, the learning rate is scaled accordingly. Top-1 and Top-5 results are reported. Newton-ResNet50 outperforms ResNet50 with a Top-5 validation error of 6.358%, approaching ResNet101's performance. The proposed method shows favorable results compared to the baseline ResNet in terms of loss and error. Removing \"relu\" activation functions further improves Newton-ResNet50's performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have dominated the literature with impressive visual results. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, both implemented with resnet-based neural networks. The generator samples from a prior distribution and models the target distribution, while the discriminator distinguishes between synthesized samples. The study explores reducing the number of residual blocks in generative models to improve performance. The study explores reducing the number of residual blocks in generative models to improve performance. The architecture of Miyato et al. (2018) (SNGAN) is used as a baseline on CIFAR10, with 3 resnet blocks in both the generator and discriminator. By replacing the original blocks with proposed ones, the same performance is achieved with fewer blocks. Experimental results show similar visual samples between the two methods, with Newton-ResNet having 38% fewer blocks but the same accuracy. In this work, a novel residual block called Newton-ResNet is proposed, which uses second order interactions similar to Newton's numerical optimization method. This allows for faster convergence compared to first order methods like Gauss-Newton. Experimental results show that Newton-ResNet achieves the same accuracy as traditional ResNet models but with 38% fewer parameters. This reduction in residual blocks translates to less decent directions in the network while maintaining performance in image and audio classification tasks. Experiments on image and audio classification with residual networks show competitive performance even without non-linear activation functions."
