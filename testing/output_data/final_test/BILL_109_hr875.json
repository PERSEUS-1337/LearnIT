A taxpayer can deduct the cost of a qualifying security device as an expense in the year it is placed in service. A qualifying security device is a security device acquired by purchase and installed in a building owned or occupied by the taxpayer in the United States. Examples of security devices include electronic access control systems and biometric identification. The qualifying security devices that can be deducted as an expense include biometric identification systems, surveillance cameras, door locks, cyberterrorism software, alarm systems, asset tracking devices, air filtering systems, and vehicle barricades. The qualifying security devices that can be deducted as an expense include various items such as biometric identification systems, surveillance cameras, door locks, alarm systems, and vehicle barricades. The term 'building' encompasses structures used for commercial, retail, or business purposes. Special rules apply for basis reduction when a deduction is allowed for the purchase of a qualifying security device. The basis of a qualifying security device is reduced by the deduction allowed. Rules similar to section 179 apply for this purpose. Conforming and clerical amendments are made to allow deductions under section 179C. The text amends various sections of the tax code by adding references to section 179C in addition to 179B. The amendments made by this Act regarding security device purchases under Sec. 179C apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date."
