    "content": "The Act titled \"Ambulatory Surgical Center Medicare Payment Modernization Act of 2007\" establishes Medicare payment for ambulatory surgical center services. The Ambulatory Surgical Center Medicare Payment Modernization Act of 2007 amends Section 1833(i) of the Social Security Act to specify payment for facility services in ambulatory surgical centers for outpatient surgical procedures covered under Medicare, excluding procedures posing significant safety risks or requiring overnight stays. The Secretary presumes outpatient surgical procedures in ambulatory surgical centers are safe, with adjustments made every two years. Payment for services in these centers is set at 75% of the fee schedule amount for the same service in a hospital outpatient department. Payment for covered ambulatory surgical center services is calculated based on a percentage of the 2007 ASC payment amount, adjusted annually. The payment amount is set at 75% of the hospital OPD fee schedule amount for the same services. For services furnished during 2008, the payment amount is 20% of the 2007 ASC payment amount increased by the market basket percentage for OPD services. For 2009, it is 60% of the 2007 ASC payment amount plus 40% of the payment amount for that year. For 2010, it is a similar calculation based on the 2007 ASC payment amount. For services furnished during 2011, the payment amount is a combination of percentages of the 2007 ASC payment amount increased by the market basket percentage for OPD services. For covered ambulatory surgical center services, the payment amount is based on a combination of percentages of the 2007 ASC payment amount and the market basket percentage for OPD services in 2011. The payment amount is determined by comparing the 2007 ASC payment amount to the hospital OPD fee schedule amount for the same services. In 2012 and subsequent years, the payment amount for ambulatory surgical center services is based on the hospital OPD fee schedule amount, with specific provisions for services involving implantable medical devices. This includes a 100 percent payment for the device-related portion and a 75 percent payment for the non-device-related component, with a 20 percent beneficiary copayment. The definition of a 'medical device' includes devices that are an integral part of a procedure, used for one patient only, single-use, contact human tissue, and surgically implanted or inserted. Amendments are made to align with this definition in the Act. Amendments are made to sections 1833(i)(2)(A) and 1833(a)(1)(G) of the Act, updating payment systems for services provided under subsection (i)(2). Section 1833(a)(4) is also amended to align with the revised payment system. The amendments made by this section apply to ambulatory surgical center services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. SEC. 3. CLARIFYING STATE LICENSURE AUTHORITY. Amends the Social Security Act to allow surgical services in ambulatory surgical centers as permitted by state licensure laws. Effective upon enactment of the Act."
