    "content": "The House of Representatives passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, a measure to reauthorize federal civil aviation programs for six years, excluding the controversial proposal to privatize air traffic control. The Senate Committee reported a four-year FAA reauthorization bill without addressing ATC privatization. Differences between the two bills include authorization length and funding amounts. This would be the first long-term FAA reauthorization act since 2012. Disagreement on ATC reforms has delayed action on a long-term FAA bill. Disagreement over ATC reforms has hindered progress on a long-term FAA bill for almost three years. The 114th Congress approved multiple extensions, including a one-year extension (P.L. 114-190) that expired in FY2017. The 115th Congress passed a six-month extension (P.L. 115-63) until March 2018, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) extended authorization for aviation programs through FY2018. Proposals to reform ATC have been a focal point in legislative debates. The House proposed ATC reforms through a not-for-profit private corporation, but later abandoned the idea. The Senate bills did not include any ATC reforms. Privatization of ATC is no longer moving forward, but there is interest in privatizing airports. Changes to grant allocations for airport improvements are still being considered in H.R. 4. The House proposed ATC reforms through a not-for-profit private corporation, but later abandoned the idea. The Senate bills did not include any ATC reforms. Privatization of ATC is no longer moving forward, but there is interest in privatizing airports. Changes to grant allocations for airport improvements remain in both H.R. 4 and S. 1405. Key issues in the debate include concerns related to NextGen implementation, promoting adoption of unmanned aircraft for commercial uses, addressing aircraft parts certification processes, and air carrier safety oversight. The reauthorization bills would extend the Essential Air Service program, address airline consumer issues, and finance FAA programs through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The trust fund has provided the majority of FAA's funding between FY2014 and FY2018. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) receives revenue from various sources like passenger ticket taxes, air cargo fees, and fuel taxes. In 2017, the AATF had revenues of over $15 billion with a cash balance of nearly $15 billion. The uncommitted balance was estimated to be approximately $5.9 billion at the end of FY2018. The trust fund balance is projected to grow in the near term as revenue continues to rise and airport capital needs are expected to decline over the next five years. Changes in airline business practices may pose a risk to the AATF revenue structure as low-cost air carrier models have held down ticket prices, affecting trust fund receipts. Airlines imposing fees for options like checked bags and onboard meals, not subject to federal excise taxes, have generated significant revenue. This issue is not addressed in recent legislation. FAA funding has ranged between $15 billion and $18 billion annually, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 providing funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) provided funding for FAA through FY2018. FAA funding is divided among four main accounts: Operations and Maintenance (O&M), Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development. These accounts fund air traffic operations, aviation safety programs, airport projects, air traffic facilities and equipment, and research on aviation safety and efficiency. The federal government supports airport infrastructure development through AIP grants, local passenger facility charges (PFCs), and tax-exempt bonds. Airports also use state and local funds, operating revenues, and various funding sources to finance projects. Small airports rely more on AIP grants, while larger airports have more diverse funding sources. The AIP provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning, with funding limited to airside operations improvements. AIP grants are more commonly used by small airports, while larger airports utilize tax-exempt bonds and PFCs for financing capital projects. Each funding source comes with specific constraints and may influence the availability of other funding sources. The AIP funds distribution reflects congressional priorities and aims to ensure airport safety, increase capacity, reduce congestion, fund noise and environmental mitigation, and support small state and community airports. AIP grants provide financial advantages to airports by funding capital projects without the burden of debt financing, with airports required to provide a modest local match. Limitations include project eligibility and adherence to program regulations. Federal law mandates the publication of a national plan for airport development in the U.S. The National Plan of Integrated Airport System (NPIAS) is a biannual FAA publication that airports must be listed in to receive AIP funds. The distribution system for AIP grants includes formula grants and discretionary funds, with airports applying for discretionary funds for projects in their master plans. Formula grants and discretionary funds are not mutually exclusive, and grants are generally awarded directly to airports. The distribution of AIP grants benefits smaller airports more than larger ones, with noncommercial airports receiving about 24% of grants in FY2017. Smaller airports typically have a lower cost-share for AIP-funded projects compared to larger airports. H.R. 4 aims to strengthen the current AIP structure to further support smaller airports. H.R. 4 would create a new supplemental funding authorization for AIP discretionary funds, excluding large hub airports, starting at $1.02 billion in FY2019 and increasing to $1.11 billion in FY2023. The Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 allows airports to impose a passenger facility charge (PFC) to supplement AIP grants, with restrictions on PFC amounts above $3. The PFC funds can be used for a broader range of capacity-enhancing projects, including landside projects like terminals and transit systems. Airports imposing PFCs above $3 lose 75% of their AIP formula funds. Legislation in 2000 raised the PFC ceiling to $4.50 with an $18 limit per round trip. The central legislative issue related to PFCs is their complementary relationship with AIP funds. The central legislative issue related to PFCs is whether to raise or eliminate the $4.50 per enplaned passenger ceiling. Airports advocate for increasing or eliminating the ceiling, while carriers and some passenger advocates oppose higher limits on PFCs. The House-passed H.R. 4 and Senate bill S. 1405 would not change the current PFC ceiling. Airport operators want more freedom to use PFC funds for off-airport projects, while carriers argue that funds are sometimes used for low-priority projects instead of safety or capacity enhancements. The major air carriers are dissatisfied with their limited influence over project decisions regarding PFC-funded projects. H.R. 4 includes a provision to use PFC revenues for projects to prevent airport power outages, while S. 1405 does not have a similar provision. Privatization of publicly owned airports has been explored as a way to make airports more efficient and financially viable. Airport privatization involves shifting governmental functions and ownership to the private sector, often through partial privatization. This can lead to stakeholders with conflicting interests, such as airport owners concerned about losing control and air carriers wanting to keep costs low. Private investors and operators in airport privatization seek financial returns, which may conflict with the interests of air carriers who want to keep costs low. The FAA is tasked with engaging private capital in aviation infrastructure development while maintaining safety and enforcing compliance. The FAA carefully examines privatization proposals to ensure they do not risk closures of runways or airports, reduce aviation system capacity, or favor certain airport users. The FAA Administrator can exempt airports in the Airport Privatization Pilot Program from certain requirements. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 increased the number of airports in the Airport Privatization Pilot Program from five to 10. Only one large hub commercial airport can participate and can only be leased, not sold. General aviation airports can be sold under the program. Despite 11 airports applying, only two have completed privatization. Language in H.R. 4 aims to allow more airports to enter the program. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) faces challenges that discourage airports from participating, such as approval requirements from air carriers, restrictions on rate increases, and limitations on federal funding for improvements. Privatized airports under the APPP receive less federal funding and face higher financing costs compared to publicly owned airports. This serves as a disincentive for airports to privatize under the current program. Privatization under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) is unattractive to airport owners and investors due to challenges like approval requirements and limited federal funding. Streamlining the APPP process may make privatization more appealing, but significant interest would require structural changes in airport financing. Options include equal tax treatment for private and public airport bonds, relaxing AIP requirements, and liberalizing fee rules. NextGen is a modernization project for air traffic technologies to meet future demand. NextGen is a multiyear initiative to modernize the national airspace system using satellite-based navigation and aircraft tracking technologies. It aims for full implementation by 2025 and includes core components like Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) for aircraft identification and data transmission. The FAA funds the installation, operation, and maintenance of a ground network to receive ADS-B transmissions for air traffic facilities. Most aircraft must have ADS-B Out capability by 2020. SWIM is a data sharing system for aviation, while DataComm is a digital voice and data network for communication between aircraft and air traffic facilities. Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT) include automation tools to enhance aircraft flow management. National Airspace System Voice System (NVS) upgrades digital voice communications. NextGen Weather provides a common weather platform. ADS-B ground receiver stations and performance-based navigation procedures improve airport efficiency. Less than 20% of the airline and air taxi fleet is equipped with ADS-B Out capability, despite most having PBN navigation equipment. FAA mandated ADS-B Out equipment for aircraft in controlled airspace by 2020, but adoption remains low. General aviation aircraft also lack precision navigation and ADS-B tracking capabilities in the NextGen environment. FAA estimates 40,000 fixed-wing aircraft are not equipped for these upgrades. H.R. 4 and S. 1405 aim to improve ADS-B tracking in the NextGen environment. H.R. 4 proposes a pilot program for preferential air traffic services to aircraft with upgraded avionics, while S. 1405 focuses on identifying barriers to compliance with the 2020 ADS-B mandate and developing a plan to address them. Additionally, S. 1405 calls for a more effective international strategy for harmonizing NextGen with other systems. Congress historically addresses airport noise concerns by allocating 35% of discretionary funding for noise mitigation within specific noise impact areas. The increasing volume of air traffic around major airports and changes in flight patterns have led to increased noise in residential communities, prompting complaints. Congress has directed the FAA to expedite the rollout of NextGen procedures and streamline environmental reviews. H.R. 4 would require the FAA to consider additional measures to address community impacts and engage local authorities before implementing procedural changes to flight patterns. H.R. 4 directs FAA to consider actions to reduce noise over neighborhoods, use alternative noise metrics, involve communities in NextGen planning, and study health impacts of aircraft noise. It also allows older Stage 2 airplanes to operate in rural communities. S. 1405 focuses on AIP funds for noise mitigation and updating airport noise exposure maps. H.R. 4 directs FAA to lead in developing international policies for civil supersonic aircraft, without requiring a sonic boom standard. Interest in civil supersonic aircraft is growing for business jets and air charter operations. P.L. 112-95 mandated FAA to integrate drones into national airspace and establish test sites for studying integration with manned flights. The 2012 act mandated FAA to issue final rules for civilian drones, allowing commercial operations of small UAS under certain conditions. Operators must obtain FAA remote pilot certification, pass a security assessment, and conduct preflight checks. FAA may waive restrictions on a case-by-case basis. The FAA may waive regulatory restrictions on drone operations, but certain limitations still exist, such as operations beyond visual line-of-sight and over crowds. S. 1405 and H.R. 4 aim to extend the UAS integration test site program for six years to facilitate testing of new technologies for drone operations. H.R. 4 and S. 1405 aim to extend the UAS integration test site program for six years, encourage beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations, establish a certification process for drone package delivery, and incorporate FAA positions related to UAS into veterans employment programs. The Senate bill also includes penalties for airspace violations and drone attacks against federal buildings. The Senate bill requires the FAA to create a public database of UAS operators with details on flights and capabilities, exempting news organizations. It also mandates commercial drone operators to have privacy policies in line with U.S. privacy laws, with violations considered unfair trade practices enforceable by the FTC. FAA is responsible for oversight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees compliance with safety regulations in the aviation industry, including airlines, repair stations, and manufacturers. H.R. 4 and S. 1405 aim to align FAA's safety workforce training with risk-based approaches, industry knowledge-sharing, and set milestones. H.R. 4 also requires an independent review of training needs at FAA's Office of Aviation Safety. Maintenance of U.S. air carrier aircraft at foreign and domestic locations is regulated. Maintenance of U.S. air carrier aircraft at foreign and domestic locations is regulated by the FAA under Part 145. Repair stations must develop FAA-approved documentation and processes, including quality control procedures and training programs. FAA may also approve foreign repair stations based on bilateral aviation safety agreements. FAA's compliance philosophy targets oversight activities based on risk and information voluntarily shared by regulated entities. H.R. 4 would require a GAO study to assess the effectiveness of FAA's new compliance philosophy in encouraging workers to report errors without fear of reprisal. Concerns have been raised about FAA's leniency in enforcing actions, especially with repair stations outside the U.S. Additional concerns include inconsistent interpretation of regulations by FAA field offices and potential impact on regulatory compliance. FAA has implemented quality management systems to standardize processes and address inconsistencies in regulations. S. 1405 proposes a centralized database for safety guidance and a task force on reforming flight standards. No independent assessment of revised certification practices has been conducted. H.R. 4 includes comprehensive reforms to FAA certification processes, aiming to streamline processes, address regional inconsistencies, and create an industry advisory committee for policy advice. FAA lacks performance measures to assess progress on certification-related initiatives, leading to inconsistent interpretation of regulations at the regional level. The bill in H.R. 4 aims to reform FAA certification processes by creating an industry advisory committee for policy advice, establishing oversight for organization designation authorization holders, and streamlining the certification of safety-enhancing equipment for small general aviation aircraft. It also proposes expanding acceptance of airworthiness determinations from foreign regulators. S. 1405 would establish a specific ODA office within FAA to provide oversight and ensure consistency of FAA audit functions across the agency. The office would handle all requests from ODA holders regarding the review and removal of limitations and reviews of corrective actions taken. It would also require an expert panel review of FAA's ODA program. The FAA extension act ( P.L. 114-190 ) required FAA to establish a risk-based oversight system focusing on repair stations located outside the United States that perform heavy maintenance work on air carrier aircraft, and to target its oversight activities based on the frequency and severity of instances in which air carriers must take corrective actions following servicing at foreign facilities. The FAA has not yet published a proposed rule for drug and alcohol testing at foreign repair stations, which may be further delayed due to Executive Order 13771. H.R. 4 would require FAA to implement a HIMS program for airline pilots, allowing pilots who have successfully undergone substance abuse rehabilitation to return to the cockpit with monitoring by HIMS-trained examiners. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated that pilots attain the airline transportation pilot rating before being hired as airline first officers, with a minimum of 1,500 flight hours required. Previously, pilots could be hired with only 250 hours. FAA required all pilots and first officers operating under Part 121 to meet these new requirements. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated that pilots hold an airline transportation pilot certificate and have at least 1,000 flight hours for air carrier operations. S. 1405 allows nonacademic ground training courses to count towards the 1,500-hour requirement for airline pilot-in-command. The FAA implemented new regulations on pilot flight time, duty time, and rest requirements in 2012, with a focus on fatigue risk management plans. These rules, effective since 2014, apply to passenger airlines but are optional for cargo carriers under 14 C.F.R. Part 121. Pilot labor groups advocate for uniform fatigue regulations, while the FAA and airlines argue that separate rules are necessary for cargo operations. Efforts to include all-cargo pilots under the same duty and rest rules as passenger airline pilots have not been successful in recent Congresses. However, H.R. 2997 and S. 1405 propose revisions to flight attendant duty periods and rest requirements, ensuring a minimum 10-hour postduty rest period. H.R. 2997 prohibits rest period reduction, while S. 1405 allows for a single reduction to nine hours followed by an 11-hour rest period. Both bills mandate airlines to develop FAA-approved fatigue risk management plans for flight attendants. In 2009, the retirement age for airline pilots in the United States was raised from 60 to 65. International standards and FAA regulations previously required pilots over 60 to be paired with a younger pilot, but this restriction was lifted in 2014. There are no upper age restrictions for pilots in charter flights and business aviation as long as they pass medical exams. H.R. 4 proposes an upper age limit of 69 for pilots in certain types of flights. The capabilities of tracking technologies and data recorders aboard passenger aircraft were questioned after two incidents in 2014 involving Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501. Despite the availability of GPS tracking technologies, aircraft are still primarily tracked using ground-based radar by air traffic control. The FAA's NextGen initiative aims to implement GPS-based aircraft tracking, but it will rely on ground-based receivers within the United States and have limitations in tracking beyond the network coverage area. Enhanced satellite-based systems are being developed to track aircraft globally, especially for transoceanic and polar flights that go beyond ground-based radar coverage. Some U.S. military aircraft are equipped with deployable flight recorders to aid in locating civilian aircraft in distress or accidents in remote areas. The House and Senate bills aim to improve aircraft tracking and flight data recovery through technologies like automatic deployable flight recorders and satellite-based solutions. The FAA has implemented various measures to enhance runway safety, including investments in airport lighting, surface radar, and Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS). P.L. 112-95 mandated the development of a strategic runway safety plan with specific national goals to improve safety at commercial service airports. The FAA has implemented measures to enhance runway safety at commercial service airports, including investments in airport lighting, surface radar, and EMAS. P.L. 112-95 mandated a strategic runway safety plan with national goals. FAA is using data tools to identify safety risks and has committed to actions like installing runway status lights and EMAS. S. 1405 would require FAA to assess direct warning technologies for runway incursions. The bill aims to improve runway safety by directing the FAA to develop metrics for runway incursions and assess safety initiatives. It also requires progress reports on airport grants for safety improvements. Additionally, it addresses the carriage of lithium batteries on aircraft, giving DOT more leeway in regulations to ensure compliance with hazardous materials regulations and ICAO instructions. The bill aims to improve runway safety by developing metrics for runway incursions and assessing safety initiatives. It also addresses the carriage of lithium batteries on aircraft, directing DOT to establish a lithium battery air safety advisory committee. This committee would provide advice on lithium battery safety, increase awareness among shippers and passengers, and advise on safety regulations for helicopter fuel systems. The National Transportation Safety Board has issued recommendations to update regulations regarding helicopter fuel system crashworthiness in response to recent helicopter crashes. H.R. 4 would require newly built helicopters to meet updated fuel system crashworthiness standards. FAA reauthorization debates have focused on air traffic services, with House bills proposing a private corporation for ATC services. Senate bills have not included ATC reforms. On January 27, 2018, Representative Bill Shuster announced he would no longer push for FAA ATC restructuring. H.R. 4 introduced on April 13, 2018, did not include ATC privatization. Alternative plans to move ATC out of FAA were considered but ultimately scrapped due to funding and borrowing cost obstacles. The proposed organization faced obstacles due to borrowing costs and lack of federal government support for separating ATC from FAA. Despite this, FAA has taken steps towards privatizing certain functions. FAA has made changes to its hiring process for air traffic controllers, switching to a single nationwide vacancy announcement open to all qualified U.S. citizens between 18 and 30. This change was in response to recommendations to improve workplace diversity. The FAA implemented a biographical assessment in the hiring process to identify successful air traffic controller candidates, reducing costs by $7 million. However, concerns were raised by colleges and universities participating in the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative. Legislation limited FAA's ability to continue using the new hiring process. The FAA implemented a biographical assessment in the hiring process for air traffic controllers, but legislation now limits its use. The new law gives preference to experienced controllers and AT-CTI graduates, increases the maximum entry age to 35 for those with prior ATC experience, and requires reevaluation of disqualified applicants. Consolidation of FAA air traffic facilities aims to control costs, upgrade outdated facilities, and enhance services. Efforts have focused on TRACON facilities in major metropolitan areas. Recent initiatives involve separating airport tower/approach control facilities and merging approach control functions over larger areas, which could lead to job losses in specific districts. The FAA is undergoing realignment and consolidation of air traffic control facilities under the NextGen system, which will change job functions and consolidate them in fewer physical facilities. Provisions in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required the FAA to provide recommendations for realignment and consolidation for public comment and congressional review. A collaborative working group has issued reports with recommendations for consolidation in various regions across the United States. The FAA is undergoing realignment and consolidation of air traffic control facilities under the NextGen system. H.R. 4 would amend existing statutory language to emphasize reducing the overall number of ATC facilities and incorporating input from industry stakeholders and labor organizations. The future course of action regarding these recommendations and facility consolidation plans remains uncertain. In 2015, GAO raised concerns about FAA's security and cybersecurity measures during the transition to the NextGen system. It recommended developing a cybersecurity threat model and a holistic approach to cybersecurity. The incident at the Chicago ATC center highlighted the risks posed by employees with facility access. Redundancy proved crucial as controllers from other locations restored normal operations within days. The DOT Office of Inspector General found FAA's response to system disruptions inadequate in 2017, recommending improvements in contingency planning, testing of emergency safeguards, and assessing NextGen capabilities. P.L. 114-190 requires FAA to develop aviation cybersecurity principles and policies, address GAO recommendations, and maintain an agency-wide cybersecurity threat model. The 2015 GAO report mandates FAA to develop and maintain an agency-wide cybersecurity threat model, establish cybersecurity standards plan for FAA information systems, and an aviation cybersecurity research and development plan. H.R. 4 requires FAA to review the framework developed in response to P.L. 114-190, identify safety risks during power outages at airports, review mechanisms to alert pilots and air traffic controllers of runway lighting issues, and update ATC operational contingency plans every five years. S. 1405 mandates FAA to address potential air traffic facility outages and incorporate resiliency and mitigation into NextGen capabilities. It also directs FAA to consider revising aircraft certification requirements for cybersecurity and accessibility of avionics. FAA regulates commercial space launch providers amidst global competition, with Russia, France, and China vying for business. This parallels FAA's role in promoting private-sector space launches, similar to its dual role in the commercial aviation industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996 directed FAA to focus on safety and transferred its promotional role to DOT. FAA's authority includes launch and reentry of space vehicles, with 10 licensed launch sites in the US. H.R. 4 proposes establishing an Office of Spaceports within FAA to support licensing activities for launch sites. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996 shifted FAA's focus to safety and transferred promotional responsibilities to DOT. H.R. 4 proposes creating an Office of Spaceports within FAA to assist with licensing activities for launch sites. S. 1405 includes language for aeronautical studies to assess potential construction that could interfere with launch or reentry sites. FAA Research and Development prioritizes aviation system safety, efficiency, and environmental impact reduction, with funding allocated to modernization, safety, and energy/environmental projects. The FAA receives advice from industry through the Research, Engineering, and Development Advisory Committee (REDAC) to address energy and environmental impacts. FAA is required to develop an annual national aviation research plan that outlines five-year research goals and funding requirements. A 2017 GAO review recommended improvements in identifying long-term research priorities, transparency in project selection and funding, and meeting statutory requirements for annual reviews and plans. The FAA is revising its approach to research planning and has not updated its national Aviation Research Plan since 2016. FAA research activities are funded by various accounts, with 47% funded through the Facilities and Equipment account and 11% from AIP funds. H.R. 4 and S. 1405 propose different funding amounts for FAA research, engineering, and development, but the FY2019 budget request suggests a reduction in funding. The FAA is revising its research planning approach and reducing funding for research, engineering, and development by $100 million to $74 million. This cut may impact FAA grants, research partnerships, and staffing. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 gave airlines freedom to determine markets and fares, leading to concerns about service in small communities. The EAS program was established to ensure service to these communities with subsidies if needed. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, administered by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, determines minimum service levels for eligible communities. Congress has limited the program's scope over the years, mainly by removing subsidies for communities near major hub airports. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 introduced reforms, including requiring a minimum number of daily enplanements for EAS eligibility. Subsequent legislation has not made significant changes to the EAS program. The 2012 act and subsequent extensions did not bring significant changes to the EAS program. To be EAS-eligible, locations must have participated in the program between September 30, 2010, and September 30, 2011. No new communities can enter the program since October 1, 2012, except for Alaska or Hawaii. Communities eligible for EAS subsidies in FY2011 remain eligible if they are more than 70 miles from a large or medium hub airport and require a subsidy of $200 or less per passenger. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program has specific requirements for eligibility, including a subsidy cap of $200 per passenger, an average rate of subsidy per passenger less than $1,000, and an average of 10 or more enplanements per service day. These limitations apply to locations in the contiguous 48 states and Puerto Rico, with exemptions for EAS communities in Alaska and Hawaii. Funding for the EAS program comes from annual transfers of overflight fees paid to the FAA by foreign aircraft. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program receives funding from overflight fees and annual appropriations, totaling about $274 million for FY2018. The program subsidizes air service to over 170 communities, with subsidies reaching over $298 million for service in various states and territories. H.R. 4 and the Senate committee bill propose different funding amounts for EAS, with additional requirements for a study on reform options. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program received an appropriation of $175 million for FY2018-FY2021, higher than the $155 million in FY2018. The Department of Transportation (DOT) issued tentative orders to enforce EAS program criteria, with some communities failing to meet eligibility requirements. Most communities received waivers to remain eligible for subsidized EAS, while a few had their eligibility terminated. DOT found 21 communities not meeting criteria in FY2017, with a decision pending on their eligibility. The 1978 deregulation of the airline industry in the United States eliminated federal control over many airline business practices. Congress determines the rights of airline passengers through legislation or regulatory rulemaking. DOT's consumer rules aim to protect consumers from unfair practices. H.R. 4 addresses crowding aboard airplanes. H.R. 4 and S. 1405 address airplane crowding by regulating minimum passenger seat dimensions and studying seat pitch. They also focus on improving passenger experience for individuals with disabilities and enhancing the consumer complaint process. H.R. 4 aims to prevent unfair practices like involuntary bumping and deceptive advertising of base airfares by airlines. The DOT consumer protection rule deems airline and travel websites \"unfair and deceptive\" for not prominently displaying the total cost of a flight, including taxes and fees."
