    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Enterprise Zone Act of 2007\" and includes sections on findings, National Enterprise Zones, a study, and effective date. The National Enterprise Zone program offers tax incentives to corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships in economically depressed regions to stimulate economic activity, create jobs, and improve living standards. The National Enterprise Zone program aims to boost economic activity in depressed areas by offering tax incentives to businesses, including improved taxation on investments and promoting universal economic prosperity. SEC. 3. NATIONAL ENTERPRISE ZONES. This section introduces a new part in the Internal Revenue Code aimed at creating National Enterprise Zones to stimulate economic growth in struggling areas through tax incentives for businesses. The National Enterprise Zones are designated to stimulate economic growth in struggling areas through tax incentives for businesses. The procedure for designation, eligibility criteria, and tax implications for individuals and corporations conducting business within these zones are outlined in sections 1400U-1400U-7 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary designates areas in the US meeting requirements for National Enterprise Zones, with an effective date of January 1 following designation. An eligibility review is conducted between January 1 and April 30 after the decennial census release to ensure zones meet criteria; revocation occurs if criteria are not met. The Secretary revokes the designation of a National Enterprise Zone if criteria are not met, with notice given to taxpayers by June 30. Taxpayers still qualify for tax benefits until the 12th taxable year after revocation. National Enterprise Zones must meet specific criteria including having over 50,000 residents, a poverty rate double the national average, and an unemployment rate double the national average. These zones cannot overlap with other designated zones. The designation of a National Enterprise Zone can impact individuals, estates, and trusts conducting business within the zone. Individuals with National Enterprise Zone taxable income can elect to pay a tax consisting of their taxable income reduced by the National Enterprise Zone tentative taxable income, plus a 12 percent tax on the National Enterprise Zone taxable income. This election is effective for three taxable years following the year it is made. Individuals with National Enterprise Zone taxable income can elect to pay a reduced tax for three years, unless they cease to have such income, revoke the election, or the specified period expires. If business operations in the zone cease during the initial three-year period, the taxpayer will be subject to tax at the regular rate for individuals. The National Enterprise Zone tax allows individuals to pay a reduced tax for three years, but if the election is terminated or revoked, they cannot make a new election until the 3rd taxable year after the termination. National Enterprise Zone individual taxable income is determined by taxable income from active trade or business in National Enterprise Zones, with adjustments for inventory property expenditures and excess deductions under section 179(e). The designation of National Enterprise Zone has an effect on corporations. The National Enterprise Zone Tax allows corporations to elect to pay a tax based on their income within the zone, with a special rule for non-domestic corporations operating in the zone. The National Enterprise Zone Tax allows corporations to elect to pay tax based on their income within the zone. The election is effective for three taxable years following the year it is made and for all succeeding years unless certain conditions are met. If a corporation ceases business in the zone within three years after making the election, they will be taxed at the regular domestic rate. If an election is terminated, the corporation cannot make a new election until the 3rd taxable year after the termination, unless approved by the Secretary. National Enterprise Zone corporate taxable income is based on income from active trade or business within National Enterprise Zones, with adjustments for inventory property expenditures and deductions. Corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietors can conduct active trade or business within these zones. For tax purposes, active trade or business in a National Enterprise Zone means deriving no more than 25% of gross income from passive activities. Gross income within the zone includes compensation for services, rentals or royalties from property, and profits from inventory sales. Expenses in the National Enterprise Zone are allocated based on income-producing activities. Expenses not directly related are allocated based on the ratio of gross income within the zone to all gross income in the US. The Alternative Formulary Method allows a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietor in a National Enterprise Zone to determine income, expense, and other items by multiplying its apportionment ratio. The apportionment ratio is based on the ratio of income-producing activities within the zone. The apportionment ratio in a National Enterprise Zone is calculated based on the sum of remaining basis in depreciable property, inventory property, and compensation paid to employees in the zone, divided by the same values for the entire United States and its possessions. The alternative formulary method is mandatory for taxpayers with over 10% of gross income from sales to related parties or over 10% of expenses from purchases from related parties within the United States and its possessions. The alternative formulary method is mandatory for taxpayers with significant related party transactions in the United States and its possessions. The term 'possession of the United States' includes the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Inventory property refers to specific types of property and expenses capitalized under section 263A. The deduction under section 1400U-3(b)(1) replaces the deduction for inventory property sales. For corporations electing under this part, an electing corporation organized under certain laws is included in section 7701(a)(4). The electing corporation organized under certain laws in a possession of the United States is exempt from section 7701(a)(5). Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to remove limitations on property placed in a National Enterprise Zone. Property expensed in the zone but not disposed of is treated as if repurchased by the taxpayer. Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow property placed in a National Enterprise Zone to be expensed without limitations. Property not disposed of in the zone is treated as repurchased by the taxpayer at a price equal to its remaining basis. The Secretary will conduct a study on the National Enterprise Zone program's effectiveness in promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. The study must be submitted to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance by December 31, 2012. The amendments made by this Act will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
