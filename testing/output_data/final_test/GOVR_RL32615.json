    "content": "In August 2005, Pakistan conducted municipal-level elections in 110 districts. Despite being a non-party affair, opposition parties criticized President Musharraf for favoring ruling party candidates. The Pakistan Supreme Court ruled that candidates with religious education must also study English, Pakistan studies, and Urdu to be eligible. Violence during polling resulted in numerous casualties and injuries. Allegations of vote-rigging and women being barred from polling stations led to opposition parties' protests. The recent elections in Pakistan saw opposition parties calling for a national strike to protest President Musharraf's actions, with protests being moderate in scale. Candidates from the ruling party performed well, boosting President Musharraf's position. However, the outcome has not brought political harmony and has increased bitterness among opposition parties. In June 2005, the U.S. State Department's official for South Asia highlighted Pakistan's role in assisting U.S.-led efforts against terrorism and stabilizing Afghanistan. Pakistan's government was praised for taking steps towards modernization and democracy, although challenges remain. Secretary Rocca emphasized the importance of democratization in U.S.-Pakistan relations, expecting free and fair elections in 2005 and 2007. Some members expressed doubts about Pakistan's progress under Musharraf, citing repression of moderate parties. Police arrested thousands of opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP) activists and senior leaders to block a rally welcoming Asif Zardari back to Lahore. Zardari was placed in \"protective custody\" upon arrival, sparking appeals for the release of arrested PPP supporters. Meanwhile, the Islamist coalition also saw thousands of supporters arrested during protests against the Musharraf government. Religious parties in Pakistan were disturbed by allegations of Koran desecration in a Newsweek report. The Islamabad government expressed concern to U.S. officials about allegations of Koran desecration at Guantanamo Bay, leading to condemnation by Pakistan's National Assembly. Pakistan, a key ally in U.S.-led counterterrorism efforts, faced international criticism after a bloodless coup replaced Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 1999. After facing international criticism for a bloodless coup in 1999, Pakistan's isolation decreased following the 9/11 attacks and Musharraf's withdrawal of support for the Afghan Taliban. The U.S. temporarily lifted sanctions, resumed aid, and characterized Pakistan as a key partner in the war on terrorism. The focus remained on combating religious extremism and nuclear proliferation. The United States is interested in improving Pakistan's human rights situation and strengthening its civilian democratic institutions. There is a debate among analysts on whether military-guided governance is necessary for stability or if Pakistan's underdeveloped democracy is a cause of instability. Some believe that Islamist forces in Pakistan are influenced by the military, leading to skewed civil-military relations. Top U.S. diplomats and Congress members are calling for more rapid progress in addressing these issues. The United States is pushing for accelerated development of Pakistani democracy, with top diplomats and Congress members calling for progress. The Bush Administration sees Pakistan as a crucial ally in the anti-terrorism coalition and emphasizes the need for strengthening civilian political institutions in Islamabad. The State Department and USAID have identified democratic stability in Pakistan and Afghanistan as key initiatives for the region. The United States is advocating for the advancement of Pakistani democracy, emphasizing the importance of strong democratic institutions and civil society involvement. The Bush Administration aims for a fully democratic and economically stable Pakistan that is at peace with its neighbors, reducing anti-Americanism and extremism. Condoleezza Rice has expressed support for these goals since becoming Secretary of State in 2005. Condoleezza Rice, as Secretary of State since 2005, has supported Pakistan's move towards democracy. The US emphasizes the need for fair elections in Pakistan, with Assistant Secretary Rocca stressing the importance of a level playing field. The 9/11 Commission Report acknowledges challenges in US-Pakistan relations but sees Musharraf's government as the best hope for progress. The 9/11 Commission Report recognizes Pakistan as a key transit country for terrorists and highlights Musharraf's government as crucial for stability in the region. The report recommends that the US support Pakistan in its fight against extremism through a comprehensive effort, including military aid and education support, as long as Pakistan's leaders make difficult choices. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 endorsed long-term U.S. support for Pakistan to ensure a stable future. Congressional attention to Pakistan's political development continues, with concerns about the slow pace of democracy. The House and Senate passed legislation requiring reports on Pakistan's democracy and human rights protection. Pending legislation addresses critical issues in U.S.-Pakistan relations, including government institutions and rule of law. The concept of \"enlightened moderation\" by Musharraf aims to combat the perception of Islam being linked to extremism and terrorism. It promotes a path of moderation, socioeconomic uplift, and conciliatory approach to modernization, democracy, and secularism. Pakistan's prime minister also supports this strategy to counter religious extremism. The Bush Administration supports Musharraf as the right leader for Pakistan, balancing democratization efforts with the need for a stable ally in the fight against terrorism. Some argue that human rights issues in Pakistan are a crucial concern amidst these priorities. The human rights situation in Pakistan is seen as linked to terrorism and extremism. Congressional oversight in 2003 expressed concerns about democratization issues and military control in Pakistan. The military's influence has expanded under Musharraf, dominating decision-making in various sectors of the state, economy, and society. Military agencies in Pakistan are criticized for human rights abuses, with some suggesting that Musharraf's alliance with Islamists fuels extremism. The military's control over decision-making is evident, with a lack of transparency in policy-making, especially regarding the defense budget. Opposition figures argue that this lack of transparency undermines democracy and allows intelligence services to operate without accountability. Pakistan's democratic institutions are criticized for being inflexible and unaccommodating of dissent, with political parties weakened and military influence strong. Analysts question Musharraf's role as a stable ally in counterterrorism efforts, citing concerns about political stability and U.S. reliance on military regimes. Counterterrorism efforts in South Asia have analysts concerned about Musharraf's political advantage and U.S. reliance on him, with calls for support to focus on Pakistan's democratic institutions and civil society instead. The Pakistani analyst criticizes Musharraf's policy shifts as being driven by external pressure, with slow progress towards stable democracy. US scholars warn of Pakistan's dysfunctional social order and distorted political system, advocating for the inclusion of secular political parties for lasting change. The expert criticizes Pakistan's military for hindering mainstream parties, suggesting they should retreat from politics. American policymakers prefer a strong Islamabad leadership. Musharraf's reforms are losing support, with calls for the return of Sharif and Bhutto for free elections in 2007. Optimism about Musharraf's potential as a reformer has decreased significantly. Concerns arise about the possibility of an unstable, Islamicized, or failed state with nuclear weapons in between Afghanistan and India. The country's law-and-order situation deteriorated in 2004-2005, causing uncertainty about political succession in Islamabad. Pakistan's fragile democratic institutions are constantly threatened by the authoritarian influences of the military and economic structures. The U.S. emphasizes the importance of democratic institutions for Pakistan's economic growth and development. Pakistan's history of democracy is troubled, with ongoing power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. Military regimes have ruled for over half of the country's existence, lacking effective constitutionalism or parliamentary democracy. The armed forces see themselves as \"saviors of the nation,\" often working with the president. The U.S. closely monitors Pakistan's political developments for economic growth and stability. The military in Pakistan has seized power from civilian-led governments multiple times since 1958. Five successive governments have been voted into power but none have been voted out, all removed by the army. This turmoil has led to a lack of understanding of democracy among Pakistanis. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML) is the country's oldest political party, initially weakened after the deaths of key leaders in 1948 and 1951. It regained prominence in 1988 under Nawaz Sharif's leadership, who later established the PML-Nawaz (PML-N) and dominated the 1997 elections. In 2002, former Sharif loyalists formed the PML-Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q). Sharif loyalists joined the new PML-Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q) in 2004, led by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain. Nawaz Sharif and his family live in exile in Saudi Arabia under an arrangement barring their return to Pakistan for ten years. The PML's electoral strength lies in Punjab province. The left-leaning Pakistan People's Party (PPP) was established in 1967 in reaction to military dictatorship. Under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's leadership, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won majority seats in West Pakistan's assembly in 1970. Bhutto established a parliamentary system and initiated Pakistan's nuclear program. He was overthrown by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 and executed in 1979. Bhutto's daughter Benazir became PPP leader, serving as Prime Minister in 1988 and 1993. She currently lives in exile in London and Dubai due to corruption charges. The PPP formed PPP Parliamentarians (PPPP) to participate in elections in 2002. The PPP Parliamentarians (PPPP) was formed as a separate entity to uphold Bhutto's political philosophy, led by Makhdoom Amin Fahim. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) is a coalition of Islamist parties, with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) being prominent members. Islamists in Pakistan advocate for a central role of religion in politics and oppose Westernization. On October 12, 1999, Army Chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, citing dissatisfaction with Sharif's authoritarian and allegedly corrupt regime as a key factor. Musharraf declared a state of emergency under a \"Provisional Constitution Order\" (PCO). In October 1999, General Musharraf seized power in Pakistan, declaring a state of emergency under a \"Provisional Constitution Order\" (PCO). He suspended the Constitution, ensuring his actions couldn't be challenged. The Supreme Court validated his actions but ordered elections to be held by October 12, 2002. This led to a military dictatorship in Pakistan. Musharraf's seizure of power in October 1999 initially had widespread approval due to perceived corruption in the Sharif government. However, his subsequent actions to establish authoritarian rule alienated many, despite his promise to hold elections in October 2002. Critics argue that his actions have strengthened his ruling position and that of the military. Proponents of Musharraf's political choices since 1999 claim the country is becoming more stable and less corrupt under \"military-guided\" administration. In June 2001, President Mohammad Rafiq Tarar was replaced by Gen. Musharraf. Musharraf legitimized his presidency with an April 2002 referendum, which faced opposition boycotts and allegations of coercion and fraud. In August 2002, Musharraf announced a \"Legal Framework Order\" with constitutional changes granting enhanced powers to the President. Musharraf made constitutional amendments granting enhanced powers to the Pakistani President, including the ability to dismiss the National Assembly and appoint military chiefs. Critics argued that these changes aimed to legitimize the military's role in governance and ensure Musharraf's continued power, contrary to democratic principles. The creation of a military-dominated National Security Council was also controversial, with opposition parties denouncing the actions as illegal. Pakistan's major opposition parties criticized Musharraf's constitutional amendments as illegal, comparing them to Zia-ul-Haq's efforts to avoid challenges to his rule. The United States expressed continued support for Musharraf, despite concerns about the impact on democratic institutions. Following the 1999 coup, Musharraf held elections in 2002, which was praised given Pakistan's history with democracy. The 2002 elections in Pakistan were criticized by opposition parties and independent observers for being deeply flawed, despite the government's insistence on their fairness. Voter turnout was estimated to be above 40%, with pro-Musharraf parties winning a plurality but falling short of a majority in the National Assembly. The PPP received the largest number of votes overall. The PPP won the largest number of votes overall in the 2002 elections in Pakistan, but was awarded runner-up status. The MMA Islamist coalition had a strong third-place showing, controlling the provincial assembly of NWFP and leading a coalition in Baluchistan. They also had 68 legislators in the National Assembly. The new National Assembly sat in November 2002, with the PML-Q, PPP, and MMA engaging in failed coalition-building negotiations. Both the PPP and Islamist parties rejected the Legal Framework Order changes to the Constitution. In the 2002 elections in Pakistan, the PPP won the most votes but was awarded runner-up status. The possibility of a PPP-Islamist alliance caused panic in the Musharraf regime. President Musharraf refused MMA demands for his resignation as Army Chief. Pro-Musharraf parties formed a coalition without PPP or MMA involvement, with some PPP members defecting and being rewarded with ministerial positions. Mir Zafarullah Jamali became a favorite of the PML-Q in November 2002. In November 2002, Mir Zafarullah Jamali was elected as Prime Minister. Speculation arose about the intentions behind the Islamist coalition's strong showing, with concerns raised about handing over border areas to religious parties. The National Assembly faced procedural issues for over a year, passing only a budget. Opposition parties rejected the Legal Framework Order (LFO) and called for Musharraf's resignation, with the MMA refusing to accept the LFO and Musharraf's status as Army Chief. The 14-month-long dispute between President Musharraf's allies and opposition parties in the National Assembly ended with a December 2003 deal with the Islamist MMA. Musharraf agreed to resign as Army Chief by the end of 2004 and put a modified version of the Legal Framework Order (LFO) before Parliament. The LFO was passed as the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. Musharraf's presidency through 2007 was legitimized when he won a vote of confidence from Pakistan's Electoral College on January 1, 2004. This was seen as a positive development for Pakistani democracy and stability. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution in December 2003 removed the National Security Council, allowing Parliament nominal power over it. Secular and Islamist opposition parties opposed the bill, boycotting the vote when it passed in April. The NSC's first meeting in June focused on Pakistan's law-and-order situation. Musharraf was displeased with Maulana Fazlur Rehman's absence, as he boycotted the session. Supporters claim the NSC will prevent military coups by providing a forum for the army without dissolving Parliament, but opponents fear it will undermine Parliament's power. The Pakistani military has a history of meddling in politics, often benefiting Islamist forces at the expense of secular ones. The Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy in Pakistan, comprising non-Islamist parties, sees themselves as the true opposition to the ruling party. The arrest of opposition leader Makhdoom Javed Hashmi in 2003 led to accusations of government repression. Hashmi was sentenced to 23 years in prison for criticizing President Musharraf's policies. The United States expressed concern over the lack of transparency in the legal proceedings. In response to the arrest and sentencing of opposition leader Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, the United States criticized the closed nature of the legal proceedings and called on Pakistan to ensure fair justice. Pakistan accused the US of interference. In a separate incident, former Punjab Chief Minister Shabaz Sharif was deported to Saudi Arabia after attempting to return to Pakistan, leading to the arrest of 2,200 supporters. These events were seen as a sign of the military's control over civil society. Additionally, Maulana Fazlur Rehman was appointed Leader of the Opposition in Parliament in May. In late 2004, reports indicated a potential reconciliation between President Musharraf and the Pakistan Muslim League with the non-Islamist opposition. Asif Zardari, husband of former PM Benazir Bhutto, was released on bail after being imprisoned for eight years without conviction. He later received permission to leave the country, sparking rumors of a deal between Musharraf and the PPP. In early 2005, there were talks of a potential deal between Musharraf and the PPP, with reports of communication between government officials and top leaders of both the PPP and PML-N. Former Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto met in Saudi Arabia to establish a \"minimum program for the restoration of democracy\" in Pakistan, setting aside their differences for this goal. Bhutto was accompanied by her husband, Asif Zardari, who was released from prison in November 2004. In December, PPP Senator Raza Rabbani was elevated as Leader of the Opposition in parliament's upper house as part of Musharraf's reconciliation efforts with moderate political parties. Despite this, PPP leaders continue to reject any accommodation with the Musharraf government. Pakistan saw its third prime minister since the October 2002 elections in 2004, with indications of Musharraf's dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Jamali's perceived ineffectiveness. Jamali resigned on June 26, 2004, at the request of President Musharraf, which was seen as further evidence of the military's supreme power. After Prime Minister Jamali's resignation, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain was nominated as his successor, with Shaukat Aziz eventually winning the prime ministership. Aziz's appointment was seen as a military-backed choice, emphasizing a technocratic approach to governance and economic development. President Musharraf's elevation to power was perceived as a move to consolidate control over his regime, with the appointment of a prime minister who would have limited authority. Despite opposition parties' concerns about his dual role as President and Chief of Army Staff, Musharraf showed signs of retaining both positions for the sake of \"political stability\" in Pakistan. In September 2004, there was pressure for Musharraf to maintain political stability in Pakistan by staying on, despite concerns about his insecurity. The United States and the British Commonwealth expected progress towards democracy and his military retirement. In October 2004, the ruling PML-Q party passed a bill allowing Musharraf to remain in uniform for his tenure. The ruling PML-Q party passed a bill allowing President Musharraf to remain in uniform for his tenure, sparking criticism from opposition parties and widening the government-opposition rift. The United States and the British Commonwealth expressed the expectation for Pakistan to transition to democracy and reiterated the view that Musharraf's retirement from the army would be beneficial. In December 2004, Musharraf announced his decision to retain his army post, citing domestic political and economic stability. Opposition parties criticized his move, calling it a threat to democracy. Anti-Musharraf rallies were relatively small, and the Pakistan People's Party did not join forces with Islamists in protest. The Western and Pakistani press were critical of Musharraf, with concerns raised about the United States' support for him. The United States is facing criticism for overlooking Musharraf's nuclear proliferation and human rights issues in exchange for Pakistan's cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. The Bush Administration praised Musharraf for his cooperation during a visit to Washington, but did not address concerns about Pakistani democracy and governance. In a conference, an unnamed senior Bush Administration official defended Pakistan's democratic institutions under Musharraf's leadership. Musharraf claimed democracy was fully restored in Pakistan and announced a Local Government Plan to strengthen grassroots democracy, similar to past military rulers' tactics. Musharraf's Local Government Plan, similar to Gen. Zia's, established a three-tiered system with nazims at union, tehsil, and zila levels. While providing some benefits like attention to local needs, analysts are skeptical of rigging, lack of democratic accountability, and limited autonomy. International observers view the nazim system positively. The Asian Development Bank sees the nazim system as a positive aspect of Pakistani democratization efforts. Despite complaints of election interference, the Supreme Court ruled against Islamist candidates without certain educational qualifications. The municipal elections in August 2005 saw violence and casualties despite heavy security measures. In Pakistan, there were claims of vote-rigging and women being barred from polling stations, leading to opposition parties calling for a national strike against President Musharraf. Despite moderate protests, ruling party candidates did well in the elections, seen as a boost for Musharraf. He expressed satisfaction with the results, calling it a victory for moderates and a defeat for extremists. However, political harmony is unlikely to result from the outcome. In Pakistan, claims of vote-rigging and opposition parties calling for a national strike against President Musharraf. The outcome exacerbated bitterness among opposition parties. The U.S. State Department criticized Pakistan's poor human rights record in 2004, highlighting restrictions on citizens' right to change their government and weak political parties. The judiciary in Pakistan is corrupt, inefficient, and susceptible to political pressure. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom criticized Pakistan's inadequate response to religiously motivated violence and recommended it be designated a Country of Particular Concern. Islamabad rejects U.S. criticism of its human rights record, stating that efforts are being made to improve the situation. Independent observers highlight ongoing human rights issues and lack of full democracy in Pakistan. Freedom House rated Pakistan as \"not free\" in political rights and civil liberties for the sixth consecutive year. Freedom House rated Pakistan as \"not free\" in political rights and civil liberties, with human rights groups criticizing the government for violent repression of opposition rallies and maintaining control over economic resources. The United States was chided for providing military aid to Pakistan despite human rights violations. Pakistan's leading human rights organization blamed the government for increasing violations and failing to maintain law and order. Independent human rights groups have accused the Islamabad government of contradicting President Musharraf's policy of \"enlightened moderation.\" In March, ruling party parliamentarians allied with Islamists to reject legislation against \"honor killings.\" Prime Minister Aziz's cabinet reversed a decision to remove a religious column on Pakistani passports, following protests by Islamist politicians. In April, police clashed with Islamist protestors in Gujranwala over women's participation in a foot race. In West Frontier Province, Islamist groups attacked race participants with weapons. Human rights activists in Lahore were dispersed by police, leading to arrests. Journalists in Islamabad and Lahore were also targeted by police. The treatment of women in Pakistan was scrutinized in 2005. In 2005, Secretary Rocca expressed dismay at travel restrictions on Pakistani gang rape victim Mukhtaran Mai. President Musharraf imposed restrictions to protect Pakistan's image from Western NGOs. Musharraf faced criticism for his handling of the case, labeled a \"public relations disaster.\" In 2005, President Musharraf faced criticism for his comment on rape in Pakistan being a \"money-making concern\" at the U.N. General Assembly. Concerns about \"Islamization\" and anti-American sentiment in Pakistan were also raised, with a majority of citizens supporting religion playing a key role in politics. Islamist laws were passed in provinces like the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. In 2005, efforts to establish Islamist legal councils in provinces like Baluchistan and the NWFP raised concerns about replicating harsh Islamic law enforcement seen in Afghanistan. President Musharraf vowed to combat religious extremism, leading to the Supreme Court blocking unconstitutional clauses in a controversial \"Hasba\" bill. Pakistan's Islamists criticize military operations, resist religious school reforms, and oppose cooperation with the U.S. government. Islamists in Pakistan, particularly the MMA, criticize Islamabad's cooperation with the U.S. government and have been linked to assassination attempts on President Musharraf. Their political influence in western provinces is tied to their acceptance of the current political system. Despite their anti-Western sentiments, they are cautious not to jeopardize their own standing by pushing too hard against the Musharraf regime. The Pakistani army, radicalized by Gen. Zia's policies in the 1980s, harbors Muslim hardliners. A 2005 Pew Center poll showed 51% of Pakistanis trust Osama bin Laden, while only 6% believe in U.S. sincerity in combating terrorism. Pakistan is seen as highly anti-American, with sentiments ranging from radical Islamists to Westernized elites. The leadership of Pakistan's Islamist groups, including Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat-Ulema-Islami, express strong anti-American sentiments and call for jihad against perceived threats to Pakistani sovereignty. They oppose President Musharraf's cooperation with the United States and are critical of the U.S.-supported Kabul government. Despite their rhetoric, Pakistan's Islamists have gained from Musharraf's actions undermining mainstream politics. Islamists in Pakistan have benefited from Musharraf's weakening of mainstream parties, forming a cohesive political force challenging his policies. Pakistan receives significant U.S. aid, with a pledge of $3 billion for FY2005-FY2009. Musharraf's seizure of power in 1999 led to penalties under Section 508 of the foreign assistance appropriations act. In response to Musharraf's seizure of power in 1999, penalties were imposed under Section 508 of the foreign assistance appropriations act. Congress waived coup-related aid restrictions for FY2002 and granted the President waiver authority for FY2003. Subsequent legislation extended the President's waiver authority through FY2006. Since August 2003, Pakistan and USAID have collaborated on a five-year grant program to enhance democracy in Pakistan. Over $32 million has been allocated for six \"good governance\" projects, with a total expected amount to double over five years. The projects aim to strengthen legislative bodies, political institutions, and the justice sector to promote democratic, responsive, and transparent governance in Pakistan. The U.S. has provided assistance to Pakistan to strengthen governance through legislative bodies, political parties, and civil society. There is concern about political succession in Pakistan and control of its nuclear arsenal. The designated successor to the President is currently Muhammadmian Soomro, a member of PML-Q and a Musharraf loyalist. The potential removal of President Musharraf in Pakistan could lead to the military declaring martial law and ruling directly. Despite concerns about political institutions surviving his removal, the military is seen as a stabilizing force in the short- and middle-term due to its hierarchical solidarity and professionalism. After President Musharraf's potential removal, doubts linger about the survival of political institutions he built. Concerns arise over the continuity of pro-U.S. policies, with speculation on potential successors like Gen. Mohammed Yusuf or Gen. Mohammad Aziz. The military's role in purging pro-Taliban elements adds complexity to the succession scenario. Gen. Aziz, one of Pakistan's highest-ranking officers with links to Islamist groups, retired in 2004. His replacement, Gen. Hayat, narrowly escaped assassination in 2004, confirming his stance against Islamic extremists. Gen. Hayat is a close ally of President Musharraf and a likely successor as Army Chief. The government under President Musharraf continues to face challenges. The government under President Musharraf faces challenges as opposition groups struggle to unite against his administration. Differences over religious governance, blasphemy laws, and women's rights hinder opposition efforts. Military tactics of \"divide-and-rule\" contribute to opposition disunity, despite previous hints of accommodation between Musharraf and opposition parties. Pakistan's unstable domestic security situation, including tensions with Pashtun tribes near Afghanistan and ongoing sectarian violence, may improve the army's standing with some of the public. Criticism of Pakistan's slow progress towards democracy is seen as arbitrary and could potentially limit cooperation with the United States. Pakistan has made significant progress since the 1990s, with improved macroeconomic indicators and warmer relations with India under President Musharraf's leadership. Despite some critics, the government's international standing has been partially rehabilitated, especially as a key member of the anti-terrorism coalition. The strengthening of democratic institutions and civil society is seen as crucial for a stable and prosperous Pakistani state, despite concerns about potential military rule. Despite some progress in civilian governance prospects in Pakistan, military rule continues with little power transferred to civilian leaders. Musharraf's intention to extend his term raised concerns of nondemocratic leadership. Critics are skeptical of his pledges to combat extremism. Foreign and defense ministers assure his civilian candidacy in the 2007 elections. President Musharraf has given assurances that he will contest the 2007 elections as a civilian, but has not ruled out remaining in uniform. The military's control over Pakistan's governance and the success of Islamist forces in blocking reforms raise doubts about Musharraf's claims of pursuing \"enlightened moderation.\" US policy options for Pakistan include maintaining the status quo, increasing pressure, offering incentives, and adjusting aid programs. The Bush Administration has not publicly criticized Pakistan's democratization process but encourages movement towards full democracy. No conditions have been placed on U.S. aid to Pakistan, with hopes for free and fair elections in 2007. Increased pressure options are being considered by the United States to push for reforms in Pakistan. Pressure: The United States is considering options to increase pressure on the Pakistan government for democratization, such as ending or reducing aid with democracy-related benchmarks. Some argue that without conditionality on aid, the Pakistani military may not fully remove itself from governance. Another option is offering additional aid linked to Pakistan's progress. U.S. policy may involve offering additional aid to Pakistan tied to its domestic reform agenda, cooperation in counterterrorism, and nonproliferation. Incentives could benefit the country or the military, such as the sale of major U.S. weapons platforms as a reward for successful implementation of democracy or certain actions towards that goal. Adjusting aid programs is also being considered as part of President Bush's aid plan for Pakistan. President Bush's 2005-2009 aid plan for Pakistan emphasizes a 50-50 split of funds for economic and military financing. A policy recommended by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society taskforce suggests prioritizing economic aid to bolster Pakistan's social and economic development, democratization, and education reform. Skeptics argue for ensuring Pakistan's military security due to ongoing security threats from neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan's strategic setting, large Muslim population, and history of regional conflict make stability and governance crucial. The stability and quality of governance in Pakistan are important to U.S. policymakers."
