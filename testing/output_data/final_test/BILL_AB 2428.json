    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that SB 375 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California by requiring metropolitan areas to develop sustainable communities strategies. Local officials play a crucial role in implementing SB 375 by coordinating regional housing needs with transportation processes while maintaining local land use authority. Plan Bay Area, adopted in 2013, aims to accommodate the Bay Area's expected growth of 2,000,000 people over the next 25 years. It focuses on meeting 80 percent of the region's housing needs in priority development areas with access to transit and amenities. The direct relationship between development planning for population growth in Priority Development Areas (PDAs) and the provision of open space and amenities to support projected growth is highlighted in San Francisco. A 2014 Citywide Nexus Analysis in San Francisco documents the correlation between population growth and the cost of new open-space infrastructure. This includes providing recreation and open space such as baseball diamonds, soccer fields, parks, playgrounds, tennis courts, flower gardens, community gardens, and greenways, which is a capital-intensive endeavor due to limited land availability and high land prices in the city. To achieve the goals of SB 375, future development in San Francisco's Priority Development Areas (PDAs) aims to be walkable, bikeable, and close to public transit, jobs, schools, shopping, parks, and recreation. Many PDAs lack open space and are near freeways, with potential open-space areas under Caltrans' jurisdiction being too costly to lease. One strategy to support statewide SB 375 goals is to decrease land costs for additional open space. An intergovernmental partnership could involve low-cost leases with Caltrans for freeway areas in PDAs. San Francisco would then build and maintain new open space on these lands to accommodate future growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. San Francisco has successfully implemented open-space projects under Caltrans freeways, including recreational uses like volleyball and basketball courts in the Mission Bay Area and a dog park and skatepark in the SoMa West area. These projects, negotiated in partnership with Caltrans, could serve as models for more financially feasible open-space projects. San Francisco could meet its SB 375 goals by utilizing under-freeway open spaces, allowing for localized decision-making and better planning for future growth and emissions reduction. A proposed amendment to the Streets and Highways Code would permit leasing of under-freeway airspace for emergency shelter or feeding programs in the city. Any airspace under or adjacent to a freeway in San Francisco, not excess property, within a priority development area, must be leased for park, recreational, or open-space purposes to the city, county, or state agency. Lease amount for emergency shelter or feeding programs is $1 per month, and for park purposes, it is 10% or less of the fair market value. The lease amount for emergency shelter or feeding programs or park, recreational, or open-space purposes may be paid in advance to reduce administrative costs. An administrative fee of up to $500 per year may be required for lease administration. The lease for park, recreational, or open-space purposes requires the lessee to fund and construct infrastructure, accept liability, and cover maintenance costs. The lessee can generate revenue to offset maintenance costs, with excess revenue shared with the state. The lease of real property for park, recreational, or open-space purposes in a priority development area serves a public purpose as defined by the Legislature."
