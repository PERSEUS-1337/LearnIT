    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Black Hills National Cemetery Boundary Expansion Act\" and involves the withdrawal and transfer of public land for cemetery use. Prior to the withdrawal and transfer of public lands for cemetery use, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must conduct due diligence activities to confirm suitability. Upon completion and confirmation, the public lands described shall be transferred for cemetery purposes. Coordination with the Secretary of the Interior is required during these activities. The public lands described in subsection (c) are withdrawn from appropriation under public land laws, deemed property, and transferred to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for use as national cemeteries. The lands must undergo suitability confirmation before transfer for cemetery purposes, requiring coordination with the Secretary of the Interior. The approximately 200 acres of land adjacent to Black Hills National Cemetery in South Dakota, depicted as \"Proposed National Cemetery Expansion\" on a map dated June 16, 2016, will be transferred for cemetery use. The boundary of the cemetery will be modified to include these public lands. Public Land Order 2112 dated June 6, 1960, will be modified to exclude lands identified in subsection (c). SEC. 3. LEGAL DESCRIPTIONS. The Secretary of the Interior will publish legal descriptions of public lands suitable for cemetery purposes in the Federal Register. These descriptions will have the same legal force as if included in the Act, with the Secretary able to correct errors. Maps and legal descriptions will be available for public inspection at the Bureau of Land Management and the National Cemetery Administration offices. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will reimburse the Secretary of the Interior for costs incurred in implementing this section, including surveys. SEC. 4. RESTORATION TO PUBLIC LANDS FOR NON-CEMETERY USE. Upon determination by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that lands withdrawn for cemetery purposes will not be used as such, administrative jurisdiction will be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is responsible for decontamination costs of lands to be restored to public lands. The lands subject to a notice under subsection (a) can be restored to public lands upon acceptance by the Secretary of the Interior and a determination of suitability. The Secretary may open the lands to operation of public land laws if deemed suitable for restoration. The House of Representatives passed the bill on February 6, 2017. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
