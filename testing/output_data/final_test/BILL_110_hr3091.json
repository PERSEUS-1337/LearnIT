Mink Fellowship\" with specific findings, purpose, and designation. The Congress finds that minority college enrollment is increasing, but the employment of women and minorities as faculty in higher education lags behind, especially among American Indian, Alaskan Natives, and women of color. In 1999, only 14 percent of faculty were minorities, with African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic American, and American Indian/Alaskan Native representation. In 1999, minority faculty in higher education included 53,401 African American, 30,961 Hispanic American, 48,892 Asian/Pacific Islander, and 4,429 American Indian/Alaskan Native out of 1,027,830 total faculty. Women made up over one-third of full-time instructional faculty, with men outnumbering women in all faculty rank categories except for Instructor and Lecturer positions. Minority faculty absence affects minority students' educational experiences. The purpose of the program is to provide fellowship awards to assist qualified minorities and women in obtaining advanced degrees for entering the higher education professoriate. The presence of minority and women faculty is crucial for student access, retention, and academic environment improvement. Eligible institutions are those offering postgraduate programs. The program provides fellowship awards to assist minorities and women in obtaining advanced degrees for entering the higher education professoriate. Recipients of the fellowship award are known as 'Patsy T. Mink Graduate Fellows'.
