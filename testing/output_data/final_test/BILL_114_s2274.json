Section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to include an Indian veterans housing rental assistance program, with definitions for \"Indian\" and \"Indian area\" provided. The Determination Act of 1996 allows the Secretary to use up to 5 percent of rental assistance funds for a program benefiting Indian veterans in collaboration with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Determination Act of 1996 allows the Secretary to use rental assistance funds to benefit Indian veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, residing on or near Indian areas. The program is modeled on the rental assistance and supportive housing program, with necessary modifications for Indian grant recipients to serve eligible Indian veterans. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 allows rental assistance for eligible Native American veterans based on need, administrative capacity, and other funding criteria set by the Secretary. Rental assistance for Native American veterans will be administered according to the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, with grantees required to submit reports on the use of the assistance to the Secretary. The Secretary will gather information to assess the program's effectiveness in serving eligible veterans. Consultation with recipients of grants under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act will ensure the delivery of rental assistance and supportive services to eligible individuals. The Secretary may waive or specify alternative requirements for rental assistance under this subparagraph if necessary for effective delivery. The Secretary may waive or specify alternative requirements for rental assistance to Indian veterans, except for provisions related to labor standards or the environment."
