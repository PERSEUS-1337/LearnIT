    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Caring for an Aging America Act of 2008\". It includes findings related to aging population. Congress finds that the aging population in the United States is growing rapidly, with projections showing a significant increase in older adults by 2030. There is a concern that the healthcare workforce is not adequately prepared to meet the needs of this aging population, leading to issues such as misdiagnoses and medication errors. The lack of adequate training in geriatrics among healthcare professionals leads to misdiagnoses, medication errors, and inappropriate care for older patients. Medical students, psychologists, and nurses report feeling unprepared to care for older adults, highlighting a significant gap in geriatric education across healthcare disciplines. By 2050, the US will require three times more direct care workers to meet the needs of the aging population. Only 5% of social workers are trained in aging, yet 70% have worked with older adults. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Geriatric and Gerontology Loan Repayment Program to strengthen recruitment and retention for geriatric care practice. The Secretary will establish a Geriatric and Gerontology Loan Repayment Program to address workforce shortages in geriatric care. Individuals will enter contracts to provide full-time service to older adults for at least 2 years, receiving up to $35,000 annually towards educational loans. The Geriatric and Gerontology Loan Repayment Program offers loan repayments of up to $40,000 per year for individuals who have completed specialty training in geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, geriatrics, gerontology, or social work. The Geriatric and Gerontology Loan Repayment Program offers loan repayments for individuals with specialty training in geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, geropsychology, or social work. Applicants must have a degree in medicine, psychology, social work, or related fields, and be enrolled in an accredited program of specialty training. The Geriatric and Gerontology Loan Repayment Program offers loan repayments for individuals with specialty training in geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, geropsychology, or social work. Applicants must have obtained an educational loan for graduate training in medicine, psychology, or social work, be licensed in the state of practice, and agree to provide clinical services to older adults for at least 2 years in a designated setting. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program provisions apply to the Geriatric and Gerontology Loan Repayment Program. A National Advisory Council will be established to advise the Secretary on program matters.

Council members are appointed for 3-year terms and represent eligible health professions and associations. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports to Congress on the program's details, including loan repayments, recipients' practice locations, and participant demographics. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program provisions include details on participant demographics, default rates, interactions with other federal loan repayment programs, overall costs and benefits, and definitions of geriatrics and gerontology. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program includes provisions for specialty training in geriatrics and gerontology, with authorized appropriations of $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, $9,500,000 for fiscal year 2010, $16,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, $24,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $30,500,000 for fiscal year 2013.

SEC. 772. HEALTH AND LONG-TERM CARE WORKFORCE ADVISORY PANEL FOR AN AGING AMERICA is added to the Public Health Service Act to address workforce needs in long-term care services for an aging population.
