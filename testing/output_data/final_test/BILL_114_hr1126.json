The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the United States Postal Service, shall establish a program to provide postal benefits to qualified individuals who are active duty members of the Armed Forces serving in designated hostile fire areas or hospitalized due to service-related injuries. The postal benefits under this Act consist of vouchers entitling qualified individuals to mailings free of postage within designated areas served by a US post office. The Act provides vouchers for qualified individuals to send specific types of mail free of postage within designated areas served by a US post office. Each individual is eligible for one voucher per month and the voucher can only be used for a single qualified mailing before the expiration date set by the Secretary of Defense. The Act provides vouchers for qualified individuals to send specific types of mail free of postage within designated areas served by a US post office. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Postal Service, will prescribe regulations within 30 days of the Act's enactment to ensure timely provision of vouchers to qualified individuals. Procedures will be established to ensure compliance with the number of vouchers provided to qualified individuals for mailing purposes. Funding for the program will be established. The Department of Defense is authorized to appropriate funds for providing benefits described in section 2(c) for fiscal years 2016 through 2021, not to exceed $75 million. The Department shall transfer an amount to the Postal Service in advance of each calendar quarter for postal benefits under this Act. The Department of Defense will adjust postal benefits quarterly based on previous determinations, with an annual correction for fiscal years 2016-2020. Final determinations will be made to ensure accuracy. The Department of Defense will make final determinations on postal benefits adjustments within 6 months after fiscal year 2021. Consultation with the Postal Service is required for all estimates and determinations under this section. The postal benefits under this Act will be applicable to mail sent from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2021."
