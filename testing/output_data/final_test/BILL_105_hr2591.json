    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Holocaust Victims Redress Act\" and includes provisions related to heirless assets. The Congress found that among German and Swiss assets seized during World War II, there were assets belonging to Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Legislation was enacted to address the issue of legal heirs for these assets. Legislation was enacted to authorize the transfer of up to $3,000,000 of assets to organizations providing relief for Holocaust survivors. Due to administrative difficulties, a lump-sum settlement of $500,000 was provided to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of New York in 1962. In June 1997, a representative of the Secretary of State urged reconsideration of the $500,000 settlement for Holocaust victims. It is important to recognize the moral claim of Holocaust victims to unrestituted assets. The United States should lead in meeting obligations to Holocaust victims to strengthen efforts for the distribution of remaining gold assets. The Tripartite Commission still holds metric tons of gold looted by Nazi Germany during World War II. The United States is urging nations claiming a portion of the gold to contribute to Holocaust survivors, as the gold includes assets stolen from individual victims. The Act aims to provide justice to survivors. The Act aims to provide justice to Holocaust survivors worldwide by appropriating funds to compensate for assets stolen from heirless victims and urging nations to contribute gold held by the Tripartite Commission to assist survivors. SEC. 102. DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE TRIPARTITE GOLD COMMISSION. The Secretary of State is directed to seek an agreement for signatories of the Paris Agreement on Reparation to contribute gold to assist Holocaust survivors. The Secretary may commit up to $25,000,000 for distribution under this agreement. The authority in paragraph (1) is effective only to the extent and amounts provided in advance in appropriation Acts. SEC. 103 authorizes appropriations for the President to distribute funds to organizations meeting the needs of Holocaust survivors in the U.S. A portion of the funds is reserved for the U.S. Holocaust Museum for archival research and activities promoting Holocaust remembrance and education. Congress acknowledges the prohibition of pillage and seizure of works of art under international law, as well as the efforts to prevent illicit import and export of cultural property. The Nazis defied these laws by extorting and looting art during World War II. During World War II, the Nazis looted art from occupied countries to finance their aggression. This policy of art theft was a key element in their genocide campaign, particularly targeting individuals of Jewish and other cultural backgrounds. The international legal principles that apply to stolen assets should also be applied to art taken from Holocaust victims after the war. Art looted by Nazis during World War II was transferred to the Soviet Union and has not been returned to rightful owners. The Congress urges governments to facilitate the return of private and public property, like works of art, taken during Nazi rule, to rightful owners with reasonable proof of ownership."
