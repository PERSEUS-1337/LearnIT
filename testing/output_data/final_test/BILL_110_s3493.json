    "content": "SECTION 1. POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEMS. Rail carriers, including Class I railroads, those with poor safety performance, and those providing passenger rail services, must submit a plan for implementing a positive train control system by December 31, 2014. The Secretary may offer technical assistance in developing these plans. Positive train control systems aim to prevent train collisions and derailments caused by overspeed. Rail carriers, including Class I railroads, must submit a plan for implementing a positive train control system by December 31, 2014. The system aims to minimize train collisions, overspeed derailments, and protect maintenance-of-way workers. The plan should include measurable goals and a timeline. The Secretary of Transportation may provide technical assistance in developing these plans. Rail carriers must submit a plan for implementing a positive train control system by December 31, 2014. The plan should include measurable goals, prioritization of implementation, detailed steps, and any other elements deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Within 90 days of receiving the plan, the Secretary will review and approve it. Rail carriers must correct deficiencies in their positive train control system plan within 30 days of receiving notice from the Secretary. Once approved, carriers must comply with the plan's goals, strategy, and timeline. The Secretary will conduct an annual review to ensure compliance with the submitted plan. Rail carriers must implement positive train control systems by December 31, 2012, in high-risk areas with shared tracks. The Secretary will submit a progress report to relevant committees by December 31, 2011. Certification by the Secretary is required before installing any positive train control system or component. The Secretary must certify that a positive train control system or component has not had a safety-critical failure before installation. If a failure occurs, it can be repaired and evaluated according to regulations. The Secretary can enforce civil penalties for violations, including failure to submit or certify. Failure to submit, certify, or comply with a plan for implementing a positive train control system is a violation that can result in civil penalties. Civil penalties for violations of various chapters in title 49, United States Code, have been increased. The amendments include raising penalties from $10,000 to $25,000 and from $20,000 to $100,000 for different types of violations."
