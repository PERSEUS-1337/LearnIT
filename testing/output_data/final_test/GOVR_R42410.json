    "content": "The 112th Congress prioritized federal R&D activities amidst concerns about the federal debt and budget deficits. The U.S. government supports a wide range of scientific and engineering research for national defense, health, environment, and energy security, aiming to advance knowledge, develop workforce, and enhance innovation and competitiveness. The federal government plays a crucial role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. Congress defines the nation's R&D priorities and faces challenges in allocating funding amidst concerns about the federal fiscal condition, deficit, and debt. The report provides analyses of the President's FY2013 request for R&D funding, congressional actions on appropriations legislation, and specific information on appropriations enacted by Congress in the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. Agency FY2013 appropriations were subject to rescissions and sequestration, making it challenging to determine R&D funding levels for some agencies. Funding may need to be reallocated across disciplines, programs, or agencies to address priorities. The agency's R&D funding level may not be known until included in the President's FY2015 budget request or agency budget justifications. Final appropriations may not be resolved until after the President's next fiscal year budget request. Some agencies may provide funding estimates publicly or privately. Determination of funding levels can be complicated by factors like rescissions, sequestration, and transfers. President Obama's proposed FY2013 budget included $140.820 billion for R&D in FY2013. The President's FY2013 budget included $140.820 billion for R&D, a 1.4% increase over FY2012. The budget emphasized funding for physical sciences and engineering, aligning with the America COMPETES Act and Reauthorization Act. The President's FY2013 budget included $140.820 billion for R&D, a 1.4% increase over FY2012. Funding for targeted accounts in FY2011-FY2013 fell short of authorized levels, with a 3.1% decrease in appropriations for FY2013. President Obama aimed to increase national R&D investment to over 3% of GDP. President Obama aimed to increase national R&D investment to over 3% of GDP, which would require a substantial increase in public and/or private investment. Reaching this goal would have required a 4.4% increase in national R&D spending based on 2009 figures. Concerns have been raised about the potential harm of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding. The biomedical research community faced challenges after the NIH budget doubled in FY2003, leading to rapid growth in infrastructure and faculty hiring. However, the budget decreased annually from FY2004 to FY2009, causing disruptions in research, fewer funded grant proposals, decreased student interest in biomedical studies, and limited job prospects for researchers. The NIH budget doubling in FY2003 led to challenges for the biomedical research community, including disruptions in research, decreased grant proposals, and limited job prospects for researchers with advanced degrees. Funding for targeted accounts grew by 28% from FY2006 to FY2010 but fell 3.6% between FY2010 and FY2013. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complex due to various factors, leading to discrepancies in agency budget figures reported by different offices. The President's FY2013 budget request included the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund, aimed at supporting wireless technology development and public safety applications. NIST was set to receive up to $300 million from the fund for research and development of new standards and technologies in public safety communications. The President's FY2013 budget request included the establishment of a competitive grant fund, awarding $70-75 million per year for research projects. Federal R&D funding is primarily viewed from agency and program perspectives, with seven agencies receiving 95.8% of total funding. The President's FY2013 budget request included significant increases in R&D funding for various agencies, with the Department of Commerce receiving the largest increase at 104.5%. Other agencies such as DOE, HHS, NSF, and NASA also saw notable increases in funding. However, DOD and USDA faced reductions in R&D funding under the budget request. Overall, federal R&D funding is primarily distributed among seven agencies, with the majority of funding allocated to these agencies. Federal R&D funding in FY2013 saw increases in basic research, applied research, and development, with the Department of Commerce receiving the largest increase at 104.5%. Other agencies like DOE, HHS, NSF, and NASA also received notable funding boosts. However, DOD and USDA faced reductions in R&D funding. The overall federal R&D budget reflects national priorities, from spaceflight advances to energy sources. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research, funding 53.2% of U.S. basic research in 2009. In contrast, industry funded only 21.7% of U.S. basic research in 2009. The Department of Health and Human Services, mainly the National Institutes of Health (NIH), accounted for over half of all federal funding for basic research in the President's FY2013 budget request. Industry is the primary funder of applied research in the United States, accounting for 48.1% in 2009, while the federal government accounted for 42.2%. HHS is the largest funder of applied research, providing nearly half of all federally funded applied research in the President's FY2013 budget request. Industry also funds the majority of development, with 77.6% in 2009, compared to the federal government's 21.3%. DOD is the main federal agency funder of development, with 87.0% of total federal development funding in the President's FY2013 budget request. Federal R&D funding includes multiagency efforts like the National Nanotechnology Initiative and presidential initiatives. Obama's FY2013 budget requested funding for six multiagency R&D initiatives, following President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative to increase federal funding for physical sciences and engineering research. Congress authorized increases for targeted accounts under the America COMPETES Act, but actual funding fell short in subsequent appropriations acts. In 2010, Congress passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) authorizing appropriations levels for targeted accounts for FY2011-FY2013. President Obama's FY2013 budget requested $13.073 billion for targeted accounts, an increase of $544.0 million (4.3%) from FY2012, but below the authorized levels set in P.L. 111-358. The FY2013 appropriations for targeted accounts were $12.141 billion, below the authorized levels set in the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The compound annual growth rate between FY2006 and FY2013 appropriations is 3.0%, doubling in more than 23 years. President Obama's plan to double funding for basic research over 10 years at the ACI agencies is in question due to budget constraints. The FY2013 budget request reiterated the intention to double funding from FY2006 levels, but the timeframe was not specified. The FY2013 budget request included projections of budget authority for targeted accounts through FY2017, aiming for a doubling pace of more than 21 years. The President requested $1.766 billion for the National Nanotechnology Initiative for FY2013, a $70 million increase from FY2012. Under the Administration's FY2013 request, nanotechnology funding would have increased at the DOE, NSF, DOC, and EPA, while falling at the DOD. Final FY2013 appropriations figures for NNI R&D are not expected until the President's FY2015 budget is released. President Obama requested $3.807 billion in FY2013 funding for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program, with increases for NSF, DOE, DOC, and DHS. President Obama proposed $17 million (36.2%) for DHS in FY2013. DOD NITRD funding would have been reduced by $67 million (5.7%), while other agencies' funding would have remained flat. The President also proposed $2.563 billion for the US Global Change Research Program in FY2013, with increases for NASA, DOC, DOE, and DOI. Final appropriations figures for both NITRD and USGCRP R&D are not expected until the President's FY2015 budget is released. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) was announced in June 2011 to accelerate the discovery, manufacture, and deployment of advanced materials. Agencies are developing strategies to create new knowledge and tools for U.S. industries. Funding opportunities in FY 2012 and FY 2013 Budget reflect efforts to achieve national goals with advanced materials. OSTP Director John Holdren stated that the initiative aims to speed up understanding of materials science. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) aims to accelerate the discovery and deployment of advanced materials, providing practical information for American entrepreneurs and innovators. The Obama Administration launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) to invest in emerging technologies for creating manufacturing jobs and enhancing global competitiveness. The President's FY2013 budget included $2.2 billion for federal advanced manufacturing R&D, a 19% increase over FY2012. The National Robotics Initiative (NRI) aims to develop robots that enhance human capabilities in various sectors such as manufacturing, space missions, drug discovery, and food safety. Funding for next-generation robotics research is provided by NSF, NIH, NASA, USDA, and the Department of Defense. DOD supports the purchase of equipment for robotics research to advance defense technologies, including unmanned vehicles and autonomous systems. The President's FY2013 budget proposed the establishment of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) with a collaboration between NIST, DOD, DOE, and NSF. The NNMI would consist of a network of institutes focusing on developing new manufacturing technologies with broad applications to bridge the gap from the laboratory to the market. Each institute would have a unique technology focus to support manufacturing technology commercialization. The President's budget proposed $1 billion over 10 years for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) to bridge the gap from the laboratory to the market. Congress did not provide funding for this initiative in FY2013. The remainder of the report analyzes R&D funding for federal departments and agencies, with most appropriations bills still pending in Congress as of September 2012. The House passed Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (H.J.Res. 117) on September 13, 2012, providing appropriations for all agencies through March 27, 2013, at a rate for operations as provided in the applicable appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2012. H.J.Res. 117 included modifications to FY2012 funding levels, potentially impacting federal R&D funding. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 117 without amendment on September 22, 2012, and President Obama signed it into law (P.L. 112-175) on September 28. President Obama also signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) on March 26, 2013, providing appropriations for all agencies through the end of FY2013. Division A-E of regular appropriations acts for 2013 covered various agencies and departments. Division F provided continuing appropriations for departments not included in A-E. Section 3001 of Division G included across-the-board rescissions for projects and activities in Divisions A-E. Rescissions ranged from 0.1% to 2.513% for security and nonsecurity discretionary budget authority. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 included across-the-board rescissions of 2.513% in Divisions A and E, and 1.877% in Division B. The section aimed to prevent exceeding FY2013 discretionary spending limits, with additional rescissions possible if needed. OMB later calculated an additional rescission of 0.032% for security budget authority. Enactment of P.L. 113-6 required additional rescissions of 0.032% of security budget authority and 0.2% of non-security budget authority. FY2013 appropriations were also subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The report includes FY2013 funding levels after the rescissions and sequestration effects. Table 5 shows the regular appropriations bill for each agency, including R&D activities. CRS produces individual reports on appropriations bills accessible on their website. Congress supports research and development in the Department of Defense primarily through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation. RDT&E funds are appropriated in various parts of the defense appropriation bill, including the Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, and National Defense Sealift Fund. The Program supports health care delivery to DOD personnel and their families through RDT&E funds for research in cancer and other medical conditions. Congress appropriates funds for the program in Title VI of the defense appropriations bill. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program aims to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. Funds for this program are requested through the Procurement appropriation. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports the nation's naval reserve fleet and U.S. flagged merchant fleet. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) supports efforts in the Global War on Terror and Overseas Contingency Operations. It does not have an RDT&E line item like other programs, but funding is allocated for research. The fund is administered by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office. The Obama Administration includes Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds in the regular budget, not emergency supplementals. Additional OCO funds may be requested if needed. GWOT/OCO-related requests often include money for transfer funds like the Iraqi Freedom Fund and Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. The Obama Administration requested funds for various programs including the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund, and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each fund and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts. In FY2013, the Administration requested $69.408 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E and $246 million in OCO RDT&E, which was lower than the previous year's appropriations. Additionally, $673 million in RDT&E was requested through the Defense Health Program and $647 million through the Chemical Agents and Munitions Program. In FY2013, Congress authorized $69.938 billion for baseline RDT&E and $246 million in additional OCO RDT&E. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriation Act, 2013 provided $69.859 billion for baseline RDT&E, more than requested but nearly $6 billion less than appropriated in FY2012. Additionally, $248 million in OCO RDT&E was appropriated. Funding for RDT&E in the Defense Health Plan was nearly double the requested level, while $6 million less than requested was allocated for the National Defense Sealift Fund. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments, DOD agencies, and Defensewide accounts. It is categorized into budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 for research, and 6.4 and 6.5 for weapon system development. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support. The program established includes budget activities 6.6 and 6.7 for management support and system improvements. S&T funding supports new technology development and is crucial for U.S. military superiority. DOD sought to maintain a strong S&T posture in FY2013 with a funding request of $11.861 billion. Congress appropriated $12.471 billion for S&T, exceeding the request. The Department of Defense requested $11.861 billion for Science and Technology (S&T) in FY2013, but Congress appropriated $12.471 billion. Basic research (6.1) receives special attention, with over half of DOD's basic research budget spent at universities. The Administration requested $2.117 billion for basic research, Congress authorized $2.127 billion, and appropriated $2.128 billion. The Department of Homeland Security requested $1.179 billion for R&D in FY2013, a 20% increase from FY2012. The Department of Homeland Security requested $1.179 billion for R&D in FY2013, including funding for the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T), the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), and Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) in the U.S. Coast Guard. The House bill proposed $1.162 billion, while the Senate committee recommended the same amounts as the request. The final operating plan reflected a total of $1.123 billion, with the S&T Directorate being the primary DHS R&D organization. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 24% increase from the previous year. Funding for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) would have increased by $212 million, with the largest increase for disaster resilience R&D. There was a $50 million reduction in the request for Laboratory Facilities due to the omission of funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). DHS announced plans for an assessment of whether a facility like NBAF should be built. The House bill proposed $826 million for the S&T Directorate, $6 million less than the request. It included $72 million less for RDI and directed DHS to allocate the reduction. $75 million more was allocated for Laboratory Facilities, with the increase to be spent on NBAF construction. The Senate committee recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request, with separate amounts specified for each RDI thrust area. No funding was recommended for NBAF construction due to a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion. The operating plan included $801 million for the S&T Directorate, with funding for RDI at $432 million. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is responsible for combating nuclear threats and received a requested increase of 14% to $328 million for FY2013. The Administration proposed a $44 million increase for Transformational R&D, partially offset by a $23 million reduction for Systems Development. Funding for human-portable radiation detectors would increase by $20 million, while radiation portal monitors would decrease to $1 million from $7 million. The House bill proposed $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than the request, with reductions in the Transformational R&D program. It directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The committee recommended consolidating DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. The Senate committee recommended merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. They also directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The April 2013 operating plan included $303 million for DNDO, with $71 million for Transformational R&D. The FY2013 President's Budget request for NIH was $30.860 billion, the same as FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding NIH at $100 million higher than the President's request for FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 provided appropriations for Labor/HHS agencies through the end of FY2013, including an increase of almost $70 million for the NIH Office of the Director. The March 1, 2013 sequestration order and a transfer of funding under the authority of the HHS Secretary further reduced FY2013 funds. The FY2013 budget for NIH was reduced by $1.553 billion and $173 million due to sequestration and a transfer of funding. NIH supports a wide range of research and training, with 83% of its budget going to external research projects. The agency consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets policy for NIH and coordinates programs of all NIH components. Institutes and centers (ICs) focus on specific diseases or research areas. Congress provides separate appropriations to most ICs and OD. Funding for NIH primarily comes from the Labor/HHS appropriations bill. The NIH receives discretionary budget authority from the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. It also receives mandatory funding for type 1 diabetes research and funding for the National Library of Medicine. The total funding available for NIH activities is determined by the program level, and NIH is subject to a budget assessment called the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside redistributes funds among HHS agencies for program evaluation. In FY2012, the set-aside level was 2.5% of eligible appropriations, totaling over $1.0 billion. The FY2013 proposed increase to 3.2% was rejected, with the Senate Appropriations Committee calling for it to remain at 2.5%. In FY2013, the proposed increase of the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside to 3.2% was rejected, maintaining it at 2.5%. NIH was assessed over $700 million under P.L. 113-6. The FY2013 President's Budget Request for NIH emphasized basic research and organizational restructuring for translational medicine. Congress directed NIH to focus on basic biomedical and behavioral research, with 54% of the budget targeted for basic research. The FY2013 NIH budget request focused on basic research in genetics, regenerative medicine, and environmental influences. Advanced technologies like DNA sequencing and nanotechnology were emphasized for understanding complex diseases. The Cancer Genome Atlas project aimed to map genetic changes in cancer types. The creation of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences aimed to convert basic research into clinical applications. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) was created in FY2012 to consolidate preclinical and clinical translational sciences resources. NCATS aims to find faster and more cost-effective ways to test new drugs and therapies for human use. The FY2013 budget request for NCATS was $639 million, with a focus on expanding the Cures Acceleration Network. The FY2013 budget request for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) includes nearly $40 million to expand the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) and $463 million for the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program. Additionally, there are programs to support young scientists such as the NIH Director's New Innovator Award and Early Independence Program. The FY2013 budget request for NIH includes $12 million for an independent research career program, $775 million for the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards, and $276 million for the Institutional Development Awards program. The budget also focuses on analyzing workforce needs and promoting diversity in the biomedical field. In FY2013, the Administration did not request extra funding for the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) IDeA program, reducing the budget by $51 million from FY2012. The National Children's Study funding was reduced by nearly 15% to $165 million, with the pilot Vanguard Study moving to a less resource-intensive phase. Additional resources were allocated to Alzheimer's disease research in FY2012 and FY2013, with $50 million redirected in FY2012 and $80 million planned for FY2013. In FY2013, HHS planned to allocate $80 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund for new Alzheimer's research grants. The President's Budget requested $16.5 billion for research project grants, supporting approximately 35,888 awards, with 9,415 being competing grants. The average cost of a competing grant was $431,000. In FY2013, NIH proposed grant-funding policies to reduce the average cost of competing RPGs by 1% and maximize resources for young researchers. Additional scrutiny was planned for scientists with grant support of $1.5 million or more. Other funding mechanisms within the NIH budget were also proposed for changes. In FY2013, NIH proposed grant-funding policies to reduce the average cost of competing RPGs by 1% and maximize resources for young researchers. Other funding mechanisms within the NIH budget were also proposed for changes, including a decrease in support for research centers by $64 million to $2.966 billion, an increase in R&D contracts by $108 million to $3.076 billion, a gain of $21 million for the NIH intramural research program to $3.420 billion, and an increase of $1.7 million for research management and support to $1.535 billion. The Office of the Director would decrease by $28 million to $1.429 billion due to plans for the National Children's Study, with funding for the NIH Common Fund also included in this account. In FY2013, the NIH proposed grant-funding policies to reduce costs and support young researchers. The Senate Committee recommended a $100 million increase in Labor/HHS funding for NIH, with a 10% increase for NCATS. No extra funding for the IDeA program was provided in the bill. The committee report recommended an increase in funding for the National Institute on Aging for Alzheimer's research, but disagreed with allocating $80 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund for NIH research on Alzheimer's. Final FY2013 funding levels for NIH showed a decrease from FY2012, with RPGs receiving a reduced budget and fewer awards compared to the previous year. The Administration requested $12.763 billion for Department of Energy (DOE) R&D and related programs in FY2013, including activities in science, national security, and energy. The request was 8.2% more than the FY2012 appropriation. The House bill proposed $11.680 billion, while the Senate committee recommended $12.240 billion. The DOE Office of Science received a request of $4.992 billion, aiming to double its funding. The doubling goal was initiated in January 2006 with no specified completion date. The FY2013 request for the Office of Science was 37% more than the FY2006 baseline. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 authorized $6.007 billion for the Office of Science in FY2013. The House bill proposed $4.801 billion, while the Senate committee recommended $4.909 billion. The FY2013 operating plan provided $4.621 billion, a 5.2% reduction from FY2012. The Office of Science includes six major research programs, with a requested increase of $112 million for basic energy sciences (BES) for new science initiatives. The Administration proposal for the Linac Coherent Light Source-II was offset by a ramp-down in construction for the National Synchrotron Light Source-II. The House bill provided $142 million less than the request for BES, while the Senate committee recommended $88 million less. Both committees rejected the proposal for BES energy frontier research centers to collaborate with EERE. The U.S. contribution to ITER would have increased by $45 million, but funding for domestic fusion activities, including the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, would be reduced. The estimated total cost for the U.S. share of ITER remains between $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion, with a possibility of cost increases. The House bill would have provided $76 million more than the request for fusion, including domestic funding at the FY2012 level and $28 million more than requested for ITER. The Senate committee's recommendation for fusion was the same as the request. The request for DOE national security R&D was $4.054 billion, an 8.1% increase from $3.752 billion in FY2012. The request for nonproliferation and verification R&D included a one-time increment of $150 million for domestic uranium enrichment R&D and demonstration. The House bill would have provided the proposed increment for domestic uranium enrichment; the Senate committee rejected it. Final figures under the FY2013 operating plan are not yet available. The request for DOE energy R&D was $3.717 billion, up 17.3% from $3.168 billion in FY2012. In energy efficiency, funding for the Advanced Manufacturing Office would have increased by $174 million, building technologies and vehicle technologies by $91 million each, biomass and biorefinery systems by $71 million, while funding for water power and hydrogen and fuel cell technologies would have decreased. The request for fossil energy R&D reflected a decrease of $105 million, with an increase of $75 million for ARPA-E. The House-passed bill and Senate committee report included varying funding levels for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and ARPA-E. Under the FY2013 operating plan, energy efficiency and renewable energy received $1.599 billion, a reduction of 4.9% from the FY2012 enacted level. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering, established as an independent federal agency in 1950. It is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research, especially in fields like mathematics and computer science, and plays a significant role in federal STEM education programs. The President requested $7.373 billion in funding for NSF in FY2013, which was $268.4 million more than FY2012. The House-passed bill would have provided $7.333 billion, $40.6 million less than the request. Final FY2013 funding for NSF was $6.884 billion. Final FY2013 funding for the NSF was $6.884 billion, $220.6 million less than FY2012. Budget increases since FY2006 have been driven by the \"doubling path\" policy to double funding for targeted accounts. At a growth rate of 6.3%, it would take approximately 11 years to double funding for these accounts. The President's FY 2013 budget request aimed to establish a 4.1% compound annual growth rate for targeted accounts, similar to the previous year. However, due to sequestration and rescissions, the growth rate was reduced to 3.0% in FY2013. The House and Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed on similar appropriations levels for NSF's major accounts, with the main difference in the research account. The primary difference between the two proposals was in the main research account (Research and Related Activities or R&RA). The House would have provided $59.4 million more to the R&RA account in FY2013. Post-sequestration, post-rescission funding for NSF's main research account in FY2013 was $5.544 billion, which was less than the FY2012 actual funding level. The President's FY2013 request for R&RA was $5.983 billion, highlighting priorities in interdisciplinary research, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, materials, wireless communications, smart systems, and cybersecurity. The NSF requested increases for various research directorates, with the largest increase for Integrative Activities (IA) account, mainly for the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program and the INSPIRE program. They also sought an increase for the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program. The differences in funding for R&RA in FY2013 between the House, Senate committee, and the President were small, with slight variations in the proposed amounts. The House report on NSF funding for FY2013 prioritized cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, materials, and research in natural and physical sciences, math, and engineering. It included provisions for NSF's Advanced Manufacturing initiative and I-Corps recipients committing to domestic production. The report also endorsed NSF-proposed changes in R&RA, except for the proposed termination of political science research funding. The House report on NSF funding for FY2013 prioritized cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, materials, and research in natural and physical sciences, math, and engineering. It included provisions for NSF's Advanced Manufacturing initiative and I-Corps recipients committing to domestic production. H.Rept. 112-463 endorsed NSF-proposed changes in R&RA, except for the termination of the Communicating Science Broadly program. The Senate committee report highlighted support for scientific facilities and instrumentation, provided funding for astronomical sciences and cybersecurity research, and expressed concerns about funding levels for the Academic Research Fleet. Additionally, the report allocated funding for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope pre-construction planning and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The FY2013 NSF funding was $158.2 million, $7.1 million more than FY2012. The explanatory statement included provisions on R&RA terminations, advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity research, and I-Corps. It rejected Senate report limitations on OneNSF initiatives but emphasized the balance between core functions and OneNSF initiatives in future budget requests. Additionally, $247.6 million was provided pre-sequestration. The FY2013 budget request for NSF included $247.6 million for astronomical sciences and $158.2 million for EPSCoR. Other accounts funding R&D at NSF include E&HR and MREFC, with FY2013 post-sequestration funding close to FY2012 levels. The FY2013 budget request for E&HR aimed to emphasize core R&D activities, scholarships, and partnerships. The FY2013 budget request for NSF aimed to reframe education programs by emphasizing core R&D activities, scholarships, and partnerships. The President's request sought $20.0 million in new funding to establish the reframing effort and included funding for a new initiative called Expeditions in Education (E2). The goal of E2 activities was to address STEM education challenges using current or emerging areas of science. Funding for the GRF program in E&HR was requested at $121.5 million, with a reduction in funding for the IGERT program. Funding for minority-serving institutions (MSIs) would have continued at FY2012 levels. The FY2013 NSF budget request did not include specified funding for Hispanic-serving institutions or new MREFC projects. Two of MREFC's funded projects were in the second-to-last year of their funding cycles. Both the full House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations would have funded E&HR and MREFC at the requested levels in FY2013. There were differences between House and Senate recommendations for certain E&HR sub-accounts, with the House providing the requested level of funding for NSF's MSI programs. The FY2013 budget request for NSF did not include funding for Hispanic-serving institutions or new MREFC projects. The House and Senate had differences in their recommendations for NSF's MSI programs, ATE program, and ISE program. The explanatory statement incorporated Senate report funding levels for MSI programs, directed NSF to fund AISL as described in the Senate report, and provided $69.0 million for ATE. The FY2013 request did not include increases for NSF's administrative accounts. The FY2013 request for NSF did not include funding increases for administrative accounts. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the \"OneNSF Framework\" and its initiatives. The OneNSF Framework aimed to enable operations across organizational and disciplinary boundaries, including investments in smart systems, cyberinfrastructure, and sustainability. Funding levels for administrative accounts were reduced from FY2012 levels. The FY2013 NSF request included funding increases for the OneNSF Framework priorities, but the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended reducing funding for these activities. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about administrative clarity and encouraged clear standards for OneNSF activities. Other NSF-wide investments in the FY2013 request included the National Nanotechnology Initiative, Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program, and U.S. Global Climate Change Research program. Additionally, the FY2013 request proposed cutting or consolidating 11 foundation programs totaling $67.0 million. The FY2013 NASA budget request included $16.291 billion for R&D, which was 2.8% more than the previous year but 11.3% less than authorized. The House proposed $16.049 billion, the Senate $16.305 billion, and the final operating plan allocated $15.491 billion. 11 foundation programs totaling $67.0 million were proposed for cutting or consolidation. The requested increase in NASA R&D funding in FY2013 was possible due to the retirement of the space shuttles, which were classified as operational expenses. The last shuttle flight was in July 2011, with closeout costs in FY2013 totaling $39 million. The Administration's $4.911 billion request for NASA's Science account in FY2013 was 3.5% less than the previous year, with funding for planetary science decreasing by $308.1 million or 20.5%. Most of the reduction was in the Mars exploration program. In November 2011, NASA planned to launch the MAVEN mission in 2013 and end its participation in the ExoMars missions in 2016 and 2018. A new Mars exploration strategy integrating robotic missions with human spaceflight was planned. Funding for the James Webb Space Telescope was set to increase by $98.0 million or 18.5% under the Administration's request. Congress capped the cost of JWST development and mandated annual reports on the program. The House-passed bill would have allocated $5.095 billion for Science, $184 million more than the request. The House report recommended $5.095 billion for Science, $184 million more than the request, with an increase of $88 million for a future Mars sample return mission. If NASA's new Mars strategy did not include a sample return mission, the $88 million increase should be reallocated to a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. The Senate committee suggested $5.021 billion for Science, $110 million more than the request, with a $100 million increase for Mars Exploration. Despite an overall reduction in funding, JWST and Mars Exploration received requested levels of funding. Aeronautics saw a decrease to $551.5 million, with research on hypersonic entry, descent, and landing proposed to be transferred to the Space. The Administration proposed transferring hypersonic research to the Space Technology account and eliminating funding for air-breathing hypersonic flight systems. Both House and Senate committees expressed concern about the changes in NASA's hypersonics research. The House committee directed NASA to work with the Department of Defense on defining roles, while the Senate committee requested a report on maintaining hypersonics expertise. The August 2013 operating plan included $529.5 million for Aeronautics and the Administration requested $699.0 million for Space Technology. The Administration requested $699.0 million for Space Technology in FY2013, with a 21.6% increase from FY2012. The National Research Council recommended emphasis on 16 technology areas, with NASA investing in all of them. The House-passed bill proposed $632.5 million, the Senate committee recommended $651.0 million, and the operating plan included $614.5 million. Exploration funding in FY2013 was $3.933 billion, a 4.3% increase from FY2012. In FY2013, Exploration funding was $3.933 billion, a 4.3% increase from FY2012. This account supports the development of the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift rocket for human space exploration beyond Earth orbit, as well as the commercial crew transportation systems for U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of NASA's human spaceflight program due to funding shortfalls relative to the authorization act. NASA officials stated that adequate funding would allow for key milestones such as the first uncrewed flight of the SLS in 2017 and the first crewed flight in 2021. The House-passed bill allocated $3.712 billion for Exploration, with more funding for MPCV and SLS but less for commercial crew compared to the request. The Senate committee recommended $3.909 billion, with increased funding for Exploration Systems Development and reduced funding for commercial crew. The August 2013 operating plan included $3.706 billion for Exploration, slightly less than the request. The ISS budget request was $3.008 billion, a 6.3% increase from FY2012, mainly for ISS crew and cargo transportation. The House-passed bill allocated $2.990 billion for ISS crew and cargo transportation, while the Senate committee recommended $2.958 billion. The operating plan included $2.776 billion for the ISS. Additionally, the Senate committee recommended $1.641 billion for NASA to acquire operational satellites for NOAA. Transferring the appropriation from NOAA to NASA would not have directly affected NASA R&D funding. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aims to support U.S. companies by developing technologies and advancing government-developed innovations. The President's FY2013 budget requested $857.0 million for NIST, with a focus on research and development in the Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS) account. In FY2013, the budget for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was $857.0 million. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program under the Industrial Technology Services (ITS) account received $128.0 million, with a proposed new activity called Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia (AMTech) receiving $21.0 million. The construction budget saw an increase to $60.0 million. Additionally, two new programs were proposed for mandatory appropriations, including $300.0 million for the Wireless Innovation Fund and $1.000 billion for other initiatives. The auction supported the Wireless Innovation Fund with $1.000 billion for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. S. 2323 proposed $826.0 million for NIST in FY2013, with increases for STRS and MEP accounts. H.R. 5326 would have funded NIST at $830.2 million, an increase of 10.6% over FY2012. In FY2013, funding for NIST increased to $769.4 million, with $579.8 million allocated to the STRS account, $119.4 million for MEP, and $21.0 million for AMTech. Construction received $60.0 million, accounting for rescissions and sequestration. In FY2013, NIST's funding increased to $769.4 million, with $579.8 million for STRS, $119.4 million for MEP, and $21.0 million for AMTech. The construction budget rose by 1% to $60.0 million. Some Members of Congress have questioned the use of federal funds for private sector commercialization programs at NIST, leading to proposals for their elimination. The Advanced Technology Program was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program in 2007, which operated until FY2012. AMTech, introduced in FY2012, was not funded until FY2013. In FY2013, NIST's funding increased to $769.4 million, with $579.8 million for STRS. The Administration aimed to double funding for innovation-enabling research at NIST over 10 years, but the timeframe shifted in subsequent budgets. Despite a 14.0% increase in R&D funding under the STRS account in FY2012, overall support for NIST did not increase. In FY2013, there was a 14.0% increase in funding for NIST under the STRS account. The final FY2013 appropriation included smaller increases in support, with 2.4% for NIST and 2.3% for the STRS account. NOAA conducts scientific research in various areas and was created in 1970 by Reorganization Plan No. 4. NOAA, created in 1970, focuses on climate, weather, air quality, and ocean resources. Their R&D efforts support goals like climate adaptation and healthy oceans. In FY2013, President Obama requested $650.6 million for NOAA's R&D, with $452 million for research, $56 million for development, and $143 million for R&D equipment. In FY2013, President Obama requested $650.6 million for NOAA's R&D, with $452 million for research, $56 million for development, and $143 million for R&D equipment. NOAA's administrative structure includes five line offices: NOS, NMFS, NESDIS, NWS, and OAR, along with Program Support (PS) and OMAO. R&D funding levels by line office for FY2012 enacted, FY2013 request, and FY2013 estimate are provided in Table 13. In FY2013, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2323 and the House passed H.R. 5326. The appropriations bills do not specify R&D funding levels for NOAA, but the NOAA spend plan provides $543.0 million in R&D funding, a 5.3% decrease from FY2012. R&D accounts for 11.4% of NOAA's total FY2013 discretionary budget of $4.748 billion. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's research and education activities are funded at $2.598 billion in FY2013. In FY2013, the President requested $2.598 billion for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research and education activities, an increase of 2.6% from the previous year. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the importance of investing in research and development to improve agricultural productivity, with a focus on combating pests and diseases. The Agricultural Research Service, USDA's research agency, operates 100 laboratories nationwide and includes the National Agricultural Library as a primary information resource. The President requested $1.1 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in FY2013, focusing on efficient food production, new product development, biocontrols for pest management, and research reallocations for critical needs. Priorities included converting agricultural products into biobased products and biofuels. The FY2013 request proposed an increase of approximately $25 million for research directed at improving American agriculture's adaptability to environmental challenges, stemming from recommendations in a 2011 report on the need for improved accounting of ecosystem services and increased protection of the environment. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture was established in Title VII, Section 7511 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) was established in the 2008 farm bill to develop partnerships for agricultural research and education. NIFA distributes funds to various institutions for research, including land-grant universities and historically black colleges. The President requested $1.2 billion for NIFA in FY2013, emphasizing competitive, peer-reviewed funding. The Administration's FY2013 request for NIFA focused on competitive, peer-reviewed research funding for critical agricultural needs. Funding included support for grant management and programs addressing national issues like agricultural security, climate change, and pest management. NIFA administers the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), which supports graduate students and aims to increase opportunities for minority and under-served communities. The FY2013 request for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) aimed to increase opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. It sought $325.0 million, including funding for alternative energy research, climate adaptation, international food security, foundational research, and global climate change mitigation. Additionally, support was requested for an integrated food safety research program.

The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) received $12.4 million in R&D funding for FY2013, $0.3 million above its FY2012 level and $0.7 million below the request. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds research activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control laws. EPA's scientific research activities are funded within the agency's Science and Technology (S&T) appropriations account, which includes a transfer from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. EPA is funded through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funds for research on cleaning up contaminated sites were allocated under P.L. 113-6. Prior to this, EPA and other federal agencies operated under P.L. 112-175, providing FY2013 appropriations at 0.612% above FY2012 levels. Different funding proposals for EPA in FY2013 were presented by H.R. 6091 and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided discretionary appropriations for EPA in FY2013, but did not specify final funding levels. Reductions were made due to an across-the-board rescission and spending reductions triggered by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided discretionary appropriations for EPA in FY2013. The act specified funding levels for EPA's eight appropriations accounts, with some accounts receiving anomalies below FY2012 levels. The Science and Technology (S&T) account was allocated $785.3 million for FY2013. EPA reported allocations by program, project, or activity within each account after sequestration and rescissions. In its FY2013 Operating Plan, the EPA reported a total enacted discretionary appropriation of $765.5 million for the Science and Technology (S&T) account, which was $65.0 million below the President's FY2013 request. The S&T account also received a $21.7 million transfer from the Superfund account, representing nearly 10% of the agency's total budget. The S&T account, including transfers, made up almost 10% of the EPA's total budget for FY2013. Funding for various EPA research programs within the S&T account was mostly below requested and enacted levels, with the Climate Change Program receiving $15.9 million, a decrease from FY2012 but more than the proposed amount in H.R. 6091. The $7.8 million decrease in funding for the Clean Automotive Technology program was the largest proposed reduction for FY2013 within the S&T account. The FY2013 funding for the S&T account included increases and decreases for individual EPA research programs compared to FY2012 appropriations. Funding levels for Clean Air and Climate Change, Safe and Sustainable Water, Chemical Safety and Sustainability, and Sustainable and Healthy Communities were above the House Committee proposed levels but below the requested and enacted levels. Activities funded within the S&T account involve research by universities, foundations, and non-federal entities receiving EPA grants, as well as research conducted by the agency. The EPA S&T account funds research conducted by EPA at its laboratories and facilities, managed by the Office of Research and Development. It also supports applied science and technology activities through program offices like the Office of Water. The account incorporates elements of former EPA Research and Development, Salaries and Expenses, and Program Operations accounts. The EPA S&T account funds research conducted by EPA at its laboratories and facilities, managed by the Office of Research and Development. It also supports applied science and technology activities through program offices like the Office of Water. The account incorporates elements of former EPA Research and Development, Salaries and Expenses, and Program Operations accounts. The Office of Management and Budget reports historical and projected budget authority amounts for R&D at EPA, but does not explicitly relate these amounts to specific program activities. R&D BA amounts reported by OMB are typically less than amounts appropriated for the S&T account, indicating not all funding is allocated to R&D activities. Funding priorities among EPA programs, recent regulatory actions, and scientific research support were prominent in the FY2013 appropriations debate. In the FY2013 appropriations debate, EPA regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were prominent areas of concern for Congress. The House Appropriations Committee included directive language in the S&T account regarding specific EPA scientific research activities influencing pollution control decisions. Congressional committees continue to address EPA regulatory actions through hearings and legislation. The House Appropriations Committee directed EPA to make refinements to human health risk assessments under IRIS for FY2013. They did not provide funding for hydraulic fracturing research as requested by the President. EPA's regulatory decisions are often based on toxicity concentrations and risk thresholds established by IRIS. The House Appropriations Committee directed EPA to make refinements to human health risk assessments under IRIS for FY2013 and did not provide funding for hydraulic fracturing research as requested by the President. The Department of Transportation reported reduced R&D funding for FY2013 compared to FY2012 and below the President's FY2013 request. In FY2013, the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration received 84% of the Department of Transportation's R&D funding. The FAA's budget for R&D and facilities decreased by 3.5% from FY2012, with an increase in Research, Engineering, and Development funding. The Senate Committee recommended lower funding for RE&D and NextGen R&D compared to the President's budget request. In FY2013, the FAA's Environment and Energy program received $34.6 million, a decrease from FY2012 levels. Total FAA R&D funding for FY2013 was $315.1 million, with $158.8 million allocated for RE&D. The FHWA would have received $528.4 million in R&D funding in FY2013, an increase of $116.9 million from FY2012. In FY2013, transportation research funding would have increased for various programs, including Highway R&D, Intelligent Transportation Systems R&D, Multimodal Innovation Research Program, University Transportation Center Multimodal Competitive Research Grants program, and State Planning and Research program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $429.8 million for transportation research, which was the same as the FY2012 enacted level. The FY2013 DOT budget sought to replace RITA with an Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology to strengthen research functions and improve collaboration among operating administrations. Total FHWA R&D funding for FY2013 was $369.2 million, a decrease of $42.3 million from FY2012. This funding would have supported transportation research and technology programs, intelligent transportation systems, technology deployment, training, education, university transportation research, and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics."
