    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Energy Conservation Through Trees Act\". The Congress acknowledges that the utility sector is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with heating and cooling homes accounting for a significant portion of electricity usage. Planting shade trees can reduce residential cooling costs by up to 30% and provide clean-air benefits by removing air pollution and carbon dioxide. Despite the benefits, tree cover on private property and newly developed land has decreased since the 1970s. Increasing urban tree cover in test cities across the United States has generated significant savings, with every dollar invested in tree planting resulting in two to five dollars in returns. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the document. In this Act, the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The term \"retail power provider\" includes entities authorized to provide retail electricity, natural gas, or fuel oil service. The term \"tree-planting organization\" refers to nonprofit groups focused on expanding tree cover, distributing young trees, raising awareness of tree benefits, educating the public on tree care, and carrying out related activities. The term \"tree-siting guidelines\" refers to science-based measurements outlining species and minimum distances required between trees planted under this Act, as well as minimum distances from various structures and infrastructure. The curr_chunk states the purpose of the Act. The Act establishes a grant program to help retail power providers with targeted residential tree-planting programs. This aims to reduce peak-load demand for electricity, lower wintertime energy demand, protect public health, mitigate climate change effects, and lower electric bills for residential ratepayers. The Act aims to lower electric bills for residential ratepayers, relieve financial pressure on retail power providers, protect water quality and public health, and ensure cost-effective tree planting for public and electric infrastructure maintenance. SEC. 5. GENERAL AUTHORITY. The Secretary can provide assistance to retail power providers for targeted residential tree-planting programs. A national public recognition initiative will also be created to promote participation. Eligible programs must follow specific tree-siting guidelines. Assistance is contingent on meeting program requirements, such as offering free or discounted shade. The program aims to provide free or discounted shade or wind-reducing trees strategically placed around residences to reduce electricity consumption. Tree siting guidelines will be based on scientific research to maximize energy-saving benefits during different seasons. The program aims to create tree siting guidelines for optimal placement of energy-saving trees while minimizing disruption to infrastructure. Certification from the Secretary is required to ensure alignment with program goals. Additionally, at least 30 percent of funds will be distributed to retail power providers. Retail power providers without existing tree-planting programs or those with programs established within three years of the Act's enactment are eligible to receive funds. SEC. 6. AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS AND TREE-PLANTING ORGANIZATIONS. In providing assistance under this Act, the Secretary can award grants to retail power providers with agreements with tree-planting organizations. These agreements outline conditions for targeted residential tree-planting programs, including participation in advisory committees, volunteer recruitment, and public awareness campaigns. To promote tree planting programs, initiatives should include public awareness campaigns, education efforts for tree maintenance, serving as a contact point for participants, requiring stewardship agreements, monitoring tree survival and energy savings for at least five years, and ensuring trees are planted away from power lines. To promote tree planting programs, initiatives should include public awareness campaigns, education efforts for tree maintenance, stewardship agreements, monitoring tree survival for at least five years, and ensuring trees are planted away from power lines to avoid interference with electricity distribution lines. If nonprofit tree planting organizations are not available, agreements can be made with local municipal governments or the State Forester. The tree planting program must involve the State Forester or the United States Forest Service's Urban and Community Forestry representative for the State where the program will operate. SEC. 7. TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES. To qualify for assistance under this Act, the retail power provider must establish a local technical advisory committee to provide advice on tree planting, maintenance, and education. The committee may design approved plant lists, planting specifications, and prioritize tree distribution. The retail power provider must establish a local technical advisory committee to prioritize tree distribution based on energy conservation potential and income levels. Committee members will not receive compensation and will include representatives with expertise in energy efficiency, urban forestry, and arboriculture. The retail power provider must establish a local technical advisory committee consisting of representatives from various organizations, including a local tree-planting organization, local nonprofit conservation or environmental organizations, and a local affordable housing agency. The local technical advisory committee for a shade tree-planting program includes representatives from local government, infrastructure management, nursery and landscaping industry, and research community with expertise in natural resources or energy management. The local technical advisory committee for a shade tree-planting program includes representatives with expertise in natural resources or energy management. The committee elects a chairperson to lead meetings and coordinate with external entities. Members must have specific credentials such as ISA Certified Arborist or Registered Landscape Architect. SEC. 8. COST-SHARE PROGRAM. The Federal share of project funding under this Act is limited to 50% and must be matched. Non-Federal entities can contribute to the remaining costs. SEC. 9. RULEMAKING. The Secretary can initiate a 6-month rulemaking period for public comments. A competitive grants process will be established for retail power providers. SEC. 10. NONDUPLICITY. SEC. 10. NONDUPLICITY. This Act does not override or duplicate programs under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums necessary for implementing this Act are authorized to be appropriated."
