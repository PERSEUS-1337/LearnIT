The rising costs are attributed to program expansions, renewing contracts, and housing market increases. Calls for reform and changes in funding have been made since 2002 to address cost concerns and administrative complexities. The Section 8 voucher program's funding and PHAs' funding mechanisms have led to calls for reforms by Congress. Understanding the program's history and mechanics is crucial to addressing its rising costs. Public housing and FHA programs were the main federal housing assistance forms until 1965. For more details, refer to CRS reports on Section 8 programs and reform proposals. In 1965, a new approach (P.L. 89-117) was adopted to address problems with federal housing construction programs. The Section 23 program assisted low-income families by leasing existing housing units in the private market. Interest remained in developing new approaches like the Experimental Housing Allowance Program due to criticisms of cost and practices in federal housing programs. President Nixon was involved in addressing these issues. President Nixon declared a moratorium on federal housing programs, including Section 23, in 1973 due to cost and profiteering concerns. Congress then created the Section 8 program in 1974, which consisted of new construction, substantial rehabilitation, and existing housing certificates. The Section 8 program, created in 1974, included new construction, substantial rehabilitation, and existing housing certificates. Over the years, components like moderate rehabilitation and vouchers were added, with existing housing certificates eventually converted to vouchers in 1998. HUD entered into long-term contracts with private organizations to provide subsidies for low-income tenants. The Section 8 program, created in 1974, included subsidies for low-income tenants to pay rent. By the early 1980s, rising costs led to a decrease in the number of units produced annually. Studies showed that providing subsidies for new construction or substantial rehabilitation was more expensive than existing units. Large budget authority was needed due to long-term contracts. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 (P.L. 95-557) added the moderate rehabilitation component to the Section 8 program, expanding rental assistance to projects needing repairs costing at least $1,000 per unit. However, over the next 10 years, this component faced allegations of abuse due to unfair contract awarding processes. The moderate rehabilitation program under the Section 8 program faced allegations of abuse in contract awarding processes, leading to its suspension in 1989. The existing housing certificate component of Section 8, created in the program's early years, continued until 1998. PHAs and HUD would enter into an Annual Contributions Contract for units receiving assistance, with contracts renewable for up to 15 years. HUD paid the difference between tenant rental payments and contract rent, typically limited to Fair Market Rent. The Section 8 program allowed PHAs to advertise certificates for low-income tenants to find suitable housing in the private market. Families with certificates paid 30% of their income for rent, with HUD covering the rest. If a family violated the lease, HUD paid the landlord for the remaining month and 80% of the contract rent for an additional month. In 1998, the Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act merged the Section 8 existing housing certificate program with the voucher program, converting all certificates. HUD paid PHAs an administrative fee for managing the program, set by Congress annually. PHAs could allocate up to 15% of Section 8 certificates for project-based housing, where the subsidy was attached to the unit, not the tenant. The Section 8 housing certificate program was merged with the voucher program in 1998, converting all certificates to vouchers. The voucher program, authorized in 1983, is administered by PHAs and allows families to pay more towards rent and lease apartments above FMR. Today's Section 8 program consists of two programs serving almost 3.5 million households, including project-based rental assistance. The Section 8 program includes project-based rental assistance for low-income families. Approximately 1.3 million units are still funded under multiyear contracts with HUD. Families in these units pay 30% of their incomes towards rent, with at least 40% of units rented to extremely low-income families. Owners receive payments as long as eligible families occupy the units. Owners of properties with project-based Section 8 rental assistance receive a subsidy from HUD called Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), which covers the difference between the tenant's payments and a contract rent. Contract rents are adjusted annually based on market rates or operating costs. Project-based Section 8 contracts are managed by contract administrators, with the goal of outsourcing this function to external entities. Landlords can choose to renew the contract when it expires. When project-based Section 8 HAP contracts expire, landlords can renew with HUD for up to five years or convert to market rate. Landlords can also opt-out early, providing tenants with enhanced vouchers. In 2010, 51% of households in Section 8 units were elderly, 17% were non-elderly disabled, and 33% were neither. Median income was around $10,000 per year. The Housing Choice Voucher program, funded by HUD, provides tenant-based rental assistance through Section 8 vouchers. PHAs administer the program, serving low-income families with fixed numbers of vouchers. Eligibility is based on income levels, with a focus on extremely low-income families. In 2013, HUD's income definitions were compared to HHS poverty guidelines for various geographic areas. Families receiving vouchers use them to subsidize rents in private market apartments. Eligible units must meet housing quality standards and cost less than 40% of the family's income plus the HAP paid by the PHA. PHAs have flexibility to set caps for tenant-based vouchers between 90% and 110% of FMR. PHAs have the flexibility to set their caps between 90% and 110% of FMR (up to 120% FMR with prior HUD approval). The cap set by the PHA is called the payment standard. Once a family finds an eligible unit, they sign contracts with HUD and the landlord. The PHA pays the HAP (payment standard minus 30% of family's income), and the family pays the difference between the HAP and rent (30% to 40% of family's income). Families can choose to pay more than 40% of their income towards rent after the first year. PHAs may adopt minimum rents not exceeding $50. Families can retain the voucher as long as PHA has funding and they comply with requirements. Tenant-based vouchers can move with the family if they decide to relocate. The tenant-based voucher can move with the family if they decide to relocate. Families exit the program due to their own choice, non-compliance with program rules, or if they no longer qualify for a subsidy based on income levels. Unlike the project-based Section 8 program, most households receiving vouchers are headed by individuals who are not elderly or disabled. In 2010, 19% of Section 8 households were elderly, 28% were disabled, and 53% were non-elderly, non-disabled households with children. The median income for households with vouchers was around $10,400 per year. Project-based vouchers require landlords to set aside up to 25% of units for low-income families, with HUD covering the rent difference. PHAs can project-base up to 20% of their vouchers. Project-based vouchers allow PHAs to set aside units for low-income families, with HUD covering the rent difference. Families with project-based vouchers can convert to tenant-based vouchers after one year. Tenant protection vouchers are given to families displaced from HUD housing programs, with enhanced vouchers available for those at risk of displacement from project-based Section 8 units. The value of an enhanced voucher can grow to match the new rent charged in the property. The Section 8 voucher program offers various special programs, including family unification vouchers, vouchers for homeless veterans, and vouchers for homeownership. Family unification vouchers are provided to families facing housing challenges that could lead to separation from their children. HUD has granted over 38,600 family unification vouchers to PHAs. Additionally, Section 8 vouchers have been available for use since 1992 through collaboration between HUD and the VA. Through collaboration between HUD and the VA, Section 8 vouchers are available for homeless veterans with severe psychiatric or substance abuse disorders under the HUD-VA Supported Housing program. Families can use vouchers for homeownership if they meet certain criteria and agree to counseling. Nearly 13,000 families have purchased homes using vouchers. The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program, established by Congress in 1990, aims to help families on public assistance achieve economic self-sufficiency by increasing their incomes without raising their rent. Participants sign five-year contracts and the difference in rent payments is saved in an escrow account for them to access upon completion of the program. The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program helps families increase their incomes without raising rent. Participants contribute more towards rent, with a portion saved in an escrow account. PHAs fund FSS coordinators to assist families with vouchers in accessing services like job training and education. The Moving to Work Demonstration allows HUD and PHAs to test different approaches in providing housing assistance. The Moving to Work (MTW) program allows up to 30 PHAs to participate, aiming to reduce federal costs, provide work incentives, and expand housing choice. It grants flexibility in fund usage and rent rules, with the condition to maintain the same number of households served. MTW agencies can seek exemption from program rules, but the program's effectiveness is difficult to evaluate due to implementation limitations. Some PHAs participating in the Moving to Work (MTW) program have utilized the flexibility it offers by making changes to their Section 8 voucher and public housing programs, including altering eligibility and rent policies. An evaluation in January 2004 noted that MTW allows PHAs to experiment with innovative solutions and be more responsive to local conditions. Under the Moving to Work (MTW) program, some PHAs have made changes to their Section 8 voucher and public housing programs, allowing for flexibility and innovation to address local conditions and priorities. However, this variation can also lead to mistakes and disadvantages for certain groups. The Moving to Opportunity Fair Housing Demonstration (MTO) was authorized in 1992 to help low-income families with children move to areas with low poverty concentrations. The Moving to Opportunity Fair Housing Demonstration (MTO) was designed to test if changes in neighborhood environment can impact life chances. Families who moved to lower-poverty areas saw improvements in housing quality, neighborhood conditions, safety, and adult health. Mixed effects were seen on youth health and behavior, with girls benefiting and boys experiencing negative effects. No impacts were found on child achievement or adult employment. The Section 8 programs are the largest direct housing assistance program for low-income families, with a budget of $27 billion in FY2013. While successful in providing safe housing, the high cost to the federal government has led Congress to consider reform or elimination of the programs."
