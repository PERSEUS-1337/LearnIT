    "content": "Responsibility for U.S. nuclear weapons is shared between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE). DOD handles the development, deployment, and operation of missiles and aircraft for delivering nuclear warheads, while DOE oversees research, development, testing, and acquisition programs for producing and maintaining warheads. Congress authorizes funding for both DOD and NNSA nuclear weapons activities in the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill funds NNSA's nuclear weapons activities, managed by various agencies over the years, including the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 dissolved ERDA and created DOE, leading to the establishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within DOE. NNSA manages the nuclear weapons program, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors programs, addressing long-standing concerns about the nuclear weapons complex. Congress has passed various legislative acts to improve governance, including the establishment of the Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise in 2013. The Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise was directed to make recommendations on the governance structure, mission, and management of the nuclear security enterprise. The panel found existing governance structures and practices to be inefficient and ineffective, putting the enterprise at risk over the long term. Despite efforts of capable individuals, the NNSA governance reform has failed to provide the intended effective, mission-focused enterprise. Recommendations included strengthening presidential guidance and oversight, and establishing new congressional mechanisms for leadership. The Congressional Advisory Panel recommended strengthening presidential guidance and oversight, establishing new congressional mechanisms for leadership, and building a culture of performance and accountability within the nuclear security enterprise. NNSA supported some management changes but opposed restructuring and name changes. Congress expressed concerns about cost growth and transparency in NNSA programs, addressing them in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for 2015. Section 304 of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 required independent oversight for NNSA's construction of high-hazard nuclear facilities. Section 305 mandated an independent cost estimate for projects over $100 million, while Section 308 called for an analysis of alternatives for major warhead refurbishment programs. The Senate expressed concerns about poor cost estimating within the Department, particularly in the NNSA, and directed the Secretary of Energy to improve cost estimating practices. The U.S. Department of Energy was directed to improve cost estimating for major projects and programs within the nuclear weapons complex, which now consists of eight sites in seven states. These sites include laboratories, production facilities, and the Nevada National Security Site. The Nevada National Security Site is managed by NNSA, with contractors operating the eight sites. Congress has pushed for changes in the complex post-Cold War, including personnel reductions, production efficiencies, smaller footprints, and increased security. The Obama Administration sought increased funding for the nuclear weapons complex, addressing underfunding and undervaluation of facilities. Biden highlighted the need for $7 billion in the FY2011 budget for maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile and complex. In FY2011, the Obama Administration allocated $7 billion for maintaining the nuclear-weapons stockpile and complex, with plans to increase funding by over $5 billion in the next five years. Despite the Budget Control Act slowing budget increases, actual appropriations for NNSA's weapons activities exceeded expectations outlined in the 1251 Report. The Administration outlined funding plans for the nuclear weapons enterprise in reports submitted to Congress in 2010 in support of the New START Treaty ratification. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 mandated a comprehensive plan to maintain delivery platforms, sustain a safe nuclear weapons stockpile, and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The projected costs for weapons stockpile and infrastructure from FY2011-FY2020 were between $85.4 billion and $86.2 billion. Funding for these programs fell below projected levels early in the decade but exceeded predictions in the FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 budget requests. The Trump Administration requested an additional $1 billion for NNSA weapons activities in FY2018. The Trump Administration requested increased funding for NNSA weapons activities in FY2018 and FY2019, with most of the budget going towards life extension programs and research and development. Congress approved a budget of $10.642 billion for weapons activities in FY2018. The Trump Administration requested increased funding for NNSA weapons activities in FY2019, with Congress enacting a budget of $11.1 billion for weapons activities. The United States conducted 1,030 nuclear weapons test explosions between 1945 and 1992, but a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing was enacted in 1992. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress in 1994 to maintain confidence in the U.S. nuclear stockpile without nuclear weapons testing. The program is implemented by the NNSA through the Weapons Activities account, with a budget exceeding $2 billion for three major program areas. The NNSA's Directed Stockpile Work programs directly support the U.S. nuclear stockpile through maintenance, surveillance, refurbishment, and dismantlement of warheads. The budget for FY2018 requested $3,977 million, with both the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees recommending similar amounts. The Water Appropriations Subcommittee recommended $3,912.6 million for Directed Stockpile Work, a reduction from the budget request. NNSA requested $4,666.2 million for Directed Stockpile work in FY2019, an increase of 16.3% over FY2018. Congress appropriated $4,658.3 million for directed stockpile work in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. Life Extension Programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. The NNSA is conducting life extension programs for various warheads, including the W76 for the Trident II (D-5) SLBM, B61 mod 12, W88 for Trident II (D-5) missiles, and W80 cruise missile warhead. Funding for these programs has increased, with $1,744.1 million appropriated in FY2018 and $1,920 million requested for FY2019. The new W80-4 will be deployed on the Long Range Standoff missile (LRSO) under development by the Air Force. The NNSA requested $1,920 million for Life Extension Programs (LEPs) in FY2019, primarily for the B61-12 and W80-4 LEPs. A new component, the W76-2 warhead, was introduced in response to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. The initial budget request did not allocate funding for this modification, but the White House included $65 million for it in a budget amendment package submitted to Congress. The budget amendment package submitted to Congress on April 13, 2018, authorizes the production of low-yield ballistic missiles to replace higher-yield weapons, maintaining the overall number of deployed U.S. ballistic missile warheads. The NNSA requested $48.9 million for the W76-1 LEP in FY2019, which was enacted by Congress in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 115-244). The delay in the program past FY2019 would require a restart of the W76 production line, increase costs, and delay delivery to the Department of Defense. NNSA requested $65 million for the W76-2 LEP in FY2019, with Congress enacting this amount. The House report mandated NNSA to provide a detailed report on the low-yield variant of the W76 warhead. NNSA also requested $794 million for the B61-12 LEP in FY2019, which was enacted by Congress. The LEP aims to refurbish B61 warheads, reduce the number of gravity bombs in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, and improve safety and security. NNSA requested funding for W88 Alteration and W80-4 in FY2019, with plans for production units in 2020. The W80-4 LEP seeks to use common components and enhance warhead safety. Engineering activities for W80-4 are increasing significantly over the FY2018 budget. The FY2019 budget includes funding for the W80-4 development and design, with a significant increase over the FY2018 budget request. NNSA has also requested funding for an interoperable warhead (IW1) that could be used on ICBMs and SLBMs. Congress enacted the requested amounts for both projects. The FY2019 budget includes funding for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on the W78 warhead. NNSA requested $619.5 million for Stockpile Systems in FY2019, including funding for the B61-12 and W76 integration. The Senate approved the budget increase for surveillance and assessment programs. The Senate approved $599.5 million in funding for Stockpile Systems in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. The U.S. stockpile has seen a significant decrease in warheads since the Cold War, with numbers declining from 31,255 warheads in 1967 to 3,822 warheads in 2017. The Warhead Dismantlement and Disposition program includes storage, dismantlement, and elimination of warhead components and materials. NNSA requested $68.9 million for the program in FY2017. The NNSA requested $68.9 million for the Warhead Dismantlement and Disposition program in FY2017 to accelerate dismantlement of retired U.S. nuclear warheads by 20%. The Senate approved the request, while the House subcommittee objected and reduced total funding. The final allocation in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2017 was $56 million for weapons dismantlement and disposition. The NNSA requested $56 million for warhead dismantlement in FY2018 and FY2019, with Congress approving the amount. Funding for this program is capped at $56 million as directed by the FY2017 and FY2018 National Defense Authorization Acts. Dismantlement activities provide material for future nuclear weapons production. The FY2019 budget documents do not mention the goal of dismantling weapons retired prior to FY2009 by FY2022. Stockpile Services programs support DSW operations for multiple weapon systems in the enduring stockpile. The NNSA requested $1,068.4 million for Stockpile Services in FY2019 to support enduring systems, LEPs, and dismantlements. This funding is mainly for increased activity to support the increased LEP workload. Congress approved $1,048.7 million for Stockpile Services. The Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $1,048.7 million for the NNSA program, which consolidates management of nuclear material processing capabilities. The program includes Uranium, Plutonium, and Tritium Sustainment, Domestic Uranium Enrichment, and Strategic Materials Sustainment. NNSA requested $1,002.4 million in FY2019 to meet future pit production and tritium requirements. Congress approved $708.7 million for FY2018 to support material de-inventory and optimize material staging. The budget request includes increases in funding for plutonium sustainment to support fabrication of pits for the W87 warhead, replace aging pit production equipment, and increase pit production capacity. The funding also supports design efforts for a new pit production facility and domestic uranium enrichment for down blending highly enriched uranium for tritium production. Congress approved $1,034.1 million for Strategic Materials in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 115-244), including $75 million for a Plutonium Pit production project. NNSA was directed to budget for capital improvements and equipment installations to meet plutonium pit production targets and provide a report on the current scope, costs, and schedule required. The NNSA focuses on developing and maintaining critical capabilities for stockpile stewardship without nuclear testing. It funds science and engineering programs, including the National Ignition Facility. The requested budget for RDT&E programs in FY2019 was $1,995.4 million, with Congress appropriating $2,014.2 million. The Science Program under RDT&E provides the knowledge needed to maintain the nuclear stockpile. The Science Program under the NNSA focuses on nuclear testing, understanding nuclear explosions, validating weapons simulations, and maintaining scientific infrastructure. It aims to assess warhead performance, improve readiness for nuclear tests, and support global nuclear security policy. The FY2019 budget request was $564.9 million, a 19% increase from FY2018. The FY2019 budget included a significant increase in funding for the Dynamic Materials Properties program and Enhanced capabilities for subcritical experiments. Congress approved $480.5 million for this program area in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. The DMP program funding was held at $120 million, and the request for Enhanced capabilities for subcritical experiments was reduced to $50 million. The Engineering Program, responsible for developing advanced tools for nuclear weapons maintenance and safety, requested $211.4 million in FY2019. This includes funding for a Stockpile Responsiveness Program in coordination with DOD. The Engineering Program, funded by Congress with $190.1 million, aims to develop tools for nuclear weapons research and attract scientific talent. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is the centerpiece of this effort, using lasers to create conditions similar to a nuclear explosion. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has proven valuable for stockpile stewardship, despite delays in achieving ignition. NIF was dedicated in May 2009 and is supported by the Z Facility at Sandia National Laboratories and the Omega Laser Facility at the University of Rochester. NNSA requested $419 million for this program area in FY2019, with Congress rejecting the Administration's request for a reduction in funding. Congress allocated $40.4 million for the Omega Laser Facility in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. The ASC program develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons to maintain confidence in the performance of the aging stockpile without underground testing. The NNSA program supports nonproliferation, emergency response, and nuclear forensics. NNSA requested $656.4 million for FY2019, a reduction from the $721 million appropriated in FY2018. Congress approved $670.1 million for the program in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. This funding includes support for Exascale activities, infrastructure upgrades, advanced memory technology research, and integrating artificial intelligence into modeling and prediction. The program was previously known as the Readiness Campaign until FY2015. The Nonnuclear Readiness subprogram, previously part of the Readiness Campaign, was not funded in FY2015. Congress recommended establishing an Advanced Manufacturing Development program to enhance secure manufacturing capabilities for nuclear weapons. NNSA aims to reduce cost and schedule risks by exploring advanced technologies for stockpile component production. The Infrastructure and Operations Program area, previously known as Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, received $85.5 million in FY2018 and $81.6 million in FY2019. This funding maintains, operates, and modernizes NNSA infrastructure to support a safe and effective nuclear arsenal. NNSA's Infrastructure and Operations Program area requires upgrades to maintain a safe nuclear arsenal. Funding requests for FY2017 and FY2018 were increased, with Congress allocating more than requested. In FY2019, NNSA requested $3,002.7 million for this program area. In FY2019, Congress approved $3087.9 million for NNSA's Infrastructure and Operations Program to address aging infrastructure and workforce concerns. The Operations of Facilities program under NNSA's Infrastructure and Operations Program received $848.4 million in FY2018 for operating budgets at eight NNSA sites, including funding for utilities, safety systems, and environmental compliance. This budget supported work on transuranic waste, new waste facilities at Los Alamos National Lab, and pension plan reimbursements at Savannah River Nuclear Solutions. In FY2018, Congress funded the preparation and shipment of transuranic waste. NNSA requested $891 million for FY2019 to transition new facilities to operations. Congress approved $870 million for this program area in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. The Safety and Environmental Operations program supports the safe operation of the nuclear security enterprise. NNSA requested $115 million for FY2019, but Congress approved $110 million. The Maintenance and Repair of Facilities program addresses deferred maintenance at NNSA facilities. NNSA requested $294 million for this program area in FY2017, and Congress provided $324 million. In FY2018, NNSA requested $360 million for this program area. In FY2018, Congress provided $515.1 million for the Maintenance and Repair of Facilities program to address deferred maintenance at NNSA sites. NNSA requested $365 million for FY2019 and created an Infrastructure Modernization Initiative to reduce deferred maintenance by 30% by 2025. Congress approved $515 million for FY2019 in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 115-244) added funding to address deferred maintenance at NNSA sites through the Recapitalization program. This program aims to revitalize aging facilities, improve infrastructure reliability, and enhance safety systems. NNSA sought increased funding in FY2017, with a request of $667.3 million, nearly 90% higher than the previous year. Congress provided $743.1 million in FY2017 to address infrastructure deterioration and deferred maintenance backlog. NNSA requested reduced funding in FY2018 for infrastructure and maintenance, but Congress allocated more to address high-risk facilities. In FY2019, NNSA requested increased funding for construction projects, focusing on weapons program objectives. Currently managing 20 projects in this program area. NNSA is managing 20 projects, including the controversial Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) Project. The FY2018 budget requested $1031.8 million for construction, with $663 million for UPF and $180.9 million for CMRR. Funding would support construction of UPF's Main Process Building, Mechanical Electrical Building, and Salvage and Accountability Building, as well as continued construction in CMRR for plutonium science activities. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount. The House committee recommended $620 million for UPF, below the requested amount. Congress provided $663 million for UPF and $177.2 million for CMRR in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. NNSA requested $1,091 million for construction in FY2019, with $703 million for UPF and $235.1 million for CMRR. NNSA aims to complete UPF by 2025 for no more than $6,500 million.
