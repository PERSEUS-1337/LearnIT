    "content": "The EPA Draft Report in response to complaints from well owners in Pavillion in 2008 initiated an investigation of possible contamination of the drinking water aquifer. EPA used authorities delegated by Executive Order 12580 to respond to a release of hazardous substances that could endanger public health or welfare. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) outlines procedures for EPA to evaluate sites for federal response actions under CERCLA. State or local officials can request EPA evaluation under CERCLA, and citizens can petition EPA for a preliminary assessment of potential hazards from hazardous substances. Citizens can petition the EPA to assess potential hazards from hazardous substances, with the EPA required to complete a preliminary assessment within 12 months or provide an explanation for not doing so. The petition should be addressed to the EPA Regional Administrator, identifying the release location, how the petitioner is affected, substances released, activities at the site, and contact with state and local officials. This information helps determine if a federal site assessment is needed under CERCLA. The EPA Region 8 Office determined that a site assessment may be warranted under CERCLA based on citizen complaints about domestic well water quality at the Pavillion site. EPA requested ATSDR to examine health hazards associated with contaminants in private residential well water. In response to EPA's request, ATSDR issued a Health Consultation for Pavillion in August 2010, concluding that exposure to contaminants in well water could lead to health effects and explosive hazards. Residents were advised to use alternate water sources and take precautions to address potential hazards. The ATSDR's study focused on potential hazards in private residential well water, while the EPA's investigation was broader, identifying contaminants across the aquifer. The Pavillion gas field is located in the Wind River Basin in central Wyoming. The Wind River Formation in the Pavillion gas field area is a major source of drinking water. Natural gas is extracted from wells drilled into this formation, with hydraulic fracturing occurring at depths as shallow as 1,220 feet. The EPA sampled various wells for contaminants. The EPA detected methane and organic chemicals in some domestic wells prompting the installation of deep monitoring wells to differentiate between shallow and deep sources of contamination related to gas production activities. The EPA Draft Report investigates groundwater contamination related to gas production, including drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The report aims to identify sources of contamination above the Pavillion gas field. Stakeholders have debated whether the report clearly links contamination to drilling activities. The investigation identified contaminants in shallow monitoring wells near surface pits used for disposal of drilling waste. The contaminants included benzene, xylenes, GROs, and DROs, indicating pits as a source of groundwater contamination. EPA is collaborating with Encana Oil & Gas Inc. to address the issue. Encana, a subsidiary of Canadian Encana Corporation, is investigating groundwater contamination near surface pits used for waste disposal. The EPA Draft Report does not provide detailed information on the contamination source, but stakeholders are not focusing on the issue. Encana has been providing alternate drinking water sources to affected citizens during the investigation. The EPA Draft Report focuses on detecting contaminants in deep aquifers from sources like production wells and hydraulic fracturing, rather than shallow groundwater issues or surface pits as likely sources of contamination. Multiple lines of reasoning are used in complex scientific investigations to support the detection of contaminants. The EPA Draft Report presents compelling evidence that constituents associated with hydraulic fracturing have contaminated the Wind River drinking water aquifer at depths above the current production zone. Monitoring wells installed by the EPA detected chemical constituents at depths ranging from 765 to 980 feet below ground surface, while domestic and municipal wells sampled during the investigation were shallower. The report emphasizes the absence of baseline data for comparison. The EPA Draft Report highlights evidence of hydraulic fracturing contaminants in the Wind River drinking water aquifer at depths above the current production zone. Chemical data from monitoring wells at 765 to 980 feet below ground surface indicate enhanced gas migration to groundwater used for domestic water supply. The report also mentions the absence of baseline groundwater monitoring data. EPA's \"lines of reasoning\" include chemical data from other wells, casing length, cement presence in gas production wells, and citizen complaints about taste and odor issues in drinking water. The EPA Draft Report noted unusual and high pH values in deep monitoring wells, ranging from 11.2 to 12.0, indicating groundwater was significantly more alkaline than domestic wells. Geochemical modeling suggested that the addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) used in fracking operations could increase pH values in the Pavillion aquifer. The EPA Draft Report highlighted elevated potassium and chloride levels in deep monitoring wells, indicating a distinct inorganic chemistry compared to domestic wells in the study. Potassium levels were 8.2 to 18.3 times higher than domestic wells, while chloride levels in MW02 were 18 times higher. MW01 had lower chloride levels at approximately 23 milligrams per liter. The report highlighted elevated potassium and chloride levels in deep monitoring wells, possibly linked to drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. Chemicals containing potassium and chloride were used in fracture fluids, but no direct link to specific hydraulic fracturing jobs was established in the report. Alternate explanations for the elevated levels were also considered. The EPA report considered alternate explanations for elevated potassium and chloride levels in monitoring wells, including contamination from drilling fluids and additives. Synthetic organic compounds not naturally occurring in groundwater were detected, such as isopropanol, diethylene glycol, and triethylene glycol, which are used in hydraulic fracture fluids and solvents according to well completion reports. The EPA Draft Report found tert-butyl alcohol, a breakdown product of MTBE and gel breaker used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, in Pavillion groundwater. Petroleum hydrocarbons including BTEX compounds were also detected in wells MW01 and MW02. The EPA Draft Report found various organic chemicals in Pavillion groundwater, including breakdown products like acetate and benzoic acid. These compounds were detected at different concentrations in monitoring wells MW01 and MW02, indicating a complex mixture of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing solutions. The EPA Draft Report suggested that flowing stock wells indicated an upward hydraulic gradient in the study area, supporting the presence of enriched breakdown products in monitoring well MW01. Groundwater with organic compounds like BTEX and glycols was believed to travel upward, degrading into acetate and benzoic acid. The report also highlighted potential well design and integrity issues as a possible cause of deep groundwater contamination at the site. The EPA investigation found an absence of cement or sporadic bonding in production wells, allowing fluids to potentially leak from fractured intervals to the aquifer above. This could lead to contamination of groundwater with organic compounds like BTEX and glycols. The EPA Draft Report highlighted the potential for natural gas migration due to the absence of a lithologic barrier above the gas production zone. It also mentioned the possibility of gas migrating upward in the event of fractures and fluid leakage from hydraulically induced fractures. Additionally, the report suggested that enhanced gas migration to groundwater at depths used for domestic water supply and domestic wells may have occurred. The EPA Draft Report indicated that gas migration to groundwater at depths used for domestic water supply and wells may have occurred due to hydraulic fracturing activities. Analysis of carbon isotopes showed that methane in monitoring wells is similar to that in production wells, suggesting thermogenic methane from deeper source rocks. Thermogenic methane is distinguished from biogenic methane, which is produced by the breakdown of organic material by methanogens. The EPA Draft Report suggested that organic compounds migrated upward from depth, with methane levels increasing in wells closest to gas production wells in the Pavillion study area. Methane was not detected in domestic water wells with two or fewer production wells within 2,000 feet, except for two wells. The Draft Report highlighted high methane concentrations in wells near gas production sites in the Pavillion study area. It mentioned specific wells like MW01, PGDW30, and PGDW05, noting depths where methane was found and a blowout incident in 2005. The report inferred that natural gas was not present at depths shallower than 1,000 feet before gas development activities. Additionally, it mentioned that surface casing of gas wells does not extend deeper than domestic wells' maximum depth. The EPA Draft Report found that most gas wells in the Pavillion field did not have casing extending completely through the deepest portion of the aquifer, potentially allowing for upward migration of natural gas towards shallower domestic wells. This contrasts with the assertion that natural gas was not present at depths shallower than 1,000 feet before gas development activities. The EPA Draft Report highlighted concerns about casing in gas wells not extending through the aquifer, potentially allowing gas migration towards domestic wells. Citizen complaints about well water issues post-fracking were deemed valid, emphasizing the need for baseline data and routine groundwater monitoring. CERCLA Section 105(d) would have required EPA to assess sites upon citizen petition submission. The EPA Draft Report linked groundwater contamination in Wyoming to hydraulic fracturing activities, raising concerns about the practice. Stakeholders in the oil and gas industry questioned the scientific findings in the report. Some private business interests in the oil and gas industry disputed EPA's claim that hydraulic fracturing released constituents into the Wind River drinking water aquifer. Environmental organizations called for stricter regulations based on EPA's findings. Independent assessments commissioned by stakeholders showed conflicting opinions, with industry assessments disagreeing and environmental assessments supporting EPA's findings. Encana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. disagreed with EPA's preliminary conclusions in a press release, stating that their data align with previous testing and do not show impacts on domestic wells. They claimed EPA's findings on hydraulic fracturing contamination in Pavillion groundwater were conjecture, not factual. Encana raised concerns about the unique geology and hydrology of the Pavillion area and previous reports of poor water quality in the aquifer. EPA's deep monitoring wells were drilled into a natural gas. Encana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. disagreed with EPA's preliminary conclusions, stating that their data align with previous testing and do not show impacts on domestic wells. They raised concerns about the unique geology and hydrology of the Pavillion area and previous reports of poor water quality in the aquifer. The chemical results from the deep monitoring wells are different from domestic water wells, showing no connection. Encana called for independent third-party review of EPA's data. Energy in Depth (EID), an outreach campaign by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, raised questions about the EPA Draft Report, including concerns about chemical discrepancies in monitoring wells and domestic water wells. They also questioned if EPA's drilling chemicals affected groundwater sampling results. EID called for independent third-party review of the EPA's data. High levels of potassium and chloride previously found in the Pavillion area may reflect natural variations in groundwater quality. Concerns were raised by the Petroleum Association of Wyoming and Encana Oil & Gas, Inc. about the EPA Draft Report, including issues with deep monitoring wells, differences in compounds between deep wells and domestic water wells, and quality assurance problems with EPA's drilling and testing. The Independent Petroleum Association of America disagreed with the EPA's findings on hydraulic fracturing fluid contamination. The IPAA-commissioned report supported the EPA Draft Report's conclusion on surface pits causing groundwater contamination but disagreed on hydraulic fracturing's impact on drinking water and natural gas migration. It criticized EPA's findings as unconvincing and suggested alternative explanations due to issues with sampling and monitoring wells. The IPAA report criticized EPA's findings on hydraulic fracturing's impact on drinking water, suggesting alternative explanations due to issues with sampling and monitoring wells. EPA had not characterized the hydrogeology of the study area, leading to uncertainties about the migration pathway from hydraulic fracturing zones to shallow groundwater regions. The report concluded that all evidence cited by EPA could be explained with alternative hypotheses. The NRDC supports federal regulation of fracking under the Safe Drinking Water Act, emphasizing the importance of proper well construction, baseline testing, and site characterization to prevent contamination of underground sources of drinking water. They have partnered with other organizations to commission an independent assessment of EPA's Draft Report, which highlighted the need for stronger rules in hydraulic fracturing. The NRDC released an assessment of EPA's Draft Report on hydraulic fracturing, agreeing with EPA's conclusions about pollution in the Wind River formation and aquifer. The NRDC report dismissed alternative explanations, such as poor well construction, raised by the IPAA-commissioned report. Recommendations included further data collection, deeper monitoring wells, and mapping water depth. The EPA Draft Report on hydraulic fracturing includes recommendations for deeper monitoring wells, mapping water depth, estimating vertical gradients, and correlating contamination sources. Environmental groups like the NRDC and EDF emphasize the need for stronger regulation and enforcement in shale gas development. Pro Publica suggests that the findings in the report could influence national regulations on fracking and challenge industry claims about its safety. The EPA Draft Report on hydraulic fracturing challenges industry claims about fracking safety and recommends deeper monitoring wells and stronger regulation. Senators requested rigorous peer review of the report, but EPA did not classify the Pavillion issue as highly influential. The EPA classified the Pavillion Draft Report as \"Influential Scientific Information\" instead of \"Highly Influential Scientific Assessment\" due to it being a single study. Despite this classification, the peer review process for the draft report maintains high standards for reviewer independence and agency responses. The EPA maintains high standards for reviewer independence and agency responses to peer reviewers. The House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment held a hearing to examine EPA's findings and stakeholder concerns. Testimony was given by officials representing EPA, the state of Wyoming, the Western Energy Alliance, and a public health scientist. EPA's Regional Administrator noted that the Pavillion Draft Report analysis is limited to specific geologic conditions. Mr. Tom Doll, testifying for the State Oil and Gas Supervisor at the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, questioned EPA's conclusions on groundwater contamination in the Pavillion gas field. State of Wyoming experts do not support EPA's data and recommend further testing. More research is needed, and some members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works expressed concern about the quality of the science behind the EPA's Draft Report for the Pavillion site. EPA decided not to finalize the report and deferred to the state of Wyoming for further investigation. The EPA extended the public comment period for the Draft Report on drinking water quality in Wyoming multiple times, collecting more data and addressing concerns about scientific validity. EPA continued to accept public comments until October 16, 2012, while deciding to collect additional samples from deep monitoring wells. The EPA extended the public comment period for the Draft Report on drinking water quality in Wyoming multiple times, collecting more data and addressing concerns about scientific validity. EPA partnered with USGS and the state of Wyoming for additional sampling and analysis, delaying the peer review process. EPA ultimately decided not to finalize the Draft Report or seek scientific peer review. The EPA has decided not to finalize its Draft Report on drinking water quality in Wyoming and has deferred to the state of Wyoming to lead the investigation. The state will evaluate water quality concerns, including domestic water wells, oil and gas wells, and waste disposal pits in the Pavillion area. The investigation aims to clarify water quality issues and determine if further action is needed to protect drinking water resources. The EPA deferred to Wyoming to lead the investigation on drinking water quality in Pavillion. The state aims to evaluate water quality concerns and determine if further action is needed to protect drinking water resources. EPA noted the state's intention to release a final report by September 30, 2014. The USGS conducted subsequent sampling on EPA monitoring wells MW01 and MW02, providing data on groundwater samples. The findings will be used to interpret and apply the results of the investigation. The USGS collected additional samples from EPA monitoring wells MW01 and MW02 in cooperation with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. The raw data includes water quality properties, inorganic and organic constituents, dissolved gases, and other groundwater properties. The USGS report contains raw data results only from EPA well MW01 as they were unable to collect samples from well MW02. The EPA had difficulty collecting water level data from well MW02 due to rapid decline in water levels during pumping, indicating poor yield. USGS avoided sampling low-yield wells to prevent artifacts in samples. Despite attempts to increase yield, no samples were collected from MW02. EPA spokesperson noted USGS data consistency with earlier findings. The USGS results from sampling MW01 in Pavillion are consistent with earlier EPA findings. Encana found nothing surprising in the results and USGS has no plans to interpret the data further. The EPA identified certain constituents above the production zone of natural gas wells. The EPA did not find a definitive link between the constituents in domestic wells and natural gas production wells in Pavillion. The agency decided not to finalize the report or subject it to peer review, but the state of Wyoming will consider the sampling data for further investigation of drinking water quality in the area. The EPA will not rely on its Draft Report on the link between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water quality in Pavillion, Wyoming. Instead, the agency will base its conclusions on a national research program. Stakeholders have conflicting views on the Draft Report's findings. The EPA will not use its Draft Report on hydraulic fracturing chemicals and groundwater contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming. Differences in geology and hydrology between regions could affect the likelihood of water contamination. The overall process of hydraulic fracturing is similar across regions, but specific factors may vary. The Pavillion field is a tight sand gas field where natural gas is extracted from sandstone lenses in the Wind River Formation. The gas remains trapped in the sandstone reservoirs due to surrounding impermeable rocks. Tight gas sandstones are considered unconventional gas deposits. Gas sandstones are unconventional gas deposits with lower permeability, requiring enhanced recovery techniques like hydraulic fracturing. Conventional gas deposits can produce gas naturally via a well until pressure is depleted. Shale gas formations act as both the source and reservoir rock, with gas trapped in impermeable shale layers. Shale gas formations, like the Marcellus Shale, are not permeable enough to transmit water and are not considered aquifers. In contrast, sandstone lenses in the Pavillion area can act as reservoirs for both natural gas and groundwater due to their permeability. The issue of hydraulic fracturing and gas production in Pavillion, occurring close to water wells, may not be a concern in most shale gas plays. The Pavillion field in hydraulic fracturing is close to the deepest water wells, with less rock separating gas development activities from the aquifer compared to other shale gas reservoirs like the Marcellus Shale. Impermeable rock layers can reduce the chances of upward migration of injected fluids. In deep shale gas reservoirs, upward migration of injected fluids is reduced, with leaky old or poorly constructed wells providing possible pathways for fluid migration. Vertical wells in the Pavillion field are drilled to hydraulically fracture and produce natural gas, requiring more wells for efficient gas production compared to conventional sand reservoirs. Tight gas reservoirs like Pavillion may need denser well spacing for optimal production. In tight gas reservoirs like Pavillion, well spacing can be as little as 10 acres per well, compared to 160 to 320 acres per well in conventional sand reservoirs. The increased number of wells in tight sands can create more potential pathways for fluid migration. Horizontal drilling is also used in shale gas reservoirs to hydraulically fracture and produce gas, with one horizontal well potentially replacing four vertical wells. Shale gas development requires fewer wells and drill pads compared to tight gas sand fields like Pavillion. Horizontal drilling can replace multiple vertical wells, reducing the potential pathways for fluid migration. The hydraulic fracturing process is generally similar across unconventional gas fields. The EPA Draft Report highlights the challenges of hydraulic fracturing in shale gas fields, such as the Marcellus Shale, compared to tight gas sand fields like Pavillion. Greater volumes of fluid are needed for shale gas wells, leading to issues with water supply, disposal, and potential surface spills that could contaminate drinking water aquifers. Stakeholders have raised concerns about these differences in hydraulic fracturing processes. The EPA's actions since the release of its Draft Report in December 2011 have included collecting additional samples from deep monitoring wells and extending the public comment period. The finalization of the report and independent scientific peer review have been postponed. The outcome of the investigation by the state of Wyoming will determine any future actions at the Pavillion site. EPA's response authorities under CERCLA at the federal level are reviewed in an appendix to the report. The EPA Draft Report on the Pavillion site groundwater investigation is part of the standard evaluation process under CERCLA to identify contamination and potential sources. The applicability of findings to other sites depends on geological similarities and site-specific factors. Cleanup actions would be constrained by exclusions, limitations, or exemptions if contamination warrants protection measures. Certain exclusions, limitations, or exemptions could constrain EPA's actions under CERCLA at sites like Pavillion, including the exclusion of natural gas releases from the statute's reach and limitations on responding to naturally occurring hazardous substances. Liability exemptions also apply to federally permitted releases, including certain state-issued permits for underground injection in oil or gas production. The initial site evaluation funded by EPA's Superfund program does not automatically place a site on the National Priorities List (NPL). The EPA's investigation at the Pavillion site is part of the initial site-specific evaluation process under CERCLA. It includes an Expanded Site Inspection to collect more samples and characterize contaminants in groundwater. This step aims to determine if emergency response actions are needed and if the site should be listed on the National Priorities List for further response actions. Approximately 50,000 potentially contaminated sites have been reported to EPA since 1980, with over 21,000 sites undergoing Site Inspections like Pavillion. Only 1,685 sites have been listed on the NPL, with some removed after meeting cleanup objectives. EPA's Draft Report for Pavillion did not definitively link contaminants in groundwater to a specific release, leading to no determination of cleanup actions. The EPA did not find a need for cleanup actions or identify responsible parties for response actions under CERCLA. Confirmation of contamination sources and further risk assessments are required before determining cleanup necessity or liable parties. If a hazardous substance release poses a threat, EPA evaluates potential hazards based on criteria in CERCLA to determine NPL listing eligibility using the Hazard Ranking System. The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) ranks potential hazards on a scale of 1 to 100, with sites scoring 28.5 and higher eligible for listing on the NPL. EPA may elevate priority for cleanup at the federal level based on various criteria, including deferring a site to the state. If not listed on the NPL, EPA can still take federal actions to address health and environmental risks through removal or remedial actions under CERCLA. The Superfund program allows for removal actions to address immediate risks, while remedial actions provide long-term solutions. Sites must be listed on the NPL for Superfund appropriations for remedial actions, but removal actions are eligible regardless of listing status. Superfund funds can be used for initial site evaluations before listing decisions. At the Pavillion site, Superfund funds were used for a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection. EPA can enforce cleanup liability under CERCLA if contamination sources are confirmed. The authorities of the statute identify potentially responsible parties liable under CERCLA. Cleanup orders and agreements can be issued regardless of NPL listing. EPA's enforcement authority is limited if a state is already cleaning up a site. EPA did not use CERCLA enforcement at the Pavillion site, identifying constituents in the aquifer related to natural gas production without pinpointing the source or responsible parties. The curr_chunk discusses potential risks that may require cleanup, without specifying responsible parties or constituents."
