Phased retirement enables eligible federal employees to work reduced hours while receiving a prorated federal retirement benefit. Approval from federal agencies is required for this voluntary option, with mentoring activities typically involved. The main goal of phased retirement, as per OPM, is to enhance mentoring within the federal workforce. Phased retirement allows eligible federal employees to work reduced hours while receiving a prorated federal retirement benefit. It aims to enhance mentoring and training for employees filling the positions of retiring workers. Dual compensation, the concurrent receipt of a federal salary and pension, was generally prohibited before the enactment of phased retirement. Congress has provided waivers in some cases to reduce the pay reduction typically required for dual compensation. Waivers allow reemployed annuitants to receive full salaries and retirement benefits, reducing the pay reduction typically required for dual compensation. Individuals under CSRS or FERS may be reemployed by the federal government but cannot collect both a federal retirement benefit and a salary concurrently in most cases. Waiver authority since 1990 has allowed certain reemployed annuitants to receive full salaries and retirement benefits. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 allow reemployed annuitants to receive both a federal salary and retirement benefits under certain waivers, without accruing new retirement benefits under CSRS or FERS. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 and 2010 allow federal annuitants to be hired by the Department of Defense without reducing their salaries by the amount of their annuities. The 2010 Act also permits individuals receiving annuities under CSRS or FERS to be appointed to temporary, part-time positions without a salary offset. The waiver authority granted under P.L. 111-84 allows reemployed annuitants to work a certain number of hours over specific time periods without affecting their retirement annuity. The total number of appointments under this authority cannot exceed 2.5% of the agency's full-time employees, with a report required if appointments exceed 1%. The waiver authority is set to expire on October 27, 2014, and reemployed annuitants' pay is reduced by the amount of their annuity during reemployment. Reemployed annuitants have their pay reduced by the amount of their annuity during reemployment. If the period of reemployment lasts one year or more, they are eligible for a supplemental annuity upon retirement. Phased retirement authority allows certain retirement-eligible federal employees to work a reduced schedule while receiving a reduced salary and retirement benefits. Phased retirement requires employees to spend 20% of reduced work hours on mentoring activities, serving as a tool for knowledge transfer and workforce management. It allows eligible employees to reduce work hours before retirement and receive prorated retirement benefits, promoting knowledge management and continuity of operations. The phased retirement authority allows employees to reduce their work schedule by 50%, receiving 50% of their previous salary. Additional work percentage options between 20% and 80% may be offered by OPM, but currently only the 50% reduced schedule is available. This structure aims to facilitate the implementation of phased retirement. During phased retirement, employees cannot change their reduced work schedule. They can only make one phased retirement election in their lifetime and cannot work in more than one position simultaneously. Phased retirement can be open-ended or have a mutually agreed time limit. Agencies can decide whether to establish time limits. Phased retirees can apply for full retirement at any time and may request to return to regular employment with agency approval. Employees eligible for phased retirement must obtain approval from their agency to enter the program. It is a voluntary agreement between the employee and agency, with agencies having the discretion to implement phased retirement. Written criteria must be in place for approval or denial of applications, with agencies able to start accepting applications from employees since November 6, 2014. Criteria for approving phased retirement requests include designation of officials with authority, use of time limits, positions/geographic locations, and handling multiple requests. Implementation may be subject to collective bargaining, and not all federal employees are eligible. Requirements for participation relate to employment status, retirement eligibility, and mentoring, with only CSRS or FERS covered employees eligible. Phased retirement eligibility is limited to CSRS or FERS covered employees who have worked full-time for at least three years prior. Certain federal employee categories, such as law enforcement personnel, firefighters, air traffic controllers, and nuclear waste handlers, are excluded from phased retirement. This option is for individuals transitioning into retirement at the end of their careers, with specific age and service requirements to be met. To be eligible for phased retirement, CSRS employees need 30 years of service and be at least 55 years old, or 20 years of service and be at least 60 years old. FERS employees require 30 years of service and be at least the minimum retirement age (between 55 and 57 years), or 20 years of service and be at least 60 years old. Phased retirees must spend at least 20% of their hours on mentoring, except for U.S. Postal Service employees. Phased retirees must spend at least 20% of their hours on mentoring, except for U.S. Postal Service employees. Federal regulation allows agencies to waive the mentoring requirement in certain circumstances. Phased retirees work 50% of their previous schedules and receive 50% of their previous salaries, classified as part-time employees. They are considered to be working in their previous positions with reduced schedules for employee benefits. Phased retirees work 50% of their previous schedules and receive 50% of their previous salaries. Employee benefits may be prorated based on their reduced work schedules. Phased retirement annuity is calculated based on previous CSRS or FERS service. Benefits are recalculated as a composite annuity upon full retirement. The phased retirement annuity is calculated based on years of service and high-three pay. An example for an individual with 20 years of service and a high-three pay of $80,000 entering phased retirement at age 62 would receive $8,800 per year. This annuity is in addition to a reduced work schedule salary. Phased retirement annuities receive cost-of-living adjustments and military service credits must be made prior to entering phased retirement status. Phased retirement annuities are not subject to survivor annuity reductions and are recalculated as a composite annuity upon full retirement. The composite annuity includes the phased retirement annuity amount, any COLAs, and a calculation based on high-three pay, benefit accrual rate, years of service, and reduced work schedule percentage. The composite annuity calculation for phased retirees under FERS includes unused sick leave, COLA adjustments, and no survivor annuity reduction. Phased retirees make employee contributions based on part-time salary and do not receive the FERS annuity supplement during phased retirement. During phased retirement, retirees can still participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and make employee contributions based on their pay. They are considered full-time employees for the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP), maintaining coverage and premiums. During phased retirement, federal employees' FEHBP premiums remain the same and are based on full-time employment. They and their agencies pay the same amount as before phased retirement. Federal service during phased retirement counts towards the five years needed to continue FEHBP as an annuitant. Phased retirees are considered full-time for FEGLI coverage and premiums, receiving benefits as if they were full-time employees. Leave accrual during phased retirement is prorated like for part-time employees. During phased retirement, federal employees accrue leave based on a reduced work schedule. They accrue 1 hour of annual leave for every 10 hours in pay status and 1 hour of sick leave for every 20 hours in pay status. Annual leave is not paid out as a lump sum during phased retirement but upon full retirement. Sick leave balance is maintained and included in the annuity calculation upon full retirement."
