    "content": "Repeal of laws and regulations disarming firearms-trained military personnel and prohibition on reimposing bans on military personnel carrying firearms. In various attacks on military facilities, personnel were unable to defend themselves due to restrictions on carrying firearms. Military personnel are trained in firearm use and entrusted with weapons for defense. Gun-free zones on military installations are seen as vulnerable targets. Military recruitment centers are vulnerable targets. Laws and regulations disarming military personnel are repealed, allowing them to carry firearms on military installations and Department of Defense sites within the United States. Laws and regulations disarming military personnel, including section 1585 of title 10, United States Code, section 922 of title 18, United States Code, and part 108.11 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, are repealed. Military personnel are now allowed to carry firearms on military installations and Department of Defense sites in the United States, following CJCSI 3121.01B guidelines. The Standing Rules of Engagement and Use of Force for U.S. Forces allow commanders to prohibit military personnel from carrying firearms if necessary to prevent harm. The Secretary of Defense and military department Secretaries are prohibited from reinstating gun bans for military personnel. The Secretaries of the military departments are prohibited from reinstating firearm bans or enacting similar restrictions on military personnel carrying firearms. The President is also prohibited from taking any executive action to prohibit military personnel from carrying firearms. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 90 days on actions taken to ensure compliance. Definitions include Department of Defense sites like recruitment centers and facilities. The Department of Defense facilities or assets must meet force protection and physical security standards outlined in Department of Defense Directive 5200.08-R and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 for common identification standards. The Federal Government aims to establish a standard for secure identification for its employees and contractors, including military personnel trained in firearm use at duty stations on military installations."
