    "content": "The \"Simplifying Access to Student Loan Information Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title. This Act includes an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to require private educational lenders to submit information to the National Student Loan Data System for electronic data exchange with borrowers. The Truth in Lending Act now mandates private educational lenders to provide specific information about private education loans to the National Student Loan Data System, ensuring borrower privacy. This includes details like loan amounts, types, interest rates, and borrower information as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Education. The Secretary of Education requires private educational lenders to provide essential information for electronic data exchange with borrowers, including lender and servicer contact details, loan default and collection information, and deferment details. Private educational lenders must provide information on loan deferment or forbearance, repayment completion date by the borrower, and any other details deemed necessary by the Secretary of Education for the National Student Loan Data System. Lenders must update this information on the same schedule as the system under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Private education loans made for the 2011-2012 academic year or later are subject to the amendment under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 was amended for private education loans made for the 2011-2012 academic year or later. Section 485B of the Higher Education Act of 1965 was amended to include requirements for private education loans in the National Student Loan Data System. The Secretary must ensure that cosigners have access to information regarding these loans. The Secretary must ensure that private educational lenders only have access to submit information for the National Student Loan Data System regarding their own loans, and not those of other lenders. Additionally, within one year of the Simplifying Access to Student Loan Information Act of 2015, the Secretary must establish a repayment options functionality within the System. The Secretary will establish a functionality in the National Student Loan Data System for student borrowers to input information for estimating repayment amounts under different repayment plans."
