    "content": "Charter schools are publicly funded and tuition-free schools of choice that operate under charters granted by public chartering agencies. These schools have increased autonomy over operations in exchange for accountability for results. Funding is typically on a per-pupil basis, and enrollment is open to all, without neighborhood catchment areas. Charter schools operate under charters granted by public chartering agencies, with increased autonomy over operations in exchange for accountability. Enrollment is open to all students, with admission based on a lottery if demand exceeds capacity. The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1992, with other states following suit in enacting charter school laws. By 1999, 36 states and the District of Columbia had charter school laws, and currently, 42 states and the District of Columbia permit the authorization of charter schools. The number of students attending charter schools has increased along with the number of charter school state laws. In the 2012-2013 school year, there were 6,004 charter schools serving approximately 2.3 million students, accounting for 4.6% of all public school students. Federal support under Title V-B-1 and V-B-2 of the ESEA assists in opening new charter schools and funding charter school facilities. The State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants Program and the Credit Enhancement program are part of Title V-B charter school programs. Congress has been working on reauthorizing these programs independently of a comprehensive ESEA reauthorization. The Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10) aims to amend and reauthorize the Title V-B charter school programs. The report is divided into three main parts focusing on federal programs for public charter schools, program appropriations data, and recent congressional efforts to reauthorize charter school programs. The Appendix includes a legislative history of federal charter school programs enacted in the mid-1990s under the ESEA. The No Child Left Behind Act created charter school facilities support programs under Title V-B-1 and Title V-B-2 of the ESEA. Title V-B-1 aims to increase understanding of charter schools by funding planning, program design, and implementation, while Title V-B-2 authorizes the Credit Enhancement Program. The No Child Left Behind Act established charter school facilities support programs under Title V-B-1 and Title V-B-2 of the ESEA. Title V-B-1 focuses on funding planning and implementation of charter schools, while Title V-B-2 authorizes the Credit Enhancement Program to assist charter schools in acquiring facilities. Title V-B-1 authorizes various charter school programs and activities, including the Charter Schools Program that provides grants for planning and implementation of public charter schools. Funds can also support dissemination grants to successful charter schools. The Per-Pupil Facilities Aid Program offers competitive grants to states for facilities assistance on a per-pupil basis. Additionally, funds may be reserved for national activities like evaluation and technical assistance. Funding for Title V-B-1 programs and activities is provided through an overall appropriation for the Charter Schools Program. The first $200 million is reserved for grants to states and eligible applicants for planning, design, and initial implementation of public charter schools, dissemination of information, state revolving loan funds, and national activities. The next $100 million is for State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants Program, providing competitive grants to states for funding charter school facilities on a per-pupil basis. Fifty percent of funds over $300 million are reserved for each program, with the Secretary able to reserve 5% or $5 million. The Charter Schools Program under Title V-B-1 provides competitive grants for planning, program design, and initial implementation of charter schools. The Secretary can reserve up to 5% or $5 million for national activities, with a cap of $8 million. Recent appropriations acts have changed how funds are distributed among Title V-B programs. Charter schools are public schools that operate under public direction, providing elementary and/or secondary education. They do not charge tuition, comply with federal laws, use lotteries for student admission, and have written performance contracts addressing student performance and state assessments. State educational agencies in states with charter school laws may apply for grants under the Charter Schools Program. State educational agencies (SEAs) in states with charter school laws or charter school developers can apply for grants from the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Priority is given to SEAs that conduct periodic reviews of charter schools and meet certain criteria for increasing high-quality charter schools. The state ensures high-quality charter schools have autonomy over budget and expenditures, with a five-year review to assess meeting educational objectives. The Secretary considers the number of charter schools for grant awards. Charter schools must meet academic achievement goals to receive program funds. To be eligible for charter school program funds, a school must conduct a lottery if there are more applicants than available spots. Non-regulatory guidance from the ED outlines exemptions from the lottery, including students already enrolled in a converting public school, siblings of current charter school students, and children of school founders, teachers, and staff. The ED provides guidance on exemptions from charter school lotteries, including students from converting public schools, siblings of current students, and children of school employees. Weighted lotteries can be used to give certain students a better chance of admission, without reserving seats. The non-regulatory guidance allows charter schools to use weighted lotteries to give disadvantaged students slightly better chances for admission. State Education Agencies (SEA) must use funds to award subgrants to charter schools, with limits on reserves for dissemination grants, administrative expenses, and a revolving loan fund. The State Education Agencies (SEA) provide subgrants to charter schools for initial operation and ongoing support. Charter schools can use funds for planning, program design, and implementation. Dissemination grants are awarded to successful charter schools after three years of operation. Charter schools may receive federal funding within five months of opening or expanding, with grants used for planning and initial implementation. Charter schools can receive federal funding for post-award planning, design, and initial implementation activities, including professional development for staff and acquiring necessary equipment and materials. The grant funds for charter schools can be used for expenses related to initial implementation activities, personnel, rental costs, and maintenance of buildings and equipment. Additionally, up to 10% of the grant can be used for dissemination subgrants to assist other charter schools. The grant funds for charter schools can be used for initial implementation activities, personnel, rental costs, and maintenance of buildings and equipment. Up to 10% of the grant can be used for dissemination activities to assist other charter schools in adapting the program, developing partnerships, and promoting student achievement. The document outlines successful practices of charter schools to improve student performance. Funds are reserved for national activities, including providing information on federal funds and assisting in applying for education funds. Evaluations will assess the impact of charter schools on student achievement and teacher qualifications. The Secretary is to provide assistance to charter schools, including help with applications, planning, and training. Funds will be used to disseminate information on best practices, collect data on financial resources, and provide technical assistance for State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants. The State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants Program provides matching funds to states for charter schools to obtain facilities. Only SEAs with state laws authorizing per-pupil facilities aid for charter schools may apply. The program is authorized under national activities. The State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants Program provides funding to states for charter schools to acquire facilities. California, the District of Columbia, Indiana, Minnesota, and Utah have received funding. Grants are awarded based on priority criteria, and funds can be used for various purposes such as paying rent, purchasing land, or renovating school facilities. Grants are awarded for up to five years with a federal share of up to 90% in the first year. The federal share of the program funding decreases over five years, with specific percentages allocated each year. The program provides grants to public or private entities for credit enhancement initiatives to help charter schools with facility development. Grant recipients must deposit funds into a reserve account for approved purposes. The grant funds are used for guaranteeing bonds, insuring loans, and facilitating financing for charter schools to acquire or renovate school facilities. Additionally, the funds can be used to insure leases and assist in issuing bonds for the benefit of charter schools. The reserve account funds are not meant for direct payment of charter schools' facility costs or as the main source for loan repayment. They aim to boost charter schools' credit and use non-federal funds for facility costs and loan repayment. These funds should only be used for creditors and lenders in rare cases, not for lease payments, down payments, or loans. Up to 0.25% of the original grant can be used for administrative costs, but these funds are not deposited into the reserve account. Some program grantees include community development financial institutions (CFDIs). Some program grantees, such as community development financial institutions (CFDIs), focus on project financing and economic development in low-income communities. Changes to the charter school programs have been made through annual appropriations acts since FY2008, altering how funds can be used for State Charter School Facilities Grants and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program. Starting in FY2010, acts have also allowed certain funding to be used for these programs. The annual appropriations acts since FY2008 have made changes to charter school programs, allowing funds to be used for State Charter School Facilities Grants and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program. Starting in FY2010, the Secretary can make multiple awards to nonprofit charter management organizations for replication and expansion of successful charter school models. Funds can also be used for improving quality and oversight of charter schools, providing technical assistance, and grants to increase high-performing charter schools. FY2014 appropriations bill allows Title V-B charter school program funds to support preschool education. Since FY2010, changes have been made to funding provisions and requirements for the Charter Schools Program. Annual appropriations acts now include provisions for monitoring and holding accountable public chartering agencies, improving their capacity through activities like technical assistance and professional development. State applications for funds must ensure that charter schools operate under legally binding charters. The Charter Schools Program requires charter schools to operate under a legally binding charter, conduct annual audits, and demonstrate improved student academic achievement. State law mandates that increases in student achievement are crucial for charter renewal. Appropriations for charter school programs are detailed in Table 2. Beginning in FY2008, appropriations bills have allowed the Secretary to use funding from the Charter Schools Program to support State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program. Table 3 shows funding for Charter Schools Program grants, Charter Management Organizations, State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants, and peer review of new programs. During the 112th Congress, bills were proposed for a comprehensive reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), including amendments to charter school programs. The Encouraging Innovation and Effective Teachers Act was one of the bills aimed at this reauthorization. During the 112th Congress, bills were proposed for a comprehensive reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), including amendments to charter school programs. H.Rept. 112-459 Part 1 expressed the House's support for amending charter school programs as proposed in H.R. 2218. The bill received bipartisan support and was passed on the House floor on September 13, 2011. In the 113th Congress, both the House and Senate considered legislation to reauthorize the ESEA, with the HELP Committee passing the Strengthening America's Schools Act (S. 1094) and the House Education and Workforce Committee also considering a reauthorization bill. During the 113th Congress, the House Education and Workforce Committee considered bills to reauthorize the ESEA, including the Success for All Students Act (H.R. 5) and the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10). H.R. 5 was passed on the House floor on July 19, 2013, while H.R. 10 was introduced on April 1, 2014, and considered by the committee on April 8, 2014. Both bills aimed to amend and reauthorize the Charter Schools Program as part of a comprehensive ESEA reauthorization. H.R. 10, considered by the House Education and Workforce Committee on April 8, 2014, would make changes to current law provisions related to charter school programs under Title V-B-1 of the ESEA. It would consolidate provisions into specific sections and modify the authorization of appropriations for all programs from FY2015 through FY2020. The bill would consolidate charter school program provisions, set a $300 million authorization level for FY2015-2020, and allocate funds for specific purposes like improving student services and accountability. The Charter Schools Program under H.R. 10 would focus on supporting new, replicated, and expanded high-quality charter schools, allowing for technical assistance to eligible applicants and authorized chartering agencies. Unlike current law, state recipients would not be limited to SEAs, but include various entities like state charter school boards and governors. Under H.R. 10, the definition of \"state entity\" would expand to include various entities such as SEAs, state charter school boards, governors, and charter school support organizations. Developers seeking funds to start charter schools in states without Charter Schools Program grants would now apply directly to the Secretary for a grant. Charter schools could use weighted lotteries to admit students, and grants awarded to state entities would be for a maximum of five years. Under H.R. 10, grants awarded to state entities and subgrants to eligible applicants for charter schools would be limited to a maximum of five years. State entities and eligible applicants would be restricted from receiving more than one grant or subgrant, respectively, within a five-year period. The bill also outlines changes to the state entity application process, requiring detailed plans for supporting new charter schools and improving educational outcomes. The state entity applying for grants under H.R. 10 must provide detailed plans on supporting new charter schools, ensuring federal program participation, assisting students in transitioning to other schools if needed, and promoting inclusion and retention of all students in charter schools. H.R. 10 aims to work with charter schools to promote student inclusion and retention, prevent enrollment barriers, and share best practices in academic subjects and STEM fields. The bill includes new requirements for non-SEA state entity applicants to develop statewide support systems for charter schools and describe subgrant competition processes. The bill H.R. 10 focuses on promoting student inclusion and retention in charter schools, preventing enrollment barriers, and sharing best practices in academic subjects and STEM fields. It includes new requirements for non-SEA state entity applicants to develop statewide support systems for charter schools and describe subgrant competition processes. The bill also addresses quality controls, school performance factors for charter renewal or revocation, roles of outside partners, transportation needs, and support for diverse charter school models. The bill H.R. 10 introduces new assurances for state entities seeking grants, focusing on recruitment, enrollment, and retention of underserved students in charter schools. It includes criteria for quality authorizing, public charter school inclusion in decision-making, and information disclosure requirements. The bill retains existing selection criteria and adds new ones, such as monitoring subgrantees, avoiding duplication of work, and providing technical assistance for charter schools. The bill H.R. 10 aims to provide technical assistance and funding for charter schools, prioritizing states without caps on charter schools, equitable financing, and support for at-risk students. It also requires eligible applicants to use funds for opening and preparing charter schools. The bill H.R. 10 requires eligible applicants to use funds for opening and preparing new charter schools, high-quality charter school models, or expanding existing charter schools. It prohibits establishing revolving loan funds or awarding dissemination grants to charter schools. Reporting requirements are added for state entities receiving grants. The bill H.R. 10 requires eligible applicants to use funds for opening new charter schools, replication, or expansion. It also outlines reporting requirements for state entities receiving grants, with a portion of the appropriation reserved for national activities. Priority is given to eligible applicants meeting specific criteria for grant awards. The bill H.R. 10 requires eligible applicants to meet criteria such as having high-quality charter schools, serving disadvantaged students, and having plans for timely school closures. Funds will also be used for technical assistance and program evaluation. The bill H.R. 10 proposes significant changes to charter school funding, including allowing states without per-pupil facilities aid programs to apply for grants, permitting multiple grants with increasing funds for charter schools, and allowing states to partner with organizations for program costs. Additionally, the bill would make changes to the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program, requiring eligible entities to outline their financing plans. The bill H.R. 10 proposes changes to charter school funding, including offering more favorable rates and terms, adding a new objective for predevelopment costs, and altering reporting requirements for the program. H.R. 10 proposes changes to charter school requirements, including compliance with additional federal laws like ADA and FERPA, automatic enrollment for students in affiliated schools, and serving prekindergarten and postsecondary students. It also introduces new definitions for charter management organizations and high-quality charter schools. The Charter Schools Program was initially authorized in 1994 under the Improving America's Schools Act. The program underwent substantial amendments in 1998 and 2002, with the enactment of two additional programs related to charter schools. The Secretary of Education was authorized to make grants to state educational agencies for implementation of charter school grant programs for local educational agencies. Charter schools were defined as public schools exempted from significant state or local rules. Charter schools, exempt from state or local rules, must have specific educational goals. They can be new or converted traditional public schools, nonsectarian, tuition-free, and admit students through lotteries if needed. Charters are granted by authorized entities. The Charter Schools Program was expanded in 1998. The Charter Schools Program was amended by the Charter School Expansion Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-278), which prioritized granting funds to states that support charter schools with financial autonomy, increased their number of charter schools, and provided technical assistance for federal aid eligibility. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; P.L. 107-110) further amended the program in 2002. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; P.L. 107-110) in 2002 amended the Charter Schools Program, moving it to Title V-B-1 of the ESEA. Two new programs related to charter school facilities were enacted under NCLB: the Per-Pupil Facilities Aid program (State Charter Schools Facilities Incentive Grants) and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program. The Charter Schools Program under Title V-B-2 of the ESEA allows ED to provide grants to improve charter schools' credit for acquiring facilities. Substantive changes to the program have been made through annual appropriations acts since FY2010, affecting funding, fund usage, and grant application processes. These changes have not altered the program's authorizing law."
