It designates the Elk River as a study river and includes provisions for consolidated management, miscellaneous amendments, Gauley access, a visitor center, and an extension. The \"West Virginia Rivers Conservation Act of 1993\" amends boundaries for national rivers and scenic areas in West Virginia, including the New River Gorge, Gauley River, and Bluestone River. It also designates the Upper New River as a National Wild and Scenic River. The Upper New River in West Virginia is designated as a wild and scenic river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The acreage limitation does not apply to this segment, and improvements to existing roads are allowed within its boundaries. Jurisdiction over US-owned lands within the designated segment is transferred to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior now has administrative jurisdiction over the designated segment in West Virginia, with existing leases between the US and the State of West Virginia for the Bluestone Wildlife Management Area remaining in effect. The State retains management of hunting, fishing, and other wildlife activities within the area, with the option for the Secretary to terminate or modify leases upon request. The Secretary may terminate or modify leases and assume administrative authority over designated areas in Virginia. This designation does not affect the management of the Bluestone project or the authority of US departments to carry out project purposes. ELK RIVER designated as a study river. The Secretary of the Interior will study a segment of the Elk River in West Virginia to determine its eligibility as a national wild and scenic river, a unit of the National Park System as a national river, or a unit of the National Park System as a national recreation area. A report on the study results will be submitted to the relevant committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 3 years. This study will not impact the management of the Sutton project or the authority of any U.S. department, agency, or instrumentality to carry out project purposes. The authority of any U.S. department, agency, or instrumentality to carry out project purposes as of the date of enactment of this section. TITLE IV--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 401. CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT.\n\nTo streamline operations, the Secretary of the Interior will merge offices and personnel overseeing the New River segment with those managing the New River Gorge National River, Gauley River National Recreation Area, and Bluestone National Scenic River when feasible.\n\nSEC. 402. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\nAmendment to Title XI of the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to include a new section regarding the applicability of other laws. SEC. 1117 of the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987 applies cooperative agreements to the New River Gorge National River like the Gauley River National Recreation Area. Remnant lands within the New River Gorge National River are subject to similar provisions as lands within the Gauley River National Recreation Area. SEC. 403 addresses Gauley River access. Section 202(e) of the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987 is amended to provide access to the Gauley River at Woods Ferry for noncommercial entities, including the construction of parking facilities. The Secretary may provide transportation services for noncommercial visitors within the recreation area to minimize environmental impacts. Existing rights of way acquired before April 1, 1993, are protected, but compliance is required for further access downstream of the Summersville project. The Secretary is prohibited from acquiring or developing additional river access points within the recreation area. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to construct a visitor center and related facilities near the New and Gauley Rivers in West Virginia. The center can be built outside the boundaries of the National River and Recreation Area if no suitable site is available within. SEC. 405. EXTENSION. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act provisions will apply to the Bluestone and Meadow Rivers for 5 years after this Act's enactment, for segments eligible in 1983 studies but not designated by the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987."
