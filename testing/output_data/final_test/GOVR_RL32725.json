    "content": "Industrial hemp and marijuana are genetically distinct forms of cannabis with different uses and cultivation practices. Marijuana is used for medicinal or recreational purposes, while industrial hemp is cultivated for a variety of products. Both have separate definitions in statute. Hemp, defined as Cannabis sativa L. with low delta-9 THC levels, was legalized under the 2014 farm bill. There is ongoing uncertainty about its classification and regulation. The global hemp market offers a wide range of products across various industries. Hemp is a versatile crop that can be grown for fiber, seed, or dual-purpose. The harvested products include stalks with hurds and bast fibers, as well as smooth seeds. These components are used in various industries such as textiles, paper, construction, food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Hemp is used in a variety of industries including pharmaceuticals, building materials, insulating materials, plastics, and biodiesel. Commercial uses are well-documented in feasibility and marketing studies. Finished hemp products are mostly imported into the United States for further processing and manufacturing. No official estimates are available for the value of U.S. sales of hemp-based products. The Hemp Industries Association (HIA) reports total U.S. retail sales of hemp products of nearly $700 million in 2016, with sales increasing annually by 10% to 20% since 2011. Sales are mainly driven by body products, supplements, and foods, accounting for over two-thirds of retail sales. Limited information is available on other hemp-based sectors like construction, biofuels, and textiles. Data on existing businesses and processing facilities are also lacking. In 2017, U.S. hemp imports totaled $67.3 million, with hemp seeds and fibers being the main imports. The value of imports has been steadily increasing since 2005, following the resolution of a legal dispute over hemp imports in 2004. Hemp seeds accounted for 64% of the total import value, while other ingredients like hemp oil and seed cake made up 28%. Hemp yarns and fibers represented 8% of the total import value. Data on finished hemp products like clothing are not available. In 2017, U.S. hemp imports totaled $67.3 million, with Canada being the largest supplier accounting for about 90% of the value. Other leading suppliers include China and Romania. Imports include food-grade hemp seed, oilcake, raw and processed hemp fiber, and yarn. Different forms of seed are imported, including de-hulled seed and non-viable whole seed. Most hemp seed cultivars originate in Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and China. Researchers acknowledge the potential profitability of industrial hemp but also face challenges such as re-establishing agricultural supply chains, breeding modern varieties, upgrading equipment, modernizing processing, and identifying new opportunities. USDA and various universities have conducted feasibility and marketing studies in recent years. Recent market reports show that hemp production can yield around $21,000 per acre from seeds and $12,500 from stalks. Studies indicate a positive market outlook for hemp due to increasing consumer demand and diverse product uses. Removing restrictions on hemp cultivation in the US could benefit agricultural producers. A 2008 study noted a growing trend in hemp cultivation in Canada, with potential for various uses and enthusiastic market developers. Some studies highlight production advantages of hemp, such as low input requirements, while others are less optimistic about the potential market for US growers. USDA and University of Wisconsin-Madison studies project small markets and limited profits for hemp production. The profitability of hemp production in the US is uncertain due to labor-intensive harvesting and processing technologies, competition from other producers, yield variability, and lack of harvesting innovations and processing facilities. Estimates of profitability are speculative and often do not include additional costs associated with growing hemp in a regulated market. A 2013 study from the University of Kentucky found that the profitability of commercial hemp production was uncertain for Kentucky grain growers due to market conditions. The study highlighted limited short-term employment opportunities and the need for further research. A 2016 study suggested that the most promising markets for North American hemp production are oilseed and cannabidiol (CBD) production. The potential market and employment effects of relaxing current restrictions on U.S. hemp production are uncertain due to the absence of commercial hemp production in the United States since the 1950s. While some states or localities may see expanded market opportunities if restrictions are lifted, predicting future retail sales or employment gains nationally or regionally is challenging. Limited information is available from previous market analyses conducted by USDA and other agencies, and approximately 30 countries worldwide currently permit hemp cultivation. Global hemp cultivation data in 2016, excluding Canada, shows about 192,000 acres with a production of 355 million pounds. Including Canada, the total acreage was around 225,000 acres. Canada is a major hemp producer and supplier of U.S. hemp imports. In 2017, hemp acreage in Canada and the EU reached record levels, potentially exceeding 330,000 acres. In 2016, Europe was the world's largest hemp producer, with over 80,000 acres cultivated, accounting for half of global production. Many EU countries have active hemp markets, with production centered in France, the Netherlands, Lithuania, and Romania. Europe, including countries like France, the Netherlands, Lithuania, and Romania, is a major hemp producer. Other European countries like Russia, Ukraine, and Switzerland also have hemp production. China is a significant producer of hemp textiles and supplies the United States. Additionally, countries like Canada, Chile, Iran, Japan, South and North Korea, Pakistan, Syria, Turkey, New Zealand, India, Egypt, South Africa, Thailand, Malawi, and Uruguay have active hemp markets. Canada's commercial hemp industry is relatively new. Canada's commercial hemp industry in Canada is fairly new, with licenses for research crops issued in 1994 and commercial licenses starting in 1998. Production has been variable year to year, ranging from 8,000 acres in 2008 to a record of nearly 140,000 acres in 2017. The number of cultivation licenses has also varied, with a high of 560 licenses in 2006 and more than 1,100 issued in recent years. The commercial hemp industry in Canada has seen significant growth, with over 1,100 licenses issued in 2015 and 2016. Annual retail sales of Canadian-derived hemp seed products range from $20 million to $40 million. The industry is strictly regulated by the Office of Controlled Substances of Health Canada, with THC levels limited to 0.3% in hemp products. Farmers must undergo background checks to obtain a license to grow hemp in Canada. In Canada, farmers growing industrial hemp must submit extensive documentation, including criminal record checks and GPS coordinates of their fields. They also need supporting documents from relevant agencies and allow government testing for THC levels. Regulations were relaxed in 2016 to simplify the license application process for the 2017 growing season, aligning with the low health risks of hemp. The Canadian government has made commitments to legalize, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana. Simplifications and streamlining have been implemented for hemp production, including reduced paperwork, proof requirements, and THC testing. These changes aim to facilitate hemp production for Canadian farmers, giving them an advantage over U.S. growers where hemp production is still restricted. Hemp cultivation is allowed under certain circumstances by research institutions and state departments of agriculture in the United States. In 2017, there were over 25,500 acres of hemp production, with 1,420 registered growers and 32 universities conducting research. Investment in hemp processing facilities is ongoing in states like Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and New York. Industrial hemp was widely grown in the U.S. until the mid-1800s for fabrics, twine, and paper. In the early 1900s, hemp production in the U.S. was handled by USDA, with researchers exploring its potential for textiles and paper. Between 1914 and 1933, 33 states restricted hemp production to medicinal and industrial use only. The 1937 Marihuana Tax Act classified hemp as a narcotic, requiring special registration and tax stamps for farmers. In 1943, U.S. hemp production peaked at over 150 million pounds on 146,200 acres, but declined after World War II due to competition from synthetic fibers and the Marihuana Tax Act. Production dropped to 3 million pounds by 1948 on 2,800 acres, with no recorded production after the late 1950s. Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937 to discourage cannabis production for marijuana while still permitting industrial uses of hemp. The Marihuana Tax Act and decreasing hemp production post-1958 were influenced by fibers, public anti-drug sentiment, and the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The CSA defined Cannabis sativa similarly to the Marihuana Tax Act, excluding mature stalks, fiber, oil, and seeds from the definition of \"marihuana.\" The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) retains control over all varieties of the cannabis plant, including industrial hemp, by including them under the term marijuana. The CSA does not distinguish between low- and high-THC varieties and places strict controls on production, requiring a DEA permit to grow cannabis. The statute exempts parts of mature plants intended for industrial uses, such as stalks, fiber, oil, and seeds. DEA refutes the interpretation that industrial hemp is exempt under the CSA, but growers complying with the 2014 farm bill provision may be allowed to cultivate it. The 2014 farm bill allows certain institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp as part of an agricultural pilot program without DEA approval. The bill defines industrial hemp as Cannabis sativa L. with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3%. The provision was included in the research title of the law and did not specify an effective date for the program. The provision allowing institutions of higher education to grow industrial hemp for research purposes was adopted as an amendment to the 2013 farm bill. It applied to states that already permit industrial hemp growth under state law, and was included in a revised version of the House bill despite the full House ultimately rejecting H.R. 1947. The revised version of the House bill (H.R. 2642) included language allowing research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp as part of an agricultural pilot program. This provision was expanded during the conference on the House and Senate bills, allowing for the exclusion of industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act. Several states responded to the industrial hemp provision in the 2014 farm bill by initiating new hemp pilot projects and enacting legislation for hemp cultivation. Speculation arose regarding the termination or reauthorization of the provision in future farm bills, but the language in the 2014 farm bill suggests a degree of permanence for the industrial hemp research provision. The 2014 farm bill aims for permanence, but industrial hemp remains restricted under U.S. drug laws. Despite some allowances for hemp production, DEA oversight still applies, including the need for DEA registration for importing viable seeds. The 2016 joint Statement of Principles on Industrial Hemp reaffirmed these restrictions, clarifying that commercial sale and interstate transfer of hemp are still limited. The transfer of hemp remains restricted under U.S. drug laws. States faced challenges in growing industrial hemp due to a lack of viable seeds and DEA efforts to block imports. Congress swiftly acted to prevent DEA interference with state agencies and hemp growers, ensuring the implementation of the hemp provision in the farm bill. The provision in the enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation blocks federal law enforcement from interfering with state agencies, hemp growers, and agricultural research in contravention of the 2014 farm bill. It also allows for the transportation, processing, sale, or use of industrial hemp grown in accordance with the farm bill provision. The FY2018 CJS appropriation prohibits the use of funds by the Department of Justice or the Drug Enforcement Administration in violation of the 2014 farm bill's provision on industrial hemp. Previous appropriations bills also aimed to prevent federal interference with state agencies, hemp growers, and agricultural research related to industrial hemp. The Senate FY2018 Energy and Water Development appropriations proposed to allow hemp growers access to water if grown in accordance with state laws. The House CJS bills also aimed to prevent federal interference with state laws on industrial hemp. The Senate committee urged USDA to clarify funding for research projects compliant with the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 Agricultural Act allowed funds for research projects compliant with industrial hemp initiatives, addressing concerns from state and private institutions. Congressional efforts sought clarification on USDA research funds for hemp. Interest in hemp as an alternative crop has grown in the US since the mid-1990s. Interest in hemp as an alternative crop has grown in the US since the mid-1990s, with many states enacting legislation favorable to hemp cultivation following the 2014 farm bill provision. Nearly 40 states or territories have enacted or introduced such legislation, with more states considering similar laws. (Figure 6) State actions regarding hemp are evolving rapidly, with requirements varying among states. Common provisions include defining industrial hemp based on THC percentage, authorizing cultivation, creating advisory boards, establishing licensing programs, and promoting research and development. Some states have guidelines for industrial hemp growers, including seed requirements and penalties. USDA has provided guidance on organic certification. Calls for consensus standards for cannabis varieties are increasing due to the lack of standards. Production of industrial hemp is happening in multiple states, with some states implementing taxation and fees. Some states have enacted taxation and fees for industrial hemp cultivation, including California, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and West Virginia. Federal law requires growers to obtain permission from the DEA to cultivate cannabis, regardless of state permits. DEA enforces strict production controls, leading to cases where growers have been denied permits to grow hemp. The DEA has not approved permits for hemp cultivation, even in states where it is legal. Obtaining a DEA permit involves demonstrating a security protocol, paying a fee, undergoing background checks, and extensive documentation. The process of obtaining and operating under a DEA permit, along with additional costs and regulatory requirements, may discourage production. In 1999, North Dakota passed a state law allowing industrial hemp production. Researchers applied for DEA permits but were denied. Two farmers with state licenses filed a lawsuit in 2007 seeking permission to cultivate hemp. The case was dismissed in 2007 and again in 2009. The farmers appealed in 2010. In 2009, some U.S. farmers were growing hemp without federal permits, challenging the DEA's authority. Limited information is available on the DEA's permit process for hemp cultivation, with reports indicating reluctance to grant licenses even for research purposes. DEA had issued a permit for an experimental hemp plot in Hawaii from 1999 to 2003. DEA was hesitant to grant licenses for hemp cultivation, even for research purposes. Land grant university researchers obtained licenses under specific conditions. DEA enforced a zero-tolerance THC standard for imported hemp and hemp foods from late 1999 to 2004, sparking a debate. In October 2001, DEA published an interpretive rule in the Federal Register explaining the basis of its zero-tolerance standard. In March 2003, the DEA issued rules stating that hemp products often contain THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana. The rules prohibited cannabis products with THC intended for human consumption. Retailers of hemp foods faced potential seizure by the DEA after a certain date. The 2003 DEA rules prohibited cannabis products with THC for human consumption, leading to potential seizure of hemp foods by the DEA. Hemp industry groups argued that naturally occurring THC in hemp is at non-psychoactive levels and should be exempt from enforcement. The TestPledge Program certifies low THC levels in hemp-containing foods to ensure they do not interfere with drug testing or cause health effects. The U.S. Court of Appeals permanently blocked DEA's enforcement of THC rules in 2004, and the Bush Administration did not appeal. In January 2017, HIA appealed to block DEA's rule on marijuana extracts, including CBD, as \"marihuana extract\" under the CSA. In February 2017, HIA petitioned again, alleging DEA violated a 2004 court order regarding hemp products. In May 2018, DEA issued a directive clarifying that certain cannabis plant products fall outside the CSA's definition of marijuana. The DEA issued a directive in May 2018 clarifying that certain cannabis plant products, such as sterilized seeds, oil, mature stalks, and fiber, are exempt from the Controlled Substances Act and can be distributed in the United States without restrictions. This directive does not address marijuana extracts and resins. Some interpret the 2018 DEA directive as suggesting that CBD extracted from hemp may be exempt from regulation. However, research shows that extracting meaningful levels of CBD from industrial hemp may be challenging. The Department of Justice updated its marijuana enforcement policy in 2013 after state ballot initiatives in Washington and Colorado legalized marijuana possession and regulation. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces the Controlled Substances Act, keeping marijuana illegal. DOJ prioritizes preventing distribution to minors, revenue going to criminal enterprises, interstate diversion, illegal drug trafficking cover-ups, violence in cultivation, drugged driving, and public land cultivation. The Cole memo addresses the dangers of marijuana production on public lands and aims to prevent marijuana possession on federal property. The guidance from August 2013 includes industrial hemp production under the definition of marijuana. Colorado's state laws now allow for industrial hemp cultivation, but challenges remain in implementing the law, such as sampling, registration, and seed sourcing. Colorado's state laws allow for industrial hemp cultivation, but challenges remain in implementing the law, such as sampling, registration, seed availability, disposition of non-complying plants, and law enforcement concerns. There is uncertainty about federal authorities' response to production in states where cultivation is allowed. Requests for clarification from the DOJ have been made regarding federal enforcement authorities' response to industrial hemp cultivation. In September 2013, Representative Blumenauer urged Oregon state officials to implement hemp laws. DOJ officials in Oregon stated that federal prosecutors will be aggressive in enforcing laws related to hemp cultivation. They indicated they will not interfere with well-regulated hemp production in states. Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memorandum in January 2018 rescinding previous guidelines. In January 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded nationwide guidance on marijuana enforcement, including the 2013 Cole Memo. Some believe this does not affect industrial hemp efforts in certain states. Kentucky planned hemp pilot projects, but faced obstacles when U.S. Customs blocked a shipment of hemp seeds from Italy in May 2014. DEA officials justified their actions by stating that importing viable cannabis seeds is regulated by the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. The seeds must be sterilized to remove THC traces and meet specific requirements. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture sued DEA, DOJ, and U.S. Customs to release hemp seeds for commercial distribution. The Department of Agriculture filed a lawsuit against DEA, DOJ, U.S. Customs, and the U.S. Attorney General, claiming authorization to grow industrial hemp under state and federal law. DEA's actions caused uncertainty for U.S. hemp growers, leading Congress to pass legislation preventing DEA from interfering with hemp cultivation. Hemp production is allowed under the 2014 farm bill, but importing viable seeds requires DEA registration. The process involves sourcing seeds internationally, submitting a DEA 357 import form, and meeting USDA phytosanitary rules. DEA issued three major decisions in August 2016 regarding hemp cultivation. In August 2016, DEA made significant decisions on marijuana and industrial hemp. DEA rejected a petition to reschedule marijuana, maintaining its illegal status as a Schedule I controlled substance. Policy changes were announced for authorized marijuana cultivators for research. A joint statement with USDA and FDA addressed the uncertainties surrounding the application of Federal drug control laws to industrial hemp under the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill did not remove industrial hemp from the controlled substances list. Federal law still restricts hemp-related activities not legalized under the farm bill provision, which did not change CSA requirements for drug products. The bill also did not alter the approval process for new drug applications under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The joint statement reiterated the need for hemp to be grown in accordance with state agricultural pilot programs where industrial hemp production is legal. State registration and certification for hemp cultivation sites were not addressed in the 2014 farm bill. The joint statement addresses the need for registration of authorized manufacturers of industrial hemp, including location details. It clarifies who can grow hemp under state agricultural pilot programs and the applicability of USDA programs. Concerns arise over how federal agencies interpret the definition of industrial hemp and potential restrictions on product sales and seed importation. The joint statement clarifies regulations on industrial hemp cultivation, including who can grow it under state programs. Some in Congress and the industry have concerns about certain aspects of the statement. The joint statement clarifies regulations on industrial hemp cultivation, allowing private farmers licensed by state departments of agriculture and institutions of higher education to participate in USDA research programs. Some in the hemp industry are concerned about the interpretation of the statutory definition of industrial hemp in a joint statement by Congress and USDA. They worry that the statement excludes flowering tops, which contain the highest cannabinoid content, and broadens the definition of THC beyond what is specified in the 2014 farm bill. Congress members argue that the executive branch is defining industrial hemp too narrowly. Some Members of Congress are concerned that the executive branch is defining industrial hemp too narrowly, excluding certain parts and broadening the definition of THC beyond what is specified in the 2014 farm bill. They have requested the removal of certain language from the guidance to clarify restrictions on commerce and ensure that general commercial activity does not hinder sales within approved pilot programs. The hemp industry is also worried about restrictions on the sale of industrial hemp products in certain states. The joint statement emphasizes restrictions on the sale and transportation of industrial hemp products, including the prohibition of sales in states where it is not allowed. There is ongoing debate over the authority of federal agencies to limit hemp sales and transport under the 2014 farm bill. The joint statement provides guiding principles on industrial hemp sales and transport under the 2014 farm bill. However, it does not establish legal requirements, leading to uncertainty about its influence on future DEA policies. The Small Business Administration prohibits SBA-backed loans for businesses involved in hemp products unless they can prove legality under federal and state law. This creates challenges for businesses marketing industrial hemp products. President Clinton's Executive Order 12919 included hemp as an essential agricultural product for defense preparedness. Some argue that this gives hemp strategic value for national security. USDA has supported research on alternative crops since the late 1930s, with some like kenaf becoming established in certain parts of the US. Crops like kenaf, jojoba, and amaranth have been established in certain parts of the United States. The Critical Agricultural Materials Act of 1984 supports research on alternative crops at USDA and state laboratories. Authorities also fund the development of new commercial products from natural plant material for various applications. The United States is a signatory of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, which aims to limit drug use to medical and scientific purposes. The convention allows for the cultivation of the cannabis plant for industrial or horticultural purposes, which could support the development of a regulated hemp farming sector in the US. Congress has introduced legislation to further this goal. Congress has introduced legislation to advance industrial hemp farming in the United States, including an expanded version of the Industrial Hemp Farming Act. Amendments to the 2018 farm bill were proposed but not adopted, with discussions on clarifying eligibility for federally recognized Indian tribes to grow hemp. The 2018 farm bill amendments proposed changes for industrial hemp farming, including removing hemp from the CSA definition of marihuana and placing it under USDA jurisdiction. Amendments for standardized testing procedures and financial institution safe harbor were also suggested but not adopted. The Senate-passed farm bill (H.R. 2) includes provisions for industrial hemp, such as amending the CSA to exclude hemp with less than 0.3% THC. It also creates a new hemp program under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, expanding eligibility to other producers and groups. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2018 aims to facilitate commercial cultivation of industrial hemp in the US by excluding it from the definition of marijuana based on THC content. This would allow hemp producers to participate in federal crop insurance programs and USDA research initiatives. States or tribes seeking regulatory authority over hemp production must implement a monitoring plan. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2018 proposes to exclude low-THC hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, allowing for its cultivation under state laws. H.R. 5485 and S. 2667 would establish a new Hemp Production program under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, expanding the definition of hemp to include all parts of the Cannabis plant. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2018 aims to exclude low-THC hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, allowing cultivation under state laws. H.R. 5485 and S. 2667 propose a new Hemp Production program under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, expanding the definition of hemp to include all parts of the Cannabis plant, including derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, and salts. State and tribal plans would require monitoring, regulation, grower information collection, testing, disposal procedures, and compliance. H.R. 5485 and S. 2667 authorize appropriations for USDA to support state and tribal plans for industrial hemp, including requirements for plan approval, technical assistance, and corrective action for violations. The bills also include hemp in the federal crop insurance program and eligible for research funding. USDA is required to conduct a study of agricultural pilot programs, including the hemp pilot program. In the 115th Congress, Representative Comer introduced the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017 (H.R.3530) to exempt industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana in the CSA. The bill aimed to expand the definition of hemp to include viable seeds and allow cultivation by Native American tribes and states. It also defined research hemp as cannabis with a delta-9 THC concentration between 0.3% and 0.6% for scientific, medical, or industrial research. H.R. 3530 expands the Industrial Hemp Farming Act by requiring states and tribes to submit information on hemp production. Previous versions of the bill were introduced in multiple Congresses, with some lawmakers seeing economic benefits in hemp production. Legislation in the House and Senate addresses the therapeutic uses of industrial hemp for CBD production. CBD, a non-psychoactive compound in Cannabis, is marketed for various ailments. Some hemp-based CBD products have been marketed as having comparable therapeutic uses to CBD extracts, leading to FDA warning letters for fraudulent marketing claims. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to exclude cannabidiol and cannabidiol-rich plants with low THC levels from regulation under the Controlled Substances Act. The House bill also aims to exempt these products from regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. There are concerns about fraudulent marketing claims for hemp-based CBD products. Growing concern exists regarding hemp-based CBD products being marketed as rich in CBD and having therapeutic uses comparable to CBD extracts. Medicine-grade CBD is not derived from hemp seeds, which only contain low levels of CBD. Most CBD extracts are formulated from cannabis strains with THC levels higher than 0.3%. The FDA has issued warnings about the marketing of CBD in various therapeutic products. The FDA has not approved any CBD drug products and has issued warnings to companies marketing CBD products for health conditions. These products are not considered safe or effective by the FDA and cannot be sold as dietary supplements. FDA may consider federal enforcement actions against manufacturers of CBD products marketed as dietary supplements. The International Narcotics Control held a hearing on the barriers to research and potential medical benefits of CBD. Agriculture-based groups advocate for more research into industrial hemp-derived CBD. Some states are conducting research on its potential uses. The National Academies of Sciences published a review on cannabis research, concluding that oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The study discusses the potential medical uses of cannabis, including the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms. Various bills related to industrial hemp, such as the Industrial Hemp Banking Act and the Industrial Hemp Water Rights Act, have been introduced in the 115th Congress to support hemp production and ensure access to water for hemp growers. In late 2015, Members of Congress sought clarification from USDA on research funds for industrial hemp, amid concerns about eligibility for federal grant awards. Some institutions faced uncertainty about qualifying for USDA competitive grants for hemp research, potentially jeopardizing other grant opportunities. CRS staff attempted to clarify USDA's policy on industrial hemp research funding. USDA's information was inconsistent, with NIFA stating no competitive grants were awarded for hemp research in 2015. However, CRIS database showed formula-funded grants used at Colorado State University for hemp cultivation. USDA had no record of denying any hemp research applications. The USDA has no record of denying any industrial hemp research applications. A memo from December 2014 indicates that NIFA supports grants for hemp research as long as it meets state requirements outlined in the 2014 farm bill. This suggests that researchers can continue their work on hemp independently without risking their relationship with USDA. The USDA's Rural Business-Cooperative Service is exploring the possibility of providing grant funding for industrial hemp research under the 2014 farm bill. It is unclear if USDA will fund such applications in the future, and clarification is needed on the eligibility of hemp research projects for USDA competitive grants and other agricultural support. Some have suggested that industrial hemp producers may not qualify for certain USDA grant programs designated for specialty crops. Other potential programs for hemp producers include the Organic Transitions Integrated Research Program and the Value-Added Producer Grant Program. Additionally, there is interest in applying for non-USDA grants like the Small Business Innovation Research program. Some key agricultural groups and industry organizations support U.S. policy changes regarding industrial hemp. In 2018, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) expressed support for the Hemp Farming Act of 2018. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) supports the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, addressing issues hindering industrial hemp pilot programs. The Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation (WFBF) and 27 other Farm Bureau presidents recommend hemp as an agricultural crop. The Congressional Cannabis Caucus focuses on federal drug law reforms and state legalization issues. The National Farmers Union (NFU) updated its farm policy to urge reclassification of industrial hemp as a non-controlled substance for American farmers to grow. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) supports the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, urging the reclassification of industrial hemp as a non-controlled substance for American farmers to grow under state law without affecting USDA benefits. NASDA also urges Congress to distinguish between industrial hemp and marijuana and collaborate with USDA, DEA, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to develop an official definition of industrial hemp. NASDA supports the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, advocating for the reclassification of industrial hemp as a non-controlled substance for American farmers. The American Farm Bureau Federation also endorses policies to promote industrial hemp production and opposes its classification as a controlled substance. Regional farmers' organizations, like the North Dakota Farmers Union, have similar policies in support of hemp production. The North Dakota Farmers Union and Rocky Mountain Farmers Union urge Congress to legalize industrial hemp production and fund research into alternative crops. They support decoupling hemp from marijuana under the CSA and want the DEA to differentiate between the two. The National Grange also supports industrial hemp research and production. In California, efforts are ongoing to revise hemp regulations. In California, efforts are underway to redefine marijuana to exclude industrial hemp, with support from the state's sheriffs' association and the North American Industrial Hemp Council petitioning the DEA to remove hemp from federal drug schedules. Despite some support, groups like the National Alliance for Health and Safety oppose reintroducing hemp as an agricultural crop. The California Narcotic Officers' Association opposes proposals to reintroduce hemp as an agricultural crop, claiming it is a strategy by the pro-drug lobby to legalize cannabis. They argue that hemp production would undermine efforts to regulate marijuana, as the two crops are indistinguishable through surveillance. Concerns about potential linkages to illegal drug use are also raised by parent and community organizations. Hemp proponents believe that DEA opposition to changing current policies is due to concerns over hemp production undermining drug enforcement efforts. Further policy changes for industrial hemp are unlikely without congressional action. DEA and others fear that commercial hemp cultivation could complicate surveillance and enforcement activities, sending the wrong message about the government's stance on drugs. The DEA and other observers are concerned that efforts to legalize hemp and medical marijuana may be a front for decriminalizing marijuana. Hemp production in the US faces competition from global suppliers, with China being the largest producer. Canada's lead in the North American market for hemp seed and oil could impact the profitability of a US industry. Despite this, the US market for hemp-based products has a dedicated and growing demand base. The commercial hemp industry in the United States could provide opportunities as an economically viable alternative crop for some U.S. growers, supported by recent market data and trends for hemp products. Selected studies highlight the potential of industrial hemp as a sustainable agricultural commodity, with considerations for economic implications and political/social issues. The curr_chunk discusses various studies and reports on industrial hemp, including economic considerations, regulations, environmental costs, and production assessments. Various studies and reports on industrial hemp, including economic considerations, regulations, environmental costs, and production assessments, have been conducted by researchers such as T. R. Fortenbery, M. Bennett, E. Small, D. Marcus, J. Bowyer, K. Hill, N. Boshard-Blackey, J. Simson, M. J. Cochran, T. E. Windham, and B. Moore. The feasibility of industrial hemp production has been studied in various states such as Arkansas, North Dakota, Kentucky, and the Pacific Northwest. A joint statement of principles on industrial hemp was issued by the USDA, DEA, and FDA in August 2016 to inform the public on how Federal law applies to industrial hemp. The statement of principles clarifies how Federal law applies to industrial hemp activities for those participating in agricultural pilot programs. Industrial hemp growth must be part of a State-established program, with registration and certification of cultivation sites required. Authorized manufacturers must include their name, licensure period, and location for industrial hemp production. Only State departments of agriculture, authorized individuals under agricultural pilot programs, and institutions of higher education can grow industrial hemp. The term \"industrial hemp\" encompasses Cannabis sativa L. and its derivatives used exclusively for industrial purposes. Industrial hemp, including seeds, used for industrial purposes with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Sales limited to states with agricultural pilot programs for marketing research only. Prohibited from being sold in states where such sale is not allowed. Transport of industrial hemp plants and seeds across state lines is not permitted. The importation of industrial hemp seeds requires registration with the DEA. USDA phytosanitary requirements apply to hemp seed importation. Section 7606 does not amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Controlled Substances Act. It does not change FDA authorities regarding drug approval, research, or marketing oversight. Manufacturers, distributors, and researchers of drug products from cannabis plants must comply with CSA requirements. Institutions of higher education and participants in agricultural pilot programs under section 7606 may be eligible for USDA research programs."
