Functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs) are chronic conditions characterized by increased sensitivity of the GI tract, abnormal motor functioning, and brain-gut dysfunction. Symptoms include pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, incontinence, and difficulties in food passage. FGIMDs encompass various conditions affecting the esophagus, stomach, gallbladder, and more. Patients with FGIMDs often experience a range of symptoms affecting different parts of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the anorectal area. The severity of these conditions can vary from mild discomfort to life-threatening. However, effective treatments for FGIMDs are lacking, leading to dissatisfaction among patients who often resort to various medications and therapies. Additionally, a lack of proper education among physicians on diagnosing and treating FGIMDs results in unnecessary healthcare costs and delays in accurate diagnosis for patients. The economic impact of FGIMDs is significant, with annual costs in the United States for IBS alone estimated to be between $1.7 billion and $10 billion in direct medical costs. FGIMDs also impact the workplace through work absenteeism and lost productivity. Gastrointestinal symptoms in military veterans, particularly those deployed in war zones, are recognized as serious and disabling. FGIMDs affect individuals of all ages. Pediatric FGIMDs can be serious, leading to a lifetime of painful symptoms and medical expenses. There is a lack of public education and understanding, leading to stigma. The National Institutes of Health's National Commission on Digestive Diseases identified research goals related to FGIMDs in a 2009 report. SEC. 409K. FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL AND MOTILITY DISORDERS research enhancement under Part B of the Public Health Service Act aims to address the lack of public education and understanding of pediatric FGIMDs, which can lead to stigma and lifelong medical issues. The Director of NIH can enhance research on functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs) by expanding basic and clinical research, establishing centers of excellence at academic medical centers, and supporting innovative approaches to educate healthcare providers and patients. The NIH aims to improve patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, healthcare utilization, and reduce costs through collaborative research opportunities and funding for FGIMDs research. The NIH is expanding research into FGIMDs impacting children and maternal health, as well as partnering with the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs to improve patient care for FGIMDs common in veterans and military personnel. SEC. 4. PROMOTING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL AND MOTILITY DISORDERS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include public awareness of these disorders. The Secretary may engage in public awareness and education activities to increase understanding of functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs). This includes distributing materials targeting healthcare providers and the public, emphasizing basic information on FGIMDs, their symptoms, prevalence, and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. The sense of Congress is to improve treatment options for functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs) by accelerating efforts to enhance medical device and drug development, study risk vs. patient benefit, and identify proper endpoints. This includes supporting initiatives like the Patient Reported Outcomes Consortium and the Critical Path Initiative. The Critical Path Initiative aims to translate scientific breakthroughs into safe treatments quickly and collaborate with patient and provider organizations treating FGIMDs to consider the patient perspective in innovative treatment decisions."
