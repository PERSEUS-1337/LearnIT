The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2003\" introduces a new formula for calculating an individual's primary insurance amount based on a product of the excess under former law and an applicable percentage determined by a table.

The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2003\" introduces a new formula for calculating an individual's primary insurance amount based on a table of applicable percentages for different years, ranging from 55 percent in 1979 to 3 percent in 1987. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under the new formula. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' is the amount that would be the individual's primary insurance amount if calculated under the law in effect in December 1978. The primary insurance amount calculation under the \"Notch Fairness Act of 2003\" involves determining an individual's amount based on specific criteria, including the exclusion of certain subsections and the inclusion of computation base years after 1950. The primary insurance amount calculation under the \"Notch Fairness Act of 2003\" involves specific criteria for an individual's wages and self-employment income. This includes applying certain subdivisions and paragraphs to ensure a greater primary insurance amount for the individual. Additionally, timely elections for lump sum payments can also impact the computation of the primary insurance amount. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2003\" allows individuals to file timely elections for their primary insurance amount calculation with the Commissioner of Social Security. Any election filed after December 31, 2003, will be null and void. Upon receipt of a timely election, the Commissioner certifies it to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment. The Treasury will pay individuals $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, starting in fiscal year 2004. This payment is not included in determining the individual's primary insurance amount. If at least one beneficiary files a timely election by December 31, 2003, the Commissioner will certify it for payment. The Commissioner will certify timely elections for payment to beneficiaries, who will receive $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, starting in fiscal year 2004. This payment will not affect the calculation of the beneficiary's benefits. The amendments made by this Act will not increase monthly benefits or primary insurance amounts under title II of the Social Security Act before July 2004. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount to reflect benefit increases. The Commissioner of Social Security will recalculate the primary insurance amount for individuals receiving monthly benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for June 2004, taking into account the amendments made by this Act."
