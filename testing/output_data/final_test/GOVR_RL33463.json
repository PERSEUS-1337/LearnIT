    "content": "The United States engages in various trade negotiations, including joining the Trans-Pacific Economic Partnership Agreement, holding FTA talks with Malaysia, and reaching agreements with South Korea on beef imports. Legislation for the U.S.-Colombia FTA is introduced in Congress. During the 108th and 109th Congress, the U.S. negotiated and approved several bilateral free-trade agreements with countries like Australia, Chile, Morocco, Singapore, Central America, Dominican Republic, Bahrain, and Oman. The Bush Administration prioritizes bilateral and regional free-trade agreements over multilateral agreements. Trade agreements are negotiated by the executive branch, with Congress having the ultimate authority to regulate commerce. Trade promotion authority (TPA) requires the President to consult with and advise Congress throughout the process. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) requires the President to consult with Congress during negotiations and allows for implementing legislation if needed. The U.S. negotiating strategy focuses on \"competitive liberalization\" to push for trade liberalization through bilateral, regional, and multilateral agreements. Former USTR Robert B. Zoellick emphasized the importance of strengthening the coalition for freer trade. Former USTR Robert B. Zoellick stressed the need to bolster the coalition advocating for freer trade to prevent giving power to protectionists. Critics argue that the focus on regional and bilateral negotiations weakens the WTO and increases the risk of trade diversion. This leads to a complex web of rules and tariffs, known as a 'spaghetti bowl'. New USTR Susan Schwab also highlighted the importance of negotiating bilateral and regional agreements. The negotiation of bilateral and regional FTAs aims to set precedents and demonstrate the benefits of free trade. The selection of FTA partners by the Administration has faced scrutiny. Traditionally, trade agreements are negotiated for economic, political, and development reasons. The U.S.-Canada FTA focused on economic ties, while NAFTA included a geopolitical rationale for stability. The FTA with Israel and Jordan had economic and geopolitical rationales. The selection of FTA partners by the Administration lacked formal rules. Factors for evaluating countries included trade capabilities, political system maturity, and economic benefits to the U.S. The United States considers various factors when selecting FTA partners, including trade capabilities, political system maturity, and economic benefits. The reauthorization of trade promotion authority is crucial for attracting future partners. Some Members of Congress and business groups question the selection process, favoring a focus on multilateral negotiations in the WTO for greater commercial gains. Senator Baucus criticized the Administration for prioritizing foreign policy over economics in trade policy decisions. The Administration emphasizes the importance of negotiating free trade agreements to enhance prosperity and freedom globally. They view free trade as a fundamental freedom and believe that economic policies are more effective than development assistance in lifting nations out of poverty. Critics question the impact of trade agreements on American jobs and the relocation of production to other countries. Some critics argue that trade agreements do not address lower labor and environmental standards in other countries, leading to the relocation of U.S. production. Democratic leaders in the 110th Congress sought changes in trade negotiating strategy, unveiling Democratic trade principles that may require modifications to current FTAs. A conceptual agreement was reached on several issues between congressional leaders and the Bush Administration on May 10. On May 10, a conceptual agreement was announced on key issues related to trade agreements, including enforcement of labor standards, adherence to environmental agreements, protection of investor rights, government procurement policies, and flexibility in pharmaceutical product approvals. This agreement may pave the way for consideration of the Peru and Panama agreements. The United States has been actively engaged in numerous trade negotiations under the current Administration's competitive liberalization strategy. The United States has been involved in numerous trade negotiations under the current Administration, including agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Legislation to implement these agreements will be considered by the 110th Congress. Additionally, FTAs with Bahrain, Oman, and a combined FTA with the Dominican Republic and Central American countries have been ratified, but agreements with Oman and Costa Rica have not yet entered into force. The President must notify Congress before starting any trade negotiations under trade promotion authority legislation. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, passed in 2002, requires the President to notify Congress before starting trade agreement negotiations and signing completed agreements. The legislation applies to agreements entered into before July 1, 2007. If the Administration meets notification and consultation requirements, Congress is called to consider implementing legislation for a trade agreement under expedited procedures. The Administration must notify Congress at least 90 days before negotiations and consult with relevant committees. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the Administration to consult with congressional committees and the Congressional Oversight Group (COG) during trade agreement negotiations. The USTR must also comply with consultation and assessment requirements for specific sectors like agriculture, textiles, and fish. Additionally, guidelines outline the process for briefings, document access, and coordination with the COG. The President must report to revenue committees 180 days before signing an agreement and notify Congress 90 days before entering into a trade agreement. Before entering into a trade agreement, the President must notify Congress at least 90 days in advance. Private sector advisory committees must submit reports on the agreement within 30 days of notification. The President must provide details of the agreement to the International Trade Commission and request an assessment. Consultation with congressional committees, the COG, and other advisers is required, especially for agricultural trade agreements. Within 60 days of entering into the agreement, the President must submit a list of necessary changes to U.S. law for compliance. The International Trade Commission (ITC) must report to the President and Congress on the likely impact of a trade agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industrial sectors within 90 days. Once the President sends a draft implementing bill, it is introduced to the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee. Each committee has 45 days to report the legislation or it goes to the full chamber. The Senate committee may consider the House-passed legislation within 15 days. Each chamber has 15 days after reporting to act on the legislation. Negotiations with Colombia for a trade agreement began as a regional deal with the Andean Community countries but later pursued separate tracks. The United States signed the agreement with Colombia on February 27, 2006, and it was officially signed on November 22, 2006. In 2007, Colombia was the 30th largest trading partner of the United States with bilateral trade totaling $17.1 billion. Leading U.S. imports from Colombia include petroleum, coffee, spices, apparel, cut flowers, gold, and precious metals. U.S. imports from Colombia include petroleum, coffee, spices, apparel, cut flowers, gold, and precious stones. Prominent U.S. exports to Colombia are heavy construction and drilling equipment, chemicals, telephony equipment, plastics, and cereal grains. The trade agreement with Colombia faces concerns regarding violence against trade unionists and human rights defenders. Leaders announced they would not support the Colombia FTA at this time. Legislation implementing the U.S.-Colombia FTA was sent to Congress. Bilateral negotiations for an FTA with Panama began in 2004. The USTR cited Panama's return to democracy and regional importance. Negotiations for a trade agreement with Panama began in 2004, focusing on counternarcotics, anti-terrorism, and anti-money laundering efforts. Delays occurred over agriculture and government procurement issues, with further discussions on labor matters. The agreement was finalized in December 2006, with President Bush intending to sign it in March 2007. Labor and environmental provisions were left open for agreement with Congress. Panama signed the agreement in June 2007, ratified by the Panamanian National Assembly in July. Consideration by Congress was complicated by the election of Pedro Miguel Gonzales as President in September 2007. The election of Pedro Miguel Gonzales as President of Panama's National Assembly in September 2007 complicated negotiations for a trade agreement with the United States. Gonzales is wanted by U.S. authorities for the murder of a U.S. soldier in 1992. This issue was described as an \"800-pound gorilla\" by Ways and Means Chairman Rangel. Panama was the 62nd largest trading partner of the U.S. in 2007, with imports of shrimp, fish, metals, petroleum, and sugar, and exports of petroleum, aircraft, medicaments, corn, computer parts, and telecommunications equipment. Many Panamanian goods enter duty-free through trade initiatives. The United States and South Korea concluded an FTA on April 1, 2007, after eight rounds of negotiation. South Korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the United States with $78.4 billion in two-way trade in 2007. Major imports include motor vehicles, computers, and electronics, while major exports consist of machinery, aviation, and chemicals. Key issues resolved in the agreement include agriculture, auto tariffs, and intellectual property rights. The US and South Korea FTA addressed agriculture, auto tariffs, intellectual property rights, services trade, and the Kaesong industrial complex. Auto and light truck tariffs will be removed, Korea will eliminate its engine-displacement tax, but no guaranteed market access for US autos was provided. Products from the Kaesong industrial complex are not covered, South Korea will strengthen laws on intellectual property rights, and liberalize certain service sectors. Korea's \"systematic barriers\" to trade in automotive, manufactures, agriculture, and services will need to be addressed. Regarding agriculture, Korea will not allow additional access for rice, but other U.S. agricultural exports will either become duty-free immediately or have tariffs phased out over a 10-year period. Tariffs on beef will be removed over a 15-year period, but health restrictions on U.S. beef were not addressed. Korea had closed its market to U.S. beef due to BSE outbreaks in 2003, with bans lifted and reinstated in subsequent years. At the fourth Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Doha, Qatar, on November 9-14, 2001, trade ministers from over 140 member countries agreed to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations known as the Doha Development Agenda. This aimed to increase participation of developing-country members, which account for about four-fifths of the WTO members. The negotiations combined ongoing talks on agriculture and services liberalization with new negotiations. Negotiators in Geneva reached agreement on a framework for future WTO negotiations, including agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, and trade facilitation. This framework was the goal of the unsuccessful fifth Ministerial in Cancun in 2003. Developing countries also sought easier access to medicines and discussed \"Singapore issues\" such as investment, competition, transparency, and government procurement. The Singapore issues of government procurement, investment, and trade and competition policy were dropped from the Doha round negotiations. The deadline for completing the round was not met, and no new deadline was set. The deadline for submitting an agreement under TPA has passed, and there is uncertainty about renewing or extending TPA. Countries must apply adopted formulas to their tariff schedules after agreeing on negotiating modalities. The WTO's sixth Ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005 saw progress on assistance to least developed countries and setting an end date for agricultural export subsidies. However, broader agreement on negotiation modalities remained elusive. Despite multiple deadlines being set and missed, negotiations were ultimately suspended in July 2006 by Director-General Pascal Lamy. Pascal Lamy suspended negotiations in July 2006 after a deadlock in the G-6 group. Talks resumed in January 2007 but failed to reach an agreement on key issues in June 2007. In 2007, new draft texts were released by the chairmen of agriculture, industrial, and rules negotiating groups. Despite controversies, these texts kept parties engaged in Geneva. A summit in July 2008 failed to reach a breakthrough on modalities, particularly the \"special safeguard mechanism.\" The United States announced negotiations to join the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership in September 2008. The P-4 agreement, consisting of Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore, was concluded in 2006. Negotiations for investment and financial services chapters are ongoing, with the United States joining discussions in February 2008. Australia has shown interest in joining the agreement. Resistance to an FTA with New Zealand has lessened due to their cooperation in coalition peacekeeping and other geopolitical issues. New Zealand has encouraged U.S. participation in the P-4 negotiations, seen as an opportunity to influence regional trade. An FTA with New Zealand may involve tough negotiations on sensitive U.S. agriculture sectors like beef, lamb, and dairy products. The National Milk Producer's Federation seeks an exclusion for the dairy industry, while beef cattle groups are concerned about the future of the tariff-rate quota on beef imports from New Zealand. New Zealand was the 54th largest trading partner of the United States in 2007, with two-way trade totaling $5.8 billion. In 2007, U.S. exports to Brunei totaled $138.4 million, with imports at $341.7 million. The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was envisioned in 1994 by 34 Western Hemisphere nations to reduce trade barriers. The United States traded $1,066.4 billion worth of goods with FTAA countries in 2007. The FTAA negotiations began in 1998, with the third draft presented in 2003. Brazil and the United States are deadlocked over the agreement, leading to a new direction with a two-tier framework. The fourth Summit of the Americas in 2005 did not revive negotiations, and progress depends on both countries agreeing on obligations and plurilateral arrangements. The FTAA negotiations between Brazil and the United States are deadlocked, with ongoing communications but no agreement on obligations and plurilateral arrangements. Trade dynamics in the region are shifting towards bilateral agreements with the US, EU, and other countries. The Government Accountability Office criticized the handling of negotiations in 2005, faulting the two-tiered structure and co-chairmanship for lack of progress. The United States announced FTA negotiations with Malaysia in 2006, but an agreement was not reached in time under TPA. Despite ongoing negotiations, no agreement has been reached. Malaysia is the 15th largest trading partner of the United States, with trade totaling $43.0 billion in 2007. Key exports to Malaysia include electronic circuitry, computer parts, and aircraft, while imports from Malaysia include computers, electrical machinery, and rubber products. The US is seeking the removal of import licensing restrictions in the negotiations. The United States is negotiating with Malaysia to remove import licensing restrictions on motor vehicles, government procurement restrictions, increase IPR protection, and liberalize financial services. The disagreement lies in the scope of services liberalization, with the US pushing for a negative list approach while Malaysia prefers a positive list. The Administration notified Congress of its intent to negotiate an FTA with Thailand in 2004. Negotiations for an FTA with Thailand began in 2004, with talks disrupted by demonstrations and a military coup in 2006. Despite condemnation of the coup, negotiations were not formally suspended, but remain in limbo. Opposition to the FTA was voiced by a Ways and Means Committee Member in June 2006. The Administration sees potential benefits of an FTA with Thailand in promoting U.S. exports, protecting U.S. investment, and advancing initiatives like the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative and the U.S.-Singapore FTA. Thailand is important for military, security, and political issues, being the 22nd largest U.S. trading partner in 2007 with $30.5 billion in two-way trade. Leading imports from the U.S. were computers, television receivers, and jewelry, while leading exports were integrated circuits, semiconductors, and computer parts. The USTR notified Congress in 2004 about pursuing FTA negotiations with the UAE and Oman, aiming towards a Middle East Free Trade Area. Talks began in 2005 but stalled in 2006 due to the Dubai ports controversy. This may impact investment and government procurement provisions in the FTA. In 2007, the U.S. imported $1.3 billion from the UAE and exported $10.9 billion. In 2007, the United States imported $1.3 billion from the UAE and exported $10.9 billion to the Emirates, making it the 38th largest trade partner of the United States. The leading U.S. import was crude petroleum, while leading U.S. exports were aircraft, cars, and machinery. President Bush announced an initiative in 2003 to create a U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Agreement by 2013, involving a multi-stage process for countries in the region to prepare for an FTA with the United States. The USTR has mentioned Jordan, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman, UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait as potential FTA candidates in the Middle East. The goal is to boost trade and encourage economic development in the region, aligning with the 9/11 Commission recommendation. President Bush initiated the plan in 2002 to negotiate bilateral FTAs with ASEAN countries. Middle Eastern countries' share of world exports has decreased significantly since 1980, prompting the need for economic transformation and integration into the global economy. The United States aims to negotiate FTAs with ASEAN member states to reduce tariffs on agricultural products and improve market access. This initiative also serves to counter Chinese influence in the region, with two-way trade reaching $166.9 billion in 2007. Thailand is the first candidate for an FTA under this agreement. In 2007, trade with ASEAN countries totaled $166.9 billion, with imports at $111.7 billion and exports at $55.2 billion. Egypt was the 51st largest trading partner of the United States, with imports of $2.4 billion and exports of $5.3 billion. Major exports to Egypt include cereals, aircraft, machinery, vehicles, telecommunications equipment, and arms, while imports consist of textiles, apparel, carpets, petroleum, and iron and steel. Egypt, with a population of 65.3 million, is the largest country in the Middle East and a member of the World Trade Organization since 1995. Speculation suggests the US may seek to launch FTA negotiations with Egypt, with exploratory subcommittees already established for this purpose. In November 2004, a House Ways and Means Committee delegation found reforms in customs administration, tariff reduction, and tax reform encouraging for FTA negotiations with Egypt. However, intellectual property rights violations, Egyptian restrictions on U.S. agricultural imports, discriminatory taxes on imports, and poor labor rights standards were cited as impediments. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) opposed launching FTA negotiations with Egypt due to generic drug approval issues. The United States suspended consideration of an FTA with Egypt over human rights concerns. In the 110th Congress, H.Con.Res. 137 was introduced calling for FTA negotiations with Taiwan, the ninth largest U.S. trading partner with $62.7 billion in two-way trade in 2007. The U.S. is Taiwan's second largest trading partner after China, importing $38.1 billion in merchandise and exporting $24.6 billion in goods. Key imports from Taiwan include computers, circuitry, vehicle parts, television transmission, and telecommunications equipment, while exports to Taiwan include integrated electronic circuits, electrical machinery, aircraft parts, corn, and soybeans. The Bush Administration supports the concept of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA but cites trade disputes such as intellectual property rights enforcement, standards, testing, certification, labeling requirements, and rice import quotas in Taiwan. Negotiating an FTA with Taiwan may anger China, which sees Taiwan as a province. Taiwan joined the WTO in 2002 and signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with the U.S. in 1994."
