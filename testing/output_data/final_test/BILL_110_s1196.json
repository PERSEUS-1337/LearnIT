Congress finds that a significant number of Armed Forces members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have PTSD and TBI. Over 1.5 million troops have been deployed since 2001, with many serving multiple tours of duty. Additionally, there are 700,000 children in the US with a parent deployed in these conflicts. The Department of Defense is facing a shortage of mental health professionals, with only 350 psychologists on active duty to support combat operations. The demands on the mental health system exceed its capacity, and treating Armed Forces members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan could cost up to $700 billion, with PTSD being a costly condition to treat. Women now make up 16 percent of the Armed Forces. (8) Women make up 16 percent of the Armed Forces and are in 90 percent of military occupations. Research is needed on their mental health needs in combat roles. \n(9) Over 25 percent of deployed Armed Forces members in Iraq and Afghanistan are ethnic minorities. Research is needed on their unique mental health needs. \n(10) Three out of five deployed Armed Forces members have family, but research on their mental health needs is lacking.
