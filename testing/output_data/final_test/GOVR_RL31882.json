    "content": "Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act focuses on improving the quality of K-12 teacher preparation programs and recruitment of highly qualified individuals to teaching. The 110th Congress is expected to consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including its provisions for the K-12 public school teaching force. The statutory authorities in the HEA expired in FY2004 but have been extended and are currently effective. This report provides an overview of the current programs and provisions of HEA Title II, Part A. The report discusses the current programs and provisions of HEA Title II, Part A, focusing on higher education institutions' role in preparing K-12 teachers and federal involvement in improving teaching quality. Approximately 1,200 institutions award undergraduate degrees in education, with other undergraduates participating in teacher education programs. Higher education institutions play a crucial role in preparing K-12 teachers through various programs, including teacher education programs, post-baccalaureate certificate programs, and master's programs. However, the quality of these programs has been criticized for inadequate subject matter and pedagogy learning time, superficial curriculum, fragmented courses, uninspired teaching, and lack of preparation for modern teaching environments. Critics have raised concerns about the quality of teacher preparation programs, citing high failure rates of graduates on certification exams. States like Massachusetts, Texas, and New York have started tracking pass rates and holding programs accountable. The federal government also became involved in this issue after the reauthorization of the HEA in 1998. The reauthorization of the HEA in 1998 led to programs targeting K-12 teacher preparation improvement. The 107th Congress amended the ESEA to prioritize teacher quality, requiring all teachers to be \"highly qualified\" by 2005-2006. Title II, Part A of the HEA focuses on accountability for teacher graduates' quality. The HEA, amended in 1998, provides three competitively awarded grants to improve K-12 teacher quality: state grants, partnership grants, and recruitment grants. Appropriated funds are divided as 45% to state grants, 45% to partnership grants, and 10% to teacher recruitment grants. FY2006 and FY2007 appropriations were $59.895 million, FY2008 appropriation is $33.662 million. Grants are awarded to the state governor or designated entity for teacher certification and preparation. States must match 50% of federal grant amount. Grant funds must be used for teacher preparation activities. State grants under the HEA must be used for activities such as holding teacher preparation programs accountable, reforming teacher certification requirements, creating alternative routes to certification, recruiting highly qualified teachers, and addressing social promotion. Priority is given to applicants who have reformed certification requirements, held higher education institutions accountable for teacher preparation, or reduced the shortage of qualified teachers. State grants under the Higher Education Act (HEA) are aimed at addressing the shortage of qualified teachers in high poverty urban and rural areas. States receiving grants must report annually on progress towards specific objectives, including increasing student achievement, raising academic standards for teachers, and increasing the number of certified teachers through alternative routes. State grants under the Higher Education Act aim to address teacher shortages in high poverty areas by increasing teacher competence, reducing shortages in urban and rural areas, providing professional development opportunities, and promoting technology integration in classrooms. Grants are awarded competitively to partnerships involving a higher education institution, a school of arts and sciences, and a high-need local educational agency. Failure to show progress may result in grant termination by the Department of Education. Partnerships receiving state grants under the Higher Education Act must match a percentage of the grant from non-federal sources and are required to use the funds for various purposes such as holding teacher preparation programs accountable, providing clinical experience to teacher candidates, and offering professional development for teachers. Additionally, partnerships may support activities like recruiting teachers, preparing them to work with diverse student populations, and providing leadership training to school administrators. The Department of Education awards competitive grants to partnerships for leadership training, dissemination of effective practices, and promoting positive change. Priority is given to partnerships involving businesses, with equitable geographic distribution. Each grant recipient must have an evaluation plan with specific objectives, including increasing teacher retention. Failure to show progress may result in grant termination. Grants are awarded competitively to states or eligible partnerships for a three-year period. The Department of Education awards competitive grants to partnerships for leadership training, dissemination of effective practices, and promoting positive change.

Each grant recipient must have an evaluation plan with specific objectives, including increasing teacher retention. Failure to show progress may result in grant termination. Grants are awarded competitively to states or eligible partnerships for a three-year period. Recruitment grant funds must be used for teacher education scholarships, support services, and activities enabling high need LEAs and schools to recruit highly qualified teachers. Recipients of recruitment grants must report annually to the Secretary on progress, with termination possible for failure to demonstrate progress by the end of the second year. The Department of Education awards grants to partnerships for leadership training and promoting positive change. Grant recipients must provide information on teachers' qualifications to parents upon request. The Secretary reports to committees on evaluation of funded activities and shares successful practices. Preliminary results from a national evaluation show partnerships are effective. Partnerships in the national evaluation of the partnership grant program are implementing the professional development school model, aligning teacher preparation programs with district standards, increasing collaboration between education and arts/sciences faculty, and forming new relationships with businesses and nonprofit organizations. The GAO identified difficulties in program implementation, evaluating impact, and cited a funding problem for Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant projects. The GAO found that Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant projects are primarily focused on reforming certification requirements, providing professional development, and recruiting new teachers. The report criticized the Department of Education for not systematically approaching the evaluation of projects' impact on teaching quality and failing to provide adequate guidance on assessment and reporting requirements. Without changes to the law, the state grant funding may not be fully utilized. The Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant program focuses on reforming certification requirements, professional development, and teacher recruitment. The Department of Education may struggle to meet the mandate of allocating 45% of funding to state grants. States must report on teacher preparation quality, including pass rates on certification assessments. Without legislative authority, over $22 million of funding could lapse in FY2005. The Teacher Quality Enhancement Grant program focuses on reforming certification requirements, professional development, and teacher recruitment. States must report on teacher preparation quality, including pass rates on certification assessments. Institutions with teacher education programs must release annual reports detailing certification pass rates, comparisons with state averages, and program performance assessments. To maintain eligibility for HEA funds, states must identify and assist low-performing teacher preparation programs. Criteria for determining low performance include pass rates of graduates. Programs designated as low-performing may face fines and restrictions on funding and student enrollment. The Secretary of Education prepares an annual report on the quality of teacher preparation programs for students receiving assistance under HEA Title IV. The report includes data on pass rates on teacher certification assessments, waivers of certification requirements, and identification of low-performing programs. The first report in 2002 highlighted serious limitations in the teacher preparation system. The report found that most states set passing scores for certification assessments well below national averages. Institutions with 100% pass rates required passage of the exam for program completion. Subsequent reports show progress in improving teacher quality, but GAO concluded that the Department of Education could not accurately report on teacher education program quality. The report criticized the limitations of information collected for Title II accountability provisions, noting issues with the term \"program completer\" in determining pass rates. It highlighted concerns related to Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for consideration during an HEA reauthorization process. Congressional review of grant programs may include issues with state, partnership, and recruitment grants. The report raised concerns about the effectiveness of Title II grant programs in achieving their objectives. Funding has been awarded over five fiscal years, with no grants revoked for lack of progress. Evaluating the impact of these grants is challenging due to the administration of the programs. Congress may need to review the reporting and evaluation process to ensure effectiveness. The current funding structure for Title II grant programs may need to be modified to ensure full expenditure of state grant funds. Questions arise about the mix of programs and activities being funded under this authority, prompting consideration of shifting funds to partnerships and reevaluating the emphasis on different types of grants and activities. Congressional reauthorization may involve deciding the level of involvement of State Education Agencies in teacher preparation and program strengthening. The Congress is considering the impact of partnerships on teacher preparation and recruitment, the need for support in Title II programs for higher education institutions, and the allocation of funding for teacher preparation, recruitment, professional development, and accountability. There is also a discussion on alternative routes to certification and the accountability provisions of Title II, Part A. The provisions of Title II, Part A for teacher preparation programs have sparked debate. States set standards for identifying low-performing programs, with federal consequences only if the state takes action. Few institutions have been labeled low-performing. Congress may consider changes to involve the federal government more directly. Some may argue for involving the federal government more directly in the teacher preparation program accountability process, while others may want to maintain the current framework. Congress may need to decide on the constraints or expansion of the emphasis on licensing exam pass rates in the Title II accountability process. The current pass rate-based system may have limited utility on a national level due to inconsistencies in standards across states and the lack of rigorous licensing exams. Many licensing exams are not rigorous, leading to increased institutional pass rates that may not reflect teacher quality. There is a call for innovative strategies to improve content knowledge and skills of prospective teachers. Federal involvement in improving teacher preparation programs is seen as just the beginning of a multi-step process to enhance program quality. Consideration may be given to establishing a single, nationwide standard. The Congress may debate the calculation of pass rates, particularly focusing on the 100% pass rates reported by some states and institutions. These rates result from decisions made by the Department of Education and institutional/state policies. Increasing numbers of institutions reporting 100% pass rates raise questions about the utility of these rates for accountability. In response to institutions reporting 100% pass rates, Congress may consider alternative measures for accountability. These could include requiring reporting on graduates passing certification exams on their first attempt, measuring teaching effectiveness through student performance or school administrator feedback on graduates."
