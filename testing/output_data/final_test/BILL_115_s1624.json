    "content": "The Act titled \"Protect Children, Farmers, and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2017\" is referred to as such. It includes findings related to the protection of individuals from nerve agent pesticides. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) amended FIFRA and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate pesticide use and establish acceptable levels for pesticide residues on food. The FQPA directs the EPA to ensure no harm will result from food and drinking. The FQPA mandates that EPA must ensure no harm from pesticide residues on food and consider children's sensitivity to pesticides. Chlorpyrifos, a widely used pesticide, must meet safety standards for children's health. Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, affects the nervous system by inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme. Exposure during pregnancy to low levels can lead to long-lasting neurobehavioral deficits in offspring. Chlorpyrifos exposure in pregnant women can lead to permanent neurobehavioral deficits in children. Residues on food, contaminated water, and pesticide drift contribute to exposure. The pesticide is used on various crops, with high application rates on apples, broccoli, onions, walnuts, and cauliflower. Chlorpyrifos is acutely toxic and linked to neurodevelopmental issues in children, including reduced IQ and delays in motor development. Chlorpyrifos exposure in pregnant women can lead to permanent neurobehavioral deficits in children, including loss of working memory, delays in motor development, attention-deficit disorders, and structural changes in the brain. The United States Geological Survey estimates annual pesticide use on agricultural land in the United States, with chlorpyrifos use on crops in 2014 ranging from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 pounds. Studies show that gestational and/or early postnatal exposure to chlorpyrifos may cause persistent effects into adulthood. Prenatal chlorpyrifos exposure in mother-infant pairs has been associated with neurodevelopment outcomes in infants and children. EPA has taken various actions to address concerns about chlorpyrifos, including ending residential uses in 2000, proposing to ban all food tolerances in 2015, and updating risk assessments in 2016 to protect against prenatal exposures. The EPA found that residues from chlorpyrifos on food crops exceeded safety standards, and drinking water exposures also surpassed acceptable levels. Children are particularly at risk due to greater exposure, with prenatal exposure to low levels potentially causing lasting neurological impairments. EPA released a revised human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos in November 2016. The revised human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos confirmed no acceptable uses for the pesticide, with all food uses exceeding acceptable levels. Children aged 1 to 2 are exposed to levels 140 times higher than what the EPA considers safe. Chlorpyrifos poses a threat to agricultural workers, who are often exposed to it through mixing, handling, and applying the pesticide. It is one of the pesticides most commonly linked to acute poisonings, with widespread under-reporting of incidents. Chlorpyrifos poses a threat to agricultural workers and rural families due to unsafe exposure levels on food, in drinking water, and through drift. Workers face inadequate reporting systems and unsafe re-entry intervals after spraying. Chlorpyrifos drifts from fields to homes, schools, and other gathering places, exposing people to toxic levels. EPA's risk assessments show unsafe levels of chlorpyrifos in the air and drinking water in agricultural areas, putting children at risk. In 2015, experts under \"Project TENDR\" called to reduce exposure to chemicals affecting fetal and children's brain development, including organophosphate pesticides. In the US, 1 in 6 children are affected. Based on parents' reports, 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability or delay. The TENDR Consensus Statement emphasizes the need to reduce exposure to chemicals linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children. SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS RELATING TO CHLORPYRIFOS. Amends Section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the presence of chlorpyrifos or its residue in food. SEC. 4. REVIEW OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must offer a contract to the National Research Council for a risk assessment on organophosphate pesticides' effects on all populations, including vulnerable groups like infants and children. The assessment will focus on neurodevelopmental and low-dose effects, as well as cumulative risks from exposure. The Administrator must conduct a risk assessment on organophosphate pesticides' effects, including cumulative risks from exposure, and submit it by October 1, 2019. Regulatory action will be taken if any exposure does not meet the required standards. The Administrator must take regulatory action within 90 days of becoming aware of any exposure to organophosphate pesticides, including revocation or modification of tolerances and registration. This action can be taken regardless of the completion of the registration review process. The Administrator must take regulatory action within 90 days for any exposure to organophosphate pesticides, including revocation or modification of tolerances and registration, if the pesticide does not meet legal requirements or if action is required by statute, judicial order, or petition."
