    "content": "The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established by Congress to provide science and technology advice and research and development capabilities for improving homeland security. However, there have been concerns about the slow pace of technological advances and the alignment of resources and mission within the DHS. Members of Congress have questioned the effectiveness of R&D activities in light of fiscal constraints. The S&T Directorate is the primary organization for R&D in DHS, with a total budget of $1.22 billion for FY2014. It conducts R&D in its own laboratories and funds R&D by other government agencies, industry, and universities. Congressional policy makers are facing issues regarding the prioritization of S&T Directorate R&D activities amidst fiscal constraints. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate of Science and Technology within DHS, headed by an Under Secretary for Science and Technology. The Under Secretary is responsible for overseeing operational testing and evaluation of homeland security systems, conducting R&D activities, transferring technologies, and managing a wide range of responsibilities and authorities. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology within DHS is responsible for overseeing R&D activities, transferring technologies, and supporting U.S. leadership in science and technology. They also advise on R&D efforts, assess vulnerabilities and threats, and coordinate countermeasures against terrorist threats. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology in DHS oversees R&D activities, technology transfer, and supports U.S. leadership in science and technology. They coordinate with other agencies to reduce duplication, identify needs, and integrate department activities in R&D. The S&T Directorate contributes to DHS in new capabilities, process enhancements, acquisition support, and understanding homeland security risks. Their approach focuses on high-impact R&D deliverables, rapid product transition, and high ROI. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology in DHS oversees R&D activities, technology transfer, and supports U.S. leadership in science and technology. The structure of the S&T Directorate allows for reorganization by the Under Secretary, with different visions shaping its activities. Since 2010, the Directorate has been organized into four groups, including HSARPA and Support to the Homeland Security Enterprise and First Responders Group. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology in DHS oversees R&D activities, technology transfer, and supports U.S. leadership in science and technology. The S&T Directorate is organized into four groups, including HSARPA and Support to the Homeland Security Enterprise and First Responders Group. The Directorate also includes divisions for Acquisition Support and Operational Analysis, Research and Development Partnerships, and a Chief Scientist position. In FY2012, the S&T Directorate realigned its budget structure. In FY2012, the S&T Directorate realigned its budget structure to consolidate research and development activities under one Program, Project, and Activity (PPA) titled Research, Development, and Innovation (RD&I). This new structure aimed to better align with DHS priorities, improve transparency, and maintain neutrality. However, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations raised objections to this change. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations objected to the new budget structure for the S&T Directorate in FY2012. Despite concerns about transparency and accountability, the conference committee supported the consolidation of research activities under the Research, Development, and Innovation budget category. This new structure allows for quicker resource allocation without formal reprogramming, emphasizing the need to prioritize research areas with the greatest potential for impact. The S&T Directorate's budget structure for FY2012 faced objections from the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Despite concerns, the consolidation of research activities under the RD&I PPA was supported for quicker resource allocation. However, for FY2014, both committees recommended dividing the RD&I PPA into six separate categories to provide more detailed insight into funding allocation. The S&T Directorate's funding levels fluctuated in recent years, with a decrease in FY2012 followed by a rebound in FY2013. In FY2014, the Directorate received $1.220 billion, and a request for $1.072 billion was made for FY2015. The reductions in funding highlighted the challenge of balancing long-term R&D investments with immediate operational needs, as emphasized by the House Committee on Appropriations in 2011. The Committee believes that S&T should focus on near-term, operational projects for homeland security, justify taxpayer spending, and prioritize high-priority projects with reduced funding levels. Maintaining federal research infrastructure and investing in R&D by industry or academia is crucial, despite increasing costs. In a declining S&T Directorate budget, infrastructure costs compete with R&D funding. Agency leaders and Congress face the choice of using research budgets for infrastructure or delaying needed repairs. Shifting funds to infrastructure means accepting loss of research investments and opportunity costs. Robust funding for facilities and R&D is essential for effective innovation and national security. The increase in S&T Directorate funding may alleviate tension in meeting priorities, with a focus on R&D activities. Planned infrastructure costs for the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF) and Plum Island Animal Disease Center may pose future challenges. Additional funds for NBAF must not displace resources for Departmental programs. Balancing R&D activities with providing S&T assistance to other DHS components is a key priority. The Homeland Security Act broadly defined functions for the S&T Directorate, leaving open the interpretation of how to prioritize R&D activities and provide S&T assistance to other DHS components. Issues include priority-setting mechanisms, the scope of R&D activities, and efforts to consolidate R&D within the directorate. The S&T Directorate faces challenges in prioritizing and balancing its broad scope of R&D activities across all potential homeland security threats and diverse customer base, including federal and nonfederal clients. The directorate must consolidate R&D efforts and align expenditures with DHS mission areas. The S&T Directorate prioritizes R&D based on DHS mission areas, national security strategies, and first responder needs. They assess threats, national needs, and vulnerabilities to identify technical areas for development. Strategic planning, portfolio reviews, and partnerships with DHS components help in executing high-priority R&D activities. The S&T Directorate coordinates DHS R&D activities and engages in strategic planning with varying success. Efforts include creating joint plans with other DHS entities, engaging with federal agencies, and developing a federal strategic plan for homeland security R&D since at least 2007. NAPA recommended aligning the S&T Directorate's strategic plan with federal guidance. The S&T Directorate published an internal Strategic Plan in June 2007, focusing on the structure, roles, outreach mechanisms, and workforce development. However, the plan lacks a clear \"why\" and was criticized for weaknesses in its development process. NAPA recommended developing a new plan with a clearer mission, goals, and strategies to enhance focus and alignment with federal guidance. The NAPA recommended that the S&T Directorate broaden its mission statement and follow federal guidance for developing a new strategic plan in 2011. The new plan outlines five goals to advance the department's mission and assist DHS components. The S&T Directorate aims to assist DHS components in establishing operational requirements, acquiring technologies, and enhancing capabilities for homeland security and disaster response. The 2011 strategic plan addresses NAPA's criticism but lacks full alignment with best practices for agency strategic plans. It provides high-level direction on directorate priorities, including DHS component acquisition practices, without specifying required funding. The S&T Directorate focuses on DHS component acquisition practices but lacks specific funding, metrics for progress monitoring, and key external challenges. It engages in strategic planning with operational components to develop discrete strategic plans aligned with component priorities. The Science and Technology Resource Allocation Strategy (STRAS) guides engagement with partner organizations through systems analysis and joint development of strategic plans and technology. The S&T Directorate collaborates with stakeholders to develop strategic plans and technology roadmaps, updating them as needed. They have signed agreements with various DHS components, focusing on specific topics like aviation security. Draft plans are in place for engagement with other components like the Office of Health Affairs and Customs and Border Protection. The S&T Directorate collaborates with DHS components to develop strategic plans and engage in outreach activities to improve information sharing with R&D performers and stakeholders. Plans include R&D strategies with components like U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and FEMA, linking focus areas with transition pathways for R&D outputs. HSARPA aligns its efforts with these priorities to meet strategic goals. The S&T Directorate collaborates with DHS components and federal agencies to assess strategic partnerships and align R&D activities. Strategic planning is done to address specific threats, such as chemical and biological threats, with other agencies like USDA APHIS, FBI, and EPA. Multiagency strategic plans help DHS gain situational awareness and progress towards shared goals. The Homeland Security Act mandates the S&T Directorate to collaborate with other agencies in developing a national policy and strategic plan for counterterrorism efforts. This includes coordination with DHS components and other executive branch agencies. The Under Secretary is responsible for working with various departments in regulating biological select agents. The S&T Directorate collaborates with other agencies to develop a national policy and strategic plan for counterterrorism efforts, including regulating biological select agents. The issuance of federal R&D strategies is coordinated by the NSTC, with some policymakers expecting a standalone document from the Under Secretary. The S&T Directorate uses a portfolio review process to evaluate R&D investments. The S&T Directorate conducts an annual portfolio review process to evaluate R&D investments, involving project manager presentations and analysis of impact and feasibility. A review panel assesses projects against specific metrics, aiming to identify synergies, cost savings, and prioritize funding for efficient project delivery. The process aims to provide transparency, enable strategic budget decisions, and improve communication for effective long-term planning. The S&T Directorate conducts an annual portfolio review process to evaluate R&D investments, involving project manager presentations and analysis of impact and feasibility. While the portfolio review process is seen as beneficial for strategic long-term planning, there is a risk of focusing too much on short-term results. Congressional policy makers have generally supported the portfolio review process, with the FY2013 appropriations describing it as \"effective\" and directing DHS to adopt and expand it across the department. Some DHS components have since implemented a portfolio review process. The S&T Directorate conducts an annual portfolio review process to evaluate R&D investments, involving project manager presentations and analysis of impact and feasibility. Some DHS components have implemented a similar portfolio review process, with the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement being examples. A significant change in the S&T Directorate's R&D strategy was the creation of Apex projects in 2011, which aim to solve urgent problems identified by DHS operational components. Senior leadership commitment is crucial for the S&T Directorate to engage in Apex projects. The S&T Directorate employs a non-traditional R&D approach through Apex projects, integrating solutions into DHS operations. Congressional support for this process is strong. The Apex process established by the S&T Directorate focuses on expediting technological solutions and collaboration. It integrates planning with operational components, making technology development more adaptable to emerging needs. This approach involves senior operational officials, leading to a more holistic project planning compared to traditional R&D investments. The S&T Directorate's Apex process involves senior operational officials in project planning to expedite technological solutions and collaboration. Challenges in transitioning R&D results into operational environments include failure to reflect leadership priorities, lack of further investment, ambiguous requirements, and insufficient user demand. Apex projects may address some of these challenges but face uncertainties in budgets and schedules, increasing the risk of failure or underperformance. The S&T Directorate's Apex projects require larger funding for deployment, potentially increasing success rates but also raising the cost of failures. Without additional funding from Congress, the Directorate may need to reallocate funds from other priorities to support multiple Apex projects. Limited data makes it difficult to predict the success rates and timelines of these new projects in addressing high-priority issues. The S&T Directorate's Apex projects face uncertainty in addressing urgent short-term problems without compromising long-term solutions. With capacity for three to four simultaneous projects, the Directorate completed one project with the U.S. Secret Service and terminated another with CBP. Lessons learned include securing leadership commitment and maintaining flexible project teams for future endeavors. The S&T Directorate's Apex projects aim to maintain scope and product expectations by developing project goals, objectives, and procedures. They work with cross-organizational teams to identify core problems and leverage resources for quick technology development. In FY2014, funds were requested for new projects with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and CBP. The effectiveness of this approach will be assessed as more projects are implemented. Congressional policy makers have options to address any perceived challenges in the planning processes. Congressional policy makers have options to address perceived challenges in the planning processes within the S&T Directorate. They could provide additional authorities to the Under Secretary for Apex projects, require increased rigor in strategic planning, establish independent oversight for DHS R&D, or give greater discretion to redirect funding. Supporting integrated projects like Apex or those combining S&T Directorate activities with operational components may improve research results transitioning into the field. A close partnership between the operational component and the S&T Directorate may increase the likelihood that S&T Directorate work addresses high-priority needs. The S&T Directorate has increased projects benefiting from non-S&T Directorate funding and received $128 million in funding from other DHS components since 2010. Policy makers should evaluate whether Apex project investment leads to successful outcomes for both perspectives, as successful integrated projects may increase demand for joint R&D activities. Monitoring the success of integrated projects is recommended. Policy makers should monitor integrated projects to ensure they are not limited by resource constraints. They should also consider the balance between S&T investments and support for other homeland security clients. Successful partnerships may lead to uneven distribution of R&D support for DHS operational components. Congressional policy makers may require a more rigorous strategic planning process for R&D in the S&T Directorate or DHS-wide. The S&T Directorate participates in various planning activities within DHS, but has not publicly released a detailed multiyear R&D plan. Experts question the clarity of the current strategic planning process and suggest Congress mandate a formalized planning process for increased oversight. This could enhance agency predictability, improve transparency, and provide better access to funding opportunities for the private sector. The S&T Directorate's lack of a detailed multiyear R&D plan has raised concerns about the clarity of its strategic planning process. Experts suggest that Congress mandate a formalized planning process to increase oversight, enhance predictability, improve transparency, and provide better access to funding opportunities for the private sector. This could also increase transparency regarding the Directorate's priorities and progress, but may limit flexibility and responsiveness. An advisory board could assist in identifying research priorities. The S&T Directorate may establish an advisory board, possibly using the HSSTAC or an external panel like the National Academies, to assist in identifying research priorities and strategic directions. This would provide wide-ranging input into the prioritization process, similar to how other federal agencies utilize advisory boards for strategic planning. The S&T Directorate may establish an advisory board, such as the HSSTAC or an external panel like the National Academies, to assist in identifying research priorities and strategic directions. This input could help prioritize processes and address specific technology needs of other DHS components, while potentially reducing the discretion of the Under Secretary. Congressional policy makers could alternatively choose to increase the discretion of the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate may increase discretion by allowing easier funding transfers between programs, potentially leading to a shift towards short-term investments with more accountability for research success. This could impact long-term needs and result from portfolio reviews, leadership decisions, or changes in priorities. The S&T Directorate is a key player in homeland security R&D, but other agencies also invest in this area. DHS ranks third in investment after the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services. The S&T Directorate focuses on cybersecurity, biodefense, explosives detection, and first responders. Policy makers may question how R&D priorities are determined and coordinated with other agencies. The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) was created within the S&T Directorate of DHS to administer an Acceleration Fund for Research and Development of Homeland Security Technologies. Initially, HSARPA was used for conventional R&D activities with moderate risk, contrary to expectations of high-risk, high-reward projects similar to DARPA. The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) was restructured by Under Secretary Jay Cohen to focus on high-risk, high-reward programs like the Homeland Innovative Prototypical Solutions (HIPS) and High Impact Technology Solutions (HITS). However, due to its size, HSARPA could not take on projects of the scope and significance addressed by DARPA. Under Secretary O'Toole reorganized HSARPA to encompass the majority of R&D activities in the S&T Directorate, with a focus on conventional R&D with only moderate risk. The directorate's portfolio review process may reduce high-risk, high-reward activities. The HSARPA has focused on transitioning technology to the field, leading to a consolidation and reduction in the number of projects. The S&T Directorate reduced projects from 250 to 75 between FY2010 and FY2012, but increased to over 100 in FY2014. Underperforming projects were terminated, and similar projects were combined to maximize successful technology development. This consolidation may increase funding for specific problems, potentially leading to technological solutions or overly focusing on a limited range of threats. Maintaining a balance is a challenge for the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate faces the challenge of maintaining programs and projects to cover a range of homeland security threats while ensuring sufficient resources for success. They aim to stay updated on R&D developments and identify technologies through \"technology foraging\" using various sources. The S&T Directorate established a Technology Foraging Office to increase technology foraging efforts. Program managers are required to include technology foraging activities in their plans to develop new technologies. In FY2013, 49 technology foraging projects were completed, resulting in the development of several prototypes. The S&T Directorate faces challenges in aiding the fielding of equipment and developing concepts of operations. Transitioning technology to private sectors for final development is more challenging than to DHS components due to cost factors influencing private sector investment in security. The S&T Directorate is working on improving technology transfer to the private sector and DHS components by aligning R&D programs with future investment priorities. Joint funding with DHS components and Apex projects are also being used to increase adoption of R&D outputs. The S&T Directorate faces challenges in simultaneously employing technology transition and Apex models, requiring different skills for program managers. It is unclear how to balance developing technology to the prototype stage and bringing it into the field. Extending development to deployment may strain resources and increase costs, as previous R&D expenditures stopped at the prototype stage. The S&T Directorate has faced funding uncertainty for years, impacting R&D productivity and tempo. Inconsistent funding leads to project cancellations, loss of momentum, and difficulty retaining expertise. Funding reductions in FY2011 and FY2012 have worsened the situation. The S&T Directorate faced funding reductions in FY2011 and FY2012, leading to constraints on R&D activities. Prioritization of funding towards high-impact programs and focus on four priority areas: biological defense, cyber security, explosives detection, and first responder technologies. Uncertain funding environment resulted in the cancellation of multiyear programs prematurely. Increased FY2013 funding allowed for expansion of research investment beyond the priority areas. The S&T Directorate expanded research investment beyond priority areas, restarting some paused programs. Funding interruptions delayed program completion. Continuing resolutions hindered new program starts, causing delays in meeting R&D milestones. Delays in soliciting and starting new programs may lead to increased unobligated balances. Congressional policy makers may need to address these challenges. Congressional policy makers may direct the S&T Directorate to focus on specific R&D approaches, such as high-risk, high-reward efforts, or narrow the focus to specific topics. They could also provide funding for activities across the homeland security R&D spectrum or invest in specific stages of the R&D enterprise. Implementing HSARPA and adopting a higher proportion of DARPA-like R&D may be of congressional interest. Advocates of the DARPA model highlight the high risks and potential benefits of funded programs. However, most programs do not achieve their goals, requiring increased financial commitment for success. The S&T Directorate is shifting towards prioritizing specific research areas amidst fiscal constraints. The S&T Directorate is prioritizing specific research areas during fiscal constraints, using a portfolio review process to focus resources on urgent needs. Congress may need to provide more explicit direction on which threats should have primary focus or adopt an approach that addresses as many threats as possible. Increasing funding for the S&T Directorate could allow for investment in a broader range of R&D programs to address all homeland security threats, including high-risk, high-reward projects and incremental R&D. This could support larger projects like Apex projects while also funding smaller efforts. However, concerns about past performance and the current fiscal climate may hinder such an increase in funding. Congress may view increasing funding for the S&T Directorate as potentially reducing resources for other homeland security priorities. Congressional policy makers may choose to focus the S&T Directorate on specific types of R&D, such as near-term development. Not all federal entities maintain a balanced portfolio across the R&D enterprise. The S&T Directorate may need to balance short-term development with long-term basic research to ensure a sustainable approach to homeland security. Congress could provide more explicit support for transitioning technologies to operational components or direct a focus on fundamental knowledge development. Experts caution against under-investment in basic research, as an over-emphasis on short-term projects may limit future research opportunities. The S&T Directorate must balance short-term projects with long-term research for sustainable homeland security. Leveraging other agencies' capabilities may help but could also incur costs. Congress transferred some R&D activities to DHS but not all, with TSA, Customs, and Coast Guard retaining their R&D activities. The Homeland Security Act charges the Under Secretary with primary research and development activities, coordinating with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. Congress preferred DHS to consolidate R&D into the S&T Directorate, transferring R&D activities from Customs Service and TSA to the Directorate in FY2005 and FY2006 respectively. The establishment of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) in 2005 marked the first dispersal of R&D activities from the S&T Directorate. DNDO took over the S&T Directorate's radiological and nuclear countermeasures portfolio, operating independently until FY2006. DNDO received funding through the S&T Directorate until FY2007, and there were proposals to transfer the DNDO Transformational R&D program to the S&T Directorate in FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2011 congressional budget justification for the S&T Directorate's proposed new Radiological and Nuclear Division emphasized the benefits of consolidating fundamental research within DHS to achieve economies of scale and foster collaboration across research programs. This integration would create a more cross-disciplinary environment for basic research and sensor development activities, enhancing synergy and efficiency within the Directorate. The S&T Directorate aims to centralize research expertise, reduce duplication, and increase R&D coordination. Previous consolidation proposals for DHS R&D have focused on synergy, efficiency, and a multidisciplinary approach. Congress has debated the consolidation of DNDO Transformational R&D, with the Senate generally supporting the transfer of R&D responsibilities while the House has not. The Committee is concerned about the proposed realignment of nuclear detection responsibilities, as it may reduce support for DNDO's research mission. Congress directed DHS to review the consolidation and reorganization of DNDO's activities, including R&D, in FY2013. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allows various DHS components to conduct R&D activities under the coordination of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. A review in 2013 directed DHS to evaluate potential improvements and cost savings by consolidating organizations and missions, including merging functions of DNDO and OHA. This analysis may recommend transferring DNDO Transformational R&D activities back to the S&T Directorate. The GAO audit in 2012 identified weaknesses in the coordination and oversight of R&D activities in DHS, with fragmented and overlapping efforts across different components. Coordination mechanisms were found to be lacking, increasing the risk of duplication. Only DNDO and the U.S. Coast Guard receive explicit appropriations for R&D from Congress. The GAO audit in 2012 highlighted coordination weaknesses in DHS R&D activities, with fragmented efforts and lack of oversight. S&T coordinates R&D through various mechanisms, but DHS lacks a policy for coordination and tracking all R&D activities. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop policies and guidance for overseeing R&D department-wide. Currently, DHS is drafting policies to define R&D activities on a department-wide basis. Congressional policy makers in the 113th Congress are addressing the issue of DHS R&D activities in the appropriations process. The House and Senate FY2014 DHS appropriations bills direct DHS to implement reforms and policies for setting R&D priorities, involving DHS-wide decision-making, and implementing GAO recommendations. Congress has various options for structuring the department's research and development activities, including allowing departmental officials to make determinations under congressional oversight. Congress has options for structuring DHS R&D activities, such as consolidating them into the S&T Directorate or dispersing them back to operational components. Policy makers could limit other components from conducting independent R&D, potentially slowing down R&D activities. The lack of a clear definition of R&D activities could lead to discretionary decisions on which programs to consolidate. Advocates propose consolidating R&D activities into the S&T Directorate to enhance collaboration, synergy, and efficiency. Critics question the directorate's ability to balance priorities and support non-homeland security missions. The S&T Directorate faces challenges in balancing priorities between homeland security and non-homeland security missions. One approach is to transfer R&D responsibilities to operational components, like the U.S. Coast Guard, to better meet component needs. However, this could lead to organizational costs and duplication. The dispersal of R&D responsibilities to operational components within DHS may result in organizational costs and duplication. This could hinder the identification of synergies and coordination of DHS-wide R&D activities by the S&T Directorate. Additionally, it may reduce the directorate's status and ability to provide advisory support and technology acquisitions assistance to other components. Policy makers could support greater formal interactions between operational components and S&T Directorate leadership to improve coordination in joint projects. Establishing an R&D oversight council within DHS or a DHS-wide entity could provide a leadership focus on R&D. The success of partnerships depends on effective coordination, agreement on goals, and sufficient resources. The S&T Directorate portfolio review process could serve as a model for a DHS-wide entity. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology has statutory responsibilities beyond oversight of homeland security R&D, including overseeing departmental operational test and evaluation activities. The S&T Directorate is increasing its presence in acquisition within DHS operational components, raising policy questions about balancing acquisition support and R&D management. DHS faces challenges in developing, procuring, and deploying homeland security technologies. Congress has identified issues with the deployment of explosives trace-detection portal machines by TSA and the technological portion of the Secure Border Initiative by U.S. The failures in technology investments within DHS have raised questions about coordination between R&D and procurement activities. Separating technology development from product development can help reduce costs and deliver products on time. For example, the development of next generation BioWatch detectors and Advanced Spectroscopic Portal by OHA and DNDO respectively have not yielded expected returns. The R&D component develops technologies based on requirements communicated by OHA to the S&T Directorate. This approach may reduce competition between funding acquisition and product operation. However, it leads to competition for resources among different products. Enforcing a strict division between developers and acquirers may limit synergy opportunities. Other operational components are performing development activities that some may view as better suited for the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate is working on improving its acquisition processes by including cost-benefit and alternatives analyses to reduce risks. DHS plans to establish a new model for managing investments, with S&T involved in each phase to ensure proper testing and development of new technologies before implementation. The S&T Directorate established an Acquisition Support and Operations Analysis (ASOA) Division in 2010 to provide operations analysis, systems engineering, test and evaluation, and standards development support to DHS operational components. ASOA applies systems engineering concepts to improve efficiency in research and development (R&D) and acquisition programs by analyzing operational systems in critical areas. ASOA assists in developing testable requirements for enhanced operational capabilities and promotes a rigorous systems engineering process. ASOA promotes a systems engineering process to improve efficiency in transforming customer needs into operational capabilities. They work with DHS components to formulate clear requirements and develop technologies that serve actual needs. The S&T Directorate's involvement in the acquisition process is increasing, with potential formalization through the IILCM process. This raises questions about the directorate's role and scope, historically separate from operational components. The S&T Directorate's involvement in acquisition processes is growing, with challenges in transferring technologies to operational components. Closer integration of S&T expertise may improve acquisition quality and coordination with operational components, although opinions among DHS staff are mixed. The S&T Directorate has limited capabilities and staffing for acquisition support, which may compete with R&D program oversight. Integrating program managers more closely with DHS operational components could improve R&D success. The ASOA Division oversees operational testing and evaluation of major acquisition programs through the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation. The Office of Operational T&E oversees DHS major acquisition programs by approving Test and Evaluation Master Plans to ensure system performance and effectiveness. The GAO identified challenges in meeting all T&E oversight responsibilities within the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate and DHS components face challenges in overseeing T&E, including ensuring operational requirements can be effectively tested, working with staff with limited T&E expertise, using existing directives for complex IT acquisitions, and allowing sufficient time for T&E within program cost and schedule estimates. GAO recommended better documentation of approvals and reviews, in response to which the S&T Directorate is taking action. The S&T Directorate issued additional policies to improve test and evaluation oversight procedures in response to GAO recommendations. Congressional policymakers may consider refining the S&T Directorate's role in acquisition and T&E. One suggestion is greater integration through co-funding S&T Directorate activities with operational components to facilitate seamless information flow between requirements setting and technology development. The S&T Directorate is looking to enhance its role in acquisition support and operational analysis, which some policymakers see as a step towards integrating R&D and acquisition processes. Congressional policymakers may encourage closer collaboration between the acquiring component and the S&T Directorate through joint projects or linking funding. However, GAO recommends separating acquisition and R&D responsibilities to avoid bias in procurement decisions. Separating technology development from product development and acquisition is seen as a best practice to reduce costs. Separating technology development from product development and acquisition is a best practice to reduce costs and ensure timely delivery within budget. Integrated R&D and acquisition processes may lead to prolonged unsuccessful procurement efforts and budgetary competition between functions. The DHS has established management directives for acquisition-related activities, including T&E policies and processes. Congressional policy makers may codify oversight activities developed by DHS and the S&T Directorate. Providing statutory authority for testing and evaluation roles could maintain independence but may limit DHS's restructuring abilities. Congress could expand test and evaluation funding or staff within the S&T Directorate to strengthen oversight. Additional resources may need to be reallocated from other priorities. Congress might also expand the role of the S&T Directorate in testing and evaluation oversight, potentially requiring operational components to consult with test and evaluation experts within the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate in DHS may have a formalized role in technology acquisition and test and evaluation processes, potentially slowing down acquisitions but improving quality. Congress could also reduce the responsibilities of the S&T Directorate in this area. The S&T Directorate in DHS may see changes in oversight of test and evaluation activities, potentially transferring responsibilities to the Under Secretary for Management. Congress has historically addressed these issues through appropriations bills, oversight hearings, and program authorizations within the S&T Directorate. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to refine oversight of the S&T Directorate in DHS, but none were enacted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided funding for DHS and other agencies, while the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 provided funding for FY2013. See CRS reports for more information on S&T Directorate funding. H.R. 4034, the WMD Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2014, would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to produce terrorism risk assessments for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. It also includes provisions for tailored risk assessments for national recovery activities and synthetic biology risks. Additionally, the bill would establish biological agent detector performance standards and evaluation processes. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology would assess acquisition of new biodetection systems, technological screening capabilities for biological agents, pandemic influenza, and other infectious diseases. H.R. 3410 directs R&D to mitigate consequences of electromagnetic pulse events on critical infrastructures. The Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 focuses on evaluating technologies to improve critical infrastructure resiliency and restore it after an EMP event. It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a strategic plan for federal physical security and cybersecurity research efforts to Congress every two years. Coordination with stakeholders is essential in developing this strategy. The Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 focuses on evaluating technologies to improve critical infrastructure resiliency and restore it after an EMP event. It requires coordination with stakeholders in developing the strategy. The act also mandates the submission of a study on DHS use of public-private R&D consortiums and the establishment of a technology clearinghouse for sharing proven technology solutions for protecting critical infrastructure. H.R. 2872 directs the development of a comprehensive plan for technology to secure U.S. international borders. H.R. 2719, the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act, directs the development of a strategic multiyear technology acquisition plan for TSA in consultation with key officials. It also requires TSA to establish formal baseline requirements before implementing security-related technology acquisitions. The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act would establish baseline requirements for technology acquisition, including costs, schedule, performance milestones, and risk mitigation plans. It would also involve consultation with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology to ensure technological feasibility and testing of acquired technologies. H.R. 2691 and S. 1303 would repeal provisions related to the sale of assets supporting the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act would require collaboration between the Department of Defense and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to improve border security. Budget authority for the S&T Directorate is shown in Table A-1. Budget authority for the S&T Directorate, as shown in Table A-1, is reduced by rescissions and sequestration. It may not reflect transfers of funds from other DHS components or funds appropriated in previous years. The S&T Directorate may not have obligated the full amounts in the year of appropriation, leading to differences in obligations or outlays compared to the table amounts."
