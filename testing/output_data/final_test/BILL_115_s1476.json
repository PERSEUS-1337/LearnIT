    "content": "The Act titled \"Countering Russian Missiles Act of 2017\" defines key terms and committees related to missile defense, including the INF Treaty. The INF Treaty, in force since 1988, banned the USSR from possessing ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 km. Implementation led to the dismantlement of thousands of missiles, but concerns arose in 2008 about Russia's noncompliant GLCM development. The United States has accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty by developing and testing the SSC-8 missile, leading to Russia's noncompliant status in subsequent reports. General Paul Selva stated in 2017 that Russia deployed a land-based cruise missile that violates the treaty's spirit and intent. The United States accuses Russia of violating the INF Treaty with the SSC-8 missile, posing a threat to NATO. The Department of Defense prefers Russia's compliance with the treaty. US allies in Europe lack sufficient defense against Russia's new GLCM. US policy aims to protect interests and allies from the growing threat. The United States aims to protect allies from Russia's new GLCM threat by promoting cooperation, enhancing military coordination, and pressuring Russia to comply with the INF Treaty through diplomatic engagement. The United States accuses Russia of violating the INF Treaty and warns of military actions if non-compliance continues by January 1, 2019, including enhancing European defense capabilities and assisting allies with advanced strike systems. The United States plans to enhance European defense capabilities by deploying advanced strike systems, including a variant of the JASSM-ER and sea-based Tomahawk cruise missile. Limited defenses against cruise missiles will also be deployed to protect key alliance assets. Additionally, the US will not withdraw from the INF Treaty without consulting European allies. The text chunk \"SEC. 4. REPORTS.\" does not provide enough context to summarize. The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, must submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment of the Act and annually thereafter. The report will include a description of Russia's new GLCM (SSC-8), its capabilities, the threat it poses to US allies in Europe and Asia, an assessment of military disadvantages faced by the US with the SSC-8 in Europe, and an assessment of gaps in US capabilities. The report required under subsection (a) must assess gaps in the current missile defense infrastructure in Europe to defend US and European assets against the threat posed by the SSC-8, capability gaps addressed by a new US intermediate range missile in Europe and Asia, timeline for fielding an INF range missile, and total cost for development and deployment of the system. The Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense, must submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment of the Act and annually thereafter. The report will include a plan for coordinating with European allies to enhance missile detection and defense, as well as recommendations for additional military sales, financing, and training to strengthen missile defense capabilities. SEC. 5. CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESS. The President must consult with the Senate before any Special Verification Commission meeting on INF Treaty amendments. The Secretary of State must report on Russian compliance with the treaty every 180 days. SEC. 6 of the INF Treaty restricts funds for the withdrawal of the United States from the treaty, except after Congress receives a required report and the President certifies that withdrawal is in the national security interests."
