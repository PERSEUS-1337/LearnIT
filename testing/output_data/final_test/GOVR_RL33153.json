    "content": "This report provides background information on China's naval modernization and its implications for U.S. Navy capabilities. The question of how the U.S. Navy should respond to China's military modernization effort, particularly its naval modernization, is a key issue for Congress. Decisions made by Congress on this issue could impact U.S. Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. This report focuses on China's naval modernization effort and its implications for U.S. Navy capabilities, based on unclassified open-source information. The term \"China's naval modernization effort\" refers to the modernization of China's navy and other military forces that can counter U.S. naval forces in the Western Pacific. China's military, formally known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA), includes the PLA Navy (PLAN) and the PLA Air Force (PLAAF). The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF) is China's ballistic missile force. The term \"China's near-seas region\" refers to the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea. The second island chain includes these waters and the Philippine Sea between the Philippines and Guam. China's naval modernization effort has been ongoing for over 25 years, with design work on newer ship classes starting in the late 1980s. Observers suggest that China's military modernization may have been influenced by U.S. military operations in Iraq in 1991 and a 1996 incident near Taiwan. Since 2000, China has been focused on expanding its naval capabilities for 'blue-water' operations. China's naval modernization effort includes a wide array of platform and weapon acquisition programs, enabling 'far-seas' deployments globally. This effort encompasses programs for ASBMs, ASCMs, LACMs, surface-to-air missiles, submarines, aircraft carriers, and various other naval assets. China's naval modernization effort focuses on improving maintenance, logistics, doctrine, personnel quality, education, and training. The emphasis is on enhancing the modernity and capability of Chinese platforms rather than increasing total platform numbers. Changes in platform capability have been more significant than changes in total platform numbers, with some categories seeing a decrease in total numbers but an increase in aggregate capability due to the replacement of older platforms with more modern ones. China's force modernization in 2015 focused on improving the quality of its platforms rather than increasing their numbers. The quantity of major combatants remained relatively constant, but their combat capability greatly increased as older platforms were replaced by newer, more capable ones. For example, China's ballistic missile submarines increased from one in 2008 to four in 2016, and China's first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012 with plans for two more. Additionally, corvettes saw an increase in numbers until 2014. China has rapidly built corvettes since 2014, with 41 in service as of July 2018 and a projected force of 60. The total numbers of destroyers, amphibious ships, and coast guard cutters are also increasing. In 2016, the PLA Navy commissioned 18 new ships, including destroyers and frigates. China has significantly expanded its naval fleet since 2014, with a total of 18 new ships commissioned in 2016, including destroyers, frigates, and corvettes. The Navy's total displacement is 150,000 tons, roughly half of the British Royal Navy's. In January alone, three new ships were commissioned, indicating China's increasing role on the world stage. China's decision to expand its naval fleet beyond planned levels could be influenced by a perception of the United States reducing its global role. This shift may lead to a more ambitious naval modernization effort, focusing on increasing total numbers of platforms for global operations. China's ultimate navy size and composition remain undisclosed, contrasting with the U.S. Navy's public force-level goal. China's navy does not publicly disclose its force-level goal or detailed ship procurement information, unlike the U.S. Navy. This lack of transparency in China's military modernization efforts highlights a major difference between the two countries. The ultimate size and composition of China's navy may still be uncertain even among Chinese military and political leaders. China's naval modernization effort has improved its capabilities, but there are limitations in joint operations and antisubmarine warfare. Debate among Chinese leaders about future military force structure may lead to changes in shipbuilding goals. China's naval modernization effort has improved capabilities, including joint operations, antisubmarine warfare, and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers. Despite some capability gaps, the PLA(N) is emerging as a well-equipped force. China's navy may be sufficient for missions of interest to Chinese leaders, with ongoing efforts to address weaknesses and limitations. The focus is on developing capabilities for potential missions, such as addressing the Taiwan situation militarily. China aims to address Taiwan militarily, defend territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea, control the South China Sea, regulate foreign military activities in its maritime exclusive economic zone, protect commercial sea lines of communication, displace U.S. influence in the Western Pacific, and assert its status as a leading regional and world power. China wants its military to act as an anti-access/area-denial force to deter U.S. intervention in conflicts in its near-seas region. China's emerging maritime A2/AD force, including ASBMs, ASCMs, attack submarines, and C4ISR systems, aims to deter U.S. intervention in conflicts in China's near-seas region, similar to the Soviet sea-denial force during the Cold War. One key difference is China's inclusion of conventionally armed ASBMs capable of targeting moving ships at sea. China's navy has various missions, including maritime security, evacuating Chinese nationals, and humanitarian assistance. As China's military modernization program expands, it focuses on missions beyond its borders, such as power projection and sea lane security. The PLAN's shift from \"offshore waters defense\" to \"far seas protection\" reflects this evolution. The PLAN's evolving missions include maritime security, evacuations, and humanitarian assistance. As China modernizes its military, it focuses on power projection and sea lane security, moving from \"offshore waters defense\" to \"far seas protection.\" The high command's interest in a wider operational reach is reflected in doctrinal references to \"forward edge defense,\" envisioning a global role for the PLA. The PLAN is developing into a global force, extending its operational reach beyond East Asia with advanced naval platforms like aircraft carriers. These platforms enable combat operations beyond China's land-based defenses, enhancing China's power projection capabilities. China's ability to project power has expanded beyond its immediate region, facilitating non-war military uses. China's 2015 defense white paper elevated the maritime domain in PLA's strategic guidance, focusing on winning informationized local wars. The paper highlights the vulnerability of China's national security to international turmoil, terrorism, piracy, natural disasters, and the security of overseas interests. China's armed forces are adjusting their preparation for military struggle to focus on winning informationized local wars and maritime military struggle. The PLA Navy will shift its focus to a combination of offshore waters defense and open seas protection to enhance strategic deterrence and counterattack capabilities. China emphasizes the importance of developing a modern maritime military force structure to safeguard national sovereignty, protect maritime rights, and participate in international maritime cooperation. Jesse L. Karotkin highlighted these points in a statement regarding China's military modernization and its implications for the United States. China's naval modernization effort includes fielding the DF-21D and DF-26 ballistic missiles with anti-ship capabilities, giving China the ability to target ships, including aircraft carriers, in the western Pacific Ocean. The DF-26 is capable of conducting precision strikes against ground and naval targets in the region. China's ASBMs pose a significant threat to naval targets in the western Pacific, including U.S. Navy ships and allied navies. These missiles are considered a \"game-changing\" weapon due to their highly accurate and maneuverable re-entry vehicles. The DF-21D has been a focus of concern since 2008, with its ability to hit moving ships at sea. The DF-21D missile stands out for its maneuverable re-entry vehicle with SAR and optical sensors, potentially allowing it to target moving objects. It has been tested over land but not against a sea target. Reports claim a successful sinking of a US aircraft carrier in a war game scenario using a mock-up platform. A new variant of the DF-21D missile has undergone pre-deployment tests by the People's Liberation Army. The new DF-26 missile has undergone pre-deployment tests by the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Force, with increased assault capabilities that could disable an aircraft-carrier strike group. It is reported to be 30% more powerful than the previous DF-21D, with improved off-road travel ability and potential anti-ship capability. Details on specifications and test parameters were not provided. The DF-26 missile may have an anti-ship capability with a range of 1,800 to 2,500 miles, surpassing the DF-21D. China is developing a hypersonic glide vehicle to enhance ASBMs. Chinese navy possesses advanced ASCMs like the Russian-made SS-N-22 Sunburn and SS-N-27 Sizzler, along with indigenous designs. DOD reports China deploys a variety of ASCMs, with the YJ-83 series being the most numerous. China has developed various advanced anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) such as the YJ-18, YJ-12, and YJ-12A for different platforms including submarines, bombers, and surface combatants. They also carry Russian-made ASCMs like the SS-N-22 Sunburn and SS-N-27 Sizzler. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) emphasizes anti-surface warfare (ASUW) with older ships equipped with YJ-83 ASCMs and newer ships like the LUYANG II DDG using more advanced variants. China's submarine modernization effort, focusing on advanced anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) like the YJ-18, YJ-12, and YJ-12A, has attracted attention and concern. The PLAN prioritizes the modernization of its submarine force for regional deterrence, with newer surface combatants equipped with advanced ASCMs like the YJ-62 and YJ-18. China's submarine-launched ASCMs, including the YJ-18 and its variants, represent an improvement over Russian-made systems like the SS-N-27, and will be deployed on various submarine units. China's submarine modernization effort has led to the acquisition of 12 Russian-made Kilo-class non-nuclear-powered attack submarines and the development of four new classes of indigenously built submarines, including the Jin class SSBN, Shang class SSN, Yuan class SS, and Song class SS. These new submarines are considered more modern and capable than China's older-generation submarines. China's new indigenously built submarines are believed to have benefitted from Russian technology and design know-how, as well as knowledge from scientists who had worked at US national laboratories. Figures from an ONI report show the acoustic quietness of Chinese submarines compared to Russian submarines, indicating that quieter submarines are harder to detect and counter. China's submarines, armed with ASCMs, torpedoes, and mines, pose varying levels of difficulty for navies with capable antisubmarine warfare forces to detect and counter. Some submarines, like those armed with the SS-N-27 Sizzler ASCM, are more challenging to counter. Additionally, Shang-class SSNs may carry LACMs, adding to the concern over ASCMs. China is developing advanced propulsion systems for submarines. The Type 094A ballistic missile submarine has improved capabilities, with a larger size and the ability to carry 12 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Type 094A ballistic missile submarine has advanced features such as a blended base for reduced drag, a retractable towed array sonar for threat detection, and acoustic quieting technologies. China is also expected to develop a new variant of the SHANG class, the Type 093B guided-missile nuclear attack submarines, to enhance its anti-surface warfare capabilities. China is continuing production of the SHANG-class SSN with an improved variant, launching four additional hulls since 2012. These submarines will replace the aging HAN class SSN. The PLA(N) will then progress to the Type 095 SSN, which may offer advancements in quieting and weapon capacity. China is also working on updating computer systems on nuclear submarines with artificial intelligence to enhance commanding officers' thinking skills. China is advancing its submarine technology by incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance commanding officers' decision-making abilities, potentially giving them an advantage in undersea battles. This development could pose a threat to US undersea dominance, especially when combined with advancements in stealth, sensors, and weapons by countries like Russia and China. China's newer non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion systems could challenge US undersea dominance. These submarines have extended submerged endurance compared to traditional diesel-electric submarines. Images show new Yuan-class submarines being fitted out in the water. China has resumed production of Yuan-class patrol submarines after a three-year hiatus. These submarines are more capable than the older Ming-class submarines and could be used for various strategic purposes. Additionally, China has commissioned a larger non-nuclear-powered submarine called the Qing class. China has resumed production of Yuan-class patrol submarines, which are more capable than the older Ming-class submarines. They have also commissioned a larger non-nuclear-powered submarine called the Qing class. Observers believe the Qing class submarine may be a one-of-kind test platform, referred to as an auxiliary submarine (SSA). By the end of 2016, China was expected to have a total of 43 relatively modern attack submarines in commission, including Shang-, Kilo-, Yuan-, and Song-class boats. Between 1995 and 2016, China added a total of 57 submarines, averaging about 2.6 submarines per year. This would eventually result in a steady-state submarine force of about 52 to 78 boats. China plans to acquire a total of 80 submarines, with most being non-nuclear-powered. China has built nuclear-powered submarines at a rate of less than one per year, with a total of 44 domestically produced submarines placed into service between 1995 and 2016. Projections suggest that by 2020, China's submarine force could grow to between 69 and 78 submarines, with ONI providing a more precise projection of 74 submarines, including 11 nuclear-powered boats. China's submarine force in 2020 is projected to include 58 boats, with 4 Jin-class SSBNs, 6 Shang-class SSNs, and 48 SSs. China's Jin-class SSBNs are armed with 12 JL-2 nuclear-armed SLBMs, representing their sea-based nuclear deterrent. The next-generation Type 096 SSBN is expected to be armed with the JL-3 SLBM and construction is likely to begin in the early-2020s. China is developing the JL-3 SLBM as a successor to the JL-2, with a range of 7,400 km. They have a robust naval mine capability with an inventory of over 50,000 mines and infrastructure for research, development, testing, and production. China has significantly expanded its naval mine inventory in recent years, including various types like moored, bottom, drifting, rocket-propelled, and intelligent mines. These mines can be deployed by submarines, surface ships, aircraft, and even fishing and merchant vessels. China is also working on developing more advanced mines, such as extended-range propelled-warhead mines and antihelicopter mines. Additionally, they are developing large, smart unmanned submarines for various missions, including mine placement and reconnaissance. China is developing autonomous robotic submarines for a wide range of missions, challenging Western naval powers. The submarines are aimed at strategic waters like the South China Sea and western Pacific Ocean. The project is part of China's plan to boost naval power with AI technology. The unmanned submarines will join other military systems to carry out coordinated missions. The researchers are developing AI-powered robotic submarines that are larger than traditional unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). These submarines have a reconfigurable cargo bay, diesel-electric engines for continuous operation, and rely on artificial intelligence to navigate the sea's complex environment. They can gather intelligence, deploy mines, and work with manned submarines for various missions. China is developing extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles (XLUUVs) for military use, with a focus on AI-powered robotic submarines that can gather intelligence, deploy mines, and work with manned submarines for missions. The development is led by Lin Yang, a director at the Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is also chief scientist of the 912 Project aiming to have new-generation military underwater robots ready by 2021. China's unmanned submarine program is a countermeasure against US developments. China has two aircraft carriers in service and is reportedly building a third. China may eventually have a force of four to six aircraft carriers. China purchased the carrier Liaoning from Ukraine in 1998 as an unfinished ship. It is conventionally powered with a full load displacement of almost 60,000 tons. The air wing may consist of 24 J-15 fighters, 6 anti-submarine warfare helicopters, 4 airborne early warning helicopters, and 2 rescue helicopters. The Liaoning lacks aircraft catapults and launches fixed-wing airplanes using an inclined \"ski ramp.\" In comparison, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is nuclear powered with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The Liaoning, China's \"starter\" carrier, has a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons and can accommodate an air wing of 60 or more aircraft. It launches fixed-wing aircraft using catapults and lands them using arresting wires on its angled deck. However, it is less capable than the U.S. Navy's NIMITZ-class carriers in projecting power due to its smaller size and limited aircraft capacity. The Liaoning, China's \"starter\" carrier, has limitations compared to U.S. carriers. Its smaller size restricts aircraft capacity and fuel loads, affecting flight radius and combat power. China lacks specialized supporting aircraft like the E-2C Hawkeye. The PLA Navy is still learning to operate aircraft from the ship, with full integration of a carrier air regiment years away. Despite being described as combat-ready in 2016, doubts remain about its war-readiness. China's second aircraft carrier, the Type 001A design, was launched on April 26, 2017, and is undergoing sea trials. It is a modified version of the Liaoning design and may be named Shandong. The ship can carry up to 35 J-15 carrier-based fighters. China's second aircraft carrier, the Type 001A, can carry up to 35 J-15 carrier-based fighters. Observers speculate China may eventually have four to six aircraft carriers, with some potentially using new electromagnetic catapults and nuclear power. A June 20, 2018, report suggests the latest carrier will have a catapult launch system, unlike its predecessors. China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) revealed plans to accelerate the development of China's third carrier, the Type 002, with a flat flight deck and catapult-like devices. The image was a digital representation displayed in CSIC's boardroom. China aims to have a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier by the mid-2020s to enhance its navy's capabilities. China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) is focusing on achieving technological breakthroughs in nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, new submarines, underwater combat systems, and networked communications systems to enhance China's navy capabilities. The original news release detailing these plans has been removed from CSIC's website. China is also prepared to build larger aircraft carriers in the future. China Shipbuilding Industry Corp is ready to build larger aircraft carriers, with complete expertise in design, technology, and manufacturing. They are also developing technologies for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. China's third aircraft carrier is currently under construction. China's third aircraft carrier, known as 002, is under construction with technological improvements over the first two carriers. It will be larger and feature an electromagnetic launch system for aircraft, allowing for longer distance flights with more weaponry. The construction began in March 2015 at the Jiangnan Changxingdao Shipyard in Shanghai, and it is expected to be substantially different from its predecessors in terms of size and capabilities. The third carrier, 002, is expected to be larger than the second carrier, with a weight of about 80,000 tons. It will have more fuel capacity for aircraft and longer flight deck. The carrier will accommodate more aircraft in the hangar and on the flight deck, potentially increasing the air wing to 40 fighters. The island on 002 will be smaller, allowing for more deck space. China's third carrier, 002, is expected to have a larger air wing of 40 fighters, along with propeller-driven carrier onboard delivery transports and airborne early warning aircraft. Unlike previous carriers, 002 will use an electromagnetic aircraft launching system (EMALS) instead of a ski ramp. Chinese engineers have solved the power issue for EMALS, and the carrier is expected to come with a more robust air defense weapons suite. China's third aircraft carrier, with a hi-tech launch system, is being built at a Shanghai shipyard. It will feature a more robust air defense weapons suite, expanded medical and water desalination capabilities, and passive anti-missile and anti-torpedo defenses. This could make the ship useful in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions. China's third aircraft carrier is being built at a Shanghai shipyard with a more complicated and challenging construction process than previous ships. The vessel's hull work is expected to take about two years, and it will have a displacement of about 80,000 tonnes. China plans to have four aircraft carrier battle groups in service by 2030. China's third aircraft carrier, the CV-18, will have a more advanced electromagnetic aircraft launch system than its predecessors. The layout of the new carrier will be different, with a smaller tower island to accommodate China's large J-15 fighter jets. China is set to build its Type 003 nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which will be the largest non-American warship in the world when launched in the late 2020s. The carrier will displace between 90,000-100,000 tons and feature electromagnetically assisted launch system (EMALS) catapults. It is expected to carry a variety of aircraft including J-15 fighters, J-31 stealth fighters, KJ-600 airborne early warning and control aircraft, anti-submarine warfare helicopters, and stealth attack drones. China has developed carrier-capable fighters like the J-15, modeled after the Russian Su-33, with limited range and armament when operating from the carrier. Future Chinese aircraft carriers will carry fifth-generation jet fighters like the J-20 and J-31, with plans to install them on carriers with catapult systems for protection. China's carrier aviation programs are progressing with the development of training and specialized aircraft as the first domestically built carrier nears sea trials. The J-15 fighters on the Type 001A carrier are expected to be around 40, similar to those on the Liaoning ship. There are predictions that J-15 fighters and improved versions will be joined by stealth fighters like the J-20 and J-31, each playing different roles. Adapting the J-20 and J-31 for navy use will incur costs, with the J-20 being more expensive to modify than the J-31. China's first domestically built carrier is nearing sea trials. The PLAN currently operates the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark multirole fighter from the Liaoning aircraft carrier and the Type 002 carrier. China is testing catapult launch accessories on a J-15 prototype and developing a twin-seat variant. The J-15S variant, likely to operate from China's future catapult-equipped carrier, will be a two-seat multirole fighter alongside single-seat J-15s. Future production batches may have modern avionics like the J-16 fighter, including active electronically scanned array radar. Electronic warfare/electronic attack technology from the J-16 variant may also be introduced. These upgrades are expected to enter service in the early part of the next decade. The PLAN is revamping its pilot training program to meet the urgent need for 400 new pilots in the coming years. They lack a dedicated trainer aircraft for carrier pilots, using the J-15 instead. Attempts to develop a carrier trainer version of the JL-9 were unsuccessful. If China builds a third carrier with EMALS, they can operate a wider variety of aircraft. China is developing a new fighter jet for aircraft carriers to replace its J-15s due to mechanical failures and crashes, as part of its efforts to build a blue-water navy. The PLAN is interested in equipping its air wings with an aircraft similar to the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye for airborne early-warning capabilities. A mock-up of a Xi'an Y-7 with a radar rotodome was previously built, indicating China's continued interest in developing such a platform. China is developing a new fighter jet to replace its J-15s on aircraft carriers, aiming to build a blue-water navy. The new jet, based on a Russian design, is needed for China's plans to create multiple aircraft carrier groups. The FC-31 stealth fighter is being considered as a replacement for the problematic J-15 on Chinese aircraft carriers. Several crashes involving the J-15 have been reported, with issues related to its unstable flight control system. The accidents have led to grounding of all J-15s for three months, impacting morale in the air force and navy. Several months after crashes undermined morale in the air force and navy, an investigation was called for after Zhang's death. Aviation experts initially denied design problems with the J-15, only acknowledging them after Cao experienced similar issues. China's home-grown fighter jets have faced engine and design problems. Despite faults, pilots were pressured to fly the warplanes without conducting more test flights. Chinese air force pilots are expected to work around mechanical errors unlike their Western counterparts. China may be developing a carrier-based airborne early warning and control aircraft. China is developing a carrier-based airborne early warning and control aircraft similar to the U.S. Navy's E-2 Hawkeye. The purpose of Chinese aircraft carriers is not critical for Taiwan-related conflict scenarios, as Taiwan is within range of land-based Chinese aircraft. Most observers believe China is acquiring carriers to demonstrate its status as a leading regional and world power, for power-projection operations, and to impress foreign observers. They could also be used for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Chinese aircraft carriers could be used for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security operations, and projecting China as a major world power. In combat against U.S. forces, they would be vulnerable but could divert attention from other missions. The focus of Liaoning is likely fleet air defense missions and developing carrier pilots and tactics. China's next generation of carriers, developed to enhance carrier battle group capabilities, will have greater endurance and be able to launch a variety of aircraft, including EW, early warning, and ASW aircraft. These improvements will increase striking power in safeguarding China's interests beyond its immediate periphery and protecting nuclear ballistic missile submarines in the South China Sea. The carriers will also conduct missions such as patrolling economically important sea lanes, naval diplomacy, regional deterrence, and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief. China's LIAONING carrier is better suited for fleet air defense missions and long-term training investment. China has modernized its PLA Navy surface combatant technology with purchases from Russia and indigenous construction of destroyers and frigates. The PLAN is engaged in a robust surface combatant construction program to upgrade its air defense capability. China's PLAN is enhancing its air defense capability with new ships equipped with medium-to-long range area air defense missiles. The JIANGKAI-class frigate series, LUYANG-class destroyer series, and upcoming new cruiser class are key components of this upgrade. China is exploring designs for submersible arsenal ships with large missile capacity. They are also building new cutters for the China Coast Guard to assert maritime territorial claims. Production of corvettes and cutters is active in noncommercial shipbuilding for China. Russia has reportedly assisted China in developing new surface warfare capabilities. China is developing a new class of cruiser called the Renhai-class or Type 055 with assistance from Russia. The cruiser reportedly displaces over 10,000 tons, possibly up to 13,000 tons. This new super-destroyer is larger than U.S. Navy's Ticonderoga and Arleigh Burke class cruisers and destroyers. The Type 055 design is referred to as a cruiser by the DOD. The Type 055 cruiser being developed by China is expected to displace about 15,600 tons and is larger than their newest destroyers. The first Type 055 ship was launched in June 2017, with more scheduled for launch in the coming years. The design is expected to enter service in 2019 and 2020. China is developing the Type 055 cruiser, with the first ship launched in June 2017. The ship is expected to enter service in 2019, with more scheduled for launch in 2020. China has also ordered Sovremenny-class destroyers from Russia in the past. China has developed modern destroyer classes including Luhai, Louzhou, Luyang I, Luyang II, and Luyang III designs, which are more advanced than older Luda-class destroyers. The Luyang II and Luyang III ships feature phased-array radars similar to the SPY-1 radar used in the U.S. Aegis combat system. These new destroyer classes are armed with ASCMs and were commissioned between 1994 and 2007 as part of China's modernization plan. China has developed modern destroyer classes including Luhai, Louzhou, Luyang I, Luyang II, and Luyang III designs, featuring phased-array radars similar to the U.S. Aegis combat system. Commissionings of new Luyang II- and Luyang III-class destroyers resumed after a hiatus, with at least 10 ships expected. China has also put into service four new classes of indigenously built frigates since the early 1990s. China's newer frigate classes, including the Type 054A, feature improved hull designs and AAW capabilities. China continues to produce the Type 054A frigate, with over 20 ships in the fleet and more under construction. The production run for Type 054A seems to be ending, with only a few more ships expected to join service. China is rapidly building a new type of corvette called the Jiangdao class or Type 056/056A. The first 8 ships were commissioned in 2013, with a total of 41 projected by 2017 and possibly 60 in the future. The PLAN is enhancing its littoral warfare capabilities in the South China Sea and East China Sea with these ships. China is expanding its naval capabilities in the South China Sea and East China Sea with the production of the JIANGDAO-class corvettes (FFL) (Type 056). These ships are equipped for various missions but are not suitable for major combat operations. China is expanding its naval capabilities in regional waters with the production of the JIANGDAO-class corvettes (FFL) (Type 056). These ships are not equipped for major combat operations but are replacing older patrol craft and frigates. China also introduced the stealthy, wave-piercing Houbei (Type 022) class fast attack craft armed with ASCMs. China retains a modern coastal-defense capability with 60 HOUBEI (Type 022) class missile patrol craft built in the mid-2000s. These ships are valuable for reacting to specific threats in China's exclusive economic zone and slightly beyond. China consolidated its maritime law enforcement agencies into the China Coast Guard in 2013. China consolidated its maritime law enforcement agencies into a new China Coast Guard (CCG) in 2013. The CCG is responsible for various missions, including enforcing China's sovereignty claims, anti-smuggling, surveillance, protection of fisheries resources, and general law enforcement. China primarily uses CCG ships, which are rapidly modernizing and can be effective in confrontations with unarmed vessels. The PLAN is used in an overwatch capacity in case of escalation. The China Coast Guard (CCG) has significantly expanded and modernized its forces since 2010, with a fleet of over 130 large patrol ships equipped with advanced capabilities like helicopter facilities, water cannons, and guns. These newer ships have increased China's capacity to conduct offshore operations in disputed areas, making the CCG the largest coast guard force in the world. Additionally, the CCG operates more than 70 fast patrol combatants for various missions. The China Coast Guard (CCG) has expanded and modernized its forces since 2010, with over 130 large patrol ships equipped with advanced capabilities. The CCG operates more than 70 fast patrol combatants and plans to add 25-30 more patrol ships and combatants by the end of the decade. China's civilian maritime forces have also added approximately 100 new large patrol ships and combatants in recent years. The China Coast Guard (CCG) has significantly increased its force level by 25 percent in recent years, with most ships armed with light deck weapons and commercial radars. The PLA continues to enhance its amphibious warfare capabilities, focusing on Taiwan invasion and small island seizures in the South China Sea. Both the PLA Army and PLAN Marine Corps closely integrate with the PLAN's amphibious forces. In 2016, the PLAA's 1st and 31st Group Armies improved their ability to conduct amphibious operations. The 1st Group Army focused on real-time ISR, precision targeting, and nighttime reconnaissance. The 31st Group Army demonstrated a combined ground warfare concept with integrated command systems. The PLANMC brigades conducted battalion-level amphibious training in Guangdong. The PLANMC conducted training in Guangdong focusing on amphibious operations, small boat assault, and special forces deployment. The PLAN added new ships to its fleet for routine training. Large-scale amphibious invasion is complex and challenging, requiring air and sea superiority, supply buildup, and uninterrupted support. Invading Taiwan would strain China's forces and invite international intervention. China's amphibious invasion of Taiwan poses significant political and military risks due to various challenges and Taiwan's defensive capabilities. The PLA could potentially launch smaller-scale invasions of Taiwan-held islands in the South China Sea to demonstrate military capability and political resolve. China has commissioned a new class of amphibious ships called the Yuzhao or Type 071 class, with a displacement of over 19,855 tons. This poses political risks as it could fuel pro-independence sentiment in Taiwan and face international opposition. The PLAN has four YUZHAO-class amphibious transport docks (LPD) with advanced capabilities for long-distance deployments. China is expected to build larger Type 075 amphibious assault ships in addition to the existing Type 071 class. China is constructing a new Type 075 Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) ship with a displacement of 40,000 tons and a length of 245 meters. This new ship is larger than the existing Type 071 class and will incorporate a full flight deck for helicopters. China is constructing a new Type 075 Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) ship with a displacement of 40,000 tons and a length of 245 meters. The ship is believed to be capable of operating 30 helicopters and equipped with a well-deck for amphibious craft. China has begun construction of three Type 075 ships that are similar in size to U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships, strengthening its navy's power projection capabilities. China is constructing a new Type 075 Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) ship with a displacement of 40,000 tons and a length of 245 meters. The ship will give China's navy the ability to launch various types of helicopters to attack naval vessels, ground forces, or submarines in the East or South China Sea. Vice-Admiral Shen Jinlong visited the shipbuilding company specializing in building Landing Helicopter Docks, confirming construction work on the new vessel. Construction of the Type 075 ships will take two more years, with the first vessel possibly launching in 2019 and entering full service in 2020. The larger Type 075 vessels will help China match the US in helicopter fleet capabilities. The launch of China's Type 075 Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) ship will enhance the navy's vertical landing capability, allowing it to deploy up to 30 armed helicopters and become the world's second most powerful navy after the US. The ship can also deploy landing craft, troops, and conduct command and control operations. This new addition will be valuable for conducting various operations, including amphibious landings in Taiwan-related conflict scenarios. China's investments in amphibious ships signal its intent to develop expeditionary capabilities for various operations, including HA/DR, counterpiracy, and territorial claims in the East and South China Seas. In June 2013, China received four large Zubr-class air-cushioned landing craft with impressive capabilities. China has developed a new Type 726 LCAC with a payload capacity of 150 tons and speeds over 60 knots. They also commissioned a ship similar to the U.S. ESD for ship-to-shore equipment movement. China's investments in amphibious ships show their intent for various operations in the East and South China Seas. China has developed a large new amphibious aircraft called the AG-600, with a cruising speed of 270 knots and a flying range of 2,400 to 2,800 nautical miles. The aircraft can carry 50 passengers or 12 tons of water for firefighting missions. Its primary missions are maritime search and rescue and firefighting, with potential additional missions such as observing and protecting the marine environment and resource exploration. China has developed the AG-600, an amphibious aircraft for maritime search and rescue, firefighting, and other missions. There are speculations about potential military use. China is also building large floating sea bases for supporting aircraft and surface operations. China's military aims to create large modular artificial islands that can be moved around the world as needed. The structures consist of smaller floating modules that can be assembled at sea to form a larger platform with various uses such as touristic attractions, military bases, or floating airports. Two Chinese companies are planning to build 3.2-kilometer long platforms for hosting airstrips, docks, helipads, barracks, and more. The Financial Times reported on plans by Chinese companies to build 3.2-kilometer long platforms for various uses, including airstrips, docks, helipads, and barracks. The project has drawn attention from western media and criticism from military observers, with concerns about the provocative nature of placing these platforms in the South China Sea. Experts suggest the platforms may be used for large oil drilling rigs. China is developing very large floating structures (VLFS) for peaceful purposes like duty-free shopping malls and tourist destinations. The first VLFS is being built in Caofeidian near Beijing. China is also working on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for potential military use, including sensors and weapons. A Chinese company tested a formation of 56 USVs for sea battles and military patrols. The People's Liberation Army Navy Air Force (PLANAF) has made significant advancements in the past two decades. The People's Liberation Army Navy Air Force (PLANAF) has advanced from using outdated aircraft to a modern fleet capable of various missions, including offshore air defense, maritime strike, and carrier-based operations. They have transitioned from relying on Russian imports to domestic combat aircraft production, improving their capabilities significantly. The PLA(N) upgraded its air capabilities with the Su-30MK2 FLANKER in 2002, acquiring 24 aircraft with extended range and maritime radar systems. They also replaced older J-8B/D with the newer J-8F variant featuring improved armament and avionics. Today, they are receiving modern domestically produced 4th-generation fighter aircraft. The PLA(N) is receiving modern domestically produced 4th-generation fighter aircraft like the J-10A Firebird and J-11B FLANKER, equipped with modern radars and air-to-air missiles. The H-6 BADGER bomber is used for maritime strike with upgrades to remain viable. The JH-7 FLOUNDER complements the H-6 for maritime strike with at least five regiments fielded. China's PLA(N) is expanding its inventory of fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft, airborne early warning, and surveillance aircraft by modifying existing airframes like the Y-8. These aircraft play a crucial role in maritime surveillance as the PLA(N) extends its operations farther from the coast. Additionally, a Y-9 naval variant equipped with a MAD boom for ASW capabilities is under development. China's PLA(N) is expanding its inventory of fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft, airborne early warning, and surveillance aircraft. The Y-9 ASW variant features a large surface search radar and electronic surveillance antennae. China is upgrading its H-6 bomber fleet for increased operational effectiveness with standoff weapons. The H-6K has turbofan engines and can carry land-attack cruise missiles for long-range precision strikes. PLAN Aviation fields the H-6G with systems for maritime missions. China is developing longer-range UAVs for ISR and strike operations. China's PLA(N) is expanding its inventory of fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft, airborne early warning, and surveillance aircraft. The development of high-altitude, long-endurance UAVs like Shendiao and Yilong in 2015 has increased China's ability for long-range ISR and strike operations. The PLA(N) is likely to become one of China's most prolific UAV users, using UAVs for various missions including early warning, targeting, EW, and satellite communications. Additionally, the PLA(N) is also pursuing ship-based UAVs to supplement manned helicopters. In an interview published in October 2017, it was stated that Chinese military objectives focus on projecting sovereign power near China, controlling sea space along its borders, and dominating the South China Sea. They are incorporating drones into their doctrine to bridge the gap with the U.S. in terms of military capabilities. This asymmetric approach using drones provides China with the ability to perform various roles effectively. The Chinese military is focusing on developing mass platforms known as \"swarms\" rather than larger autonomous or remotely operated vehicles. This strategy is based on a historic military ethos that believes a conventionally inferior adversary can defeat a superior one. By swarming U.S. warships with small unarmed drones, they can disrupt and distract U.S. weapons systems, impacting electronics and target acquisition. This nonlethal drone capability allows China to conduct military operations in a non-kinetic way. China is developing non-kinetic military capabilities to control disputed islands and maritime traffic. They are working on carrier-based UAVs and an electromagnetic railgun. The U.S. Navy is also developing a ship-based electromagnetic railgun. China is also reportedly developing electromagnetic pulse weapons. China's military is developing electromagnetic pulse weapons to target U.S. aircraft carriers in a potential conflict over Taiwan. Chinese military is also enhancing surveillance and targeting systems to detect and track U.S. ships and submarines. The PLAN is improving its over-the-horizon targeting capability with radars and reconnaissance satellites to support long-range precision strikes, including ASBMs. China is investing in reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication systems for high-fidelity targeting information. China is developing sensors for maritime surveillance through ships and aircraft reporting at sea. China uses ships, aircraft, ground-based radars, skywave OTH radar, reconnaissance satellites, and civilian systems like AIS and Beidou for maritime awareness. China's Beidou system is used on thousands of Chinese fishing boats for navigation and position reporting back to China. Strategic Chinese military writings emphasize the importance of cyber operations, with network warfare being a key aspect of sea battle according to the PLA. As China's military investment in cyber matures, cyber operations in the maritime realm will enhance the PLA(N)'s capabilities. The China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) and the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) have signed an agreement to collaborate on quantum technologies for advanced naval mission systems. They will establish three laboratories in Wuhan focused on quantum navigation, communications, and detection. The project will be funded by the state-owned shipbuilder and aims to promote industrialization in disruptive technologies for China's navy. Potential modernization plans for China's navy were revealed by retired Rear Admiral Zhao Dengping in a university lecture, including new submarines, anti-ship ballistic missiles, destroyer capabilities, and Air Force modernization goals. Zhao, a former Director of the Equipment Department of the PLAN, shared these details in a lecture at Northwestern Polytechnical University. Retired Rear Admiral Zhao Dengping revealed potential modernization plans for China's navy in a university lecture, mentioning known PLAN programs like the Type 055 destroyer, Landing Helicopter Dock amphibious assault ship, Type 056 corvette, and YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship missile. Zhao's lecture likely took place within the last 2-3 years, and his mention of potential PLAN programs was considered an unprecedented revelation. Admiral Zhao revealed plans for a new 7,000-ton nuclear-powered attack submarine with advanced features. The Chinese web pages also showed additional slides, possibly as a psychological tactic. The PLAN may be developing a low power auxiliary nuclear powerplant for conventional submarines. Admiral Zhao revealed plans for a new 7,000-ton nuclear-powered attack submarine with advanced features, possibly succeeding the PLAN's current AIP systems. The slides detailed weapon and technical ambitions for future surface combatant ships, including hypersonic anti-ship missiles, guided projectiles, laser weapons, and directed-energy weapons. Future ships could also have an integrated electric power system. The future DDG may have an integrated electric power system, full-spectrum stealthiness, integrated mast and RF technology, new laser/kinetic energy weapons, and mid-course interception capability. Requirements for future PLAN Aviation developments include a new carrier-borne fighter, EW aircraft, fixed AEW, ship-borne ASW helicopter, carrier-borne UAV, stratospheric long-endurance UAV, and a stratospheric airship. Chinese navy ships are increasingly conducting operations away from home. China's navy ships are conducting operations in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Baltic Sea. Some deployments include training exercises and antipiracy operations off Somalia since 2008. China's naval modernization aligns with a shift to \"far seas\" protection, beyond the \"first island chain.\" China's navy is expanding its operational reach beyond the \"first island chain\" with long-range, sustainable naval platforms that have robust self-defense capabilities. The PLAN's focus has shifted from \"offshore waters defense\" to a mix of \"offshore waters defense\" and \"far seas protection,\" reflecting an interest in a wider operational reach. The PLA envisions a global role with references to \"forward edge defense\" moving potential conflicts far from China's territory. The PLAN is gradually extending its operational reach beyond East Asia into the \"far seas.\" The PLAN's latest naval platforms extend combat operations beyond China's land-based defenses, including aircraft carriers for air defense and sea-based land-attack capabilities. This expansion facilitates non-war military uses and missions in the \"far seas,\" such as protecting sea lanes, providing disaster relief, naval diplomacy, and regional deterrence. The PLA(N) is increasing its focus on developing blue-water naval capabilities to sustain missions far from China's shores, with a growing fleet and experience in distant waters. China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has expanded its fleet and conducted regular combat training in the Philippine Sea, participated in multinational exercises like RIMPAC 2014, operated in the Mediterranean, increased intelligence collection deployments in the western Pacific, and deployed a submarine to the Indian Ocean. The PLAN has also been involved in counter-piracy escort missions in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden, with 22 deployments since December 2008, showcasing its growing presence in distant waters. China is expanding its strategic presence by investing in supply ships and using commercial shipping lines to provide logistics support to deployed naval vessels. This effort aims to enable the PLAN to deploy with increasing tempo throughout the Asia-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean. China's People's Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps is undergoing a significant reorganization and expansion, increasing its force size from 20,000 to potentially over 100,000 Marines. This expansion will enhance China's ability to project power abroad and make the Marine Corps more of a full spectrum expeditionary force. China's Marine force, similar to the British Royal Marines, is being expanded and reorganized to enhance China's global power. They can be stationed at home, abroad, or aboard PLAN ships to secure trade routes. This focus on maritime operations will improve China's ability for amphibious landings and deploying expeditionary forces. The PLAN's naval drills serve as both political exercises and warnings to the US, laying the foundation for future activities. China's maritime strategy is expanding beyond traditional boundaries, signaling future expeditionary deployments by the PLAN. The psychological fixation on island chains has hindered the development of true sea power. Expect routine PLAN activities with greater operational support from other PLA arms in the near future. China's Eastern Theater Command aims to increase power projection and gain air superiority beyond the mainland to support naval operations. China's first overseas military base in Djibouti signifies its intent to build bases outside China for logistic support of naval operations. China began construction of a military base in Djibouti in February 2016, with plans to complete it within a year. The facility is intended to support UN peacekeeping operations, escort missions near Somalia and the Gulf of Aden, and provide humanitarian assistance. The base was officially established on July 11, 2017, and a multi-purpose wharf is planned for naval flotilla docking. The Chinese navy is planning to build a multi-purpose naval wharf in Djibouti to support its flotillas conducting anti-piracy operations in Somali waters. The wharf will accommodate a four-ship flotilla, including China's new generation Type-901 supply ship, destroyers, frigates, and amphibious assault ships for combat and humanitarian missions. The construction will begin once accommodation for the People's Liberation Army marines, engineers, and workers is completed. The Chinese navy is planning to build a multi-purpose naval wharf in Djibouti to support its flotillas conducting anti-piracy operations in Somali waters. The wharf will accommodate a four-ship flotilla, including China's new generation Type-901 supply ship, destroyers, frigates, and amphibious assault ships for combat and humanitarian missions. Satellite images suggest ongoing development of docking facilities and military infrastructure in Djibouti. Beijing may need to assist in mass evacuations of Chinese citizens, leading to the design of a large capacity wharf for more warships to dock. The base is intended to resupply vessels for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, with initial plans for a naval maintenance and repair port due to a 2010 incident with a destroyer. China's new base in Djibouti broke down during anti-piracy missions in 2010. Chinese firms have spent money in Djibouti, but it's unclear if it will translate into influence. The base will support Chinese navy ships conducting operations in the Gulf of Aden. China's new base in Djibouti supports Chinese navy operations in the Gulf of Aden and is strategically located near critical maritime chokepoints and China's economic interests in East Africa. Despite Beijing describing it as a logistics facility, satellite imagery shows military infrastructure present. China's military base in Djibouti has barracks, storage units, and docking facilities for its naval fleet. It is the seventh country to establish a presence in Djibouti, following the US, France, and Japan. The base is strategically located near the Suez Canal and has raised concerns about China's geopolitical ambitions. Djibouti hosts multiple foreign military installations, making China's presence less controversial. China's military base in Djibouti strategically located for humanitarian missions and to protect Chinese interests along the maritime Silk Road. The base allows China to have a presence in a strategically important area with Chinese diaspora, investment, and trade flows. According to a CNA report, the Djibouti base supports China's missions for \"far seas protection\" including combatting piracy, evacuating Chinese citizens, peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and protecting sea lanes. Analysts believe China could use the base to project power into North Africa and strengthen its position in the Indian Ocean, allowing for longer patrols in the region. This has raised concerns in India about regional maritime security. China may establish additional overseas military bases in countries with friendly relationships and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan. The willingness of countries to host a PLA presence may constrain China's overseas military basing. China's leaders are considering a mix of military logistics models, including access to overseas commercial ports and exclusive PLAN logistic facilities, to meet future overseas military needs. This would enhance the PLA's capabilities for non-combat operations, humanitarian assistance, and projecting military power further from China. Reports suggest China may deploy marines to the commercial port at Gwadar, Pakistan for security purposes. A senior Pakistani diplomat confirmed that China was invited to build a naval facility in Pakistan in 2011, following strained relations with the US after the raid on Osama bin Laden. China is considering establishing more overseas military bases, with Djibouti being its current outpost. China is considering establishing additional overseas military bases, as instructed by President Xi Jinping to advance base construction. Chinese military analysts have speculated about potential locations for these bases. China is considering setting up additional overseas military bases in various locations such as Gwadar, Pakistan, Hambantota, Sri Lanka, Sittwe, Myanmar, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Analysts suggest that China's first base in Djibouti may be the first of many, potentially leading to conflicts with the U.S. due to China's fast-modernizing military. China is rapidly modernizing its military, potentially leading to security conflicts with the U.S. and other countries. Plans for a new naval and air facility in Jiwani, Pakistan, near the Iranian border, have been advanced by Chinese forces. Plans for a large naval and air base in Jiwani, Pakistan, were advanced by Chinese People's Liberation Army officers during a visit on Dec. 18. The base will require the relocation of residents and an upgrade of the airport to accommodate Chinese military aircraft. Construction is expected to begin in July, occupying nearly the entire strategic peninsula. Reports suggest China may also build a naval and air base near Gwadar in west Pakistan. China may be planning to construct a naval and air base near Gwadar, Pakistan, as part of its network of military bases in the Indian Ocean. Plans include building accommodation for up to 500,000 Chinese nationals within five years, along with a large contingent of Chinese marines. This development would significantly impact Gwadar's existing population of around 100,000 people. China's plans to construct a naval and air base near Gwadar, Pakistan, could potentially overwhelm the existing population of around 100,000 people. This development would effectively establish Gwadar as China's first colony in the Indian Ocean. Additionally, there are reports suggesting China may also be considering building a new naval base and airfield at Jiwani, located 60 kilometers west of Gwadar. This expansion of Chinese military presence in the region is part of a larger strategy to secure its energy trade routes and protect its interests in the Indian Ocean. China's expanding military presence in the Indian Ocean includes plans for naval facilities in Tanzania, Sri Lanka, and possibly the Maldives. There is speculation about China's intentions in these locations, with concerns raised about potential naval bases. China's interest in the region is part of a larger strategy to secure energy trade routes and protect its interests in the Indian Ocean. China has approached Vanuatu about building a permanent military presence in the South Pacific, potentially leading to a full military base less than 2000 kilometers from Australia. This move has raised concerns in Canberra and Washington about China's ability to project military power in the region. China has approached Vanuatu to establish a military base in the Pacific, raising concerns in Australia and the US about a shift in strategic balance. Beijing's military ambitions in Vanuatu could start with an access agreement for Chinese naval ships to dock and be serviced, potentially leading to a proper base. Senior figures in China's People's Liberation Army are eager to move quickly on this plan. China is looking to establish a network of naval and air bases in the Indian Ocean to support its strategic imperatives, including potential bases closer to Australia. This expansion follows the opening of China's first overseas military base in Djibouti and negotiations for another base near Gwadar in Pakistan. Beijing's strategic imperatives and distance from Chinese territory suggest a need for military facilities across the Indian Ocean, including in its central/eastern zone. China is expanding its naval and air presence in the Indian Ocean to protect sea lines, Chinese nationals, and assets. The forecasted growth includes around 20 surface vessels and submarines, requiring naval logistics facilities and air bases in three quadrants of the Indian Ocean. This expansion follows the establishment of China's first overseas military base in Djibouti and negotiations for another base near Gwadar in Pakistan. China is expanding its naval and air presence in the Indian Ocean to protect sea lines and assets. The deployment of aircraft carriers or air tankers from China may not provide adequate coverage. Concerns have been raised over the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka potentially being converted into a Chinese naval base, despite reassurances from Sri Lanka to India. India is concerned about Chinese economic power and the potential for a Chinese base in the Maldives, particularly on the island of Gan. The Indian navy has maintained a presence at Gan, but there are suspicions that India's presence may be used as a bargaining point. The withdrawal of an Indian naval helicopter from Gan in April raised concerns that China may establish a naval and air base there, which could be a game changer in the Indian Ocean. A Chinese naval base in the Maldives or Myanmar could threaten India's naval dominance in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. China's efforts to establish a military presence in Myanmar have been resisted in the past, but with new developments like the port at Kyaukpyu, Chinese influence may increase if Myanmar fails to secure funding. China's efforts to establish a military presence in Myanmar could threaten India's naval dominance in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. A Chinese commercial firm purchased a port near Darwin, Australia, sparking concerns about potential security threats to U.S. naval forces operating out of Darwin. Unlike the U.S. Navy, China does not publicly release detailed information about its navy's force-level goals or shipbuilding plans. China's 30-year shipbuilding plan lacks transparency compared to the U.S. Navy. The ultimate size and composition of China's navy remains uncertain even among Chinese military and political leaders. Just as there is debate in the U.S. about future military force structure, similar discussions may be happening in China. The 2015 ONI report highlights China's navy possessing over 300 surface combatants, submarines, amphibious ships, and missile-armed patrol craft. It includes details on the PLA(N) surface force, submarine force, and various types of ships in their fleet. The report suggests potential changes in force-level goals and shipbuilding quantities for China's navy. The ONI report provides figures on the Chinese navy's fleet composition, including submarines and surface ships. The report also includes projected numbers for 2015 and 2020, highlighting the modern design percentage of ships. Additionally, DOD states that the PLAN is the largest navy in Asia with a significant number of combatants, submarines, and amphibious warfare ships. The annual DOD reports to Congress on Chinese navy ships show an increase in modern units within China's submarine and surface combatant forces. Comparisons between U.S. and Chinese naval capabilities are sometimes made based on ship numbers. The evaluation of fleet capabilities relative to missions can be challenging due to various factors. Total number of ships or tonnage is only a partial metric of capability, as warfighting capabilities now rely heavily on internal electronics and software, which can vary greatly between navies and are difficult to assess externally. The comparison of naval capabilities based on easily observed factors like ship numbers and tonnages is becoming less valid. Total numbers of ships can hide significant differences in capabilities, especially between the U.S. and Chinese navies. China's navy includes older, obsolete ships, which can skew the assessment of their true capabilities. The comparison of naval capabilities based on total ship numbers can be misleading, especially when considering China's navy. While China has fewer submarines today compared to 1990, the aggregate capability has increased due to replacing older ships with more modern and capable ones. This shift in focus from total numbers to aggregate capability is crucial in assessing naval strength accurately. China's navy has replaced older ships with more modern and capable ones, increasing aggregate capability. Tracking growth in numbers of modern and capable units is more useful than total ship numbers for assessing naval strength accurately. The U.S. Navy's global responsibilities and homeporting locations affect its availability for crisis scenarios in China's near-seas region. In a U.S.-China conflict inside the first island chain, U.S. naval forces would operate at the end of long supply lines, while Chinese forces would operate at the end of short supply lines. Comparisons of ship numbers do not consider other military capabilities like land-based anti-ship missiles and Air Force aircraft armed with missiles. This is crucial due to significant non-navy maritime forces in both countries. In comparing U.S. and Chinese military capabilities in the Western Pacific, it is important to consider the broader military conflict involving multiple branches. Navies should be measured against their respective missions rather than each other, as they may excel in different areas. This is crucial in assessing naval capabilities, as each navy has distinct missions to fulfill. The 2015 RAND report assesses U.S. and Chinese naval capabilities for potential conflict scenarios involving Taiwan and the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. China's PLA has transformed into a modern military with technology and skill levels that lag behind the U.S. but have narrowed the gap. The PLA has made significant strides since 1996 and enjoys proximity advantages in most scenarios. Since 1996, the PLA has significantly improved its capabilities, particularly in ballistic missiles, fighter aircraft, and attack submarines. While the U.S. military has also seen enhancements, the overall shift in capabilities favors China. However, U.S. advancements in certain areas have provided new options and slowed down the relative balance of Chinese military modernization. Chinese power projection capabilities are increasing, but limitations in range impact their ability to influence events and win battles beyond certain distances. The PLA is not close to catching up to the U.S. military in aggregate capabilities, but it doesn't need to in order to dominate its immediate periphery. Over the next five to 15 years, U.S. dominance in Asia will recede if current trajectories continue. The United States would likely prevail in a protracted war in any area, but operating further from China will always work against China. The PLA is becoming more capable of establishing temporary local air and naval superiority in regional conflicts, potentially achieving limited objectives without defeating U.S. forces. This could lead Chinese leaders to believe they could deter U.S. intervention, undermining U.S. deterrence and tipping the balance of debate in Beijing on using force. The debate in Beijing is focused on the advisability of using force, despite the military balance shifting against the United States. The Trump Administration's new national security and defense strategies prioritize great power competition with China and Russia, along with countering their military capabilities. This strategy, known as \"2+3,\" addresses challenges from North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups. The Trump Administration has highlighted the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) as part of its foreign policy and national security strategy. This includes addressing challenges from North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups, while also focusing on maintaining U.S. military superiority over countries like China. The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) was created in 2012 to help achieve this goal. The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) was created to re-imagine existing systems for new roles and capabilities to outsmart enemies. The Defense Innovation Initiative aims to maintain U.S. military superiority through technological advancements. The Long-Range Research and Development Plan (LRRDP) identifies key technology investments for future competition. The Third Offset Strategy, announced by the DOD in 2015, aims to maintain U.S. superiority over numerically large and technologically advanced military forces. The strategy includes initiatives like \"The China Strategic Initiative\" and focuses on developing and deploying new weapons and military technologies quickly. The 2018 NDS emphasizes achieving greater speed in technology development and deployment. The future trajectory of U.S. materiel investments will prioritize technology that can be implemented in development programs within the next five years. The impact of these initiatives under the Trump Administration remains uncertain. The Department of Defense is shifting towards prioritizing speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent modular upgrades to better integrate new technologies. They aim to shed outdated management practices and structures while focusing on joint operating effectiveness through concepts like Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC). The Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC) aims to enhance the joint operating effectiveness of U.S. naval and Air Force units against adversary anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) forces, with a focus on countering Chinese, Russian, and Iranian threats. The concept was introduced in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review and is nearing completion, with military services and combatant commands currently reviewing the draft document. The Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC), aimed at enhancing joint operating effectiveness against A2/AD forces, is in the final stages of development. Capt. Michael Hutchens is overseeing the coordination process, with the document set for review by operational deputies and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2016. Admiral John Richardson's white paper highlights the need for increased agility in response to the rapidly evolving security environment driven by exponential technological advancements. Information technology is driving exponential pace in global challenges, with multi-domain and trans-regional dynamics. China and Russia compete globally with space, cyber, and nuclear forces, challenging U.S. influence in maritime areas. China's 2015 white paper emphasizes sea importance over land. China is rapidly developing its maritime military force to become a maritime power, with a modernized fleet expanding at a frenetic pace. This includes adding ballistic missile submarines and commissioning numerous ships. The Navy aims to provide a balanced fleet to address the evolving security environment and achieve its mission. The Navy must provide a balanced fleet with credible options in strategic locations at a relevant speed. To achieve this, the fleet needs to be larger, more powerful, and equipped with modernized payloads to counter potential competitors and maintain deterrence. Increasing the number and capability of platforms is crucial to prevent the Navy from becoming less powerful. The future fleet must be armed with more effective payloads, utilize advanced sensor and communication technology, and operate on resilient networks. It is crucial to have a powerful fleet by the 2020s, not the 2040s, by maximizing current capabilities and rapidly integrating new technologies. In a competitive environment where pace is key, the Navy must build a larger, more capable battle fleet led by adaptable teams for decisive operations. Time is of the essence. The U.S. Navy is taking steps to improve its ability to counter Chinese maritime A2/AD capabilities by adjusting force posture and basing, including increasing the number of ships homeported in the Pacific to 60% by 2020. The U.S. Navy plans to increase the number of Navy ships stationed in the Pacific from 51 in 2014 to 67 by 2020. They will also increase attack submarines at Guam to four and station up to four Littoral Combat Ships at Singapore. Additionally, the Navy will assign its newest ships, aircraft, and personnel to the Pacific. The U.S. and Philippines signed an agreement for increased access to Philippine bases, and U.S. Marines will have rotational training deployments in Australia with 2,500 Marines by 2020. The U.S. Navy plans to increase the number of Marines in each deployment to 2,500 by 2020 or later. China's navy has weaknesses in areas like antisubmarine warfare. To counter China's naval modernization, actions include developing attack submarines, torpedoes, and unmanned underwater vehicles. Navy programs aim to improve the ability to counter Chinese maritime capabilities with ships like Ford class aircraft carriers, Virginia class attack submarines, and Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. The Navy is acquiring highly capable aircraft like F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, and P-8A Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft. New weapon technologies being considered include Aegis ballistic missile defense systems, solid state lasers, electromagnetic rail guns, and hypervelocity projectiles for Navy cruisers and destroyers. Recent efforts have focused on increasing antisubmarine warfare training and forward-deployed operations in the Pacific Fleet. The Navy has been focusing on acquiring advanced aircraft and weapon technologies, including Aegis ballistic missile defense systems and hypervelocity projectiles. Recent efforts have also included increasing antisubmarine warfare training and conducting forward-deployed operations in the Pacific Fleet, engaging with allied navies and monitoring Chinese military operations in the Western Pacific. There is a trend towards expanding naval cooperation with allies like Japan, Australia, and India into trilateral or quadrilateral forms, under the concept of the \"Indo-Pacific\" region. The U.S. Navy is facing challenges in countering Chinese maritime forces while also meeting other global missions. Concerns include Chinese military advancements, budget constraints, and the Navy's capability to maintain a fleet of 355 ships. This could impact U.S. allies in the Pacific and the ability to defend interests in the region. The U.S. Navy's challenge lies in countering Chinese maritime forces and meeting global missions amidst concerns about budget constraints and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships. The adequacy of resources for national defense strategy and the development of long-range carrier-based aircraft and weapons are also key issues for Congress to consider. The Navy aims to develop long-range carrier-based UAVs to counter Chinese A2/AD systems and enhance the survivability of aircraft carriers. The UCLASS program is crucial for extending the operational range of Navy carrier air wings. The UCLASS aircraft debate focused on optimizing for strike operations or ISR missions. The program was restructured into the UCA/MQ-25 Stingray program for carrier-based unmanned tanker aircraft. The Navy accelerated fielding timelines for the MQ-25 Stingray program. The MQ-25 Stingray program rapidly develops an unmanned capability for Carrier Air Wing missions, extending mission effectiveness range and filling future tanker gaps. It pioneers integration of manned and unmanned operations, demonstrating advanced sea-based UAS technologies. The MQ-25 Stingray program aims to deliver the Navy's first carrier-based UAS for mission tanker capabilities by FY 2026. It will reduce the use of F/A-18E/Fs as tankers, freeing them for strike fighter missions and increasing overall capacity within the carrier air wing. The program is designed for rapid acquisition with a streamlined decision-making process to mitigate risks and expedite development. The U.S. Navy is focusing on developing longer-ranged anti-ship and land-attack missiles to counter Chinese navy ships. Efforts are underway to modify existing weapons for near-term capabilities and develop new-design weapons for future deployment. The Department of the Navy's Cruise Missile Strategy aims to maximize lethality while minimizing costs. The Department of the Navy's Cruise Missile Strategy includes sustaining the Tomahawk cruise missile inventory through a mid-life recertification program to extend its service-life by 15 years. Modernization and technological upgrades will be integrated, along with the development of a Maritime Strike Tomahawk capability. The Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) will be fielded to counter anti-surface warfare threats. The Department of the Navy plans to develop next-generation strike capabilities like the Next Generation Land Attack Weapon (NGLAW) to replace the Tomahawk Weapon System. There is also a potential consideration for the Navy to procure a long-range air-to-air missile for carrier-based strike fighters to enhance their survivability against Chinese aircraft. The Navy is considering developing a long-range air-to-air missile for carrier-based fighters to counter Chinese A2/AD systems. The Navy previously had the F-14/Phoenix combination during the Cold War to counter Soviet threats, but the program was cancelled. Currently, there is no long-range air-to-air missile in development by the DOD. BVRAAMs are used by fighters for beyond visual range combat. China successfully test fired its latest air-to-air missile, the PL-15, with improved features like an active radar seeker and extended range. The PL-15 has garnered international attention, with the USAF considering a new missile to counter its capabilities. The PL-15 missile, developed by China, poses a significant threat to American air operations due to its long range and maneuverability. The USAF considers countering the PL-15 a high priority, as it out-ranges existing American air-to-air missiles. The PL-15 will equip Chinese stealth fighter jets and is part of China's innovative military system. China successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile, estimated to be about 19 feet long and 13 inches in diameter, with a range exceeding 300 km. This missile, categorized as a very long-range air-to-air missile (VLRAAM), outperforms any American or NATO missile, reaching speeds of Mach 6 and increasing the no escape zone against supersonic targets. The new very long-range air-to-air missile (VLRAAM) features a large AESA radar for locking onto targets, infrared/electro-optical seeker for high-value targets, and lateral thrusters for improved maneuverability in engaging agile targets. It outperforms American and NATO missiles with its range, speed, and effectiveness against distant and stealthy targets. The VLRAAM poses a significant risk to U.S. military operations, especially in the South China Seas and Taiwan Straits. Assets like aerial tankers and AEW&C aircraft are crucial for long-range operations. Stealthy tanker platforms and proposed tankers could be vulnerable to VLRAAMs, pushing the Chinese air defense threat bubble further out. This could impact the U.S. \"Arsenal\" Plane concept. The Vympel R-37M air-to-air missile, with a range of up to 188 miles and speeds of up to Mach 6, poses a threat to U.S. combat aircraft, including the F-35. If operational reports are accurate, it could impact the future of air warfare. The Vympel R-37M air-to-air missile, capable of speeds up to Mach 6 and with a range of 188 miles, gives Russian aircraft an advantage over U.S. combat aircraft. Defense experts are concerned about the missile being in service with the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, especially for their Su-35 aircraft. The F-35 is considered vulnerable to this new weapon due to its lack of supercruise capability and limited acceleration. The F-35's stealth characteristics have been designed to contend with older threats, making it more detectable to newer sensors and weapon systems. Congress is concerned about the Navy's ability to counter China's ASBMs, but there are potential approaches for countering them, including using a combination of active and passive measures. The Navy has experience developing counters for new weapons like ASCMs and is likely exploring ways to counter ASBMs. Employing a combination of active and passive measures can target various points in the ASBM \"kill chain\" to counter an opponent's military capability. Lieutenant General Herbert Carlisle emphasized the importance of attacking various points in an opponent's kill chain in Air Force planning. The Navy could disrupt China's ASBM kill chain by using tactics like controlling electromagnetic emissions and deploying deception emitters. They could also acquire weapons to disable or jam China's surveillance and targeting systems, attack ASBM launchers, and confuse ASBMs during flight. Options include using SM-3 and SM-6 interceptor missiles, as well as developing hypervelocity projectiles and electromagnetic rail guns. The Navy could disrupt China's ASBM kill chain by using tactics like controlling electromagnetic emissions and deploying deception emitters. Options for confusing ASBMs include equipping ships with electronic warfare systems or generating radar-opaque smoke clouds. Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson emphasized that the US would not shy away from deploying carriers within the range of China's \"carrier-killer\" missile. Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson challenges the notion of A2/AD zones as impenetrable, emphasizing that denial is an aspiration, not a certainty. He argues that the threats represented by red arcs on maps are not insurmountable and can be managed, stating that it is hard to achieve a hit and requires a complex chain of events. Richardson believes that military forces can fight from within these defended areas. Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson challenges the notion of A2/AD zones as impenetrable, emphasizing that threats can be managed and are not insurmountable. Richardson believes that military forces can fight from within these defended areas, highlighting the US Navy's preparedness to project strategic influence wherever necessary. The United States Navy is confident in its aircraft carriers' ability to operate in A2/AD zones, which have evolved with technological advancements. Adm. John Richardson challenges the idea that A2/AD zones are impenetrable, emphasizing that threats can be managed. The U.S. Navy is confident in its aircraft carriers' ability to operate in A2/AD zones despite the challenges posed by advanced anti-ship missile systems and air defenses. Adm. Richardson emphasized that these threats can be managed effectively. The U.S. Navy is confident in its aircraft carriers' ability to operate in A2/AD zones despite threats from advanced anti-ship missile systems and air defenses. Adm. Richardson emphasized the need for operational security and being cautious about discussing capabilities openly to avoid giving competitors an advantage. Miller highlighted historical threats to carriers and the Navy's ability to adapt to current challenges. The U.S. Navy is confident in its ability to operate in A2/AD zones despite threats from advanced anti-ship missile systems and air defenses. There is nervousness in U.S. defense circles regarding China's capabilities, but opinions are mixed on whether the DF-21D missile is a game-changer. The Navy's ability to counter China's submarines is also a concern for some observers. The Navy's ability to counter Chinese submarines is a concern for Congress, highlighted by incidents of Chinese submarines closely trailing U.S. Navy aircraft carriers in international waters. In one instance, a Chinese submarine even conducted a simulated missile attack on a U.S. aircraft carrier. The Navy is working on improving its anti-submarine warfare capabilities to counter the threat posed by Chinese submarines. This could involve increasing ASW training exercises, procuring platforms with ASW capabilities, and developing new technologies for a distributed and sensor-intensive approach to ASW. Additionally, efforts to counter wake-homing torpedoes include completing development of the Navy's new anti-torpedo torpedo (ATT) and putting it into procurement. Enemy submarines are identified as the most dangerous threat to the Navy's aircraft carriers and surface fleet, especially as the Russian undersea force reemerges and China expands its fleet. The U.S. Navy is focusing on improving its anti-submarine warfare capabilities to counter the growing threat from Chinese and Russian submarines. Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson emphasizes the importance of maintaining dominance in the undersea realm, especially as competition for undersea space increases. The Navy is working to ensure its attack submarine force remains stealthy and influential in key areas to uphold undersea superiority. Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson stresses the need to continue developing anti-submarine warfare systems to counter the increasing threat from Chinese submarines. China's focus on building numerous quiet submarines poses a challenge in detecting and engaging them, highlighting the importance of maintaining a strong undersea presence. The debate over whether the U.S. Navy should shift to a more distributed fleet architecture, reducing reliance on aircraft carriers and increasing smaller ships, has been ongoing. Supporters argue that the current concentration of combat capability in a few high-value units makes the Navy vulnerable to enemy targeting. Supporters of a more distributed fleet architecture argue that a smaller number of enemy weapons could cause enough damage to stop a carrier's aviation operations, leading to a \"mission kill.\" They believe a distributed fleet would make it harder for China to target the Navy and reduce the risk of significant combat capability loss. Opponents argue that larger ships are more capable of defending themselves and are proportionately more capable than smaller ships. Supporters of a more distributed fleet architecture argue that larger ships are better equipped to defend themselves and withstand enemy weapons due to their size, armoring, and damage-control systems. They believe a more distributed fleet would be less vulnerable to enemy attacks. Opponents argue that the Navy is already taking steps towards a more distributed fleet with the acquisition of LCSs and JHSVs, as well as implementing the concept of distributed lethality in surface ship formations. The Navy's future fleet architecture is further discussed in another CRS report. The Navy's future fleet architecture is discussed in various CRS reports covering U.S. Navy programs in response to China's naval modernization efforts. These reports include Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans, Navy Ford (CVN-78) Class Aircraft Carrier Program, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, Navy Virginia (SSN-774) Class Attack Submarine Procurement, and Navy DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs. The Navy's future fleet architecture is discussed in various CRS reports covering U.S. Navy programs in response to China's naval modernization efforts, including Navy DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs. In H.R. 5515, Section 1242 addresses the United States strategy on China, emphasizing the importance of maintaining advantages over competitive adversaries. The National Security Strategy identifies China and Russia as revisionist powers seeking to shape the world to their authoritarian model. China is leveraging military modernization and predatory economics to gain regional hegemony in the Indo-Pacific, aiming to displace the United States for global preeminence in the future. The United States recognizes the need for a comprehensive response to address challenges posed by China, with a focus on integrating various national power elements like diplomatic, economic, intelligence, law enforcement, and military capabilities. Congress prioritizes long-term strategic competition with China and mandates the submission of a whole-of-government strategy report by the President by March 1, 2019. This strategy should include strategic assessments and planned responses to address China's activities. The strategic assessments and planned responses to address activities by the Chinese Communist Party include undermining democratic institutions, exploiting research and development, gaining access to sensitive US industries through economic tools, engaging in malicious cyber activities, using investment and infrastructure projects for access and influence in various regions, and employing military activities and hybrid warfare methods. The report required by paragraph (1) outlines strategies to counter Chinese influence through various means such as strategic communication, coordination of resources, and interagency mechanisms. It also includes a classified annex and highlights programs in the annual budget submission to Congress. Section 1105 of title 31, United States Code outlines funded programs related to the strategy to counter Chinese influence. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The House of Representatives' Budget includes a provision on China's military activities in the Indo-Pacific region. It emphasizes the importance of transparency to raise awareness, enable security partners to protect their sovereignty, and maintain regional stability. The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with other officials, is required to submit quarterly reports on China's military actions. The House of Representatives' Budget provision requires quarterly reports on China's provocative military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, including military deployments and infrastructure construction in specific areas.

A written summary with imagery and analysis will be distributed to congressional committees and allies in the region. The report on significant destabilizing activities by China in the Indo-Pacific region will be disseminated to appropriate congressional committees in a manner consistent with national security and protection of classified information. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" includes the congressional defense committees, the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives. H.Rept. 115-676 mentions long-range naval carrier aviation in relation to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 directed the Secretary of Defense to provide three independent studies on future fleet platform architectures for the Navy in the 2030 timeframe. The studies emphasize the need for an enhanced carrier-based unmanned long-range strike capability. The committee is concerned that the MQ-25 program lacks precision strike capability as a requirement, potentially limiting future growth in this platform integrated into the carrier air wing for the next 30 years. The Navy is encouraged to develop an unmanned anti-access capability. The committee encourages the Navy to develop an unmanned anti-access penetrating long-range strike capability from the aircraft carrier, in addition to the current focus on the MQ-25A. The evolving challenges in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region highlight the ongoing need for a surface ship torpedo defense capability for the Navy's high-value units. Despite the increasing threat to Navy carrier strike groups and surface platforms, the budget request inadequately supports currently deployed systems. The committee is concerned about the budget request and Future Years Defense Program not adequately supporting currently deployed systems and canceling further development of SSTD capability. They are worried that decisions based on inadequate funding resources are putting the readiness and security of U.S. naval and Marine forces at risk. The Navy's distribution of SSTD program responsibilities among various sponsors has led to a lack of support for efficient program execution and focused leadership. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide a briefing to the House Committee on Armed Services by October 1, 2018.

The appendix discusses the strategic and budgetary context of China's naval modernization and its implications for U.S. Navy capabilities in the evolving international security environment. The U.S. role in the world has shifted from a unipolar moment to renewed great power competition with China and Russia, challenging the U.S.-led international order created after World War II. China's naval capabilities reflect this shift, raising uncertainty about the future U.S. role in promoting and defending the open international order. The Trump Administration's statements and actions have raised uncertainty about the future U.S. role in promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights. This could have profound implications for U.S. defense strategy, especially in countering China's naval capabilities. The renewed emphasis on U.S. security and foreign policy is driven by uncertainty over the future U.S. role in the world. Grand strategy and geopolitics are key considerations, with a focus on global strategy and the influence of world geography. U.S. policymakers have prioritized preventing the emergence of threats in Eurasia due to its significant population, resources, and economic activity. The U.S. national strategy aims to prevent the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia to protect core U.S. interests. China's military modernization is seen as part of this effort. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy emphasizes great power competition. The Trump Administration's 2017 National Security Strategy and 2018 National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, as well as countering their military capabilities. This strategy, known as \"2+3,\" addresses challenges from North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups. Additionally, the administration emphasizes a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The Trump Administration's foreign policy and national security construct for the Indo-Pacific region includes a military component. Concerns are raised about the narrowing technological and qualitative edge of U.S. military forces compared to other countries, particularly China's improving naval capabilities posing a challenge to U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific. China's naval capabilities pose a challenge to U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific, impacting the military balance and influencing decisions of other Pacific countries. Conflict between the U.S. and China is seen as unlikely due to economic ties, but the military balance remains a key factor in regional alignment choices. Decisions made by Congress and the executive branch regarding U.S. Navy programs to counter Chinese maritime military forces could impact the political landscape of the Pacific region. China's actions in the East and South China Seas have raised concerns about potential conflicts, drawing the United States into regional security obligations with Japan and the Philippines. China's actions in the South China Sea have raised concerns about its territorial claims and strategies, leading to worries that China aims to dominate the region. The United States has security treaties with Japan, the Philippines, and other regional allies, including policies related to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. The United States has bilateral security treaties with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, along with other security partners in the Western Pacific. Budget constraints from the Budget Control Act of 2011 have led to discussions on balancing defense funds for responding to China's military modernization, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and countering the Islamic State organization. The U.S. Navy faces challenges in executing missions due to constrained defense spending levels set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. A testimony on China's naval modernization was presented before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, highlighting the PLA(N)'s transition from a littoral force at the beginning of the 21st Century. The PLA(N) has undergone a significant modernization effort in the past 15 years, transforming into a more technologically advanced and flexible force. This evolution is evident in its Gulf of Aden counter-piracy operations and more advanced regional exercises. The navy now has capabilities for a wide range of missions including conflict with Taiwan, maritime claims enforcement, protection of economic interests, counter-piracy, and humanitarian missions, with a substantial fleet of surface combatants, submarines, and amphibious ships. The PLA(N) has significantly modernized in the past 15 years, with a focus on larger, multi-mission ships equipped with advanced weapons and sensors. Over fifty naval ships were added in 2013, with more expected in 2014. Qualitative improvements are seen in naval aviation and submarines, capable of striking targets far from China. China is expanding its capabilities with long-range anti-ship missiles and advanced C4ISR architecture. China's military modernization efforts aim to enhance its \"counter-intervention\" capability in the Philippine Sea and South China Sea, deterring U.S. military intervention. The PLA(N) is rapidly acquiring combat capability, aiming to achieve a \"three-step development strategy\" by the mid-21st century. Despite some capability gaps, the PLA(N) is becoming a well-equipped and professional force. China's PLA(N) is modernizing its forces to enhance its capabilities in offshore operations, with a focus on developing blue water capabilities. The acquisition of larger, multi-mission platforms like the LUYANG III-class DDG (052D) reflects a shift towards a more flexible force with advanced air defenses and long-range strike capability. China has made significant progress in anti-surface warfare, deploying advanced, long-range ASCMs. The PLA(N) has made significant progress in anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and anti-air warfare (AAW) by deploying advanced ASCMs and improving air defense capabilities. While progress in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) is less pronounced, there are indications of efforts to address this gap. China is making progress in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) by equipping more surface platforms with modern sonar systems and developing aY-8 naval variant with a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) boom. China's submarine force is focused on anti-surface warfare (ASuW) but may deploy a type-095 guided missile attack submarine with land-attack capability in the next decade. The deployment of land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs) on future submarines and surface combatants could enhance China's ability to strike key U.S. bases in the region. China's naval aviation is expanding its capabilities, including maritime strike, patrols, anti-submarine warfare, early warning, and logistics. The Liaoning aircraft carrier and its air wing are developing towards full operational status by 2020, supporting fleet operations in an air-defense role. The PLA(N) is transitioning to a versatile naval aviation force capable of various missions near and far from home. China's surface force poses a challenge in accurately assessing its size and capability. China's naval aviation is expanding capabilities, including maritime strike, patrols, anti-submarine warfare, early warning, and logistics. The PLA(N) is transitioning to a versatile naval aviation force capable of various missions near and far from home. Rielage highlighted challenges in accurately assessing China's surface force due to differences in ship types and capabilities. A detailed examination is needed to understand the potential impact of China's naval modernization. The PLA(N) possesses a modern surface combatant fleet with destroyers, frigates, corvettes, patrol craft, amphibious ships, mine warfare ships, and auxiliary ships. China imported modern combatants in the 1990s to address capability gaps but also developed its own weapons and platforms. China's surface force has evolved from a mix of vintage, modern, converted, imported, and domestic vessels. China's surface ship acquisition has shifted to Chinese-designed units with Chinese weapons and sensors, incorporating imported or license-produced engineering components. China rapidly narrowed the technology gap with modern navies by using imported technology, reverse engineering, and indigenous development. China has narrowed the technology gap with modern navies by implementing longer production runs of advanced surface combatants and conventional submarines. The PLA(N) surface force has made strong gains in anti-surface warfare with advanced anti-ship cruise missiles and over-the-horizon targeting systems. China has invested heavily in maritime reconnaissance systems and communication systems to enable accurate targeting. China's surface force has made significant progress in shipboard air defense, retiring older ships with limited capabilities and replacing them with modern destroyers equipped with advanced surface-to-air missiles. The upcoming LUYANG III DDG is expected to have extended range anti-ship cruise missiles, advanced SAMs, anti-submarine missiles, and possibly land-attack cruise missiles. These high-end combatants will enhance weapons stores and flexibility for surface action groups operating in blue water. China's surface force has upgraded its shipboard air defense capabilities by introducing modern destroyers and frigates equipped with advanced surface-to-air missiles. The new generation of destroyers and frigates utilize modern combat management systems and air-surveillance sensors, such as the Chinese SEA EAGLE and DRAGON EYE phased-array radars. These vessels have proven instrumental in sustaining China's counter-piracy presence in the Gulf of Aden, allowing the PLA(N)'s surface force to operate with increased confidence outside of shore-based air defense systems. China's surface force has upgraded its shipboard air defense capabilities with modern destroyers and frigates equipped with advanced surface-to-air missiles. Approximately 65 percent of China's destroyers and frigates are currently modern, with plans to increase to 85 percent by 2020. The PLA(N) has phased out Cold War-era missile patrol boats for a more active offshore orientation. They have acquired a modern coastal-defense capability with 60 HOUBEI class guided missile patrol boats, essential for reacting to threats within China's exclusive economic zone. Additionally, China began producing the new JIANGDAO class corvette in 2012. In 2012, China started producing the JIANGDAO class corvette optimized for naval patrol in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The 1500-ton JIANGDAO is equipped for littoral warfare with various weapons and is suitable for patrols, counter-piracy, and other regional duties. At least ten JIANGDAOs are operational, with plans to build more, replacing older patrol craft and frigates. The rapid construction of JIANGDAO FFLs has been a significant part of China's shipbuilding in recent years. China's ship construction focus has shifted towards larger, high-end ships, with the commissioning of three YUZHAO class amphibious transport docks since 2007. These 20,000-ton warships can carry air cushion landing craft, helicopters, armored vehicles, and troops on long-distance deployments. The PLA(N) is investing in expeditionary warfare with plans for more YUZHAOs and a larger amphibious assault ship design. The PLA(N) has shown interest in expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault capability, with a focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and counter-piracy missions. Construction of lower-end tank landing ships has been suspended since 2006. The PLA(N) has added new replenishment oilers and submarine rescue ships to support missions in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean. The PLA(N) recently added new state-of-the-art submarine rescue and fast-response ships, a hospital ship, satellite and rocket launch telemetry ships, survey ships, missile tenders, and a large support ship for aircraft carriers. Progress in anti-submarine warfare capabilities is improving, with more modern sonars and shipboard helicopters. By 2020, the PLA(N) surface force may be more capable of identifying adversary submarines in limited areas. China's surface force has made steady proficiency gains over the past decade. China's surface force has significantly improved in proficiency over the past decade, with increased operational focus and extended deployments in the Gulf of Aden. Training and exercises have become more complex, expanding operating areas within and beyond the First Island Chain. The force engages in opposing force training and utilizes advanced training aids to enhance realism. Multiple deployments to the Philippine Sea have built core warfare proficiency in various areas. These efforts align with General Staff Department guidelines to \"normalize\" distant seas training. China commissioned its first carrier, the Liaoning, in September 2012 and is currently learning to operate fixed-wing aircraft from its deck. Despite recent progress, it will take several years before Chinese carrier-based air regiments are operational. The PLA's newspaper noted that Aircraft Carrier development is core to the PLA(N) and could serve as a deterrent to countries provoking trouble at sea. Liaoning is less capable of power projection than the U.S. Navy's NIMITZ-class carriers. China's Liaoning carrier, commissioned in 2012, is limited in power projection compared to US carriers due to its smaller size and lack of specialized supporting aircraft. It is primarily suited for fleet air defense missions and training carrier aviation skills. The carrier's initial air regiment will consist of the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark. The J-15 aircraft, based on the Chinese J-11B Flanker, is equipped with domestic avionics and armament capabilities. It is armed with PL-8 and PL-12 air-to-air missiles and ASCMs. China is testing six J-15 prototypes and has an operational two-seat J-15S trainer. There is speculation that China may adopt a catapult launching system for its next carrier. Recent reports indicate China is building its first indigenous carrier. China's carrier operations may be limited by a lack of distant bases and support infrastructure. China's submarine force has evolved from a large but poorly equipped force in the 1980s to a more modern fleet optimized for regional anti-surface warfare missions. It currently consists of five nuclear attack submarines, four nuclear ballistic missile submarines, and 53 diesel attack submarines. By 2015, approximately 70 percent of China's submarine force will be modern, capable of employing anti-ship cruise missiles or submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles. Beijing may eventually abandon its prohibition on foreign basing to support its submarine force. By 2020, 75 percent of China's conventional submarine force will be modern, with 100 percent of the SSN force modernized. Most submarines are conventionally powered but equipped with long-range ASCMs. Over half of China's submarines are now ASCM equipped, and by 2020, the majority will have advanced, long-range ASCMs. China's small nuclear attack submarine force can operate further from the mainland for intelligence and surveillance missions. China's submarine force is capable of operating further from the Chinese mainland, conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The PLA(N) is satisfied with recent submarine designs, with a focus on a streamlined mix of units. China's most modern conventionally powered submarine is the YUAN SSP, with eight currently in service and more anticipated. Reducing the number of different submarine classes in service helps streamline maintenance, training, and interoperability. The YUAN SSP submarine, China's most modern conventional submarine, has combat capabilities similar to the SONG SS. It is equipped with an air independent power (AIP) system and may have incorporated quieting technology from the Russian-designed KILO SS. The AIP system increases underwater endurance, reducing vulnerability to detection. China's submarine force also includes SONG SS, MING SS, and Russian-built KILO SS submarines, with only the MING SS and some KILO SS lacking the ability to launch anti-ship cruise missiles. China is modernizing its submarine force with the production of improved variants like the SHANG SSN and future Type 095 SSN, which will likely have enhanced capabilities including a possible land-attack capability. The anticipated deployment of the JIN SSBN in 2014 will give China its first credible at-sea second-strike nuclear capability, with the ability to strike targets in Hawaii, Alaska, and possibly western parts of the US. The PLA Navy may build five units to maintain a continuous peacetime presence, as recent years have seen an increase in submarine patrol activity due to improved training and operational proficiency. Since 2008, the PLA(N) has significantly increased submarine patrol activity, conducting more than 12 patrols annually. This shift aims to enhance operational proficiency and simulate combat missions. The PLANAF has evolved to focus on maritime strike, patrols, anti-submarine warfare, and logistics, utilizing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft for fleet operations. The PLA(N) is expanding its helicopter fleet to enhance platform capabilities for over the horizon targeting, anti-submarine warfare, and search and rescue operations. The primary helicopter, Z-9C, obtained in the 1980s, can operate from any helicopter-capable combatant and is equipped with search radar, dipping sonar, and a lightweight torpedo. The fleet is expected to grow in the near future to keep pace with the rest of the PLA(N). The PLA(N) has approximately twenty operational Z-9Cs equipped with new roof-mounted EO turrets, unguided rockets, and machine gun pods for counter piracy deployments. The Z-8, a Chinese-produced helicopter based on a French design, is a medium lift helicopter used for SAR, troop transport, and logistical support roles. The Z-8 has a greater cargo capacity compared to other PLA(N) helicopters but is limited in its ability to deploy from most PLA(N) platforms. The PLA(N) has upgraded its helicopters with Z-9Cs for counter piracy missions and Z-8 for SAR and troop transport. The PLA(N) also operates Russian-built Ka-28 helicopters for ASW missions. Additionally, the PLANAF has modernized its fighters for various missions including offshore air defense and carrier-based operations. The PLA(N) has upgraded its aircraft with newer models like the Su-30MK2 and J-8F, replacing older variants for improved range, avionics, and armament. The Su-30MK2 is equipped with maritime radar systems for long-distance strikes on enemy ships and strong air-to-air capabilities. The PLA(N) has modernized its aircraft with newer models like the J-8F, J-10A, and J-11B, equipped with advanced armament and avionics. The H-6 Badger, a licensed copy of the Tu-16, remains in service with upgraded electronics and increased missile capacity. The PLA(N) has modernized its aircraft with newer models like the J-8F, J-10A, and J-11B, equipped with advanced armament and avionics. Some H-6s have been modified as tankers, increasing the PLA(N)'s flexibility and range. The JH-7 Flounder provides a maritime strike capability with a maximum of four ASCMs. The PLANAF is expanding its inventory of fixed-wing Maritime Patrol Aircraft, Airborne Early Warning, and surveillance aircraft, including the Y-8. The PLA(N) is developing a Y-8 naval variant with ASW capabilities, including a MAD boom, surface search radar, electronic surveillance antennae, EO/IR turret, and internal weapons bay. China has also developed multi-mission UAVs for maritime operations, integrating them to enhance situational awareness. China has actively pursued UAV technology for over a decade and is emerging as a leader in UAV development. Their latest achievement is the unveiling of the Lijan, a prototype unmanned combat aerial vehicle with blended-wing design and low observable technologies. The PLA(N) is likely to use land and ship-based UAVs to supplement manned ISR aircraft and aid targeting for long-range weapons systems. UAVs will be valuable assets in maritime disputes due to their long loiter time, slow cruising speed, and real-time information capabilities. The PLA(N) has been seen operating the Austrian Camcopter S-100 rotary-wing UAV. China has a robust naval mine capability with over 50,000 mines in inventory. They have developed advanced mine types including moored, bottom, drifting, rocket propelled, and intelligent mines. Future developments may include extended-range propelled-warhead mines and anti-helicopter mines. China's naval mine capability includes advanced types like extended-range propelled-warhead mines, anti-helicopter mines, and bottom influence mines. China's maritime C4ISR expansion enables counter-intervention missions with improved targeting capabilities, posing a challenge for modern navies. China has invested in a wide array of sensors to cover a vast maritime and air picture in the \"near seas,\" spanning over 875,000 square nautical miles. To enable more sophisticated operations, China requires more sophisticated sensors to gain a broader view of activity in its near and far seas. China is strengthening its navy with advanced sensors like skywave radar and reconnaissance satellites to enhance awareness of maritime activity. The PLA(N) is transitioning from a coastal navy to one capable of global missions, widening the military capability gap with Taiwan in China's favor. China's PLA(N) is focused on enhancing its maritime capabilities to protect its vast maritime claims and ensure access to regional resources. While Taiwan remains a top priority for China, the PLA(N) is also preparing for a variety of potential challenges in the East and South China Seas. Beijing prefers to use diplomacy and economic influence to safeguard maritime sovereignty, relying on patrols by the China Coast Guard. However, defending maritime sovereignty will continue to be a fundamental mission for the PLA(N), with assets regularly patrolling China's claimed territory to provide security guarantees. The PLA(N) has various options to defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime interests in a crisis, including amphibious campaigns, blockades, and SLOC interdiction. China's future operational aircraft carrier may increase pressure on SCS rivals. The PLA(N) is expected to perform tasks like ensuring economic lifelines, asserting territorial interests, and providing humanitarian assistance. The Air-Sea Battle concept, now known as Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC), was approved by the Secretary of Defense in 2011 to ensure access to global commons like AirSea, Cyberspace, and Space. Adversaries' Anti-Access/Area Denial strategies are a concern, focusing on areas like sea lines of communication. The AirSea Battle concept aims to counter Anti-Access/Area Denial strategies by adversaries, utilizing advanced military capabilities such as missiles, submarines, fighter aircraft, naval mines, space, and cyberspace. It provides options for national leaders and military commanders to enable follow-on operations, including military activities and humanitarian assistance. The AirSea Battle concept is a new approach to warfare focused on force development to address technological challenges. It aims to create a pre-integrated joint force for U.S. combatant commanders and allies to engage cooperatively across multiple domains. The concept will enhance warfighting capability and effectiveness through synergies within and among services. It is not a strategy like AirLand Battle, but rather a framework for cooperative and networked operations. The AirSea Battle concept aims to gain and maintain freedom of action in the global commons by addressing access challenges universally. It represents a new approach to warfare by focusing on employing military capabilities to attain specific objectives at the operational level of war, rather than amassing large resources and building coalitions when deterrence fails. The traditional approach of building up forces and applying overwhelming force at a specific time and place has been successful in past conflicts, but the changing 21st-century operating environment requires new military strategies. Adversaries are developing tactics to prevent the aggregation of forces, necessitating a shift in thinking and action to counter these emerging threats. The AirSea Battle concept aims to counter Anti-Access and Area Denial threats by creating controlled pockets and corridors. This strategy was exemplified during the conflict in Libya in 2011, where cruise missiles were used from submarines and surface ships to overcome the limited Anti-Access/Area Denial capabilities of the adversary. During the conflict in Libya in 2011, cruise missiles launched from submarines and surface ships targeted and destroyed air defense systems, enabling coalition forces to establish a no-fly zone within 48 hours. The NATO-led operation involved nearly 18,000 sorties and 7,900 precision guided munitions over seven months. During the conflict in Libya in 2011, over 200 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles were used, with more than half coming from submarines. The majority of the Libyan Regime's military assets were disabled or destroyed, including 800 main battle tanks, 2,500 artillery pieces, and 360 fixed-wing fighters. No American troops were deployed on the ground, and only one F-15 was lost due to mechanical failure. Muammar Gaddafi was killed by Libyan rebels in October 2011. The AirSea Battle Concept was completed in November 2011, following the Libya campaign. During the Libya campaign in 2011, Operation Odyssey Dawn quickly transitioned from non-combatant evacuation to kinetic operations. The flexibility and innovation of commanders were crucial in overcoming the limited Anti Access Area Denial capability of the Libyan regime. AirSea Battle provides commanders with options to neutralize challenges in multiple domains simultaneously. The Air-Sea Battle concept aims to neutralize challenges in multiple domains simultaneously by developing networked integrated forces capable of disrupting, destroying, and defeating the adversary. It provides operational advantage to friendly joint and coalition forces. DOD released an unclassified summary of the concept in June 2013."
