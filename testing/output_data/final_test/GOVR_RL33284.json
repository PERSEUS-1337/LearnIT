    "content": "The federal government has long supported minority and economically disadvantaged small businesses through procurement contracts and assistance programs. These programs, originating from the Small Business Act of 1958, aim to help disadvantaged businesses become competitive and viable. Assistance includes procurement contracts, management grants, training support, and bonding assistance. The Small Business Administration (SBA) used its \u00a7 8(a) authority to secure contracts from federal agencies and subcontract them to firms in disadvantaged areas, focusing on minority small business development. President Nixon's executive orders shifted the program's focus to increasing federal contracting with socially and economically disadvantaged firms. The SBA's \u00a7 8(a) authority was used to promote minority business enterprise, with the program officially becoming a minority business development program in 1978 through P.L. 95-507. This program allows the SBA to enter into contracts with federal agencies and subcontract them to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Applicants must demonstrate their disadvantaged status to qualify for certification. The Small Business Administration's \u00a7 8(a) certification program requires applicants to demonstrate \"socially disadvantaged\" status, with a presumption for certain minority groups. Applicants must also show \"economic disadvantage\" that limits their ability to compete in the market. The Small Business Administration's \u00a7 8(a) certification program requires applicants to demonstrate \"socially disadvantaged\" status, with a presumption for certain minority groups. The program includes a racial component and extends to those facing \"ethnic prejudice or cultural bias\" who meet regulatory criteria. The Minority Small Business Subcontracting Program under \u00a7 8(d) authorizes disadvantaged status for minority group members. Prime contractors on federal contracts must negotiate subcontracting plans with percentage goals for small socially and economically disadvantaged firms. The Small Business Administration's \u00a7 8(a) certification program requires applicants to demonstrate \"socially disadvantaged\" status, with a presumption for certain minority groups. The program includes a racial component and extends to those facing \"ethnic prejudice or cultural bias\" who meet regulatory criteria. Prime contractors on federal contracts must negotiate subcontracting plans with percentage goals for small socially and economically disadvantaged firms, with the government able to collect liquidated damages from non-compliant contractors. Federal agencies are required to establish annual percentage goals for awarding procurement contracts and subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses. The Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 set annual procurement goals for small businesses and disadvantaged businesses. Federal agencies were required to adopt compatible goals to create opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses. Amendments in 1994 included women-owned small businesses in the minority procurement goals. \"Statutory set-asides and preferences for socially and economically disadvantaged firms and individuals, including women, have been added to specific grant or contract authorization programs. Goals for minority groups, women, and disadvantaged individuals have been part of federal funding measures for education, defense, transportation, and other activities for the last two decades.\" In the 1980s and 1990s, various acts like STAA, STURAA, ISTEA, and TEA-21 included minority business participation goals on federally funded projects. Congress authorized agencies like DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard to use price evaluation preferences to meet these goals. However, recent litigation has challenged the constitutionality of these programs, following a Supreme Court decision in 1995 on racial preferences in federal contracting. The Supreme Court avoided making a decision on the merits of the Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena case, which later evolved into Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Mineta with changes in legal standing, details of the federal program, and regulatory reforms. Despite multiple lower court decisions and appeals, the Court sidestepped the constitutional issues in 2001 and dismissed the appeal as \"improvidently granted.\" This action was in response to the Tenth Circuit's ruling in Adarand Constructors v. Slater, which invalidated a federal highway program. The federal appeals court invalidated a federal highway program of financial incentives to promote minority and \"disadvantaged\" small business utilization in force at the time of Adarand I. The program was found to be narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest and passed constitutional muster after being revised and amended in 1997. Prior to Adarand, the U.S. Supreme Court had approved congressionally mandated racial preferences in Fullilove v. Klutznick but generally condemned similar actions by state and local entities in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. These disputes raised questions about whether state affirmative action measures for racial minorities were subject to the same \"strict scrutiny\" as invidious racial discrimination. In Croson, the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious remedies must be tailored to specific evidence of minority exclusion. Adarand applied strict scrutiny to federal programs using racial preferences. The Court did not decide on the constitutional merits but remanded the case. The Adarand litigation involved a race-conscious subcontracting compensation clause program by the Federal Highway Administration. The program required prime contractors to subcontract with minority firms to receive incentive payments. The Supreme Court ruled that all racial classifications by the government must be justified by a compelling interest and narrowly tailored. The Adarand Constructors, Inc. lawsuit challenged a program that favored minority subcontractors in federal contracts. The initial court decisions upheld the program with lenient judicial review, but the Supreme Court later reversed this, ruling that all government racial classifications must be narrowly tailored and justified by a compelling interest. In Adarand I, the Supreme Court rejected the equal protection approach and applied strict scrutiny to racial classifications in the DOT program. This decision undermined prior judicial holdings and emphasized the need for narrow tailoring and compelling governmental interest in affirmative action measures. The Court also acknowledged a role for the national legislature in addressing past societal discrimination. The Supreme Court acknowledged the national legislature's role in addressing past societal discrimination by accepting some forms of racial preference by Congress. The Court did not provide further guidance on the scope of congressional remedial authority or the conditions for its exercise, instead remanding the case to lower courts for further determination. The Supreme Court recognized Congress's authority to address past discrimination through broad remedies based on nationwide findings. However, the DOT incentive program was deemed unconstitutional as it failed the \"narrow tailoring\" test by linking race-based presumptions to financial bonuses for contractors. The program was found to be both overinclusive and underinclusive in its application. The SCC program was criticized for being overinclusive and underinclusive, as it excluded members of other minority groups or Caucasians who may share similar disadvantages. The Tenth Circuit in 2000 reversed the district court injunction against future implementation of DOT's disadvantaged business enterprise program in Colorado, finding that the program was not narrowly tailored to satisfy constitutional requirements. After congressional hearings, financial incentives were removed and reforms were made to DBE requirements imposed by DOT regulation on state and local highway aid recipients. The appeals court found that the DOT disadvantaged business enterprise program, as currently structured, passed constitutional muster with a \"compelling interest\" in preventing discrimination in government contracting. Congress's authority to act was not limited geographically or to specific instances of discrimination. The court allowed racial line-drawing nationwide based on evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, including obstacles faced by minority entrepreneurs. Congressional hearings highlighted issues like racism in unions and denial of access to resources. Disparity studies in major cities were conducted post-Croson to compare discrimination levels. The Tenth Circuit panel found evidence of discriminatory barriers in federal contracting, leading to a \"compelling\" government interest in remedying the situation. The appellate tribunal reviewed the DBE program in two stages, addressing constitutional flaws that had been largely eliminated. The appellate panel largely agreed with the court's opinion that the government's regulatory reforms had eliminated the old DBE program. The latest decision reverses the district court's order that would bar implementation of the revised version and clarifies the scope of the DBE program. The 5% and 10% goals in the SBA and transportation authorization measures are aspirational, not mandatory, and were not the reason for Adarand losing contracts. Any challenge to these provisions is outside the scope of the ruling. The appellate panel upheld the government's regulatory reforms that revamped the DBE program, emphasizing the importance of race-neutral measures before considering race-conscious subsidies for contractors. The revised regulations also included time limits and graduation requirements, addressing previous shortcomings in the program. The revised DOT program incorporated time limits and graduation requirements for disadvantaged businesses in the \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) and 8(d) programs, ensuring limited duration. It was found to be more flexible and voluntary for prime contractors, with monetary caps on subsidies to mitigate the burden on third parties. The use of \"aspirational goals\" had to consider the availability of DBEs in the market, reducing arbitrariness in goal-setting. The revised DOT program implemented time limits and graduation requirements for disadvantaged businesses, making it more flexible and voluntary for prime contractors. It required an individualized showing of economic disadvantage for all applicants, satisfying the Croson requirement for a racial preference. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in an appeal from the Tenth Circuit's final decision in the Adarand case. The Adarand case had its third High Court appearance, with Justices focusing on procedural irregularities rather than constitutional claims. The government argued that Adarand's challenge was limited to the DOT program for direct procurement of highway construction on federal lands. Adarand Constructors, Inc. argued that the court of appeals misunderstood the scope of the appeal. The Adarand case had its third High Court appearance, with Justices focusing on procedural irregularities rather than constitutional claims. The government argued that Adarand's challenge was limited to the DOT program for direct procurement of highway construction on federal lands. Adarand Constructors, Inc. had difficulty arguing that its client \"is still unable to compete on an equal footing\" or had \"lost a single contract under the provisions they are now challenging.\" The Tenth Circuit had rejected Adarand's attack on the statutory framework for federal small disadvantaged business programs, which was not appealed to the Supreme Court. The government contended that Adarand's lawsuit had \"outlived the program that provoked it.\" The Supreme Court dismissed the Adarand case due to technical flaws in the appeal, as the challenge was focused on a defunct aspect of a program that the Tenth Circuit had not ruled upon. The Court declined to reach the merits of the controversy as neither the parties nor the lower courts had addressed it. The Tenth Circuit found that Congress had a \"solid basis in evidence\" for enacting legislation to remedy past discrimination, based on hearing testimony, legislative reports, and disparity studies. Congress is not constrained by regional scope or specific classes when implementing race-conscious actions. The Tenth Circuit found that Congress had a solid basis in evidence for enacting legislation to remedy past discrimination, without constraints on regional scope or specific classes. Court rulings emphasize the need for congruence and proportionality in remedies for civil rights laws, raising questions about the implications for race discrimination legislation under \u00a7 5. The grant of congressional authority to legislate remedies for equal protection violations by states may be broader than its power for federal procurements. The Tenth Circuit found that adopting \"aspirational goals\" for disadvantaged firms based on \"good faith efforts\" was a narrowly tailored alternative to promote minority participation in federal procurement. However, other courts have questioned the coercive nature of government-required goal-setting and enforcement sanctions, such as liquidated damages. For example, the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California affirmative action statute that mandated subcontracting work to female- and minority-owned firms. Similarly, in Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, the D.C. Circuit also addressed issues related to affirmative action measures. In Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, the D.C. Circuit blurred the distinction between \"inclusive\" and exclusive \"affirmative\" action. FCC regulations required broadcast license holders to engage in critical self-analysis of minority and female underrepresentation and undertake affirmative outreach. Strict scrutiny was deemed appropriate as the regulations went beyond simple outreach and influenced hiring decisions. The final Adarand appeal postponed a definitive review of federally mandated affirmative action. Percolating in the lower federal courts are cases questioning Congress's power to enact racial preferences in federal contracting, similar to issues in Adarand. Federal regulatory reforms aimed to align minority business programs with Adarand, proposing stricter certification and eligibility requirements for minority contractors. The plan suspended set-aside programs for minority firms bidding on contracts and implemented statistical benchmarks for estimating expected outcomes. The Commerce Department uses industry benchmarks to estimate disadvantaged business participation in federal contracting. Bid and evaluation credits are given to economically disadvantaged firms in industries where minority participation is below the benchmark, while credits are lowered or suspended in industries where participation exceeds the benchmark. The system is monitored by the Commerce Department to ensure fair contracting practices. The Department's response to comments on its proposal and proposed amendments to the FAR were published in 1997. Procurement mechanisms interact with benchmark limits under the FAR regulation jointly promulgated by DOD, GSA, and NASA. An \"evaluation factor\" applies to bids by non-minority prime contractors in joint ventures, teaming arrangements, or subcontracts. Contracting officers may use \"monetary incentives\" to increase subcontracting opportunities for disadvantaged firms. The program's key feature is \"benchmarking\" by the Commerce Department, tailored to use race-conscious subcontracting in line with Adarand. The Commerce recommendation relies on census data to determine the capacity and availability of minority-owned firms. The DOJ calculates the impact of discrimination on minority business development and capacity, factoring it into benchmarks. Utilization of minority-owned firms is compared to benchmarks to determine when discrimination effects have been overcome. Continued use of race-conscious programs may be necessary for full utilization. Reduction or elimination of price or evaluation credits may be authorized if utilization exceeds benchmarks, after analysis. Final regulations implement DOJ recommendations regarding minority-owned firms in SIC codes. The SBA issued final regulations in 1998 implementing Justice Department recommendations for the \u00a7 8(a) business development and small disadvantaged business program. Reforms included a new certification process for small disadvantaged businesses and a price evaluation adjustment program tied to Commerce benchmarks. Previously, firms self-certified for \"disadvantaged\" eligibility, but now SBA or approved agencies make determinations. Ownership or control by specified individuals claiming to be disadvantaged is established before SBA reviews applications for disadvantaged status. The SBA regulations for determining disadvantaged status remain largely intact, with designated minority groups enjoying a statutory presumption of social disadvantage. Non-minority applicants now have a lower burden of proof, with the requirement changing from \"clear and convincing evidence\" to a \"preponderance of evidence\" rule. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) mandated that at least 10% of funds for certain programs be spent on small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. TEA-21, enacted in 1998, was extended through FY2009 by P.L. 109-59 during the 109th Congress. The revised DOT regulations align with the Small Business Act, defining disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) and disqualifying small business owners with over $750,000 in assets. The regulations make the 10% goal for small disadvantaged firms \"aspirational\" and delegate implementation to state agencies receiving federal transportation funds. States follow a two-step process to determine DBE status. The regulations require states receiving federal transportation funds to establish a two-step process to determine the level of DBE participation. This involves calculating the availability of DBEs locally and adjusting it based on capability factors and evidence of discrimination. States must allocate a portion of federal transportation funding to DBEs, with race-neutral means preferred but race-conscious contract goals applied when necessary. The regulations allow flexibility in setting DBE goals in federally funded transportation contracts, requiring prime contractors to make good faith efforts to meet the designated percentage. States cannot impose rigid quotas that disregard contractors' efforts to subcontract to DBEs. The SBA proposed regulations in 2007 to implement set-asides for industries with underrepresented women-owned small businesses in federal procurement. The SBA proposed regulations in 2007 to identify industries with underrepresented women-owned small businesses in federal procurement. A study identified 28 approaches, with critics claiming the SBA selected the most restrictive methodology, leading to delays in determining underrepresented industries. The SBA extended the comment period due to a court decision, without identifying industries where WOSBs are underrepresented. New regulations require agencies to assess if set-asides address sex discrimination and analyze their own procurement history for discrimination against WOSBs. The SBA proposed new regulations in 2010 for the set-aside program for WOSBs, aiming to comply with equal protection standards by eliminating the requirement for agency-by-agency discrimination determinations. The agency did not directly mention Rothe in the introduction to these regulations. The SBA proposed new regulations in 2010 for the set-aside program for WOSBs, aiming to comply with equal protection standards. Comments on earlier proposed rules indicated that the disparity study analysis conducted is sufficient to satisfy the intermediate scrutiny standard for the WOSB Program. Congress limited the WOSB Program to industries where women are underrepresented. Potential constitutional challenges may focus on the disparity studies underlying the determinations of eligible industries. Several lower federal courts have addressed the issue of congressional authority to fashion affirmative action remedies since Adarand. Courts generally find a compelling interest for the program in question but differ on whether states or localities must independently justify the use of racial preferences. The Supreme Court declined to revisit unsettled issues in 2004, upholding the DBE program in the Sherbrooke case. The Sherbrooke court upheld the DBE program under DOT regulations in Nebraska and Minnesota, where white-owned contractors were passed over for minority competitors in federally-funded contracts. Challenges of unconstitutional race discrimination were rejected by federal district courts, with the program subject to strict scrutiny for using race-based criteria. The DBE program is subject to strict scrutiny as it uses race-based criteria to define beneficiaries and implements race-conscious remedial measures. The federal government has a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination in government contracting markets. Petitioners argued that there is no hard evidence of intentional discrimination in the contracting industry. The Eighth Circuit upheld the need for race-conscious measures in federal highway contracting, stating that evidence of discrimination justifies remedial action. States must tailor national programs to areas where such measures are necessary. The current DOT program requires using race-neutral methods unless they are insufficient to achieve the goal. The Eighth Circuit upheld the need for race-conscious measures in federal highway contracting, stating that evidence of discrimination justifies remedial action. States must tailor national programs to areas where such measures are necessary. The DOT program requires using race-neutral methods unless they are insufficient to achieve the goal, with racial preferences limited to instances of egregious discrimination. Minnesota and Nebraska's DBE programs were found to be narrowly tailored, with goals tied to labor markets and subject to waivers and exemptions. The issue in Western States Paving Co., Inc. v. Washington State Department of Transportation is whether TEA-21 allocates 10% of federal transportation funds for small businesses. The Ninth Circuit panel upheld the constitutionality of TEA-21, which allocates federal transportation funds for small disadvantaged and minority contractors to address discrimination in the transportation construction industry. The program provides race and sex preferences to ensure fair distribution of funding and combat the effects of discrimination. The court upheld the constitutionality of TEA-21, which aims to address discrimination in the transportation construction industry through race and sex preferences for small disadvantaged and minority contractors. The regulations prohibit quotas and require states to make good faith efforts to meet goals, with Congress regularly evaluating the need for the program. The 10% DBE goal is aspirational, with state goals based on individual circumstances. The Washington State DBE program was challenged for not being narrowly tailored to address discrimination in transportation infrastructure contracts. The court emphasized the need to show evidence of discrimination against minority groups to justify the program's implementation. The ruling in Rothe Development Corporation v. U.S. Department of Defense imposes a heavier burden on the federal government to establish a compelling governmental interest in minority contracting preferences. Rothe, a non-minority woman-owned business, challenged the constitutionality of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2323 after losing a DOD contract to a business owned by Korean-Americans. The challenge focused on the 1992 and 2006 reenactments of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2323. The challenged SDB program in Rothe incorporates the SBA definition of small disadvantaged business and establishes a 5% participation goal for such entities in DOD contracts. DOD may apply a price evaluation adjustment of up to 10% to give disadvantaged entrepreneurs a preference. The DOD program was ultimately held unconstitutional as applied due to insufficient statistical evidence. The Federal Circuit found DOD's SBD program unconstitutional on its face in 2006 due to lack of evidence supporting race-conscious remedies. The district court had previously deemed the program facially constitutional in 2002 based on statistical evidence of discrimination before Congress. The Federal Circuit found significant methodological flaws in six state and local disparity studies, leading to the conclusion that they did not provide a strong basis in evidence for nationwide, race-conscious action. These flaws included failure to exclude unqualified businesses and not accounting for the capacity of minority-owned small businesses in government contracting. The Federal Circuit found methodological flaws in state and local disparity studies, leading to the conclusion that they did not provide a strong basis in evidence for a nationwide SDB program. Other statistical data and anecdotes were also deemed insufficient by the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit found methodological flaws in state and local disparity studies, concluding they did not provide strong evidence for a nationwide SDB program. Anecdotal evidence was discounted as insufficient to support 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2323, as it did not address instances of discrimination in DOD contracts. This lack of evidence of discrimination in DOD contracts was seen as significant by the Federal Circuit. The Rothe decision is significant as it governs future challenges to minority set-aside programs in bid protests related to federal procurements. It places a heavy evidentiary burden on Congress for race-conscious legislation. In Adarand, federal courts used to defer to congressional authority for race-conscious legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment, but this deference has decreased. Now, Congress must provide strong evidence of discrimination to support such measures. Courts have also examined challenges to the SBA's \u00a7 8(a) program for disadvantaged businesses, requiring proof of past discrimination before implementing race-based set-asides. Currently, legal challenges to race-based set-asides in the SBA's \u00a7 8(a) program and state/local affirmative action programs are pending in various courts, with some courts requiring specific evidence of past discrimination before implementing such measures. Federal circuit courts have addressed the legality of racial preferences in employment and public contracting programs following the Supreme Court's ruling in Croson, emphasizing the need to identify the effects of past discrimination. In Croson, the City of Richmond's 30% set-aside for minority subcontractors failed the constitutional test as it lacked specific evidence of past discrimination and did not show discrimination in all aspects of city contracting. The program compared minority contractor participation with general population statistics, rather than qualified minority business enterprises in the relevant market. Additionally, certain groups were granted a preference without evidence of discrimination. The Richmond plan's 30% quota for minority subcontractors was found to be too inflexible and lacked consideration of race-neutral alternatives. The waiver in the plan was criticized for being rigid and not addressing past discrimination. Following the Croson decision, many states and municipalities reevaluated their minority business enterprise programs, with some surviving legal challenges while others did not meet strict judicial scrutiny. After the Croson decision, local jurisdictions faced challenges in establishing evidence of minority exclusion in public contracting. Courts rejected disparity studies that relied on general population data and failed to tailor remedies to address disparities. The Richmond plan's inflexible 30% quota for minority subcontractors was criticized for not considering race-neutral alternatives or addressing past discrimination. The courts have yet to resolve important issues related to minority contracting initiatives, including the need for different fact-finding standards for state or local programs and whether independent findings are required to establish a \"compelling\" governmental interest. Circuit court decisions suggest that no independent findings may be needed if the state agency is acting pursuant to federal mandate to address discrimination. The federal mandate requires state or local action to counteract discrimination on federally funded projects. The compelling government interest is determined by the program's purpose and evidence, with a national scope. Congress or federal agencies must act with a strong basis in evidence to establish a compelling government interest nationwide. This evidence supports actions at the state and local levels. The Ninth Circuit reviewed challenges to state programs mandated by federal law in Western State Paving Co. v. Washington DOT. The court reviewed challenges to state programs mandated by federal law, specifically focusing on the 10% DBE set-aside of federal transportation funds under TEA-21. Washington must meet strict scrutiny to survive an as-applied challenge, showing that its program is narrowly tailored based on discrimination in the state's transportation contracting industry. Washington admitted to not conducting statistical studies to establish discrimination in the highway contracting industry. The court rejected estimates of minority contractor participation in state transportation contracting, stating that percentages alone did not prove discrimination against DBEs. Washington lacked anecdotal evidence of discrimination and needed to show that its program was narrowly tailored based on discrimination in the industry. In Northern Contracting Inc. v. State of Illinois, the Seventh Circuit upheld the state's DBE program, finding it narrowly tailored to address discrimination in highway contracting. The court considered the federal government's interest in remedying discrimination and concluded that the program was constitutional. In a different Seventh Circuit ruling in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. County of Cook, the court found that Cook County failed to establish a compelling interest for its contract set-aside program, despite presenting anecdotal and statistical evidence of prime contractors not soliciting minority- and women-owned subcontractors. The appeals court affirmed the decision, noting the lack of systematic evidence supporting the program. The appeals court affirmed a decision regarding a program's set-aside levels for minorities and women, stating that evidence of their availability in the market was lacking. This ruling could impact future challenges against state and federal affirmative action programs, requiring proof of discrimination on a state-by-state basis. The DOT has issued guidance on the effects of this decision in the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is deciding on recipients for minority set-asides and preferences. The Supreme Court's Shaw v. Hunt ruling requires strong evidence of discrimination before implementing affirmative action programs. The Tenth Circuit's Adarand III decision allows post-enactment evidence to be considered. The Tenth Circuit decision in Adarand III allowed consideration of post-enactment evidence in addition to congressional findings. The Supreme Court declined to address this issue in Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc. v. City and County of Denver, where a city ordinance aimed to promote participation by minority- and female-owned businesses in public work projects. The City of Denver established MBE and WBE participation goals on city contracts, with annual goals of 16% for MBEs and 12% for WBEs. The program was revised in 1996 and 1998, reducing the goals for construction contracts to 10% for MBEs and prohibiting self-performed work from counting towards the goals. Concrete Works of Colorado, a construction firm, sued the city in 1992 for allegedly being denied contracts for not meeting the goals. The City of Denver established MBE and WBE participation goals on city contracts. The city relied on evidence to demonstrate disparities in M/WBE availability and utilization. M/WBEs testified to discrimination they faced in various aspects of their work. The main issue was whether the government's evidence justified racial and gender preferences in public contracting. The circuit court took an expansive approach in its decision. The circuit court found that Denver's passive participation in marketplace discrimination by its spending practices was sufficient to show discriminatory exclusion in the local construction industry. Denver was not required to prove specific discriminatory practices or policies, nor demonstrate intent to disadvantage women or minorities. Imposing such a burden would undermine reliance on statistical studies and anecdotal evidence. Croson's caution against relying on societal discrimination did not apply in this case. The Tenth Circuit ruled that Denver did not need to prove specific discriminatory policies in the construction industry for its M/WBE program. The trial court's requirement for Denver to show such policies was deemed incorrect. Factors like firm size and specialization were considered important in assessing M/WBE capacity for city projects. The court accepted Denver's disparity studies despite some flaws, emphasizing the importance of statistical evidence over specific discriminatory practices. The Tenth Circuit accepted Denver's disparity studies for its M/WBE program, noting that small firms can adjust to bidding opportunities and that size and experience are not race or gender-neutral variables. Private barriers hindered M/WBE entry into the market, affecting fair competition for public contracts. The Tenth Circuit accepted Denver's disparity studies for its M/WBE program, noting that small firms can adjust to bidding opportunities and that size and experience are not race or gender-neutral variables. Competition for public contracts by minority firms that did submit bids was challenged in a Supreme Court appeal, with Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissenting from the Court's refusal to grant certiorari. They argued that Denver's policy violated the standards of proof required by the Court's 1989 decision in Croson. Justice Scalia criticized his fellow Justices for relying on \"good faith\" of local governments to use racial preferences in city contracting without a strong basis in evidence."
