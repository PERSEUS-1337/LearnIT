The EPA estimates that $271 billion will be needed over the next 20 years for wastewater treatment facilities to comply with the Clean Water Act. EPA is working on cost-effective approaches with states and cities to prioritize public health and environmental issues. Congressional interest in funding water infrastructure projects has led to legislative proposals. The report discusses recent EPA initiatives on integrated planning and financial capability assessment for CWA compliance. Local communities struggle to fund wastewater infrastructure improvements. EPA's approach allows municipalities to prioritize projects efficiently. Congressional interest in funding water infrastructure projects has increased due to the challenges faced by state and local governments. Since 1998, EPA has focused on enforcing CWA requirements to prevent raw sewage and contaminated stormwater discharges into the nation's waters. Many communities are under federal or state consent decrees to address uncontrolled discharges from combined sewer systems and separate sewer systems, involving significant investments and long construction time frames. EPA has been enforcing CWA requirements to prevent sewage and stormwater discharges for over a decade. Some communities are under enforcement schedules for infrastructure upgrades to maintain compliance. Municipalities have requested flexibility for costly wastewater and stormwater improvements. EPA issued a memorandum in 2011 supporting an integrated approach to address these challenges. The EPA issued a memorandum in 2011 supporting an integrated approach to wastewater and stormwater management, aiming to maximize infrastructure improvement dollars through coordination between permit and enforcement actions. This led to talks with municipal officials resulting in a 2012 framework policy for communities to pursue integrated planning, reducing compliance costs by considering all management obligations in an integrated fashion. The EPA's integrated approach to wastewater and stormwater management aims to prioritize water management goals and infrastructure projects based on affordability. This policy allows cities to modify consent decrees and discharge permits to meet CWA obligations within their financial capability while maintaining regulatory standards. Integrated plans must include six elements and prioritize environmental projects to protect public health and water quality. An integrated plan must include descriptions of water quality, human health, and regulatory issues, existing wastewater and stormwater systems, public participation, alternative compliance methods, performance evaluation, and project selection based on changing circumstances. EPA's reliance on administrative orders or consent decrees for pollution reduction plans has been a point of contention with local government stakeholders. The U.S. Conference of Mayors prefers EPA to authorize compliance flexibility through permits rather than consent decrees with penalties for noncompliance. EPA uses consent decrees after permit noncompliance, stating both enforcement and permits are necessary. The 2012 policy allows integrated plans to be incorporated into CWA discharge permits, including green infrastructure practices for stormwater management. The policy allows integrated plans to be incorporated into CWA discharge permits, providing sustainable solutions for municipal wet weather control. In 2012, EPA, the Department of Justice, and officials of the District of Columbia agreed to extend compliance deadlines in a consent decree to test green infrastructure technologies for sewer overflows. The 2012 agreement in DC allowed for potential changes to construction deadlines and projects to reduce CSO overflows through green infrastructure, comparing its effectiveness with constructed tunnels. EPA would consider reopening the consent decree based on the success of these measures. In 2012, EPA supported DC's research on green infrastructure to reduce rainwater runoff into sewers, potentially eliminating the need for planned tunnel projects. The 2005 consent decree was revised in May 2015, extending the compliance deadline to 2030. Some cities hoped to replicate the EPA-DC agreement, while environmental groups criticized the extension granted to DC for green infrastructure compliance. Some groups criticized EPA for granting DC additional compliance time for green infrastructure projects that could have been pursued earlier. Utilities and municipalities welcome flexibility under the integrated planning policy but seek clarification on various issues. Stakeholders believe clarification is needed on state and EPA roles in developing integrated plans. EPA states that cities should coordinate with state agencies, but some states are unsure of EPA's oversight role. EPA awarded grants to five communities in 2014 to develop integrated stormwater and wastewater plans. Some states and municipalities believe these plans are necessary as models. Several communities have already developed plans, with discussions ongoing with other cities to implement similar plans. Nearly five years after the framework policy for managing stormwater and wastewater was announced, integrated plans have only been included in new or amended consent decrees, not in CWA permits. Local governments are concerned about EPA's process for evaluating communities' affordability for water infrastructure improvements, which can impact schedules to meet CWA requirements. EPA relies on 1997 guidance to assess municipalities' financial capability for infrastructure upgrades. The EPA assesses financial capability by calculating wastewater and CSO control costs as a percentage of median household income. They use Residential and Financial Indicators to determine the impact on households and community's ability to afford compliance with CWA regulations. Many officials argue that the 2% of MHI measure is a minimum threshold for determining affordability. Several regions use the 2% of MHI measure as a minimum threshold for determining affordability issues in communities. Municipal officials have urged the EPA to consider a larger set of factors beyond MHI, such as average water rates as a percentage of income, future water rate increases, unemployment rate, poverty rate, and percentage of households receiving public assistance. They argue that affordability metrics should be tailored to each local government. Municipal officials recommend tailoring affordability metrics to each local government and urge EPA to consider a broader set of factors beyond median household income, such as water rates, future rate increases, unemployment, poverty, and public assistance. They suggest an integrated planning framework to assess financial capability for meeting Clean Water Act obligations. EPA is reluctant to revise existing guidance despite calls for a more comprehensive approach. EPA officials insist that current guidance provides flexibility for financially disadvantaged municipalities in implementing wastewater management controls. They argue that the 2% MHI metric is just one of many financial factors to consider, while municipal officials recommend a broader set of factors for assessing affordability. EPA is hesitant to revise the guidance despite calls for a more comprehensive approach. The EPA released a Financial Capability Assessment Framework in November 2014 to help communities assess their financial capability for wastewater management. The framework includes examples related to residential impacts and the financial strength of the community. EPA is open to further dialogue with cities and states to clarify guidelines on financial capability assessment. The Financial Capability Assessment Framework released by the EPA in 2014 helps communities evaluate their ability to fund clean water infrastructure projects, including drinking water needs estimated at $385 billion nationwide through 2031. This assessment considers factors like state or local financial limitations and obligations under the Safe Drinking Water Act, which can impact a city's bond rating. The framework aims to assist in developing integrated plans to meet Clean Water Act requirements. The EPA's Financial Capability Assessment Framework helps communities evaluate funding for water infrastructure projects to meet Clean Water Act requirements. Stakeholders seek flexibility and increased federal spending on local water projects. Regulators have discretion to provide extended time for compliance. Federal and state regulators have some discretion to extend compliance time but limited flexibility to change standards or provide extra funds. Legislators are interested in EPA's integrated planning process and community affordability as they relate to funding for water infrastructure projects. Recent legislation has addressed these issues, with some bills aiming to codify the 2012 framework into the Clean Water Act. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 465, the Water Quality Improvement Act of 2017, proposes to codify an integrated plan and permit approach into the Clean Water Act. It also includes provisions to update the 1997 CSO affordability guidance document and may alter the existing CWA framework by introducing a \"schedule of compliance\" for reasonable progress. In the 114th Congress, bills such as H.R. 1093 / S. 2358, H.R. 1705, S. 2768, and S. 2848 proposed measures to implement integrated stormwater/wastewater management programs, extend CWA discharge permit terms, and update CSO affordability guidance. These bills aimed to address compliance with regulatory requirements and improve water quality. In the 114th Congress, bills like H.R. 1705, S. 2768, and S. 2848 were passed by the Senate on September 15, 2016. Some communities support EPA's financial capability framework but also seek legislation to expand affordability criteria. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed EPA to conduct an independent study on community affordability. Congressional leaders requested funds for pilot projects to test EPA's integrated planning policy. The House Appropriations Committee requested $5 million in FY2015 appropriations for pilot projects to assist communities in developing integrated plans for managing clean water obligations. EPA awarded grants to five communities in October 2014 for this purpose. The Water Resources Subcommittee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held hearings on EPA's integrated planning policy and water infrastructure affordability. Witnesses urged for more regulatory flexibility and faster approval of integrated plans. The House Water Resources Subcommittee also held hearings on EPA's efforts to provide flexibility to communities in addressing wastewater and stormwater project needs. The House Water Resources Subcommittee held hearings on EPA's integrated planning policy and water infrastructure affordability. Witnesses addressed concerns with EPA's approach to determining a community's ability to afford water infrastructure projects. Local government stakeholders generally support EPA's efforts to encourage communities to prioritize investments in CWA infrastructure. Cities and states have continuing concerns with aspects of the integrated planning policy and financial capability assessment framework. EPA's 2014 Financial Capability Assessment Framework focuses on meeting CWA requirements. The 2012 integrated planning framework highlighted existing authority and opportunities within the CWA without providing new authority or flexibility. Legislative efforts to codify the framework into the CWA may be considered largely symbolic, but recent proposals aim to alter the CWA's existing framework to varying degrees, raising concerns. Recent proposals aim to alter the CWA's existing framework to varying degrees, raising concerns from environmental groups but receiving support from municipalities seeking flexibility."
