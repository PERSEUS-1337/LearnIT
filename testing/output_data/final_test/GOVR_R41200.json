    "content": "In December 2008, a military junta known as the CNDD took power in Guinea after President Lansana Cont\u00e9's death. Captain Moussa Dadis Camara became president, dissolved the constitution, and postponed elections. Civilian unrest grew due to Camara's erratic leadership, leading to a violent crackdown on protesters in September 2009, resulting in over 150 deaths and international condemnation. The military abuses in Guinea led to international condemnation. Dadis Camara was shot in the head and evacuated for medical treatment. In his absence, Brig. Gen. Sekouba Konat\u00e9 assumed the role of acting head of state, causing uncertainty over leadership and leading to rising ethnic tensions and instability within the armed forces. Following rising ethnic tensions and instability within the armed forces in Guinea, a new political agreement was announced on January 15, 2010. The Joint Declaration of Ouagadougou stated that Brig. Gen. Sekouba Konat\u00e9 would assume executive powers as \"Interim President\" and form a government of national unity. Key promises included the appointment of a prime minister from the Forces Vives coalition, the establishment of the National Transitional Council (CNT), and the organization of presidential elections within six months. The Joint Declaration of Ouagadougou announced Brig. Gen. Sekouba Konat\u00e9 as \"Interim President\" to form a government of national unity in Guinea. Konat\u00e9 and government members, CNDD, CNT, and defense forces barred from running as candidates. Dadis Camara's exit led to a political vacuum, with Camara expressing support for Konat\u00e9 but remaining in Burkina Faso for medical treatment. The constitution is suspended, but restrictions on political activities lifted. The 111th Congress closely monitored events in Guinea since the 2008 coup, focusing on human rights abuses, progress towards elections, U.S. assistance oversight, and potential regional destabilization. Recent legislation includes bills condemning violence and human rights abuses in Guinea. Key public figures in the government of national unity are Konat\u00e9, Dor\u00e9, and Diallo. Dor\u00e9 was named prime minister on January 19. Serah Diallo, a trade union leader, heads the National Transition Council (CNT) with 155 members from various groups. The CNT will revise electoral laws and the constitution. Dor\u00e9 appointed a 34-person cabinet in mid-February, with civilians and military officers. The Defense, Security, and Justice Ministries remain under CNDD leadership. Konat\u00e9 appointed a 23-member presidential cabinet of advisors. The trio of key leaders in the cabinet represents prominent ethno-regional groups and Guinea's two largest religious identities. Dor\u00e9 and Serah Diallo have roots in the opposition movement against former President Lansana Cont\u00e9 and little government experience. Serah Diallo led a trade union coalition that organized anti-Cont\u00e9 demonstrations in 2007, while Dor\u00e9 led a small opposition political party. Dor\u00e9, a key leader in the cabinet, was elected to the National Assembly but refused to take his seat in protest against electoral fraud. U.S. officials supported Konat\u00e9's leadership and expressed concerns about Dadis Camara's potential return to Guinea, stating it could destabilize the fragile political situation. Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair noted Guinea's instability but saw Dadis Camara's departure as an opportunity to defuse tensions. The State Department had previously backed a transitional government involving both military and civilian officials. The U.S. officials supported Konat\u00e9's leadership in Guinea, emphasizing the need for a civilian-led transition government leading to democratic elections. Major donors, the U.N. Secretary-General, and regional organizations welcomed the transitional government. The African Union, ECOWAS, neighboring countries, and the International Contact Group on Guinea have expressed support for the transitional government. France resumed bilateral cooperation programs, including military assistance, while the European Union maintained targeted sanctions and an arms embargo but removed four individuals from the sanctions list. The United States has also expressed support for the transitional government. The United States has expressed support for the transitional government in Guinea, but restrictions on some forms of U.S. assistance remain in place. Travel restrictions against certain CNDD members and Guinean officials also persist. Key issues for U.S. policy-makers include bilateral relations, progress towards elections, potential ICC investigation of CNDD human rights abuses, and support for security sector reform. U.S. relations with the unity government mark a significant shift from the previous government led by Dadis Camara, which the U.S. did not recognize and placed restrictions on aid and meetings with senior officials. The United States supports the transitional government in Guinea but maintains restrictions on bilateral aid and travel for certain CNDD members and officials. The State Department justifies its support for the unity government as an improvement from the previous junta. While most Guineans and international observers welcome the transitional government and plan for elections, critics argue that the government has yet to show political will for elections and there are concerns about potential delays in the timeline. Critics also note continuity between the CNDD and the unity government in terms of control over key ministries and security forces. The unity government in Guinea, led by the CNDD, has raised questions about Konat\u00e9's involvement in CNDD abuses. As a former commander of the elite airborne battalion, he was a key figure in the 2008 coup and a close advisor to Dadis Camara. Despite not being present during the September 2009 military crackdown, a UN commission recommended further investigation into his role. The US approach to the transitional government reflects a tension between seeking accountability for abuses and maintaining peace in the fragile state. The unity government includes individuals implicated in human rights violations, highlighting the challenges of transitional regimes. The unity government in Guinea includes individuals implicated in human rights violations, with little effort by the government to prosecute them. Two CNDD military officers accused of abuses hold ministerial positions, sparking calls for their removal. Removing or prosecuting such officials before elections could destabilize the country, according to some. The CNDD takeover in 2008 did not trigger legal restrictions on bilateral assistance, as the deposed government was not \"duly elected.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 imposed restrictions on aid to Guinea, including security assistance programs, after the 2008 coup. Military professionalism and maritime security capacity were affected, with a focus on human rights and civilian control of the military in the Expanded IMET program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 imposed restrictions on aid to Guinea, including security assistance programs, after the 2008 coup. Permitted aid includes Projet Faisons Ensemble, a $23 million USAID-funded project integrating local governance with development assistance. Over $5.5 million in electoral assistance is also provided for voter education, electoral materials, and training for various groups. Limited exceptions to security assistance restrictions may be considered due to positive developments. State Department notified Congress of intention to obligate up to $200,000 in FY2005 IMET funds for courses. The State Department notified Congress of its intention to obligate up to $200,000 in FY2005 IMET funds for courses on civil-military relations, military justice, human rights, and the rule of law. Some argue for further aid restrictions to be rolled back to assist the government in maintaining security and preparing for elections, while others believe restrictions should be maintained until free and fair elections are confirmed. Critics have raised concerns about vetting beneficiaries for potential human rights abuses. In response to military abuses in September 2009, the U.S. government imposed targeted travel restrictions on certain members of the military junta and government. The restrictions targeting individuals undermining democracy in Guinea are still in place, with debates on whether they should be lifted for certain CNDD leaders. Presidential elections are set for June 27, 2010, with donors confident in funding. However, factors may cause delays in the election timetable. Several factors could contribute to a delay in the election timetable in Guinea, including political will, capacity of the transitional government, disputes over voter lists, actions of potential spoilers, voter registration in neighboring countries, and logistics related to the rainy season. International Criminal Court prosecutors have also made announcements. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in Guinea following the violence of September 28, 2009. A U.N. commission of inquiry found that the crackdown may have constituted crimes against humanity, with potential legal responsibility for the Guinean state and individuals like Dadis Camara. The Obama Administration is considering ways to assist the ICC in investigations involving atrocities. The United States may provide assistance for security sector reform in Guinea, including training of police and military forces, military \"right-sizing,\" and electoral security preparations. U.S. officials have met with Guinean officials to discuss potential support for justice and security sector reform efforts. The United States has previously focused on training and equipping security forces in Guinea, but significant involvement in security sector reform is unlikely before elections. In 2002, the U.S. trained and equipped an 800-person \"Ranger\" battalion in response to cross-border attacks. In contrast, the U.S. has led efforts to rebuild and restructure the military in neighboring Liberia. The military in Guinea is being rebuilt and restructured after being dissolved in 2003. The army is seen as a cause of political instability due to its undisciplined nature. Military officers have been involved in coup attempts, mutinies, and human rights abuses, with little accountability. The armed forces are divided along ethnic, generational, and factional lines, which worsened under the CNDD regime. The military in Guinea, under the CNDD regime, is seen as a vehicle for corruption and patronage rather than national defense. Senior military figures have been involved in regional conflicts, looting, and narcotics trafficking. Military salaries are crucial for the impoverished population, but security forces have been escalating abuses, including looting, arrests, detentions, and torture. Abuses by security forces in Guinea have escalated, including looting, extrajudicial arrests, detentions, torture, extortion, and targeting of political opponents. While Konat\u00e9 is credited with improving military discipline, concerns remain about potential abuses. Calls for a truth and reconciliation process to address historical abuses have been unsuccessful, highlighting challenges in the security sector. Guinea's military lacks effective civilian control and faces issues of impunity and lack of discipline. Guinea's military has not been under effective civilian control for decades, with an opaque structure, size, and budget. The Defense Ministry, led by uniformed military officers, has retained aspects of military rule since former President Cont\u00e9's military coup in 1984. Attempts to make changes were met with violence, including a mutiny in May 2008. Guinea's military personnel number in the tens of thousands. Guinea's military is one of the region's largest despite a population of 10 million, with challenges such as \"ghost\" soldiers and irregular recruitment. Military salaries and benefits are a significant financial burden on the state, with an overreliance on the military for law enforcement due to insufficient police capacity. The roles and mandates of Guinea's security services are undefined, leading to confusion over who is responsible for crowd control, election security, and border security. The controversial \"Red Berets,\" who have been accused of human rights abuses, have had various roles under different administrations, with their current mandate and chain of command unclear. The CNDD oversaw recruitment and training of militias in 2009, including ex-combatants and foreign mercenaries. Konat\u00e9 closed militia training camps in January, but their whereabouts and cohesion are unclear, posing a security risk. Some militia trainees may join the military without formal disarmament or reintegration. Irregular recruitment by Guinean authorities in response to security threats lacks proper processes. Security sector reform should include judicial oversight. The judicial system in Guinea is corrupt and ineffective, with low capacity and widespread corruption. Political interference in the judiciary is common, leading to a lack of judicial independence. This has created a sense of vacuum among Guineans, leading to violence as a means of seeking justice. Military leaders under the CNDD have further marginalized the judiciary. Under the CNDD, military leaders sidelined the judiciary and encouraged vigilante justice in Guinea. Successful SSR may require deep structural reforms, downsizing security personnel, prosecuting human rights abusers, and bolstering military justice mechanisms. These reforms could be perceived as deeply political, creating winners and losers in the Guinean context. Guinea's SSR process may require long-term funding commitments and coordination from donors, as well as efforts to strengthen the justice sector and civilian oversight of the defense sector. The effectiveness of SSR in Guinea remains uncertain, and decisions on donor support may involve choosing between multilateral or bilateral assistance. The country's outlook has improved since early 2010 under the CNDD regime, which sidelined the judiciary and promoted vigilante justice. Successful SSR in Guinea may involve structural reforms, downsizing security forces, prosecuting human rights violators, and enhancing military justice mechanisms. Guinea's current outlook has improved significantly since early 2010, despite underlying causes of instability. Inter-ethnic relations have deteriorated under the CNDD regime, raising concerns for future elections. Factors like election delays, economic hardship, military divisions, and ethnic tensions could lead to renewed insecurity in the region."
