    "title": "AB 2464",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699 of the Labor Code is amended to allow aggrieved employees to bring civil actions for code violations instead of relying on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. \"Person\" and \"aggrieved employee\" are defined within the context of this amendment. The employer must \"cure\" violations by abating each alleged violation, being in compliance with statutes, and making aggrieved employees whole. Violations of wage statement requirements can only be cured by providing compliant statements for the past three years. Courts have the discretion to assess civil penalties for violations. In actions seeking civil penalties, courts may award a lesser amount if the maximum penalty would be unjust. If an employee suffered no harm, the court may dismiss the action. A civil penalty of $500 is established for violations when no employees are employed. If a violation occurs while employing one or more employees, the civil penalty is $100 per aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and $200 for subsequent violations. No civil penalty applies to failures to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency. An aggrieved employee can recover a civil penalty in a civil action filed on behalf of themselves and others for violations. Prevailing employees are entitled to attorney's fees and costs. No action can be brought for certain violations unless they involve mandatory reporting requirements. An aggrieved employee cannot bring an action under this section if the agency has already taken action for the same violation. Civil penalties recovered by employees are distributed with 75% going to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education, and 25% to the employees. Civil penalties recovered under subdivision (f) are distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education. The exclusive remedy for liability against an employer for employee injuries is through workers' compensation provisions. The superior court reviews and approves penalties in settlement agreements. The agency may create regulations to implement this part, excluding workers' compensation penalties."
