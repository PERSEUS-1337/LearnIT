Possible reasons for higher-priced loans include borrowers with weak credit histories facing higher costs, hidden or non-transparent mortgage costs, and potential discrimination leading to high-cost loans for minorities. Recent mortgage repayment problems may be due to borrowers obtaining expensive mortgage loans for various reasons, potentially reflecting predatory lending practices. Legislation such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Home Ownership Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) have been enacted to oversee lending practices in the mortgage market. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) of 1974 protects mortgage borrowers from excessive fees in real estate transactions by requiring standardized disclosures about settlement costs. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) assists in monitoring discriminatory practices in lending, implemented by the Federal Reserve Board through Regulation C. HMDA data is used for supervision and oversight. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires institutions to report home mortgage originations by various criteria to monitor fair lending practices. HMDA data is used by federal agencies like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for examinations of banks' lending practices. In 1989, Congress expanded HMDA to include race, sex, and borrower income for rejected and approved applicants. This allowed regulators to monitor denial rates by income, race, and gender. Lenders began charging higher interest rates to less creditworthy borrowers in the 1990s, leading to increased scrutiny by regulators on discrimination in lending practices. In 2002, Congress expanded HMDA to include rate-spread information, which compares the annual percentage rate (APR) of a loan to the rate on U.S. Treasury securities. The law requiring rate-spread information was implemented in 2004 to address concerns about discrimination in mortgage loan rates. HMDA reporting requirements apply to specific financial institutions based on asset size, housing-lending activity, and rate-spread thresholds. Loans not meeting these criteria are not reported. Home equity loans for non-home related purposes are also excluded. HMDA covers around 80% of national loans. The HMDA data covers approximately 80% of the national mortgage market but has limitations. Critics argue that it lacks variables like borrower credit history, which are essential to determine if pricing differences are due to financial risk or discrimination. Other useful variables include borrower characteristics and loan-to-value ratio. The HMDA data does not include all relevant information for lender risk assessment, as lenders are not required to report every variable used in lending decisions to protect borrower privacy. Federal regulator agencies can obtain loan data directly from financial institutions, making it unnecessary for all borrower information to be reported to HMDA. Procedures by FFIEC to evaluate discrimination in the prime market include reviewing bank loan files, loan prices, pricing models, and disparities. HMDA data is used to target institutions for closer examination, but not as the sole basis for enforcing anti-discrimination laws. The APR may not fully capture the complexity of non-traditional mortgage products, as it does not account for balloon payments, prepayment options, or adjustable interest rate terms. Closing costs vary by state, leading to persistent local differences. The APR measure may not provide accurate information on relative pricing due to substantial variations in loan products and terms. Changes in short-term rates compared to long-term rates, known as yield curve rotations, can impact loan reporting to HMDA. Mortgage loans are often priced based on rates reflecting the expected life-span of the loan, leading to a duration-matching issue in HMDA data. Regulation C previously required the rate-spread calculation for 30-year mortgage loans to use the 30-year Treasury yield as the benchmark rate. Changes in Treasury market interest rates can impact loan reporting to HMDA. Rate-spread calculations may increase, leading to more loans meeting HMDA thresholds. Duration mismatches between APR and benchmark rates could result in more 30-year fixed rate mortgages reported as HMDA rate-spread loans. Interest rate changes may also affect reporting of higher-priced lending, especially if the proportion of adjustable-rate mortgages increases. A flattening yield curve could cause rate-spreads on fixed rate mortgages and ARMs to be similar in size. The Federal Reserve has changed the benchmark rate used to calculate rate-spread for reporting HMDA loans. They propose using average mortgage rates from the PMMS conducted by Freddie Mac as benchmark rates. The reporting thresholds for first mortgage loans will be a spread of 1.5 percentage points or higher, and for second mortgage loans, it will be 3.5 percentage points or higher. This change is expected to align more closely with prime mortgage rates and address concerns about high-priced loans. The 1994 Home Ownership Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) amends the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA) of 1968, requiring lenders to disclose credit costs and terms before transactions. HOEPA adds disclosure rules for high-cost refinance and non-purchase loans secured by primary residences. HOEPA loans are closed-ended loans secured by principal residences with specific criteria for APR and fees. Borrowers must receive disclosures and have six days to decide on the transaction. Regulation C requires reporting of HOEPA loans in HMDA, and Regulation Z implements HOEPA requirements. Coverage for HOEPA loans has been extended since 2002. Since 2002, HOEPA coverage has been extended by lowering the price trigger from 10 to 8 percentage points above a comparable Treasury security. The Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation Z to apply HOEPA rules to all mortgage lenders, adding protections such as requiring verification of income and assets for determining repayment ability, limiting prepayment penalties for higher-cost loans, and mandating escrow accounts for property taxes and homeowners' insurance. The Federal Reserve has modified benchmark rates for HMDA and HOEPA loans, with HOEPA rate spreads now being more sensitive to Treasury yield curve movements. Loans meeting HOEPA thresholds may also meet HMDA thresholds, but the calculation methods for rate spreads are now separate. Congress would decide on any modifications to the benchmark rate for HOEPA loans. Mortgage insurance is required for borrowers with less than 20% downpayment or home equity. FHA is a program for first-time and less creditworthy borrowers, reimbursing lenders for losses. Premiums cover costs and losses, with upfront and annual charges. FHA can charge up to 3% upfront and 0.55% annually since 2008. The FHA has limited flexibility in collecting insurance fees, with upfront premiums being the bulk of the total mortgage insurance premium. This could lead to FHA loans being incorrectly identified as higher-priced loans under HMDA reporting requirements. Shifting to annual premium collections could reduce this risk and make refunds or premium reductions easier for FHA borrowers. Shifting to annual premium collections for FHA borrowers could make refunds or premium reductions easier and reduce financial burdens, especially for those planning to reside in their homes for a short period."
