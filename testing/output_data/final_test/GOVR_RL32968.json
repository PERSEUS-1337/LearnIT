    "content": "The Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) assesses state compliance with federal child welfare policies to ensure positive outcomes for children and families. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services completed the initial round of reviews in all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico by March 2004. Many states were found to have achieved safety, permanence, and well-being goals for the majority of cases reviewed. The initial round of Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSRs) found that no state's child welfare programs met the criteria for \"substantial conformity\" with federal policy requirements. All states are now implementing Program Improvement Plans (PIPs) to avoid financial penalties. The second round of CFSRs is being planned with 15 states. The second round of CFSRs is being planned with 15 states for an onsite review from March through September 2007. The report provides a history of the legislation leading to the current CFSR and explains how it is conducted. No state was found to be in substantial conformity with all federal policy aspects in the initial round. The report analyzes state performance on each indicator to understand compliance better. The report analyzes state performance on indicators to identify areas of non-compliance with federal policy. It also discusses penalties for non-compliance, Program Improvement Plans, criticisms of the initial CFSR assessment, and planning for the second round of reviews. (Tables in Appendices B and C provide detailed ratings for each state, while Appendix D presents case characteristics.) The 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act established federal protections for children in foster care, requiring states to provide written case plans and regular case reviews to receive full funding for Child Welfare Services. HHS conducted \"427 reviews\" to ensure states were meeting these requirements for all children in foster care. The 427 review process, established without formal regulations, was seen as arbitrary and focused on checking policies on paper rather than in practice. In 1994, Congress required HHS to develop a new outcome-focused review system for state child welfare programs, replacing the old process-driven reviews. The legislation also made former voluntary protections mandatory for all foster care children in all states. In 1994, P.L. 103-432 mandated a new outcome-focused review system for state child welfare programs, detailing criteria for compliance, penalties for noncompliance, and technical assistance for corrective action. HHS conducted pilot reviews and released final regulations in January 2000. The Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) was established by HHS following the Adoption and Safe Families Act in 1997. The review aims to ensure safety, permanency, and well-being for children and families in each state's child welfare program. States must meet seven specific outcomes and demonstrate operation of seven systems to conform with federal policy. A CFSR Procedures Manual outlines 45 performance indicators associated with these outcomes and systems for evaluation. HHS also issued policy guidance on six national standards to complement performance indicators. The Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) evaluates state child welfare programs based on specific outcomes and systems. States conduct self-assessments followed by onsite reviews by federal and state investigators to determine substantial conformity. This assessment includes reviewing services for children in foster care and those reported to the child welfare system. The state must analyze statewide program data and measure its performance against national standards. The assessment includes consultation with non-agency and community stakeholders. An onsite review follows, conducted by a team of federal and state members in three locations, reviewing a sample of cases and interviewing stakeholders with experience in child welfare programs. Stakeholders involved in assessing state conformity with federal child welfare policy include children, parents, foster parents, case workers, child welfare directors, judges, and other service providers. Qualitative and quantitative information is gathered to evaluate outcomes and systems in place. States are measured on achieving specific outcomes through case reviews and national standards. The outcomes of child welfare policy conformity are measured through case reviews and national standards. These outcomes include protecting children from abuse and neglect, maintaining them in their own homes when possible, providing permanence and stability, preserving family relationships, enhancing families' capacity to care for their children, meeting educational needs, and addressing physical and mental health needs. States must achieve desired outcomes in 90% of applicable cases reviewed during the initial round of reviews. Achieving these outcomes is determined through onsite case record reviews and interviews with involved individuals. In child welfare policy conformity, outcomes are measured through case reviews and national standards. States must achieve desired outcomes in 90% of applicable cases by meeting six national standards based on state administrative data. These standards include recurrence of maltreatment, incidence of maltreatment in foster care, stability of placements, and timely adoptions and reunifications. The state's compliance with national standards in child welfare policy is assessed through statewide administrative data analysis. Various system requirements such as information system, case review system, and staff training are evaluated to determine substantial conformity. New data measures have been developed for the second round of the review. The review process assesses state compliance with national standards in child welfare policy by rating system indicators as strengths or areas needing improvement. States must meet all indicators associated with a system to be in substantial conformity, with no more than one indicator below requirements. Performance indicators and goals are outlined in Table 3, showing that states performed best in safety during onsite case reviews and statewide data analysis. The analysis of statewide data revealed that states excelled in safety outcomes but struggled with permanency outcomes and had mixed results in well-being outcomes. States were successful in protecting children from abuse and neglect and ensuring educational services, but less successful in enhancing families' capacity and providing stability in children's living situations. Table 4 illustrates states' performance in achieving desired outcomes, with no state meeting all national standards. States were most successful in protecting children from maltreatment in foster care and ensuring low re-entry rates, but least successful in placement stability and timely adoptions. States must achieve substantial compliance with two key outcomes to protect children from abuse and neglect and ensure permanence and stability in their living arrangements. Only six states met these goals, with performance ranging from 62% to 100% in applicable cases. Nationally, there were close to 2,350 cases rated on this safety outcome. States must achieve substantial compliance with two key outcomes to protect children from abuse and neglect and ensure permanence and stability in their living arrangements. Twelve states met national standards for child abuse and neglect recurrence and child maltreatment in foster care. However, no state was found to be in conformity with the permanency outcome. Nationally, close to 1,500 cases were rated on this outcome, with state performance ranging from 7% to 100%. The share of cases in which states achieved desired outcomes ranged from 7% to 92%, with a median state performance of 51%. Statewide data was examined for various criteria related to children in foster care, but no state met all four standards. Over half of the states met the standard for foster care re-entries, while no standard was achieved by fewer than one in four states. No state substantially achieved the foster care re-entries outcome in 90% or more of its case review sample, resulting in no state achieving substantial conformity with this outcome. The range of performance on this outcome varied widely, with individual states achieving the outcome in a range from 18% to 86%. Nationally, over 2,500 cases were rated for this well-being outcome. The range of performance on the well-being outcome varied from 18% (NJ) to 86% (NY), with a median state performance of 66%. Only Delaware substantially achieved this outcome for 90% or more of its case review sample. Nationally, over 2,400 cases were rated for this outcome. Six states (AZ, IA, KS, NM, NY, UT) achieved the safety outcome in 90% or more of their case review sample, with a median state performance of 70%. The performance on achieving permanency outcome for children in foster care varied among states, with a range from 48% to 93%. Seven states were found to substantially achieve this outcome in 90% or more of their case review samples. Nationally, close to 1,500 cases were rated on this outcome. The well-being outcome was assessed in over 2,000 cases nationally, with state performance ranging from 65% to 100%. The median state performance was 83%. Ratings on specific performance indicators were used to identify areas of strength or improvement, although these did not impact the overall determination of state conformity with the outcome. The state final report discusses aggregate item ratings to understand a state's overall rating on outcomes. No state was found to be in substantial conformity with two outcomes: families enhancing capacity to care for children and foster care children having permanent living arrangements. State performance on indicators for stable living arrangements for foster care children was low. The state's final report highlighted the importance of stable living arrangements for foster care children, with a high percentage of states receiving strength ratings for keeping siblings together and placing children close to their birth parents or communities. The review assessed various indicators and state performance on federally required systems to achieve positive outcomes for children and families. Overall, state capacity in the child welfare system was assessed based on interviews with stakeholders. States were more likely to have the capacity to produce positive outcomes for children than to actually achieve these outcomes. Weaknesses were found in case review systems and service arrays, which are crucial for a successful child welfare program. Most states were responsive to the community, in compliance with federal requirements for information systems, and had adequate recruitment and licensing programs for foster and adoptive care. States were found to have adequate recruitment, retention, and licensing programs for foster and adoptive parents. However, a majority of states struggled with quality assurance systems and meeting federal staff training requirements. Compliance with federal child welfare policy system requirements varied, with less than half of states meeting service array and case review standards. Compliance was determined through stakeholder interviews and ratings. The findings show that service array and case review system are the main areas of weaknesses in state efforts to achieve positive outcomes for children. Compliance with these systems is determined by the number of indicators with a strength rating. Items related to service array and case review are more likely to need improvement compared to others. The majority of states received a strength rating for conducting periodic reviews of children in foster care, while fewer states received a strength rating for recruiting diverse foster and adoptive families. Compliance with case review systems and service array are areas needing improvement in state efforts for positive outcomes for children. The discussion focuses on indicators related to licensing, recruitment, and retention of foster care and adoptive parents. It examines outcomes where states were not in substantial conformity, particularly in achieving permanent and stable living arrangements for children in foster care. Reviewers found that 56% of cases achieved this outcome, 37% partially achieved it, and 7% did not achieve it at all. The CFSR assesses how well states assist children in achieving permanent and stable living arrangements. The CFSR evaluates states' performance in achieving permanent and stable living arrangements for children in foster care. Two states (DE and ND) achieved this outcome in 90% or more cases, but no state met all four national standards associated with it. Key indicators include re-entries into foster care, placement stability, timeliness of permanency goals, reunification, adoption, and use of the permanency goal \"another planned permanent living arrangement.\" States' success in achieving permanent living arrangements for children in foster care was evaluated through the CFSR. While some states were successful in limiting re-entries to foster care, they struggled with minimizing placements and setting timely permanency goals. Only a few states met the national standards for these indicators, highlighting areas for improvement in the foster care system. States' success in achieving permanent living arrangements for children in foster care was evaluated through the CFSR. Achieving timely adoption within 24 months of foster care entry was the most difficult goal for states to achieve, with only six states receiving a strength rating in this area. Reunification with a parent or caretaker within 12 months of entering foster care was met by 19 states, while 16 states received a strength rating for using the permanency goal of another planned permanent living arrangement. The case review system, outlined in Section 475 of the Social Security Act, is crucial for ensuring child protection and stable living arrangements. States had difficulty achieving strength ratings for implementing parts of the case review system at the case level. Only six states received a strength rating for developing written case plans jointly with parents. Less than half of the states received a strength rating for complying with termination of parental rights procedures. While most states held reviews of foster children every six months, only half achieved a strength rating for this. Only half of the states achieved a strength rating for ensuring timely court permanency hearings for children in foster care, and notifying caregivers of hearings. Common challenges were identified in meeting indicators for stable living arrangements. This analysis focused on 35 states reviewed from FY2002-FY2004. Common challenges were identified in meeting indicators for stable living arrangements in 35 states reviewed from FY2002-FY2004. Efforts for concurrent planning and timely family reunification were inconsistent, leading to placement instability and insufficient services for foster parents. Inconsistent access to services for parents was also noted as a challenge. Table 7 outlines challenges in achieving stable living arrangements for children in foster care. Performance indicators for this outcome were assessed through case reviews and comparison with national standards. Nationally, 55% of cases substantially achieved the goal of enhancing families' capacity to meet their child's needs, while 28% partially achieved it and 16% did not address it. In assessing how well states meet the goal of enhancing families' capacity to provide for their children's needs, the CFSR looks at four specific indicators. Only one state received a strength rating for assessing the needs of children and parents and providing necessary services. States did relatively better on the other three indicators, but no more than 12 states received a strength rating for any one of these indicators. In its content analysis of the final reports of all CFSRs conducted in FY2002-FY2004, HHS identified common challenges states had related to enhancing a family's capacity to provide for their children's needs. States reported insufficient involvement of parents in case planning, lack of face-to-face contacts with case workers, inconsistent assessments of needs, and inadequate provision of services. Federal child welfare policy requires states to have systems in place to improve family support. States must have systems in place to improve how child welfare agencies function, as required by federal policy. Analysis shows that states in substantial compliance with federal policy had better outcomes for children, including enhanced family capacity and stable living arrangements for foster children. States in compliance with federal policy had better outcomes for children, including enhanced family capacity and stable living arrangements. States with a quality assurance system in place saw higher percentages of families meeting their children's needs. Compliance with termination of parental rights proceedings under ASFA also led to positive outcomes. States in compliance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) had higher success in achieving permanent living arrangements for foster children. States with regular case reviews every 6 months showed improved family capacity to care for children. Compliance with 6-month case reviews and 12-month permanency hearings led to timely adoptions. The new review system requires HHS to determine financial penalties for states not in conformity with federal child welfare policy, with penalties withheld from specific child welfare funds. States can develop corrective action plans to rescind penalties. Penalties may range from 1% of the penalty pool for the state's initial review. The regulations specify penalties for states not in conformity with federal child welfare policy, ranging from 1% to 14% of the penalty pool. If a state fails to complete its Program Improvement Plan, funds will be withheld until goals are met or substantial conformity is achieved. HHS emphasized that the CFSR process focuses on program improvement, not recouping federal funds. Evaluation of PIP implementation in several states showed they met their goals with no penalties assessed. Concerns were raised about how \"substantial conformity\" was measured in the initial CFSR, questioning the accuracy of the assessment. Some researchers and state officials argue that accurate measures are necessary for penalty assessment and Program Improvement Plans (PIPs). Concerns raised about the CFSR include what is not measured and ensuring accountability for outcomes. National standards are used to judge state child welfare performance, affecting a state's rating on two of the seven outcomes. Meeting or not meeting national standards may have a relatively small impact. The ability to meet national standards is a small factor in achieving CFSR compliance. No state can be in complete conformity until all six national standards are met. Critiques of the standards have been raised, leading to revised national standards for the second round of the CFSR. Child welfare systems vary by state and county. The federal government defers to states on defining child abuse and neglect, leading to varying classifications of reports. Some argue that a national standard for preventing maltreatment in foster care could penalize states with broader definitions or efficient systems. Close to half of the states reviewed in FY2002-FY2004 indicated that child abuse and neglect allegations for families with open child welfare cases are not reported as new allegations, leading to potential discrepancies in data used to determine state compliance with national standards. The composition of a state's caseload may vary for reasons beyond the child welfare agency's control or due to state policy decisions. Some researchers suggest \"risk-adjusted\" standards, but more information is needed on demographic characteristics and outcomes. A review of the initial CFSR found that state performance on outcomes was not significantly affected by variations in case sample demographics. The study found that state performance on child welfare outcomes was generally unaffected by variations in case sample demographics, except for cases involving children under age six in foster care. States with a higher percentage of younger children in their sample had lower success rates in safely maintaining children in their homes. However, more significant relationships were found when analyzing the characteristics of individual children in cases. The accuracy and comparability of data used to determine compliance with national standards, collected via AFCARS, raise concerns about inconsistent reporting due to unclear definitions. States express worries about foster care placement definitions affecting child welfare performance measures. The March 2003 Inspector General report and April 2004 U.S. General Accounting Office report highlighted concerns about data inaccuracies in child welfare performance measures. Recommendations were made for HHS to provide precise definitions for data elements and improve accessibility of technical assistance. HHS is working on enhancing guidance, assessing state data collection systems, and seeking feedback on revisions to the AFCARS data collection system. National standards for the initial CFSR were based on data collected via AFCARS in the early years. Some researchers have concerns about data indicators used in national standards for child welfare performance measures. These indicators focus on reuniting children with their families in a timely manner and finding timely adoptive placements. However, supporters argue that using statewide data measured against a national standard is necessary for improving data collection and assessing state performance in multiple ways. Some researchers have concerns about national standards for child welfare performance measures, particularly regarding the use of data indicators. These indicators focus on reuniting children with their families in a timely manner and finding timely adoptive placements. Researchers argue that some measures may penalize states unfairly, as they only look at children who exit foster care in a given year. Some researchers argue that national standards for child welfare performance measures may unfairly penalize states by focusing only on children who exit foster care in a given year. They suggest an alternative measure that looks at all children in care, including those who are adopted within 24 months of entering care. This alternative measure would provide a more comprehensive view of the likelihood of a child being adopted or reunited. One alternative measure of time to reunification or adoption for children exiting foster care involves tracking a cohort of children who entered foster care in a given year. This measure requires longitudinal data, which AFCARS currently does not support. Another alternative is to group certain measures together, such as looking at the overall likelihood of adoptions in addition to timely adoption rates. Criticism of the national standard for foster care re-entry rates is also discussed. Criticism of the national standard for foster care re-entry rates focuses on how changes in a state's caseload size can impact state performance, regardless of actual permanency outcomes for children. The current measure looks at the percentage of children re-entering care within 12 months, leading to potential rating discrepancies. Alternative measures are suggested to address these issues. Some critics believe the national standard for foster care re-entry rates does not adequately measure outcomes, especially child and family well-being. Recommendations include studying appropriate measures and convening an advisory panel to review and update measures periodically. The federal policies currently in law regarding child welfare provisions are limited, focusing on accessibility of health and education records for foster children. There is a need to interpret these requirements to ensure children receive necessary services. Compliance with these regulations may be measured based on the process of record-keeping rather than the actual outcomes for the child. The concern of accountability in the child welfare system revolves around the availability of services and the timely handling of cases by the courts. It questions whether the lack of mental health services is a problem of the agency or a broader issue in the state. Compliance with termination of parental rights provisions may be hindered by court backlogs or delays in initiating proceedings by the child welfare agency. The child welfare agency is not starting proceedings in a timely manner. The second round of CFSRs is scheduled to begin in 2007 for 15 states. HHS has revised the national regulations for the onsite case review to find that the desired outcome was substantially achieved in 95% of cases. HHS has revised national standards for the second round of CFSRs, with states having 90 days to submit a Program Improvement Plan (PIP) after the Final Report. Approval of the PIP by HHS has no set timeframe, and states generally have two years to implement their PIP. Some states may receive approval for an additional year to complete their PIP, as seen with Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. As of September 2006, 42 states completed PIP implementation, with HHS evaluating success in 20 states. 19 states met PIP goals, leading to penalties being rescinded. The District of Columbia faced a fine for not meeting all improvements. Appendices detail state performance in initial CFSRs. Appendix C provides a summary of state performance on outcomes assessed in the Initial Child and Family Services Review. It includes detailed tables showing how many cases in each state achieved specific outcomes. Individual state performance on national standards is also shown for two outcomes. Outcome 1: Children are protected from abuse and neglect. Outcome 2: Children are maintained in their own homes when possible. Permanency Outcome 1: Children have stability in their living situation. Permanency Outcome 2: Family relationships for children are preserved. Well-Being Outcome 1: Families have enhanced capacity to meet their children's needs. Well-Being Outcome 2: Children receive services for their education needs. Well-Being Outcome 3: Children receive services for their health needs. Reviewers collected data on child characteristics for case ratings. The child's age was found to be significantly related to outcomes achieved in child welfare cases, with children under 6 more likely to achieve permanency and stability. Age was linked to placement stability and establishment of permanency goals. These findings were part of a study conducted by HHS and are available on the Children's Bureau website. The study found that permanency and stability are easier to achieve for younger children compared to adolescents. Placement stability and establishment of permanency goals were linked to the child's age, with children under 6 more likely to achieve these outcomes. Cases involving white (non-Hispanic) children were more likely to achieve permanency and stability. Cases involving children who are white (non-Hispanic) were more likely to achieve permanency and stability in their living situations compared to children of other races/ethnicities. Additionally, white (non-Hispanic) children were significantly more likely to receive adequate services for their physical and mental health needs. Children who were white (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), or of \"two or more races\" were also more likely to have families with enhanced capacity to meet their needs compared to children who are Alaska Native/Indian or Asian/Pacific Islander. The primary reason for case opening was related to a child's behavior. Cases opened primarily for issues related to a child's behavior were more likely to achieve permanency and stability compared to cases opened for other reasons. The location of the case review did not significantly impact the outcome ratings. In smaller population sites, families showed enhanced capacity to meet their children's needs and children received appropriate health services, unlike in larger population locations."
