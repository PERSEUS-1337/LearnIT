It introduces a credit for medical research related to developing vaccines against widespread diseases in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999\" introduces a 30 percent tax credit for qualified vaccine research expenses incurred by taxpayers in the taxable year. Qualified vaccine research expenses are defined as amounts paid or incurred that would be described in section 41 with specified modifications. The \"Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999\" offers a 30 percent tax credit for qualified vaccine research expenses. Vaccine research expenses exclude amounts funded by grants or contracts. Vaccine research refers to developing vaccines for diseases like malaria. The \"Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999\" provides a 30 percent tax credit for qualified vaccine research expenses related to developing vaccines for diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, or any infectious disease causing over 1,000,000 human deaths annually. Qualified expenses are excluded from determining the research credit allowable under section 41. The tax credit for vaccine research expenses is subject to limitations on foreign testing and certain rules applicable to base period research expenses. Taxpayers must elect to apply this section for each taxable year. The vaccine research credit under section 38 includes 20 percent of the amount paid for qualified research stock in a corporation if the funds are used for qualified vaccine research expenses within 18 months. The corporation must waive its right to the credit for the qualified expenses. The Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999 defines qualified research stock as stock in a C corporation issued after the enactment date, acquired by the taxpayer at its original issue in exchange for money or property, and meeting gross assets tests. This stock can be used to claim a credit for qualified vaccine research expenses. The Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999 allows for a vaccine research credit under section 45D, which cannot be carried back to years before the enactment of section 45D. The Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999 introduces a credit for qualified vaccine research expenses under section 45D, denying a double benefit by disallowing a deduction equal to the credit amount. Rules similar to section 280C apply for this deduction. The Code is amended to include a new paragraph (9) regarding the vaccine research credit under section 45D(a). A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date. Congress suggests that corporations receiving the vaccine research credit should establish plans to maximize international access to vaccines developed using the credit. The Institute of Medicine will study the effectiveness of a tax credit in stimulating vaccine research and submit the results to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment. This study aims to improve the credit's effectiveness in promoting vaccine research. Sense of Congress is for the President and Federal agencies to support the creation of a fund to accelerate vaccine introduction in poor countries. Flexible pricing for vaccines is seen as a valid strategy to speed up vaccine distribution in developing nations."
