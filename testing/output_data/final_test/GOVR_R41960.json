    "content": "The federal government consumed 57.4 million megawatt-hours of electricity in FY2007, with the Department of Defense accounting for over half of that amount. The federal Power Marketing Administrations generate over 127 million megawatt-hours of hydropower annually. EPAct 2005 mandated federal agencies to increase renewable energy purchases to 7.5% of overall energy purchases by 2013. Federal agencies aim to meet the 7.5% renewable energy goal through wind and solar power purchases, equivalent to 4.3 million megawatt-hours. They can receive double credit for on-site renewable energy generation. Solar photovoltaic power is favored for DOD facilities due to radar interference issues with wind turbines. The General Services Administration can enter utility service contracts up to 10 years for federal agencies, with DOD having authority for up to 30 years on military bases. Other laws allow federal agencies to utilize privately generated power. Federal agencies are required to purchase at least half of their annual renewable energy from new sources, with a preference for on-site projects. Executive Order 13423 mandates this, allowing agencies to use non-electric renewable energy sources as well. Additionally, Public Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) can assist federal facilities in meeting their renewable energy goals. Federal agencies are directed to establish greenhouse gas reduction targets and increase renewable energy use through Executive Order 13514. They encounter options and barriers in contracting with small renewable power generators, who require longer contract terms to attract investors. The typical utility agreement guarantees firm uninterruptible power through various generators and power purchase agreements. The report summarizes statutes and regulations allowing federal agencies like GSA and DOD to contract for electric utility services and purchase renewable electricity. It also discusses the potential role of PMAs in meeting renewable energy goals. The renewable energy industry is a separate topic covered in another report. The report discusses energy purchasing authorities for federal agencies under various statutes and regulations, including multiyear contracts for acquiring goods and services. The term \"acquisition\" refers to using appropriated funds to contract for property or services that support agency missions. The procurement process involves steps agencies take to acquire property or services, including sole-sourcing energy service improvements and entering into multi-year contracts. These contracts can span up to five program years and may be contingent upon the appropriation of funds. If Congress does not appropriate funds, federal agencies must cancel contracts. Agencies must follow the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) System. GSA has authority to enter into utility service contracts for up to 10 years. Services include electricity, natural gas, water, and more. Agencies pay for services with operation and maintenance funds. The GSA has delegated authority to DOD to enter utility service contracts for up to 10 years. The Secretary of Defense can exempt DOD from GSA actions for national defense. Utility service agreements provide public utility services to rate-paying customers. These agreements traditionally involve federal facilities or military installations contracting with local utilities for services like electric power, natural gas, water, and sewer. The contracts can be extended up to 10 years if the government gets better rates or terms, or if certain charges are reduced or eliminated. The federal government can have reduction or elimination of connection charges and termination liabilities in utility service contracts. Area-wide contracts provide public utility services on an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity basis within a utility's regulated service area. These contracts allow federal agencies to order utility services at approved rates published in a tariff schedule. Federal agencies can delegate authority for utility services negotiation to GSA, DOD, and DOE. They can also participate in programs funded through O&M accounts to reduce energy demands and install renewable energy projects. Demand response and load management programs are utility incentive programs where companies offer incentives to customers for reducing energy demand during peak periods. This helps improve system reliability and reduce the need for new generation facilities. Customers can use energy conservation and efficiency techniques, including installing backup generators or fuel cells. Federal agencies can participate in these programs through utility energy service contracts. Energy service contracts (UESCs) allow federal agencies to make energy and water improvements at their facilities without upfront costs. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act authorizes agencies to enter multi-year contracts with energy service providers to implement energy savings measures in exchange for a share of the resulting savings. Energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) enable federal agencies to install energy efficiency improvements with no upfront capital expenditure. The agency pays an energy service company (ESCO) through its annually appropriated budget for operation and maintenance, covering utility costs. ESPCs must meet three statutory funding limitations to ensure the contractor incurs total costs, agency payments do not exceed utility expenses, and funds come from appropriated sources. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) considers ESPCs as creating future financial obligations for the federal government, scored as mandatory spending after the expiration of the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act pay-as-you-go rules. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggests that upfront funding could achieve the benefits of ESPCs with lower financing costs, but agencies often lack sufficient funds upfront. ESPCs are seen as a necessary supplement to upfront funding to achieve energy savings benefits. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits ESPC contract periods of less than 25 years. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) established federal policy prohibiting ESPC contract periods of less than 25 years. EISA also authorized federal agencies to combine appropriated funds with ESCO private financing for ESPCs' improvements. DOD has the unique authority to enter into contracts for up to 30 years for services that provide and operate energy production facilities on military installations. The Defense Logistics Agency (Energy) is the executive agent for purchasing fuel and electricity for DOD and offers assistance in purchasing renewable energy. Many military bases relied on their own power plants in the past, but DOD began selling them off in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, DOD began selling off their power plants and now offers underutilized land for privately financed renewable energy projects. Developers install renewable energy systems on agency property, with DOD purchasing the power generated through a contract. The developer owns, operates, and maintains the system, with contract terms determining energy prices and buyback options. This arrangement benefits all parties involved. The DOD benefits from reduced power costs through renewable energy projects on underutilized land, with developers gaining revenue and tax benefits. The local utility also benefits by avoiding new generating capacity costs, ultimately benefiting taxpayers through decreased energy budgets. DOD's authority allows for multiyear contracts and leases for military lands to promote national security or public interest. The DOD can enter into leases for underutilized land for up to five years based on fair market value. The leaseback cannot exceed $500,000 annually and may include in-kind considerations like maintenance, construction, or utility services. Military installations have implemented energy projects to offset costs, such as Nellis Air Force Base's solar array. Nellis Air Force Base in NV hosts a 14-megawatt solar array providing 25% of its electricity needs. SunPower Corporation operates the array on 140 acres of land leased from Nellis. The contract allows termination with one-year notice and saves Nellis $1 million annually compared to local utility rates. The solar array at Nellis Air Force Base in NV transmits power through Nevada's distribution system for safety reasons. Nellis cannot claim RECs for the renewable power purchase as SunPower owns them. SunPower benefits from investment tax credits and has the right to sell the RECs to Nevada Energy. The Nellis array is a unique project due to the incentives offered for privately financing its construction. Nevada has a renewable portfolio standard requiring Nevada Energy to use eligible renewable energy resources to supply a minimum percentage of electricity sold. The DOD increased the geothermal energy requirement to 25% by 2025 under authority granted by 10 U.S.C. 2917. The Coso Geothermal Field on the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, hosts four power generators operated by the China Lake Joint Venture. Southern California Edison must buy the power under the 1978 PURPA. The Coso Geothermal Field at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake generates over 270 megawatts of electricity sold to the local grid. Since 1987, it has produced 26 million megawatt-hours of electricity, generating $14.7 million annually for the Navy. The China Lake Joint Venture receives revenue from royalty payments, electricity bill payments, and bonus payments for conserving electricity. Total revenue from electricity sales amounts to about $2.3 billion. The power plant operator at China Lake received $2.3 billion from electricity sales between 1987 and 2003, paying about $249 million to the Navy. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 established special rate and regulatory treatment for qualifying facilities generating less than 80 megawatts using renewable sources. Utilities were required to buy power from these facilities at the utility's \"avoided cost\" through power purchase agreements. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created a new class of wholesale generators exempt from regulation under the Public Utility Holding Act of 1935, allowing them to sell electricity to the wholesale market. In 1995, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 888 allowing open access to the electrical transmission system for independent power producers. The DOE Federal Energy Management Program describes a power purchase agreement differently than the PURPA-inferred definition. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) provides guidance on federal laws and regulations for energy managers. Developers install renewable energy systems on agency properties, with the agency purchasing the power generated through monthly payments. FEMP assists in writing agreements with developers, while state laws vary on allowing small generators to sell power purchase agreements. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) provides guidance on federal laws and regulations for energy managers. States are more likely to permit the use of power purchase agreements for renewable generated power when the purchaser is a utility. The utility is responsible for providing firm uninterrupted power to its customers, and may need to bring \"peaking\" power plants online to make up for power losses from variable and intermittent wind- and solar-generated power. DOD can directly utilize underutilized lands for renewable energy projects, while other federal agencies may benefit from indirect opportunities through federal Power Marketing Administrations. Federal power marketing originated from early 20th-century federal water reclamation and flood control projects to recoup construction costs by selling hydro-generated power at wholesale rates to regional consumers. The Depression-era Rural Electrification Administration provided subsidized loans for electrical supply infrastructure in rural regions for economic development. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 transferred federal power marketing administration functions to DOE from the Department of the Interior. This included power marketing activities authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1944 and functions of various power administrations. The Alaska Power Administration was privatized in 1996 but is still considered a PMA. The Bonneville Power Administration is authorized to use its revenues to finance operations and maintenance. The four federal PMAs market and distribute hydropower produced by federal dams to 60 million. The Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation operate dams and projects that provide power to 60 million people in 34 states. The PMAs have a combined generating capacity of 34,305 megawatts and give preference in power sales to publicly owned and cooperatively owned utilities. FERC may require physical connection of power facilities with PMAs. The 2005 Energy Policy Act directed a study on combining wind energy with hydropower, and the Western Area Power Authority has the authority to supply. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in Portland, OR markets wholesale electrical power generated by federal hydroelectric projects. BPA supplies about one-third of the electric energy in the region. Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in Portland, OR supplies one-third of the electric power in the Northwest region, operating most of the high-voltage transmission lines. BPA integrates wind energy capacity into its system, aiming for 6,000 megawatts by 2013. However, excess hydroelectric power during near-flood conditions led to a temporary cut in wind-generated power. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in Portland, OR integrates wind energy capacity into its system, aiming for 6,000 megawatts by 2013. Excess hydroelectric power during near-flood conditions led to a temporary cut in wind-generated power. The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) markets electric power generated at reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a 10-state region in the southeast and mid-Atlantic region of the United States. SEPA does not own transmission facilities and must contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the generated power. The Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) markets hydroelectric power from 24 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dams with a total capacity of 2,174 megawatts. SWPA sells power primarily to public entities like rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities, serving over 8 million customers. In FY2008, SWPA reported gross power sales of 7.4 million megawatt-hours. (WAPA) markets hydroelectric power within a 15-state region in the central and western United States. Its transmission system carries electricity from 55 hydropower plants with a combined capacity of 10,600 megawatts. WAPA reported gross energy sales of 37.3 million megawatt-hours in FY2010, with 3% going to federal agencies. The Renewable Resources for Federal Agencies (RRFA) program helps federal agencies in the region meet renewable energy goals by coordinating the purchase of renewable energy with a streamlined process. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) issues a \"request for proposal\" for renewable energy products that federal agencies pay for at cost plus administrative fees. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created by Congress in 1933 to improve the Tennessee River's navigability and provide flood control. TVA finances its programs through power sales and bond sales, with a change in governance structure in 2005. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) oversees energy efficiency in federal agencies. The 2005 Energy Policy Act and 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act mandated energy savings measures in government operations to reduce electricity consumption and improve energy efficiency. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) oversees energy efficiency in federal agencies, with measures including energy upgrades to the Capitol complex and federal procurement of energy efficient products and renewable fuels. Federal agencies can utilize private financing through ESPCs and UESCs for energy efficiency improvements without increasing their budgets, sharing in the savings from reduced energy costs. New authority allows combining appropriated funds with ESPCs for further improvements, but implementation is delayed due to a lack of federal regulations. Agencies have met past goals for renewable-generated electricity by purchasing RECs without the associated power, which can be sold separately by renewable energy generators. In 2008, federal agencies relied on RECs to meet EPAct goals instead of site-generated renewable energy. The DOE Renewable Energy Working Group provided guidance for agencies to comply with EPAct goals by consuming renewable energy, not just producing it on federal sites. Purchasing RECs allows agencies to offset their energy use with renewable energy generated elsewhere. After 2012, federal agencies can no longer count RECs towards EPAct energy-intensity reduction goals. They must directly purchase renewable generated electricity to meet the goal. Hosting new renewable small generators on federal land for double credit may be hindered if not allowed to credit projects towards EPAct goals. Roof-top photovoltaic generation can meet double credit criteria through an ESPC. States with renewable portfolio standards play a significant role in wind power development. As of June 2011, 29 states and Washington, DC, had mandatory RPS programs, influencing wind power capacity exceeding 40,000 megawatts in the US. In 2010, U.S. wind capacity surpassed 40,000 megawatts, with new renewable capacity needs estimated at 100,000 megawatts by 2035. Solar photovoltaic power reached 1,100 megawatts in 2008, mostly from rooftop installations. DOD's solar projects focus on rooftop installations. New wind projects declined in 2010 due to limited investment capital and low energy demand. Utilities face reduced prices due to low natural gas and electricity prices. The wind industry faces challenges with reduced demand for power purchase agreements due to low natural gas and electricity prices. Building transmission lines for wind farms takes longer than constructing the farms themselves, hindering project expansion. To incentivize new renewable generators, offering long-term contracts with upfront funding is proposed. Multi-year contracts are limited to five years and contingent on annual appropriations. The agency must cancel contracts if they do not meet requirements. Contracts for public utility services have terms up to 10 years, while Energy Savings Performance Contracts must be at least 25 years. DOD can enter into 30-year contracts for facilities generating electricity on military sites. Long-term contracts with renewable energy generators face barriers due to PAYGO rules. Annual appropriations fund utility spending, while long-term commitments require separate fully authorized funding. PAYGO rules were established by the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act. The Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) established \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) rules, which require mandatory spending increases to be offset by cuts or increased revenues. The BEA also imposed limits on discretionary spending. Long-term contracts for renewable energy projects may create unfunded commitments if funded through annual appropriations. The DOE Renewable Energy Working Group encourages federal agencies to enter into contracts for 10 years or longer, but offers no guidance on obtaining upfront funding. The federal PMAs already market renewable power, including wind-generated power, at wholesale cost. Bonneville Power has integrated wind power and projects exceeding the EPAct renewable goal. PURPA allows small renewable generators to sell power to utilities, but costs may exceed avoided costs. Federal customers could request PMAs to purchase new renewable power through FERC. Federal customers can request a PMA to apply to FERC to purchase new renewable power and resell it through their local utility, offsetting the cost of interconnection. This could offer an alternative to upfront multi-year contracting for some federal agencies. Congress may need to consider expanding the role of federal PMAs as an alternative to direct contracting for federal agencies. Various federal statutes and regulations authorize federal agencies to enter into contracts for energy services. Options for a Federal Renewable Electricity Standard are outlined in several CRS reports by various authors. These reports cover topics such as green procurement, energy efficiency incentives, greenhouse gas reduction targets, sustainability, energy projects on federal lands, and offshore wind energy permitting. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on topics such as wind energy permitting, Department of Defense energy conservation policies, power marketing administrations, and federal procurement processes."
