    "content": "The Bush Administration's FY2007 budget request for Energy and Water Development totaled $29.45 billion, down from $36.73 billion in FY2006. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees approved their versions of the appropriations bill (H.R. 5427) in May and June, respectively. The Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved H.R. 5427 on June 27, and the full committee reported it out on June 29. The bill was not acted upon by the Senate in 2006. Energy and Water Development programs were funded for FY2007 in the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007. DOE submitted its \"operating plan\" to Congress on March 16, 2007, detailing funding for individual programs. The Energy and Water Development bill historically includes funding for various agencies and projects. In 2005, DOE programs were transferred to the Energy and Water Development bill. The Bush Administration requested $29.455 billion for FY2007, compared to $36.726 billion appropriated for FY2006. H.R. 5427 proposed $30.017 billion, while the Senate version allocated $31.238 billion. The Continuing Resolution (P.L. 110-5) provided $30.265 billion for Energy and Water Development programs. Budget totals for FY2000 to FY2006 and the requested amount for FY2007 are included in Table 2. For FY2007, the Administration requested $4.733 billion for the Corps of Engineers budget, a decrease from the previous year. The House-passed bill proposed $4.984 billion, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5.139 billion. Adjustments in accounts within the bill affect the total amount appropriated but are not included in individual title totals. Amounts are derived from various sources including the Administration's budget requests and congressional reports. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5.139 billion for the Department of the Interior (DOI) programs in the Energy and Water Development bill, while P.L. 110-5 appropriated $5.239 billion. The Administration requested $923.8 million for FY2007, a decrease from the previous year. The House bill proposed $941.0 million, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.0673 billion. P.L. 110-5 appropriated $1.011 billion for DOE programs, which included energy research, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs, among others. The FY2007 request for DOE programs was $24.075 billion, similar to the previous year's funding level. The House and Senate proposed different funding amounts for various energy programs in the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The final appropriation under P.L. 110-5 was $23.617 billion, with specific allocations for the Corps of Engineers and independent agencies. The FY2007 request for funding of independent agencies was $249 million, with the Senate recommending $306 million, and P.L. 110-5 appropriating $306 million. The appropriations for the Corps of Engineers in FY2007 were $5,340.2 million, close to the FY2006 amount. P.L. 110-5 removed specific project funding provisions, giving the Administration more flexibility in allocating funds. This change allowed for greater discretion in distributing money across Corps-authorized projects. The Corps of Engineers FY2007 work plan was based on FY2006 funding, with the Administration's budget request as the basis for project allocations. P.L. 110-5 did not address ongoing appropriations policy debates. The Corps' civil works program has been criticized for lacking focus, with a backlog estimated between $11 billion to over $50 billion. The Corps of Engineers has a backlog of authorized projects estimated between $11 billion to over $50 billion. Concerns about fiscal planning and management support performance-based criteria for budgeting and concentrated appropriations on priority projects, while some critics argue against simplistic criteria and a focus on 8 to 10 projects, stating it does not produce an integrated multiyear program. The Corps of Engineers faces criticism for not producing an integrated multiyear program and concentrating a disproportionate amount of the budget on priority projects, neglecting other cost-beneficial projects and regions. The agency's FY2007 workplan allocated $164 million for Everglades restoration activities, an increase from the previous year. The FY2007 work plan allocated $137 million for Corps Everglades restoration projects and $3 million for the Florida Keys Everglades Improvement project. The Corps received $400 million for hurricane protection in coastal Louisiana through FY2005 supplemental appropriations. Coastal wetlands restoration activities by the Corps have received less than $200 million of the enacted Katrina appropriations. The Department of the Interior requested funding changes for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and Bureau of Reclamation for FY2007, but final funding levels remained the same as FY2006. The Administration requested $40.2 million for the Central Utah Project, but funding remained at $34.0 million. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $833.6 million for FY2007, including a rescission of $88 million for the Desert Terminal Lakes. The FY2007 request for the Bureau of Reclamation included a rescission of $88 million for the Desert Terminal Lakes, resulting in a total funding of $849.8 million. This amount is $137.1 million less than enacted for FY2006. The Water and Related Resources Account, BOR's largest account, received $833.4 million for FY2007, which is $41.3 million less than FY2006. The total funding for Title II remained at $1.05 billion. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a funding level of $874.7 million for FY2007, which is $17 million more than the President's request for BOR programs. Water and Related Resources were recommended to be funded $15.7 million higher than the FY2007 request, and the California Bay-Delta Restoration project saw an increase of $1.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding BOR Title II programs at a level $109.8 million more than the President's request and $92.6 million more than the House recommendations. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a funding level of $874.7 million for FY2007 for BOR programs, $17 million more than the President's request. The Committee recommended Water and Related Resources be funded $55.6 million higher than the Administration's request, and $39.9 million more than the House provided. The Senate had no Desert Terminal lakes rescission in its recommendations, unlike the President's budget and House report. The final continuing resolution appropriated the same amounts as FY2006. Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water diversion projects in the West, while Army Corps of Engineers focuses on flood control and navigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) manages hundreds of dams and reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. BOR is the largest water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. BOR facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but face controversy over their impact on sensitive species and water conflicts. The Administration requested $38.6 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2007, with funds allocated for environmental water, storage, conveyance, science, and ecosystem programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding CALFED at $1.5 million above the budget request for science, water quality, ecosystem restoration, planning, and management. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding CALFED as requested by the Administration and $1.5 million less than the House. P.L. 110-5 provides the same as the FY2006 level, $36.6 million. The Administration requested $39.6 million for site security for FY2007, comparable to FY2006. The FY2007 funding for facility operations/security covers administration of security program, antiterrorism activities, and security upgrades. The request is $39.6 million, with guard and patrol costs estimated at $20.9 million, of which $18.9 million is reimbursable. The program budget for 2007 is $14.5 million, an increase of $9.5 million from FY2006, focusing on retrofitting and fortification. In 2007, the program plans to retrofit and modernize existing facilities for water conservation, with an increase in budget to $14.5 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding Water 2025 at the requested level. DOE's programs historically funded by the Energy and Water bill include research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The Energy and Water Development bill for FY2007 included funding for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics. The total request for Title III was $24.0748 billion, slightly more than the previous year. The House-passed bill allocated $24.3735 billion, while the Senate recommended $24.7251 billion. DOE administers various programs with different functions, including the Advanced Energy Initiative as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. The DOE's Advanced Energy Initiative (AEI) aims to reduce America's dependence on imported energy sources by supporting initiatives for hydrogen, biofuels, and solar energy. The FY2007 DOE request sought major funding increases for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell programs, Biomass, and Solar Energy programs. The request included $484.7 million for energy efficiency R&D and $359.2 million for renewable energy R&D. P.L. 110-5 set EERE funding at $1.47 billion, $311.6 million more than the FY2006 appropriation. The DOE FY2007 Operating Plan allocates $311.6 million across major EERE programs. Key increases include Facilities ($107.0 million), Biomass ($109.9 million), Solar Energy ($77.6 million), Hydrogen ($40.1 million), and Building Technologies ($36.1 million). Cuts are seen in Weatherization grants (-$38.0 million), Geothermal (-$17.8 million), and Small Hydro termination (-$0.5 million). The House Committee report directs EERE to manage uncosted balances better to avoid employee layoffs at NREL. The report directs EERE to improve management of uncosted balances, report on progress of implementing Inspector General's recommendations, fully fund a biomass R&D grant, recruit from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and prepare a report on solar water heaters by January 31, 2007. Funding for the Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) to support clean, energy-efficient technologies is also highlighted. The report directs DOE to submit a reprogramming request for FY2006 funds to support the Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) and a detailed budget justification for FY2007 funds. Other directives involve refocusing LDRD funds, updating five-year plans, and controlling budget reprogrammings. The Senate Committee recommends completing unfinished biorefinery awards, focusing on cellulosic ethanol, and implementing the cellulosic biomass production incentive in EPACT. The Committee recommends various actions related to renewable energy, including reports on solar water heaters and non-silicon materials, funding for a solar-hydrogen pilot plant, deployment of a solar thermal facility in New Mexico, identifying promising wind resource locations, and promoting renewable energy use through an interagency group. The DOE is encouraged to form an interagency group to promote renewable energy in federal agency operations, address wind energy project delays, provide funding for a 2 MW permanent magnet motor wind turbine, study advanced ocean energy techniques, assess locations for demonstration plants, study impacts of plug-in hybrids on electricity networks, and provide a strategy for fuel-switching. The FY2007 budget request for DOE included funding for various energy programs, such as zero energy buildings and nuclear energy research. The budget allocated $137.0 million for electricity delivery and energy reliability, with an increase in funding for nuclear energy research and the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. The goal was to accelerate the development of new technology for nuclear energy production. The House and Senate differed on funding for DOE's nuclear energy program in the FY2007 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. The House passed $572.8 million, below the Administration's request but above FY2006 levels. The Senate increased funding by $151.5 million to $784.2 million, including $279.0 million for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI). The DOE FY2007 operating plan provides $618.2 million for nuclear energy, with AFCI funding doubling to $167.5 million. Critics argue that DOE's nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The GNEP initiative aims to recycle plutonium from spent fuel to expand nuclear fuel supply and reduce radioactive waste. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to lease new fuel to nations that forgo uranium enrichment and spent fuel recycling to reduce nuclear waste. The leased fuel would be returned for reprocessing, with high-level waste sent back to the user nation. DOE issued a plan in 2006 for a Technology Demonstration Program to achieve GNEP's goals. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to develop technologies to achieve its goals, including the acceleration of AFCI. Critics oppose GNEP's focus on spent fuel reprocessing due to proliferation risks. President Bush mentioned \"clean, safe nuclear energy\" in 2006. President Bush's emphasis on \"clean, safe nuclear energy\" in his 2006 State of the Union address highlighted the Administration's support for new commercial reactors. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program, aimed at assisting utilities in seeking NRC approval for potential nuclear reactor sites, is helping three utilities in Illinois, Mississippi, and Virginia. This program will cover up to half of the industry's costs for regulatory approval, licensing, and plant design, with the goal of advancing advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program, supported by President Bush, aims to assist utilities in obtaining NRC approval for new nuclear reactor sites. Two industry consortia are receiving DOE assistance for designing and licensing new nuclear power plants. The program's funding has increased to $80.3 million, with a planned total assistance of about $550 million. Additionally, the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative focuses on advanced commercial reactor technologies. The FY2007 funding request for the nuclear energy program was reduced by 30% compared to FY2006, with the Senate Appropriations Committee voting to provide $48.0 million. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) funding would have dropped from $40 million to $23.4 million. The DOE operating plan allocated $35.6 million for Generation IV, focusing on advanced designs commercially available around 2020-2030. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes $1.25 billion through FY2015 for NGNP development based on Generation IV research. The FY2007 budget request for the nuclear energy program included the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) as the primary component of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). The $243 million budget for AFCI aimed to develop nuclear fuel cycles to reduce the hazard of spent nuclear fuel and recover additional energy by separating plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials for re-use in reactors or transmutation. The focus was on an engineering-scale demonstration of the UREX+ separations technology, with most of the funding allocated for this purpose. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the UREX+ process for removing uranium from spent fuel, citing the need for more research on waste byproducts before proceeding to the demonstration phase. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, viewed the AFCI program as crucial for reducing nuclear waste and increasing energy supplies, increasing funding by $36 million to a total of $167.5 million. The UREX+ process aims to remove uranium from spent nuclear fuel, reducing the volume of waste for disposal at Yucca Mountain. It also decreases heat generation by removing cesium and strontium for separate storage. Plutonium and other long-lived elements would be fissioned to reduce long-term hazards. The economic viability of waste processing is uncertain, and there is opposition on nonproliferation grounds. DOE requested $18.7 million in FY2007 for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative to support hydrogen-fueled vehicles. The DOE requested $18.7 million in FY2007 for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative, a 25% reduction from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee voted to increase funding to $31.7 million, while the DOE operating plan provides $19.3 million. The Bush Administration's FY2007 budget request for fossil energy research was 21% lower than the previous year, with major funding categories including Coal, Program Direction, and Fossil Energy Environmental. The FY2007 Fossil Energy R&D budget request focused on coal-related activities, with the House bill proposing $558.2 million and the Senate Appropriations Committee approving $644.3 million. P.L. 110-5 funded the programs at $592 million, maintaining the FY2006 level. The DOE proposed terminating the Natural Gas and Oil Technology programs for being ineffective. The Assessment Rating Tool review rated both Natural Gas and Oil Technology programs as ineffective. Congressional support for these programs has been higher than the Bush Administration's request in previous years. Funding for the programs in FY2006 was approved by Congress, with the House Committee deciding not to fund Natural Gas Technologies and reducing funding for Petroleum Technologies to $2.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $17 million for natural gas development from methane hydrates and $10 million for oil shale and tar sands technology R&D. The Administration requested $5 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) to be directed towards the next CCPI solicitation. The Administration's request for CCPI projects has been questioned by the Senate Appropriations Committee, who believe it is inconsistent with long-term energy development goals. CCPI is a cost-shared program for coal-based power generation technologies, with $500 million appropriated since FY2002. The Administration aims to spend $2 billion over 10 years on clean coal research. CCPI is similar to the CCTP, which is being phased out after completing most projects. The Administration requested to rescind $257 million from the Clean Coal Technology Program in FY2007 for FutureGen activities. FutureGen aims to demonstrate electricity and hydrogen production from coal without emissions. The House Appropriations Committee recommended rescinding the funding as it was deemed unnecessary for active projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed deferring $203 million and rescinding $50 million from the CCTP in FY2007. The Administration requested $54 million for gasification research, showing a commitment to IGCC technology. Funding for DOE's Carbon Sequestration program would increase to $73.9 million in FY2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported FutureGen and Carbon Sequestration programs with $90 million for Carbon Sequestration, $16 million more than the Administration's request. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) holds roughly 685 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) serves as an emergency source of crude oil for presidentially declared supply interruptions. A Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established during the Clinton Administration, housing 2 million barrels of heating oil. Recent program costs focus on maintaining SPR facilities. Funding for FY2007 remained at $164.4 million, with plans to maintain this spending level. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is the third-largest federal funder of basic research. For FY2007, DOE requested $4.102 billion for Science, reflecting the American Competitiveness Initiative. The House provided $4.132 billion, and the Senate committee recommended $4.241 billion. The Senate committee recommended $4.241 billion for the DOE Office of Science in FY2007, $139 million more than the request. The final appropriation was $3.796 billion. The largest program, basic energy sciences, received $1.421 billion, a 25% increase from FY2006. Fusion energy sciences requested $319 million, including $60 million for U.S. participation in the International Thermonuclear. The FY2007 budget included an 11% increase, with $60 million allocated for U.S. participation in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The total U.S. share of ITER's cost is estimated at $1.2 billion through FY2014. The House and conference appropriations reports directed DOE to fund ITER without reducing the domestic fusion program. The impact of ITER on the domestic program is expected to be an ongoing issue. The House and Senate committees recommended the requested amount for funding. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount for funding, with $12 million proposed to be moved to a new Science program in high energy-density science. The new program would receive a total of $80 million from various sources. Fusion energy sciences received the requested amount of $319 million in the March 2007 operating plan. Biological and environmental research received $510 million, a 12% decrease from FY2006 due to the termination of congressionally directed projects. In FY2006, projects totaling $130 million were funded, with additional funding allocated for directed projects in both the House and Senate proposals. The Senate proposed using the Energy Technology Commercialization Fund for nuclear medicine activities, expecting $25 million to be provided. The March 2007 operating plan allocated $483 million for biological and environmental research, with increases requested for the three remaining Office of Science research programs in FY2007. The FY2007 request included increases for various Office of Science research programs: $775 million for high-energy physics (up 8% from FY2006), $454 million for nuclear physics (up 24%), and $319 million for advanced scientific computing research (up 36%). The House provided the requested amount for all three programs, while the Senate committee recommended the same but reallocated some funds to a new program in high energy-density science. The Senate committee also expressed concerns about the long-term effects of funding. The Senate committee report expressed concern about the long-term effects of funding for the International Linear Collider project on other high-energy physics activities. The committee recommended an increase of $25 million in non-research funding for science workforce development, including support for graduate fellowships and training for math and science teachers. The March 2007 operating plan allocated $8 million for workforce development programs in public secondary schools, in line with the PACE-Energy Act and PACE-Education Act. The DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management is responsible for developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, with funding from two appropriations accounts totaling $544.5 million for FY2007. The FY2007 nuclear waste budget request was $544.5 million, $50 million higher than FY2006. The House approved the full request plus $30 million for interim storage site selection. The Senate voted to cut the request to $494.5 million due to delays in the Yucca Mountain program. The Committee directed DOE to reduce funding for transportation activities related to future waste disposal at Yucca Mountain and to not proceed with any procurement or construction activities at a planned waste canister handling facility. DOE announced changes to repository operational plans that would delay submission of a Yucca Mountain license application to NRC. The DOE announced a delay in submitting a Yucca Mountain license application to the NRC, leading to continued delays in opening the repository. A Senate panel proposed a provision to designate interim storage sites for spent nuclear fuel, but it was not enacted. The sites would have been federally owned or purchasable by the government and could not be in Nevada or Utah. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 designated Yucca Mountain as the national geologic repository for nuclear waste. DOE was required to start accepting waste by January 31, 1998, but failed to meet the deadline, leading to court decisions in favor of utilities seeking compensation for damages. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 designated Yucca Mountain as the national geologic repository for nuclear waste. Utilities have won cases in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for damages due to missed deadlines. Exelon Corporation settled a breach-of-contract with the federal government for $600 million. Delays in the Yucca Mountain program were caused by a court decision overturning EPA regulations. Controversy arose from e-mail messages from Yucca Mountain scientists. EPA proposed revised standards in August 2005. The House Appropriations Committee report cited problems with Yucca Mountain scientists' data and documentation, leading to the establishment of a DOE interim storage program. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program in 1994 to maintain the U.S. nuclear stockpile's safety and reliability. The program is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages the U.S. nuclear stockpile through stockpile stewardship activities, including Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. Stewardship activities primarily occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites. NNSA sets policy for the complex, with contractors operating the sites. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages the U.S. nuclear stockpile through stockpile stewardship activities at the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2007 request includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program. A task force recommended a Consolidated Nuclear Production Center for nuclear weapons components. The task force recommended consolidating uranium and plutonium at few sites, closing some current Complex sites, and not modernizing the current Complex. The House Appropriations Committee supported these recommendations with $100.0 million for planning a consolidated nuclear production site. The Senate Appropriations Committee and DOE Operating Plan did not allocate funds for this purpose. The FY2007 DSW request includes funding for various activities related to nuclear weapons in the stockpile, such as monitoring their condition, maintenance, R&D for specific warheads, dismantlement, and the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. This request supports life extension programs for three nuclear warheads and surveillance and maintenance for nine warhead types. It also includes funds for dismantlement of retired warheads, management, and technology work linked to multiple warhead types. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program received $9.0 million transferred from the Advanced Concepts Initiative for FY2006. NNSA requested $9.4 million for RRW to develop reliable replacement components for the existing stockpile without underground tests. Congress appropriated $25.0 million for FY2006, with subsequent funding requests of $27.7 million for FY2007 and projections for FY2008 to FY2011. The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program (RRW) aims to transition the nuclear weapons complex into a more efficient modern complex, phase out redundant Cold War warhead designs, increase warhead reliability, reduce the need for testing, and redirect funds to current warhead maintenance programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons. The program aims to stay within military requirements and design parameters validated by past nuclear tests, while also focusing on improving manufacturing practices, reducing costs, and increasing performance margins to support a reduction in stockpile size. Additionally, the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act set objectives for the RRW program to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in FY2007 to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. They also called for a peer review of RRW designs and analysis of the feasibility of designing and deploying a new warhead without nuclear testing. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in FY2007 to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. The committee called for the report to be submitted to Congress. The bill passed by the House left provisions unchanged, including reducing funding for warhead life extension programs and increasing funding for warhead dismantlement. The Senate Appropriations Committee strongly supported RRW, citing concerns about the sustainability of maintaining incremental modifications to existing warheads. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in FY2007 to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. It urged the NNSA to accelerate the transition to a responsive infrastructure and proceed expeditiously with the RRW design. The committee provided $62.7 million for RRW, an increase of $35.0 million from the budget request, and recommended reducing funds for warhead dismantlement to $35.0 million. DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan allocated $35.8 million for RRW, $264.4 million for Life Extension Programs, and $75.0 million for weapons dismantlement and disposition. The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) was a controversial program in the FY2004-FY2006 budget cycles, aiming to modify nuclear bombs to penetrate the ground before detonating. Funding for RNEP was deleted in FY2005 and FY2006, with no funds requested in FY2007. The program provided specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The FY2007 budget request included six Campaigns for the nuclear weapons stockpile, with goals such as improving warhead performance assessment without testing and maintaining scientific infrastructure. The proposal to build a Modern Pit Facility (MPF) was controversial due to the inability to manufacture certified pits since 1989. Los Alamos has a small-scale pit manufacturing facility. The FY2007 budget request included six Campaigns for the nuclear weapons stockpile, with goals such as improving warhead performance assessment without testing and maintaining scientific infrastructure. NNSA's plan for pit manufacturing capacity at TA-55 was seen as insufficient, leading to the controversial proposal to build a Modern Pit Facility (MPF). H.R. 2419, the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, eliminated MPF funds until capacity requirements and long-term strategy for the weapons complex were determined. Conferees directed NNSA to focus on improving manufacturing capability at TA-55. The NNSA was directed to focus on improving manufacturing capability at TA-55 instead of building the Modern Pit Facility (MPF). They requested $237.6 million for the Pit Manufacturing and Certification campaign for FY2007, with plans to increase capacity at TA-55. There was a dispute over the appropriate test readiness posture, with the Administration and Congress seeking to shorten it to 18 months. The FY2007 test readiness request was $14.8 million, with the Administration and Congress in dispute over the appropriate test readiness posture. The NNSA achieved a 24-month readiness posture in FY2005 and planned to maintain it through FY2011. The Engineering Campaign includes the Enhanced Surveillance Program (ESP) to develop predictive capabilities for early identification of stockpile aging concerns. Congress is interested in experiments to determine the service life of pits based on plutonium aging characteristics, impacting decisions on MPF and RRW. NNSA requested $96.2 million for ESP in FY2006, with appropriations at $99.2 million. FY2007 request was $86.5 million, with Senate recommending $103.2 million for advanced micro-engineering devices deployment. The FY2007 Operating Plan provided $87.5 million for the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and High Yield Campaign, aiming to develop laboratory capabilities for weapons-related research in extreme conditions. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the world's most powerful laser, is a key part of this campaign. NNSA plans to complete the NIF project by March 30, 2010. For FY2006, NNSA requested $141.9 million for NIF construction. The FY2006 request reduced funding for Weapons Activities by $3.0 billion and halted NIF construction to focus on stewardship. NNSA requested $451.2 million for the ICF and High Yield Campaign in FY2007, with $111.4 million for NIF construction. The Senate criticized NNSA's \"NIF-at-all-costs strategy\" and inability to balance ICF and high yield research programs. The Committee reallocated funding from NIF demonstration and Construction activities to ensure program balance, recommending $412.3 million for the campaign with $81.4 million for NIF construction. The FY2007 Operating Plan included $489.7 million for infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites. Operations of Facilities is the largest subprogram under RTBF, with $1,166.2 million appropriated for FY2006. The Program Readiness and Material Recycle and Recovery categories within RTBF received appropriations for FY2006 and FY2007. Construction funding for FY2006 was $259.9 million, with a request of $281.4 million for FY2007. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing RTBF by $27.0 million for FY2007. The committee recommended a reduction of $100.0 million for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos, stating that CMRR construction should be terminated. NNSA proposed a Consolidated Plutonium Production Center by 2022, making CMRR obsolete in eight years. The House made no changes to these provisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,780.8 million for RTBF, including $53.4 million for CMRR, stating the facility's importance in the plutonium mission at Los Alamos. Weapons Activities include programs like DSW, Campaigns, and RTBF, with Secure Transportation Asset funding for safe nuclear weapons transport. The FY2007 Operating Plan allocated $1,613.2 million for RTBF, with a total appropriation of $210.0 million for FY2006 and a request of $209.3 million for FY2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for Nuclear Weapons Incident Response and Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) in FY2007. The FY2006 appropriation for FIRP was $149.4 million, and the FY2007 request was $291.2 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the FY2007 request for the Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) by $145.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $283.2 million for FIRP to restore and revitalize the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure. The FY2007 Operating Plan included $169.4 million for Safeguards and Security to protect NNSA personnel and assets. The NNSA has a major concern for safeguards and security, with a focus on protecting personnel and assets from terrorist threats. Security costs have increased significantly for nuclear weapons sites due to the shift towards denying access to warheads. The FY2007 budget included a request for $754.4 million, with a recommendation from the House Appropriations Committee to increase it by $78.0 million for security upgrades. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $759.4 million for security upgrades, including $5.0 million for Sandia to conduct R&D on enhanced security measures. Nonproliferation and national security programs under the NNSA received $1.615 billion in FY2006, with a request for $1.726 billion in FY2007. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.593 billion for these programs in FY2007. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $318.78 million for FY2006, with a request for $268.89 million in FY2007. The Administration requested $268.89 million for FY2007 for Nonproliferation and International Security programs, including international safeguards and export controls. The House bill proposed $308.1 million, the Senate recommended $282.9 million, and DOE's Operating Plan funded it at $262.4 million. The programs also include International Materials Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) to reduce the threat of unsecured Russian weapons, receiving $128.9 million in the DOE Operating plan. The President's request for reducing the threat of unsecured Russian weapons and materials was $413.18 million for FY2007, slightly lower than the $422.73 million appropriated for FY2006. The House recommended $583.20 million, while the Senate recommended $427.2 million. P.L. 110-5 specified $472.7 million for MPC&A. The Russian Transition Initiative aimed at providing nonweapons employment for nuclear scientists received $39.6 million in FY2006. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for the program in FY2006 was $468.8 million, lower than the requested $653.1 million. The House Appropriations Committee reduced funding for the Savannah River facility due to delays in agreement with Russia. Total funding in H.R. 2419 was $301.7 million, while the Senate bill proposed funding at the requested level of $653.1 million for FY2007. The Administration requested $603.3 million for the Fissile Materials Disposition program in FY2007. The House Appropriations Committee proposed cutting funding to $248.0 million due to Russia's lack of participation in the MOX-light water reactor plan. The Senate supported the U.S. program to convert surplus weapons plutonium to MOX and continue construction at Savannah River. The Senate version of H.R. 5427 would fund the Fissile Materials Disposition program at $618.4 million, $15 million more than requested by the Administration. P.L. 110-5 specifies that funds for construction activities for Project 99-D-143 at Savannah River Site cannot be used until August 1, 2007. DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan allocates $470.1 million for Fissile Materials Disposition, including $262.5 million for Project 99-D-143. The adequacy of funding to address human health and environmental risks from past nuclear weapons production is a long-standing issue. The Department of Energy (DOE) is involved in cleaning up former nuclear weapons sites by disposing of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediating contaminated soil and groundwater, and decontaminating excess buildings. There are ongoing issues with risk-based cleanup approaches, waste treatment facility designs, and the safe disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The DOE administers cleanup and disposal at 114 sites in 30 states where wastes and contamination were generated. The Department of Energy (DOE) is facing challenges in cleaning up nuclear waste and contamination at former weapons sites. The Environmental Management program, the second largest function within DOE, requires significant resources. The FY2007 Operating Plan allocates $6.19 billion for this program, exceeding the President's initial request and congressional approvals. DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan allocates less funding for the Defense Environmental Cleanup program compared to FY2006, mainly due to completion of cleanup at certain sites like Rocky Flats in Colorado. Despite the overall decrease, over $100 million more is allocated for closure activities at Rocky Flats in FY2007. The FY2007 Operating Plan for DOE allocates varying funding for cleanup at sites like Hanford and Savannah River, with controversies surrounding funding adequacy for Hanford due to risks of radioactive contamination. The delayed construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford is a costly cleanup challenge due to engineering and design issues. DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan allocates more funding for the waste plant but less for managing waste in underground tanks. The 109th Congress and DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan allocated funding for the Environmental Management program to clean up nuclear waste sites. Congress is concerned about the long-term financial liability and debates on ensuring public health and safety. DOE has made progress in cleaning up sites but more work remains. DOE has made progress in cleaning up nuclear waste sites, but much work remains to be done, especially at larger and more complex sites like Hanford, Savannah River, and the Idaho National Laboratory. Cleanup and disposal of wastes are expected to be complete at Savannah River in 2031, at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2035, and at Hanford in 2042. Accurately assessing the time and funding needed for cleanup is challenging, especially for the larger, more complex sites. DOE periodically revises its estimates of outstanding costs to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes at complex sites. The $159 billion estimate for completing cleanup and waste disposal at remaining sites is reported in DOE's annual financial statements. The $159 billion estimate for completing cleanup and waste disposal at remaining sites is not adjusted for inflation and could exceed the estimate due to various factors such as stricter regulatory requirements and the long-term effectiveness of cleanup actions for nuclear waste sites. Additional funding may be needed at sites where initial cleanup proves inadequate. DOE's $159 billion estimate for cleanup and waste disposal at remaining sites may not include long-term care costs. An additional $18 billion is estimated for post-closure site responsibilities, including surveillance, monitoring, and maintenance of cleanup remedies over 75 years. Additional funding may be required for long-term site care beyond this timeframe. DOE expects long-term site care to be needed beyond 75 years, with costs beyond that timeframe being uncertain. Responsibility for site care is transferred to the Office of Legacy Management once cleanup is completed. Funding for the office in FY2007 is $64 million, less than previous years and the President's request. The President requested funding for FY2007 in February 2006, with the majority intended for pensions and post-retirement benefits related to cleanup sites. $20 million was allocated for long-term cleanup responsibilities at various sites. The impact of funding reduction on site responsibilities is unclear, but Rocky Flats received increased funding within the Environmental Management Program for FY2007. The funding for continued administration of closure sites, like Rocky Flats, was more than double the original proposal. The Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations were established in response to dam construction projects for water resource management, with excess power being marketed. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power to preference customers at low rates, covering expenses and repaying debt. There was a proposal to raise PMA rates to market rates in FY2006, but it was rejected by the House. No related legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress. The Administration's FY2007 request for the PMAs was $249.5 million, a 6.6% reduction from FY2006. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding as requested, with an allocation of $252.0 million. The House did not support proposals to recover O&M expenses or increase PMA rates to market-based rates. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the Administration's proposal to fund Corps hydropower O&M expenses through WAPA, SEPA, and SWPA revenues. The Agency Rate proposal was expected to have a minimal rate impact and generate $11.8 million in additional Treasury revenue from 2007 to 2011. BPA's borrowing authority was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003, with plans to use $305 million in FY2007. Beginning in FY2007, BPA proposed using secondary net revenues over $500 million to make advance amortization payments to the Treasury on BPA's bond obligations. However, P.L. 109-234, \u00a72308 prevents this use of BPA revenue. Other independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested a budget of $776.6 million for FY2007, including $8.1 million for the NRC inspector general's office, which was 4.5% higher than the FY2006 appropriation. NRC's activities involve safety regulation, licensing of nuclear reactors and waste facilities, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The NRC budget request for FY2007 included a $22 million increase in the Nuclear Reactor Safety program to handle anticipated new nuclear power plant license applications. Electric utilities have announced plans for more than a dozen reactor license applications due to higher fossil fuel prices and incentives provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee approved a further $40 million increase for reactor licensing, with $2 million designated for oversight of spent fuel recycling under GNEP. The continuing resolution provides $821.6 million for NRC in FY2007, including the inspector general's office. NRC's proposed budget also included a 10% reduction for licensing DOE's planned Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. The NRC's FY2007 budget request included a 10% reduction to $41.0 million for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. NRC's budget for homeland security activities decreased by 11% to $70.3 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for specific funding sources. The Waste Fund is allocated for waste repository licensing, generic homeland security, and DOE defense waste oversight, with a net appropriation limit of $154.2 million.
