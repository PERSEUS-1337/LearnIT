    "content": "Proposed global-to-local memory pointer (GLMP) networks for task-oriented dialogue to address challenges with incorporating large, dynamic knowledge bases. The model includes a global memory encoder and local memory decoder to share external knowledge, improving copy accuracy and mitigating out-of-vocabulary issues. Outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on bAbI Dialogue and Stanford Multi-domain Dialogue datasets. Task-oriented dialogue systems aim to achieve specific user goals such as restaurant reservation or navigation inquiry within a limited dialogue turns via natural language. End-to-end dialogue systems have shown promising results based on recurrent neural networks and memory networks, eliminating the need for hand-crafted labels and manual interpretation of knowledge bases. End-to-end dialogue systems struggle to effectively incorporate external knowledge bases into system responses due to the challenge of encoding and decoding dynamic knowledge bases. Pointer networks or copy mechanisms are essential for generating accurate responses by directly copying essential words from the input source. This is especially crucial in task-oriented dialogue systems where the information in the knowledge base is crucial for generating the expected entities in the response. The paper proposes the global-to-local memory pointer (GLMP) networks to address the challenge of incorporating external knowledge bases into system responses. Unlike existing approaches, GLMP leverages external knowledge to learn a global memory pointer and contextual representation, filtering unnecessary words for copying. The local memory decoder uses a sketch RNN to generate sketch responses before incorporating slot values. The global-to-local memory pointer (GLMP) networks utilize a sketch RNN to generate sketch responses and local memory pointers to copy words from external knowledge. GLMP achieves superior performance in out-of-vocabulary tasks and surpasses existing end-to-end approaches in dialogue datasets. The model consists of global memory encoder, external knowledge, and local memory decoder components. The GLMP networks utilize a global memory encoder, external knowledge, and local memory decoder. The global memory encoder encodes dialogue history using a context RNN and writes hidden states into external knowledge. During decoding, the local memory decoder generates sketch responses and uses the global memory pointer to copy text from external knowledge for the final system response. The external knowledge, integrated into the learning framework using end-to-end memory networks, includes global contextual representation shared between the encoder and decoder. Memory networks store word-level information for structural KB and dialogue history, enabling multiple hop reasoning and strengthening the copy mechanism. The KB memory module represents elements in a triplet format, while the dialogue context is stored in the dialogue memory. The dialogue context X is stored in the dialogue memory module with speaker and temporal encoding in a triplet format. Memory embeddings use a bag-of-word representation. External knowledge consists of trainable embedding matrices. Memory in the external knowledge is denoted as M = [B; X]. The external knowledge module uses memory M = [B; X] with triplet components. It reads memory using an initial query vector and loops over K hops to compute attention weights. The model reads memory using a soft memory attention mechanism and updates the query vector. A context RNN encodes the context X and writes hidden states into the external knowledge. The external knowledge module utilizes memory with triplet components and reads memory using an initial query vector. It loops over K hops to compute attention weights and updates the query vector. The context RNN encodes the context and writes hidden states into the external knowledge for sequential and contextualized information retrieval. The decoder uses a bi-directional GRU to encode dialogue history and KB information. The global memory pointer contains real values between 0 and 1, allowing for independent probabilities. Instead of Softmax, an inner product followed by Sigmoid is used for querying external knowledge. The global memory pointer G, obtained through an inner product and Sigmoid function, is passed to the decoder. An auxiliary loss is added to enhance global pointing ability, improving performance. The memory readout q K+1 serves as encoded KB information. The global memory pointer is trained using binary cross-entropy loss. The local memory decoder initializes with dialogue history, KB information, and global memory pointer. The local memory decoder initializes with dialogue history, KB information, and global memory pointer G. It generates a sketch response that excludes slot values but includes sketch tags. The hidden state of the sketch RNN is used to predict the next token and query external knowledge. If a sketch tag is generated, the global memory pointer is passed to external knowledge, otherwise, the output word is generated by the sketch RNN. The system output word is picked up from the local memory pointer. The sketch RNN is trained using cross-entropy loss and slot values in Y are replaced with sketch tags based on an entity table. The local memory pointer contains a sequence of pointers and the global memory pointer modifies the global contextual representation. The sketch RNN hidden state queries external knowledge using the memory attention in the last hop represented as the memory distribution at each time step. Training for the local memory pointer includes supervision on top of the last hop. The local memory pointer is trained with supervision on top of the last hop memory attention in external knowledge. The position label of the local memory pointer at decoding time step t is defined. A record is used to prevent copying the same entities multiple times. During decoding, if a memory position is pointed to, its corresponding position in the record is masked out. The parameters are jointly trained by minimizing three losses. The weighted-sum of three losses (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are hyper-parameters) is used in 3 experiments evaluating a model on two public multi-turn task-oriented dialogue datasets: bAbI dialogue BID0 and Stanford multi-domain dialogue (SMD). The bAbI dialogue consists of five tasks in the restaurant domain, while SMD includes three domains: calendar scheduling, weather information retrieval, and point-of-interest navigation. The key difference between the datasets is the length of dialogue turns and the nature of user and system behaviors. The model is trained using Adam optimizer BID12 with learning rate annealing. Different numbers of hops are tested for performance comparison. Hyper-parameters are tuned using grid-search. GLMP achieves the least out-of-vocabulary performance drop compared to other baselines on bAbI dialogues. The model is implemented in PyTorch with hyper-parameters reported in the Appendix. In Table 2, performance is compared based on per-response accuracy and task-completion rate for bAbI Dialogue. Utterance retrieval methods like QRN, MN, and GMN struggle to recommend options and provide additional information. GLMP achieves a highest 92.0% task-completion rate in full dialogue task and surpasses other baselines by a big margin especially in the OOV setting. No per-response accuracy loss for T1, T2, T4 using only the single hop, and only decreases 7-9% in task 5. In human-human dialogue scenario, GLMP achieves a highest 14.79 BLEU and 59.97% entity F1 score. GLMP achieves a highest 14.79 BLEU and 59.97% entity F1 score, showing improvement in entity F1. Entity F1 is considered a more comprehensive evaluation metric for task-oriented dialogues. Results of rule-based and KVR are not directly comparable due to task simplification. Human evaluation of generated responses is conducted, comparing with Mem2Seq and original dataset responses. GLMP outperforms Mem2Seq in system appropriateness and human-likeness evaluations on a scale from 1 to 5. Human performance sets the upper bound on scores. Ablation study shows that GLMP with global memory pointer G and memory writing of dialogue history H performs better than without them. GLMP without G shows an 11.47% entity F1 drop in SMD dataset, but a 0.4% increase in task 5. The use of global memory pointer may impose a strong prior entity probability. Increasing dropout ratio during training can mitigate the OOV generalization problem. Visualization and qualitative evaluation involve analyzing attention weights in the last hop for each generation time step. The attention vector shows external knowledge that can be copied, including KB information and dialogue history. In task-oriented dialogue systems, the global memory pointer successfully copies entities and addresses to fill in sketch utterances. The attention weights focus on various points of interest, but the global memory pointer helps mitigate issues. More dialogue visualization and results, including negative examples and error analysis, are provided in the Appendix. Machine learning-based dialogue systems are explored through modularized and end-to-end approaches. In task-oriented dialogue systems, various modules for natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking, dialogue management, and natural language generation are utilized. These approaches combine domain-specific knowledge and slot-filling techniques but require additional human labels. End-to-end approaches have shown promising results, treating the task as a next utterance retrieval or sequence generation problem. Memory networks perform multi-hop design to enhance reasoning ability, while some approaches focus on delexicalized or final generation methods. The curr_chunk discusses memory attention visualization in the SMD navigation domain, focusing on pointer networks and copy mechanisms used in natural language processing tasks. These approaches aim to generate more flexible system responses token-by-token, surpassing retrieval-based methods in task-oriented dialogue tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the utilization of end-to-end memory networks to improve copy attention in natural language processing tasks, outperforming utterance retrieval methods. BID10 proposes entity indexing and delexicalization to simplify the problem, while GLMP leverages multiple hop attention for reading and writing in memory networks. GLMP utilizes end-to-end memory networks for multiple hop attention in task-oriented dialogues, incorporating shared external knowledge. The global and local memory pointers effectively handle out-of-vocabulary scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art results in dialogue datasets. The model shows potential for question answering and text summarization tasks. Table 5 shows selected hyper-parameters for different hops in each dataset. Mistakes in bAbI dialogues mainly occur in task 3, recommending restaurants based on ratings. SMD poses challenges for response generation, especially when the KB has multiple options for user intentions. The model struggles with entity recognition and may generate incorrect responses due to lack of supervision. Copied entities may not match the generated tags. Comparison to existing dialogue frameworks like PyDial is suggested, but challenges exist in labeling dialogue acts and belief states. PyDial's rule-based semi tracker requires rewriting rules for new domains or datasets. The dialogue management module could benefit from a learning approach. Based on the current state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and models, a task-oriented dialogue system using PyDial in a known domain with human rules may outperform end-to-end systems. However, this paper aims to explore the potential of end-to-end systems without additional human labels and rules. End-to-end approaches are believed to be advantageous for easy training and for multi-domain or zero-shot domain cases. End-to-end approaches are favored for adaptability in various domain cases. Examples include generating directions to nearby locations and setting reminders for events. Memory attention visualization in the SMD navigation domain is also highlighted. The curr_chunk discusses setting reminders for events, including a dinner with Marie at 7pm on the 6th of the month. It also mentions memory attention visualization in the SMD schedule domain and generating delexicalized and final generation outputs for various activities. Additionally, it includes a conversation about a doctor appointment on the 5th and the weather forecast for the weekend. The final generation predicts clear skies in Danville on Thursday, with no drizzle expected in Redwood City over the weekend. Memory attention visualization is shown in the SMD weather domain."
