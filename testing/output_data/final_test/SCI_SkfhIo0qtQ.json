A novel \"volumetric convolution\" operation is proposed for convolving functions in B^3 using Zernike polynomials. This operation allows for measuring symmetry around an axis in 3D shape analysis tasks. The efficacy of this operation is demonstrated in a 3D object recognition task. Convolution-based deep neural networks have excelled in 2D representation learning tasks with parameter sharing for repetitive features. Adapting these networks to spherical domains can benefit robotics, geoscience, and medical imaging. Efforts have been made to extend convolutional networks to spherical signals, with initial progress reported in the literature. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to perform volumetric convolutions inside a unit ball (B 3) that explicitly learns representations across the radial axis, achieving equivariance to SO(3). The work focuses on extending convolutional networks to spherical signals, with recent progress in harmonic analysis for rotational equivariance on the sphere (S 2) and SE(3) equivariance in 3D Euclidean space. In this work, the theory of volumetric convolution using orthogonal Zernike polynomials in B 3 is developed to enhance 3D shape recognition. The approach offers advantages over spherical convolution methods by capturing both 2D texture and 3D shape features, handling non-polar 3D shapes efficiently. Experimental results show a significant improvement in discriminative ability using volumetric convolution, with an explicit formula based on Zernike Polynomials to measure axial symmetry around an arbitrary axis. The formula derived from Zernike polynomials in B 3 is used to propose a hand-crafted descriptor for encoding axial symmetry in 3D shapes. The implementation of volumetric convolution and axial symmetry measurement is broken down into differentiable steps for integration into any end-to-end architecture. An experimental architecture using capsule networks is proposed to demonstrate the practical usefulness of these operations. Capsules allow for a direct comparison of feature discriminability between spherical and volumetric convolution, highlighting the differences in optimal deep architectures for each.

Capsules allow for a comparison of feature discriminability between spherical and volumetric convolution, showing differences in optimal deep architectures for each. The main contributions include developing theory for capturing useful features with a relatively shallow network, showcasing improvements over spherical convolution, and highlighting the usefulness of volumetric convolution and axial symmetry feature layers as easily pluggable building blocks for end-to-end deep architectures. The main contributions of this work include the development of volumetric convolution theory for efficiently modeling functions in B 3, implementation of the proposed volumetric convolution as a fully differentiable module, and a novel formula to measure axial symmetry using Zernike polynomials. Additionally, an experimental end-to-end trainable framework combining hand-crafted and learned representations for rich 3D shape descriptors is presented. In this paper, the development of volumetric convolution theory for modeling functions in B 3 is discussed. The proposed volumetric convolution and axial symmetry measurement formula are derived in different sections. The effectiveness of the operators is demonstrated through extensive experiments. Convolution is shown to be effective for capturing features from uniformly spaced grids in various dimensions. However, for topological spaces like S 2 and B 3, constructing such grids is not feasible due to non-linearity. The text discusses the limitations of using a uniformly spaced grid for 3D convolution in B 3 due to the varying spaces between points. To address this, a novel volumetric convolution operation is proposed, focusing on the 3D rotation group. The convolution operation is compared to planar convolution in FIG0. 3D Zernike polynomials are a complete and orthogonal set of basis functions in B 3, exhibiting 'form invariance' under 3D rotation. They can be used to approximate arbitrary functions in B 3. In Sec. 4, a proposed volumetric convolution operator will be derived to address rotation mapping challenges in B 3. The Euler angles can decompose a rotation into three operations, allowing for a unique 3D rotation on the kernel in terms of azimuth and polar angles. By enforcing symmetry around y, the kernel function after rotation only depends on specific points. Volumetric convolution is defined with an arbitrary rotation to capture complex patterns compared to spherical convolution. The text discusses deriving differentiable relations to compute 3D Zernike moments for functions in B3, aiming to minimize the distance between the Zernike representation and the original shape by pushing the set {\u2126n,l,m} inside frequency space. The text discusses deriving differentiable relations to compute 3D Zernike moments for functions in B3, aiming to minimize the distance between the Zernike representation and the original shape by pushing the set {\u2126n,l,m} inside frequency space. The method involves planar convolution for image and kernel inner product in (x, y) plane, and volumetric convolution with 3D rotation for inner product between 3D function and 3D kernel over B3. The process involves solving an overdetermined linear system to find the least squared error solution using the pseudo inverse of X for training the model end-to-end. The text discusses deriving differentiable relations to compute 3D Zernike moments for functions in B3, aiming to minimize the distance between the Zernike representation and the original shape. An iterative method is used to calculate the pseudo inverse of a matrix BID12, with an initial approximation V0 = \u03b1AT. The theory of volumetric convolution within the unit ball is then derived using 3D Zernike polynomials. The text discusses the completeness property of 3D Zernike Polynomials in approximating functions in B3. It shows that a symmetric function around the y-axis can be simplified and rewritten using rotational properties, leading to the derivation of differentiable relations for computing 3D Zernike moments. Using the rotational properties of Zernike polynomials, we can calculate the convolution of two functions easily through matrix multiplication. The convolution produces a polar shape and is equivariant to 3D rotation group. The theorem states that applying a 3D rotation to a function in B3 Hilbert space results in the output feature map exhibiting the same rotation. The output feature map is symmetric around the north pole, allowing the rotation to be uniquely defined in terms of azimuth and polar angles. A proposition is presented to measure the axial symmetry of a function in B3 using 3D Zernike polynomials, enabling encoding of non-polar 3D shapes with texture. Zernike polynomials allow encoding non-polar 3D shapes with texture, while spherical convolution handles polar 3D shapes with uniform texture. A proposition is presented for measuring axial symmetry using Zernike basis functions. A 3D object can be expressed as a function on the surface of a sphere, with unique values for direction vectors. The convolution kernel on the sphere in 2D extends to movements on the surface of the sphere in S2. Projecting both the kernel and object onto spherical harmonic functions can approximate non-polar 3D shapes to a polar shape, causing information loss. Representing and convolving the shape function inside the unit ball (B3) can address these limitations. The shape function inside the unit ball (B3) preserves complex shape information without deterioration, allowing encoding of 2D texture information simultaneously. An experimental architecture demonstrates the usefulness of these operations, focusing on three key factors: shallowness, volumetric convolution, and surface function application to 3D objects. The experimental architecture focuses on shallowness and modularity, using volumetric convolution and capsule networks to generate features for 3D shape analysis. The architecture consists of four components, including axial symmetry features and compact bilinear pooling. The proposed architecture for 3D shape analysis includes obtaining three view angles, generating features for each angle, optimizing view angles for maximum information content, convolving point sets with kernels, using axial symmetry measurements, and feeding features to capsule networks for decision making. The proposed architecture for 3D shape analysis involves using three view angles to generate features, translating points to achieve translational invariance, rearranging points for convolution, and applying a 1D convolution net to capture local variations along the y axis. The output of the net is used for rotation analysis. The 1D convolution net outputs rotation parameters represented by a 1 \u00d7 9 vector. Three rotations are computed to map points to different view angles. Point sets are extracted from each angle and fed to the volumetric convolution layer to obtain feature maps. Symmetry around four equi-angular axes is measured and concatenated to form a feature vector. Compact bilinear pooling provides a compact representation with the same discriminative power. The compact bilinear pooling technique reduces dimensionality of feature vectors by combining volumetric convolution features from different angles. These fused vectors are then input to capsule networks, such as CapsNet, which model input variations through vector representations inspired by inverse graphics. Various feature fusion techniques are also explored in the study. CapsNets utilize a 'routing-by-agreement' approach to preserve extracted features and compare feature discriminability of spherical and volumetric convolution. They disentangle 3D shape features through pose and view equivariance, maintaining mutual relationships between object parts. Incorporating two independent CapsNets for volumetric convolution and axial symmetry features, the network rearranges input vectors into primary capsules, utilizes dynamic routing for classification, and combines outputs through max-pooling. The architecture includes 1000 primary capsules with 10 dimensions for volumetric features and 2500 capsules with 10 dimensions for axial symmetry features. The decision layer consists of 12-dimensional capsules, implementing Eq. 15 with n = 5 and three iterations for Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse calculation. Training involves a decaying learning rate and incremental g step for each iteration. The proposed approach utilizes Adam optimizer with specific parameters chosen empirically. The GPU implementation is efficient, taking less than 15 minutes for an epoch during training on a single GTX 1080Ti GPU. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing accuracy with state-of-the-art work and conducting an ablation study. ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 datasets are used in the experiments to assess robustness. The proposed approach for computing 3D Zernike moments produces richer representations of 3D shapes compared to conventional methods. The model achieves an overall accuracy of 92.17% on ModelNet10 and 86.5% on ModelNet40, which is on par with state-of-the-art models. Performance comparison with other recent works is shown in TAB1, but these are not directly comparable with our approach. Our proposed approach achieves high accuracy on ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 without data augmentation, using a single volumetric convolution layer. The effectiveness of our architecture is demonstrated by comparing accuracy against the number of trainable parameters in state-of-the-art models. Replacing the optimum view point layer with fixed orthogonal view points results in a 6.57% accuracy drop, highlighting the importance of learned optimum view points. Additionally, the performance of volumetric convolution versus spherical convolution is studied, showing the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed volumetric convolution outperforms spherical convolution by 12.56%, showing better shape property capture. Using mean-pooling instead of maxpooling drops accuracy to 87.27%. Combining axial symmetry features with volumetric convolution features using compact bilinear pooling in a single capsule network results in an accuracy of 86.53%, a 5.64% reduction compared to using two capsule networks. The performance of volumetric convolution features reaches 85.3% accuracy, while axial symmetry features achieve 66.73%. Comparing different choices in the experimental architecture, replacing capsule network with a fully connected layer yields 87.3% accuracy. Substituting compact bilinear pooling with feature concatenation, max-pooling, and average-pooling results in accuracies of 90.7%, 90.3%, and 85.3% respectively. This validates the effectiveness of compact bilinear pooling as a feature fusion tool. The effectiveness of compact bilinear pooling as a feature fusion tool is validated. The model shows strong robustness against random information loss, with no performance drop until 20% data loss, and only a gradual decrease to 66.5% accuracy at 50% data loss. An alternative method for calculating 3D Zernike moments is proposed for closer resemblance to the original shape. The curr_chunk discusses the validation of a hypothesis through experiments on shapes in the validation set of ModelNet10 using two approaches. The mean reconstruction error decreases as n increases, with the proposed approach showing significantly lower error compared to the conventional approach. The utility of Zernike moments for modeling complex 3D shapes is justified, and a novel 'volumetric convolution' using 3D Zernike polynomials is derived. The curr_chunk discusses the theoretical foundations for volumetric convolution using low-cost matrix multiplications and a differentiable method to measure axial symmetry in B 3. An experimental architecture for 3D object recognition is proposed, showing competitive results with a shallow network. The potential extension includes exploring weight sharing along the radius of the sphere. The curr_chunk discusses achieving equivariance over 3D rotations around an arbitrary axis using complex functions and Zernike basis functions. It presents a proposition for projecting a function into a set of symmetric basis functions and provides a proof for the process.
