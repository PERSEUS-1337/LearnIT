The Secretary of Energy establishes a program to provide payment for health care expenses to former Department of Energy employees exposed to ionizing radiation at defense nuclear facilities. Former Department of Energy employees exposed to ionizing radiation at defense nuclear facilities may be eligible for payment of reasonable expenses for certain health care services if they meet specific criteria, including a minimum work period in a facility with radioactive materials and not being entitled to Medicare benefits. Covered health care services include treatment for leukemia, multiple myeloma, muscle cancer affecting the spinal cord, and lymphoma. Former Department of Energy employees exposed to ionizing radiation at defense nuclear facilities may be eligible for payment of reasonable expenses for certain health care services if they meet specific criteria. Covered diseases include cancer of various organs, berylliosis, and other diseases determined by the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In determining reasonable health care expenses for former Department of Energy employees exposed to ionizing radiation, typical payment methodologies from FEHBP plans are used. Treatment of illnesses is considered medically necessary if payment can be expected under FEHBP plans or Medicare. Health care services include items and services covered by FEHBP plans or Medicare, such as hospital and physician services. The program established by the Secretary of Energy covers various healthcare services with a threshold dollar amount of $25,000 per individual during their lifetime. The administration can be carried out directly by the Secretary of Energy or through a memorandum of understanding with a federal department, agency, or a health insurance carrier. The program must be established within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. The program established by the Secretary of Energy covers healthcare services for Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities. The program applies to expenses incurred after its effective date and includes definitions for FEHBP plan and Medicare program. The Secretary of Energy operates nuclear facilities for national security purposes, including tritium loading facility at Savannah River, 236 H facility at Savannah River, and Mound Laboratory in Ohio. It also includes nuclear waste storage or disposal facilities under the Secretary's control, testing and assembly facilities like the test site facility in Nevada, Pinnellas Plant in Florida, and Pantex facility in Texas. The Secretary of Energy operates nuclear facilities for national security purposes, including Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia National Laboratories. These facilities may no longer be in operation but were previously under the control of the Department of Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission, or the Energy Research and Development Administration."
