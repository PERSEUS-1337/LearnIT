    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Save American Jobs Through L Visa Reform Act of 2004\". The Congress finds widespread abuse by companies subcontracting nonimmigrants who obtained status under the Immigration and Nationality Act as intracompany transferees with specialized knowledge. This abuse includes displacing US citizens from their jobs and terminating their employment after training the nonimmigrants. Employers have abused the intracompany transferee visa program by admitting individuals without the required \"specialized knowledge,\" flooding the job market and displacing US citizens from their jobs. In China, there is a high rate of fraud in intracompany transferee nonimmigrant visa petitions, with a reported fraud rate of about 40 percent since fiscal year 2000. Similar fraud rates have been reported in other areas of China as well. SEC. 3. Amendment to eliminate nonimmigrant visas for intracompany transferees with specialized knowledge, limiting admission period to 7 years. Conforming amendments made to Immigration and Nationality Act.
