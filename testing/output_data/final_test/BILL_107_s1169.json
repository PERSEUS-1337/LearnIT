    "content": "The \"Home Health Nurse and Patient Act of 2001\" includes sections on short title, findings, definitions, OASIS Task Force, claims review process improvement, and implementation of task force recommendations. The Senate findings state that the Outcomes Assessment and Information Set (OASIS) is crucial for evaluating the quality of care provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients by home health agencies. The Comptroller General of the United States found that home health agencies require an average of 61 minutes more to comply with OASIS requirements for start-of-care assessments than estimated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Many nurses and home health aides are leaving the profession due to excessive federal regulations and paperwork requirements, leading to decreased job satisfaction. A national survey reported high turnover rates for registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and home health aides in 2000. Recruitment and Retention of Nurses and Nurse Aides Is a Growing Concern, with projected 58% increase in home health care nurse aide jobs from 1998 to 2008. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms such as \"comprehensive assessment of patients,\" \"CRATF,\" \"home health agency,\" and \"Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS).\" The terms \"Outcome and Assessment Information Set\" and \"OASIS\" refer to the standard for data items used in patient assessments. Medicaid beneficiary is an individual eligible for Medicaid, while a Medicare beneficiary is entitled to benefits under Medicare. The term \"OTF\" refers to the OASIS Task Force established under section 4, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The OASIS Task Force (OTF) is established under section 4. The OASIS Task Force (OTF) is established by the Secretary with 11 members, including representatives from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, national home health industry, and patient advocates. The OTF will conduct a study on patient assessments. The OASIS Task Force (OTF) will conduct a study on patient assessments, aiming to decrease the number of assessments and questions asked, establish a uniform data collection standard, and collect OASIS data from medicaid beneficiaries who are not medicare beneficiaries. A report on the study will be submitted to the Secretary and Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The OTF will submit a report to the Secretary and Congress with recommendations for legislative or administrative action based on the study conducted on patient assessments. The Secretary will revise data collection requirements under OASIS to make it optional for non-Medicare and non-Medicaid patients of home health agencies, and eliminate requirements for patients receiving only personal care services. Improving the claims review process for dually-eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries receiving home health services. The Secretary will review regulations on demand billing for dual Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to ensure efficiency, timely coverage determination for home health services, and prompt claim submission without negatively impacting Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary will revise regulations on demand billing for dual Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries within 6 months of the Act's enactment to ensure timely coverage determination for home health services without negatively affecting beneficiaries. SEC. 7. CLAIMS REVIEW AND AUDIT TASK FORCE (CRATF). The Claims Review and Audit Task Force (CRATF) is established by the Secretary with 11 members, including officers from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and representatives from the home health industry. The CRATF will conduct a study on medical review processes and policies. The CRATF will study the processes and policies for reviewing medical claims from home health agencies, denials of payment, and the sampling methodology for post-payment audits. Proposals include setting time limits for claim reviews and using alternative dispute resolution for payment disputes. The CRATF will study processes for reviewing claims from home health agencies, setting standards for ethical agencies, eliminating technical denials of payment, and allowing resubmission of claims. Developing a sampling regulation through the rulemaking process to ensure timely reimbursement for home health agencies and uninterrupted care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The CRATF will use a methodology to project overpayments to home health service providers based on erroneous claims. A report with recommendations will be submitted to the Secretary and Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. IMPLEMENTATION OF TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS. The Secretary must implement recommendations from the OTF and CRATF reports by revising regulations within 6 months of receiving the reports. This includes comprehensive patient assessments and review processes for medical claims by home health agencies. The curr_chunk discusses technical denials of payment for claims by home health agencies and the sampling methodology for post-payment audits to implement CRATF recommendations."
