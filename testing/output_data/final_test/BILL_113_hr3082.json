    "content": "The Act titled \"Ansar al-Sharia Terrorist Designation Act of 2013\" requires a report on designating the Libyan factions of Ansar al-Sharia as a foreign terrorist organization. Congress finds that Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi, led by Muhammad al-Zahawi, announced itself in February 2012. The Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Ahmed Abu Khattalah, a senior commander in Ansar al-Sharia, for his involvement in the 2012 Benghazi attack. Libyan authorities also named Abu Khattalah as a commander in the group. Libyan authorities identified Ahmed Abu Khattalah as a commander in the 2012 Benghazi attack. The Washington Institute for Near East Peace reported on Ansar al-Sharia's training camps in Libya for jihadists going to Syria. Abu Sufian Bin Qumu, leader of Ansar al-Sharia in Darnah, is a former Guantanamo Bay inmate with al-Qaeda connections. Ansar al-Sharia in Libya has been likened to embodying al Qaeda's presence in the country. According to a report by the Library of Congress, al-Qaeda has dispatched operatives to Libya to establish a terrorist network, with Ansar al-Sharia being one of the groups involved. The report suggests that al-Qaeda is close to having a fully operational network in Libya. The report will assess if the Libyan faction of Ansar al-Sharia qualifies as a foreign terrorist organization under the Immigration and Nationality Act. It will also provide a detailed justification if the criteria are not met. The report will be submitted in unclassified form, with the option for a classified annex if necessary. The term \"intelligence community\" is defined in the National Security Act of 1947. Congress believes that the Libyan faction of Ansar al-Sharia should be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. This designation should not interfere with Libya's sovereignty in combating militant or terrorist groups within its borders."
