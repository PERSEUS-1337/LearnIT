The message is to be submitted to the Senate Secretary or House Clerk if the respective chamber is not in session. The President must make a special message and proposed joint resolution publicly available. The resolution will be introduced in the Senate and House on the next legislative day by the majority leader or designated member. The joint resolution introduced in Congress by the majority leader is not referred to a committee, placed on the calendar immediately, and its motion to proceed is privileged and not debatable.
