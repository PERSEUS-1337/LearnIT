    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthcare Information Technology Enterprise Integration Act\". Congress finds that the National Institute of Standards and Technology is well-equipped to complement healthcare information technology implementation efforts by addressing technical challenges. It is in the national interest for NIST to accelerate its efforts in this area. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is focusing on developing technical standards, conformance tests, and enterprise integration processes to improve efficiency and quality of care in the healthcare industry. They are also working on ensuring that all components of the US healthcare infrastructure can be part of a reliable, interoperable, and secure electronic information network. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is working on a Healthcare Information Enterprise Integration Initiative to improve efficiency and quality of care in the healthcare industry. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is establishing an initiative for healthcare information enterprise integration in the United States. This effort will involve various units of the institute, consortia with government and industry, and focus on information technology standards and interoperability. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is focusing on information technology standards, interoperability, conformance testing infrastructure, security, medical device communication, technical architecture products, and information management. Additionally, the Director may assist in developing technical roadmaps for healthcare representatives and organizations to ensure technical standards for application protocols. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is focusing on developing technical roadmaps for healthcare representatives and organizations to ensure technical standards for application protocols, interoperability, data integrity, and security. The Director will also transmit reports on NIST activities to relevant committees. SEC. 4. FEDERAL HEALTHCARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation with industry and Federal agencies, must develop technology-neutral guidelines and standards for Federal agencies to securely and interoperably utilize healthcare information technologies. The guidelines and standards developed under subsection (a) aim to promote the use of commercially available products by Federal agencies, establish uniform testing procedures for healthcare information technology products, support testing of electronic healthcare technologies, and provide protection and security profiles. The Director shall provide reports to Congress on the level of interoperability and security of healthcare information technologies among Federal agencies, as well as the progress and challenges in ensuring interoperable and secure healthcare information systems. The Director reports to Congress on the level of interoperability and security of healthcare information technologies among Federal agencies, as well as progress and challenges in ensuring secure electronic healthcare records. SEC. 5. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a program to assist institutions of higher education in creating Centers for Healthcare Information Enterprise Integration through merit-reviewed grants. The purpose is to develop innovative approaches in this field. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a program to assist higher education institutions in creating Centers for Healthcare Information Enterprise Integration. Research areas may include interfaces between human information systems, voice-recognition systems, software for interoperability, software dependability in healthcare systems, and measuring the impact of information technologies on healthcare quality and productivity. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a program to assist higher education institutions in creating Centers for Healthcare Information Enterprise Integration. Institutions seeking funding must submit an application detailing research projects, collaborations, and promotion of active collaboration among scientists and engineers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a program to assist higher education institutions in creating Centers for Healthcare Information Enterprise Integration. This includes collaboration among scientists and engineers from various disciplines, technology transfer activities, and contributions to education and training in relevant fields. The National High-Performance Computing Program will coordinate Federal research and development programs. The National High-Performance Computing Program will coordinate Federal research and development programs related to health information technology, including computer infrastructure, data security, large-scale computing systems, networking, software development, human-computer interaction, and social/economic implications of IT. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a Strategic Plan for Healthcare Technologies and Classification in consultation with the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation will establish a task force within 90 days to develop a strategic plan with recommendations for terminologies, classifications, and stakeholder commitment to enable interoperability and accurate information. The task force will develop a centralized governance model for health terminology standards, including funding scenarios and US participation in the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization. The task force will report findings to the House Committee on Science and Technology within 18 months and will not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and Technology is set at $8,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, to be derived from amounts authorized under Public Law 110-69."
