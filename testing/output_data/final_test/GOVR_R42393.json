    "content": "The Arab uprisings challenge long-standing U.S. policy assumptions, but key goals in the region remain. Congress must consider the impact of shifting realities on U.S. goals, including discouraging conflict and ensuring energy flow. Balancing priorities in the Middle East is complex, involving energy resources, military operations, counterterrorism, weapons proliferation, and promoting democracy and human rights. Cooperation with leaders who reject democratization and human rights has been necessary for regional stability and U.S. security. This has led to criticism of the U.S. supporting dictators who suppress dissent. Providing assistance to allies for security and peace is further complicated by these challenges. The complex relationships among U.S. allies in the Middle East have added challenges to preserving security and discouraging interstate conflict. The region has experienced periods of stability with occasional bursts of conflict since the 1950s. U.S. policy aims to balance competing priorities while prioritizing a secure and stable environment. Some argue that U.S. interests in the region should not interfere with other goals, such as protecting political rights and improving socioeconomic conditions. Some analysts argue that U.S. investments in political rights and societal development in the Middle East could promote regional stability. This approach sees engagement, advocacy, and assistance as tools to build cooperation and prevent backlash from popular dissent. Recent changes in the region reflect a shift in this perspective. Change has come to several countries in the Middle East through popular uprisings, leading to a more complex U.S. policy landscape. The new regional environment emphasizes the power of public opinion, challenging the assumption that outsiders can effectively engage with the Arab world through elites. Rulers must now consider the demands of public opinion and various political and social groups shaping its influence. The future governance of states undergoing change remains uncertain, but leaders will need to address the evolving dynamics of public opinion. The Arab uprisings have led to a shift in power dynamics in the Middle East, with a focus on public opinion and the influence of emerging leaders. Foreign policy choices, especially regarding the Arab-Israeli peace process and foreign assistance, are under extra scrutiny. In the short term, increased public participation in governance may lead to support for Islamist parties for various reasons. The Arab uprisings have shifted power dynamics in the Middle East, leading to increased public participation in governance and support for Islamist parties. The United States faces challenges in engaging with Islamist parties due to concerns about their views on Israel, armed conflict, and social issues. The ability of the U.S. government to influence events in the region has become more complicated as some friendly regimes have faced upheavals. The Arab uprisings have led to increased public participation in governance and support for Islamist parties, challenging the United States' ability to influence events in the region. Iran and its allies were initially seen as winners, but the situation in Syria has complicated their position. The outcome in Syria will have significant consequences for Iran and its allies in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Israeli concerns and complications for peace are also at play. Israeli government leaders are concerned about the Arab uprisings potentially leading to hostile Islamist governments in neighboring countries, making Israel's security situation more perilous. This complicates peace negotiations as Palestinians demand a firm stance against Israel and unity between Fatah and Hamas. These challenges hinder ongoing U.S. efforts for a two-state solution to end the Arab-Israeli conflict. The weakened state security authorities in the Middle East and North Africa due to uprisings and unrest pose challenges for regional and global policymakers. Continued violence and assertive citizen demands for less security control create opportunities for terrorists and criminal entities in countries like Libya, the Sinai peninsula, and Yemen. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and a forthcoming military reset in the Gulf region will impact security calculations by Iran and U.S. allies. The Iranian nuclear program challenges U.S. goals, raising the risk of military conflict as Iran responds to escalating sanctions with threats. Economic constraints impact willingness for military interventions or aid programs. Congress may consider military and economic aid, arms sales, sanctions, and trade negotiations. The changing dynamics in the Middle East may require a shift in U.S. strategy, with ad hoc decision-making becoming more common. Congress may need to consider new approaches in response to regional changes. Egypt is undergoing a transition from military to civilian rule after the 2011 uprising. The transition in Egypt from military to civilian, Islamist-led rule poses challenges for U.S. policymakers. The power struggle between Islamist political parties and the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will impact key issues like the constitution, economy, and security. The U.S. must adjust its policies to align with the shifting decision-making authority in Egypt. The United States is adjusting its policy towards Egypt, a strategic partner since the late 1970s, to maintain peace and cooperation. The US seeks access to the Suez Canal for power projection and protection of global shipments. Egypt is also a key partner in counterterrorism efforts. Egypt's experience in counterterrorism is crucial for U.S. policy makers as they navigate shifting Israeli-Egyptian relations. Public support for the Palestinian cause in Egypt could strain these relations, despite current willingness to maintain peace with Israel. U.S. fears the potential fallout from heightened Arab-Israeli tensions. The heightened Arab-Israeli tensions may be difficult to contain due to unanticipated negative events, such as the 2011 Palestinian terrorist attack in Israel and the killing of Egyptian police. Protestors stormed Israel's embassy in Cairo, and Egyptian commandos had to rescue Israeli diplomats. Non-state actors like Hamas base their military forces in civilian areas, leading to inevitable civilian casualties during conflicts. The potential for another war or Palestinian uprising could lead to destabilizing effects in Egypt and the region, especially with images of Arab civilian casualties broadcasted over media. For the foreseeable future, U.S. policy toward Egypt may focus on containing potential conflict zones like Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. Egyptian leaders may no longer be able to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, as they did under Mubarak's leadership. Egypt's military aims to maintain peace with Israel, but Egyptian Islamist groups and public opinion may not be as hostile towards Hamas. The United States may face challenges in finding a reliable broker for negotiations in the region due to the possible loss of Egypt's role. Jordan may attempt to fill this vacuum, but lacks the same political weight as Egypt. The tension in U.S.-Egyptian relations between national security interests and promoting values and human rights is expected to continue, especially as complications arise when these interests conflict with other goals. The rise of Islamist parties in Egypt may complicate U.S. support for the country, especially regarding human rights and gender equality. Congress has backed Obama Administration's policies for Egypt, but controversies have arisen over Egypt's prosecution of personnel from U.S. and Egyptian NGOs. Congress fully funded the Administration's FY2012 assistance request for Egypt ($1.55 billion) and authorized $500 million in debt relief. The Secretary of State must certify that Egypt is meeting its peace treaty obligations to Israel and supporting the transition to a free civilian government. Some Members have raised concerns about the dispute over U.S. and Egyptian democracy NGOs affecting the certification process. Proponents of expanded ties support a U.S.-Egyptian free trade agreement, while opponents call for rescinding aid to Egypt. U.S. relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have been focused on security partnership to protect energy resources, despite occasional tensions over energy policy, counterterrorism, and regional peace. The authoritarian GCC states present challenges in balancing U.S. commitments to democracy and human rights with security needs. Political decision-making in the GCC remains concentrated in the hands of unelected rulers. The GCC states are largely ruled by unelected hereditary rulers, with security forces enforcing laws that restrict civil, religious, and political rights. The 2011 political events highlighted challenges in U.S.-GCC relations, but shared concerns about regional security have brought the United States and its Gulf allies closer. Recent uprisings have had limited impact on GCC states, except for Bahrain, where large demonstrations pose a threat to the ruling family. Other Gulf states have seen isolated unrest, such as clashes in Saudi Arabia and activism in the UAE. Demonstrations and calls for change in the Gulf states have been relatively contained. Calls for change in the Gulf states have focused on ending corruption and mismanagement, with some protestors in Bahrain demanding regime change. The U.S. relies on the Gulf states for support in achieving core goals, such as ensuring the free flow of oil. The U.S. military has access to facilities in the region through defense pacts, which Gulf governments see as protection from external threats. The United States has active arms sales relationships with all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to improve their defense capabilities against Iran. Despite U.S. military presence being controversial domestically, there are approximately 40,000 U.S. military personnel in the Gulf region supporting operations and acting as a deterrent to Iran. Bahrain and Kuwait are designated as Major Non-NATO allies, with the U.S. selling advanced missile defense systems to some GCC states. Political changes in the region impact the GCC states differently. Bahrain's strategic importance to U.S. defense strategy is highlighted by its hosting of the headquarters for all U.S. naval forces in the Gulf. This is crucial for containing and deterring Iranian power and maintaining security in the region. Despite criticism for engaging with Bahrain's government, the U.S. continues to prioritize its defense interests in the region. The U.S. has influenced political reform in Bahrain and reduced repressive tactics against protesters. Some Members of Congress have sought to restrict arms sales to Bahrain due to unrest. Oman also faced protests for political and economic reform in 2011. Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id Al Said implemented political reforms in Oman between March and September 2011 to address protests. Despite his popularity, the U.S. refrained from criticizing his use of repression. Oman's strategic location along the Strait of Hormuz and Arabian Sea is crucial for maritime security and intelligence operations. The political upheaval in the region poses challenges for Saudi Arabia's authoritarian monarchy and U.S. policy makers. Saudi leaders are adjusting their foreign policy in response to changes in Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, and Syria. Concerns about terrorism and Iranian policies are being reassessed. Saudi military interventions in Bahrain, Syria, and Yemen demonstrate the kingdom's potential power. Saudi Arabia's role in facilitating transitions in the region shows its potential as a powerful ally of the United States. However, there are dissonances in views and responses in countries like Bahrain and Syria. The U.S. faces dilemmas in balancing its policy principles with Saudi domestic political developments and human rights conditions. Annual U.S. government reports highlight restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in Saudi Arabia. Unrest in Kuwait since 2011 has not posed a direct threat to U.S. goals in the country. Qatar has not experienced domestic unrest but has responded assertively to regional changes, making U.S. relations more complex. The U.S. maintains a partnership with Qatar through a bilateral agreement allowing military access to the Al Udeid airfield. Qatar's support for Islamist figures and conservative Sunni groups raises concerns amid political changes in the region. The country has been active in diplomatic efforts against the Qadhafi regime and deployed military aircraft in support of NATO missions. Qatar is also involved in diplomatic efforts to address violence by the Syrian government. These actions have implications for U.S. national interests in preserving regional peace. Syria's role in the complex rivalry involving the United States, Iran, Arab allies, and non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah could impact U.S. national interests in preserving regional peace and limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Regime change or instability in Syria may alter the influence of competing actors, including Iran, Arab Gulf states, Turkey, Israel, the United States, and global powers like Russia and China. The potential implications of regime change or instability in Syria on U.S. national interests and regional security are significant. The spillover effects of violence could impact neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel. Policy makers are considering contingencies such as refugee flows, sectarian conflict, and transnational violence. Israel hopes for a new Syrian government less aligned with Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas, but there are concerns about a potentially aggressive stance from a new secular or Sunni Islamist-influenced government. The Sunni Islamist-influenced Syrian government may take an aggressive stance on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Hezbollah supports the Asad government and warns against third-party intervention, posing a threat to Israel and regional peace. Unrest in Syria has led to Hamas seeking new bases of operation. Concerns arise about the potential for violent Islamist groups to operate in Syria, as well as the security of Syrian weapons stockpiles. The U.S. is concerned about the human rights of Syrian civilians amidst ongoing violence and potential regime change. U.S. policy towards Syria has varied from confrontation to engagement since the 1980s, aiming to end support for terrorism and prevent proliferation of weapons. In the event of political transition in Syria, complex decisions will need to be made regarding existing policy and sanctions. Congress and the Administration could increase pressure on the Asad regime in the meantime. The Administration could increase pressure on the Asad regime through stronger sanctions or pursuing multilateral enforcement. Developing relationships with influential Syrian actors may also be considered. In the event of regime collapse, rapid response to secure weapons stockpiles may be necessary. The rise of Islamist activists in transitional countries raises questions about future political systems and U.S. partnerships. Islamist parties coming to power democratically may pose concerns about limiting individual rights and women's rights. The rise of Islamist parties in transitional countries raises concerns about potential restrictions on individual rights and women's freedoms. In Tunisia, Al Nahda, the main Islamist party, has expressed support for women's rights and a civil state, but opponents accuse it of having a \"double discourse\" to gradually introduce more conservative policies. In Egypt, U.S. policymakers are focused on Islamists' attitudes towards Israel and the Camp David Accords, as well as the potential for Islamist-influenced governments to harbor extremist groups. The rise of Islamists in transitional countries poses a new challenge for the United States as partner states' policies may be influenced by popular opinion. However, Islamists are not inherently more hostile towards the U.S. than other political groups in the Middle East. Their policies may be constrained by various factors such as state interests, state institutions, religious minority communities, and other domestic actors. The success of transitional states in establishing institutions with checks and balances, like an independent judiciary and free press, is crucial for shaping their political systems. The presence of Islamists in government does not determine the political outcome, as seen in Turkey, Iran, and the Gaza Strip. Arab countries may prioritize economic issues, security, and effective governance over Islamist identity issues. Islamist parties are not always unified movements. Islamist groups in transitional states are facing challenges in forming cohesive movements and policy principles. Salafist groups in Egypt and Tunisia are not aligning with more centrist Islamist parties. The influence of outside actors will also impact their platforms. The United States may prioritize political behavior over religious ideology when engaging with Islamist parties in transitional countries. This principle could be tested in the future, especially regarding foreign policy choices. Congressional support for Israel's security, including military assistance, remains strong. Political changes in the Middle East may affect Israeli perceptions. Ongoing political changes in the Middle East are impacting Israeli perceptions of security and regional peace. Israeli leaders have shifted their focus from conventional war threats to asymmetric threats like terrorism and unconventional weapons. Success in stopping Palestinian attacks led to concerns about threats from Iran and non-state actors in Lebanon and Gaza. With uncertainty about neighboring countries and the stability of Jordan's monarchy, Israelis are expressing concern. Israel's concerns about the future stability of neighboring states and the impact of political changes in the Arab world on regional security have heightened due to their perceived isolation and inability to rely on former partners. The country's dependence on U.S. security guarantees and strategic cooperation has become more significant in this complex political environment. Israel's increasing dependence on U.S. security guarantees and strategic cooperation may lead to disagreements over Israel's ability to defend itself. Calls for Israeli communication on military plans and requests for longer-term U.S. commitments are likely to intensify. Israeli economic growth could also impact future shifts in regional influence. Israeli economic growth and increasing self-sufficiency in meeting defense budget needs may lead to shifts in the U.S.-Israel relationship. Efforts by Israeli officials to assert their country as a reliable U.S. ally in a critical region aim to strengthen U.S. commitment to Israel's security and minimize perceptions of deference to U.S. views on regional military action and diplomacy with Palestinians. Israeli leaders may see diminished diplomatic room for maneuvering to resolve the Palestinian issue given their sense of a growing range of threats from multiple sources. Israelis insist that their security needs must be met for them to be willing to relinquish West Bank land in a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians. Increasing concern among Israeli leaders that they cannot count on future positive ties with states such as Egypt and Jordan has likely led them to perceive greater risks in any land-for-peace deal. Palestinian and other Arab leaders may be less willing to accept any final-status Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Israeli leaders may perceive greater risks in any land-for-peace deal, as opposition to Israel and its policies could drive political activism. Questions arise on how Israel will counter its increasing isolation, whether by improving relations with neighboring countries or accepting more international isolation. Israel's actions may depend on its leaders' perception of the situation. Israel's isolation may be attributed to efforts by Palestinians and increasing anti-Israel sentiments. U.S. military support for Israel and neighboring Arab states has prevented major conflicts for 40 years. A 10-year MOU commits the U.S. to $3.1 billion in annual FMF to Israel, representing 60% of total U.S. FMF and 20% of Israel's defense budget. The U.S. provides significant military support to Israel, amounting to 60% of total annual U.S. FMF and 20% of Israel's defense budget. Congress also allocates additional funds for missile defense programs. Legislation ensures Israel's military edge in the region, but changes in the regional environment may prompt Congress to review existing laws and aid to Israel and neighboring countries. Iran's desire to assert influence in the Persian Gulf region has led to strategic entanglement with the United States for decades, stemming from the 1979 Islamic revolution. This has resulted in violent confrontations, attacks on U.S. facilities, and skirmishes during the Iran-Iraq war. Central points of contention include Iranian support for terrorist groups and fears of U.S. support for regime change. Iran's uranium enrichment program is a key point of contention, along with Iran's fears of U.S. support for regime change. U.S. policy makers view the program as a cover for a potential nuclear weapons program, leading to broad economic sanctions imposed by successive U.S. Administrations and Congresses. Some experts have evaluated the Arab uprisings for their potential to compound or undermine the effects of U.S. and international pressure on Iran. Before the uprisings in 2011, U.S. strategists were concerned that the removal of Iran's enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq had enhanced Iran's influence in the region, potentially overturning the power structure in the Middle East. Iran believes the power structure in the Middle East favors the United States, Israel, and their Sunni Arab partners. The Arab uprisings have both enhanced Iran's regional influence and added to efforts to isolate it. Iran sees the toppling of pro-U.S. leaders as a sign of acceptance of its message of resistance. Iran highlights Shiite oppositionists in Bahrain challenging the U.S.-backed Sunni government. A collapse of the Bahrain regime would be a significant setback for Iran. The Saudi government sent troops into Bahrain in 2011 to suppress demonstrations, fearing a collapse of the regime would be a blow to Saudi Arabia and benefit Iran. With U.S. troops leaving Iraq in 2011, Iran may seek to increase influence in the region through neighboring Iraq. Iraq's Shiite leaders, who were in exile in Iran during Saddam Hussein's rule, are seen as supportive of Iran's interests. Iran may face setbacks due to Arab uprisings, which were driven by Westernized youth admiring American democracy. The uprising leaders do not see Iran as a model, but Iran's support for the uprisings depends on its portrayal. Iran's credibility in supporting Arab uprisings relies on being a model for both Sunni and Shiite Muslims. However, Iran's support clashes with its historical strategy of backing Shiite opposition movements against Sunni regimes. Sunni publics, led by Islamist governments, may become more confrontational towards Iran's sectarian power plays. The grip on power of Iran's ally, Syria, is at risk, affecting Iran's support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Hezbollah, inspired by Iran's Islamic revolution, is a key player in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Iran's leaders are concerned about President Bashar al Asad's potential fall and have provided security advice and material to Syria. They fear a revival of the Green movement in Iran due to Arab uprisings. During Iran's election campaign in March 2012, there were concerns that the opposition might return to the streets. Iranian authorities are more tolerant of public political activity during elections. Some experts believe the Arab uprisings were influenced by Iran's 2009 uprising, but Iran's Green Movement did not benefit from them. The US accused Iran of hypocrisy for supporting uprisings abroad while suppressing demonstrations at home. The Obama Administration supported the uprising in Libya partly to show solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in Iran. The U.S. government is committed to maintaining sanctions on Iran due to concerns about its nuclear program, threats to the Strait of Hormuz, and support for terrorist groups. The fluidity of events in the Middle East since 2011 has created challenges for policymakers in engaging with newly empowered actors and maintaining long-standing partnerships. The U.S. government is navigating challenges in the Middle East amidst changing political dynamics and global power plays involving countries like Russia, China, and Iran. Leaders in the region are adjusting to new circumstances while the U.S. addresses multiple policy concerns, including Iran's nuclear program. Expert opinions vary on the approach to engagement with Middle Eastern countries. The U.S. government is facing challenges in the Middle East amid shifting political dynamics and global power struggles involving Russia, China, and Iran. Expert opinions differ on how to engage with countries in transition, with concerns about potential risks to U.S. goals and interests. Previous U.S. policy approaches influence the range of choices available, especially considering existing relations with leaders, organizations, and populations in countries undergoing unrest and change. The U.S. government is navigating challenges in the Middle East amidst global power struggles. U.S. policy since early 2011 aims to leverage regional trends for outcomes favorable to national security interests. The Obama Administration has taken a varied approach to different cases, seeking to build strong bilateral ties and trust with partners. Trust with long-standing partners may not always deliver expected results, and partnerships with new actors cannot be rushed. Sanctions, aid programs, and diplomatic engagement play a crucial role in shaping future relationships. The Administration, supported by Congress, has approached unrest and change in the region with a focus on democratic transition. President Obama outlined core principles guiding U.S. responses in the Middle East, opposing violence and repression, supporting universal rights like free speech and equality, and the right to choose leaders. The Administration, supported by Congress, has focused on democratic transition in the Middle East and North Africa. President Obama outlined core principles opposing violence and repression, supporting universal rights like free speech and equality. America respects the right of all peaceful voices to be heard and looks forward to working with those who embrace genuine democracy. The act of restating guiding policy principles has not made it easier to reconcile them. The Administration's actions in response to events in various countries are interconnected, shaping expectations and options for future responses. The U.S.-led intervention in Libya has influenced considerations for potential actions in Syria. Regional observers criticize the U.S. for applying a double standard in its response to unrest in Bahrain compared to other countries. The U.S. response to uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen includes diplomatic outreach, political engagement, security sector programming, and promotion of trade and investment. Administration officials defend U.S. policy in Bahrain by stating that messages about reform have been communicated to leaders in Manama. The State Department's Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and USAID-OTI have been used to engage with emerging political groups in transition countries. In transition countries like Libya and Tunisia, democracy promotion programs engage with civil society groups and political parties, while security programs focus on mitigating threats from weapon stockpiles. The United States offers debt relief, creates enterprise funds, and supports economic growth through international financial institutions. President Obama emphasizes trade and investment over aid. The Administration coordinates responses and seeks funding from Congress for new transition initiatives. The State Department established an Office for Middle East Transitions in September 2011, led by Special Coordinator Ambassador William Taylor. The office supports democratic transition plans in Middle Eastern countries and coordinates with U.S. allies in Europe. A fund of $185 million has been allocated to support transitions in countries like Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt. The Obama Administration is requesting $770 million for the MENA-IF in FY2013, with $65 million for MEPI and $5 million for USAID's OMEP. Congress may influence U.S. foreign policy through legislation on sanctions, foreign assistance, arms sales, and security cooperation. The Obama Administration is requesting $770 million for the MENA-IF in FY2013, with $65 million for MEPI and $5 million for USAID's OMEP. Congress can set terms for U.S. sanctions, foreign assistance, arms sales, security cooperation, and trade policy in the Middle East. Congressional oversight and debate can stimulate new ideas and discussion about U.S. policy in the region. Key questions include what principles should guide the U.S. response to change in the Middle East, and how to reconcile interests in security, commerce, energy, governance, and human rights. The potential risks and rewards of shaping unrest and transitions in the Arab world, along with the roles of Congress and the executive branch in defining future policy, are key considerations for U.S. interests in the Middle East. Legislative precedent, bureaucratic infrastructure, and funding patterns may need to be revisited to address these challenges. The ongoing changes in the Middle East, such as the rise of Islamist parties and weakening state security, pose new opportunities and risks for U.S. policy. These trends must be considered alongside existing concerns like the Iranian nuclear program and terrorism. Understanding Arab political change should inform U.S. policy on various issues. For more information, refer to select reports available on CRS.gov. Several CRS reports provide analysis on political transitions and U.S. policy in the Middle East and North Africa, covering countries like Egypt, Iran, Syria, Libya, Israel, Tunisia, and Bahrain. Additionally, there is a report on U.S. trade and investment in the region."
