    "content": "The CDC estimates that influenza causes 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations in the US annually. Demand for flu vaccine has increased, leading to supply imbalances and wastage. The shortage of flu vaccine in 2004 raised concerns about the nation's ability to provide this life-saving product. Chiron, a biotechnology company, had production suspended in England, impacting the supply of flu vaccine for the US market. Aventis-Pasteur and MedImmune were the alternative suppliers of flu vaccine in 2004 after Chiron's production suspension, with Aventis producing 58 million doses and MedImmune producing 2 million doses of live virus vaccine. The company announced it could increase production, but LAIV is not licensed for high-risk groups. The Defense Department sought LAIV for healthy recruits going overseas. CDC re-defined high-risk groups for vaccine priority and activated an Emergency Operations Center for tracking doses and flu season start. HHS and CDC emphasized Aventis vaccine doses availability. The CDC announced an allocation plan to distribute remaining vaccine doses to state health departments based on unmet needs. They also developed clinician recommendations for the use of antiviral drugs, estimating 40 million doses would be available, including 7 million purchased by HHS for low-income individuals. The FDA determined that none of the affected Chiron vaccine lots were safe for use. HHS authorized the use of a GlaxoSmithKline influenza vaccine, Fluarix, under an Investigational New Drug application, purchasing 1.2 million doses for distribution to areas most in need. The House Committee launched investigations into the FDA, HHS, and Chiron following a shortage of the influenza vaccine. The SEC and Justice Department also launched inquiries into Chiron's knowledge of the production failure. Several class-action stockholder lawsuits were filed against Chiron for not fulfilling its disclosure obligations regarding the imminent failure of its annual production. States responded to the vaccine shortage by redistributing doses, rationing, and investigating reports of price-gouging. Some states prohibited vaccine administration to non-priority individuals and held lotteries to distribute limited doses. By early December 2004, states reported that all priority groups had received the vaccine, with doses remaining. CDC suggested expanding vaccination recommendations to non-priority groups to prevent wastage of vaccine. In early December 2004, CDC officials reported a slow start to the influenza season with a drop-off in demand for flu vaccine. Some states relaxed restrictions on providers due to a patchwork of vaccine shortages and surpluses. CDC suggested expanding vaccination recommendations to non-priority groups to prevent wastage of vaccine. As of November 30, 2004, only one-third of high-priority individuals had been vaccinated, below the coverage rate for the prior season. A survey by the Harvard School of Public Health found that less than two-thirds of seniors seeking vaccination were successful, with over half of high-risk adults not attempting vaccination. The ACIP revised guidelines for vaccine distribution, aiming to maintain demand among unvaccinated high-risk individuals while avoiding a surplus at year's end. Manufacturers, distributors, and providers historically absorbed the cost of unused vaccine. Manufacturers, distributors, and providers absorbed the cost of unused vaccine. Concerns were raised about a surplus of vaccine doses, with discussions on financial responsibility. HHS planned to use federal funds for state immunization programs to purchase investigational flu vaccine doses from Germany. The CDC Director confirmed the use of state funds, which could potentially be reimbursed from other accounts. FY2005 appropriations were not yet available at the time of the purchase. In FY2005, Congress allocated $100 million to HHS for year-round influenza vaccine production. Concerns arose in 2004 when Chiron's plant suspension threatened the flu vaccine supply for the 2005-2006 season. Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline were considered as alternative suppliers. The production of flu vaccines is a complex process that can take several years. Manufacturers must grow the virus of interest while avoiding contamination. The influenza virus changes over time, making vaccine production challenging and prone to failure. Each year, the FDA selects three virus strains for the upcoming winter's flu vaccine based on global surveillance data. The chosen strains are incorporated into the vaccine, which typically includes at least one new strain each year. The selection process considers the dominance and severity of circulating strains, but obstacles like difficulty in growing certain strains can limit choices. The Fujian strain was included in the 2004-2005 flu vaccine after overcoming challenges in growing it in eggs. Large numbers of fertilized eggs are needed for vaccine production, requiring special care and FDA regulations to ensure safety and efficacy. This process is more complex than producing eggs for food and is a bottleneck in flu vaccine production, taking weeks and posing contamination risks. The flu vaccine production process is time-sensitive, with strains selected by February and vaccine made from August to November. Breakdowns, like the one with the Chiron vaccine, can lead to complete loss of the season's production. Optimizing the process by replacing egg-growth with cell culture methods is a promising option. Cell culture techniques offer a faster, more controlled, and space-efficient method for growing the flu virus compared to using eggs. This approach could improve the annual flu vaccine production cycle by reducing failures and allowing for quicker production restarts within a season. While not yet FDA-approved, cell culture methods are being explored in clinical trials funded by the NIH. However, potential challenges include evaluating the risk of cell components or genes contaminating the vaccine, as well as the need for existing manufacturers to renovate facilities and meet manufacturing standards. Flu vaccine production can be optimized by using reverse genetics to create \"vaccine strains\" with desired traits for immunity. Currently, strains are grown together in batches and sampled for traits, but reverse genetics allows for quicker and more reliable trait development. NIH-funded clinical trials are using reverse genetics to produce vaccine for avian influenza, in case it becomes a serious human pathogen. The safety and efficacy of flu vaccine produced using reverse genetics remains to be evaluated. There are potential consumer acceptance concerns, especially in Europe, due to the genetically modified organism. Global influenza surveillance can enhance annual flu vaccine production by improving strain selection speed and accuracy. However, predicting how the influenza virus will modify itself into dominant strains each year remains a challenge. Time is of the essence in producing vaccines once new strains causing illness emerge. The regular drifts and shifts in the viral genome pose additional obstacles for science to address. The relationship between the influenza virus and human immune response has existed for eons, leading to the need for annual flu vaccines. The flu vaccine shortage in 2004 raised questions about the government's ability to prevent such crises, with states taking the lead in vaccine distribution to high-risk individuals. States led in restricting vaccine distribution to high-risk individuals and prosecuting price-gouging. The federal government can regulate vaccine safety and efficacy but not distribution. The Public Health Service Act grants broad authority to control infectious diseases. HHS Secretary did not declare the flu vaccine shortage a public health emergency. Vaccination is a medical procedure done in non-governmental settings. The government plays a role in studying and recommending flu vaccination, as well as educating providers and the public. Research includes effectiveness in different risk groups and economic impacts like reduced absenteeism. Government-supported education efforts provide materials for providers and public service announcements to encourage vaccination. Federal policies drive private-sector demand for flu vaccines. The government, through various agencies like HHS, FDA, NIH, HRSA, and CDC, plays a key role in coordinating flu vaccine activities, ensuring safety and efficacy, conducting research, and administering compensation programs for vaccine injuries. The CDC administers grant programs and supports the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The Department of Defense maintains research programs for vaccines and administers vaccines to military personnel. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers vaccines to veterans within its healthcare system. The U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates veterinary biologics under the Virus, Serum and Toxin Act, ensuring safety and efficacy similar to human products. State and local governments oversee public health activities like vaccine clinics and immunization requirements for school attendance. Many states have restricted flu vaccine administration to priority individuals due to shortages. The production and availability of flu vaccines for the 2004-2005 season were impacted by historical demand and a shortage caused by the failure of one manufacturer. Despite efforts to gauge demand accurately, unused doses of flu vaccine have been reported in the last five seasons. Demand for flu vaccine has increased over the past ten years due to a growing number of high-risk groups and interest from low-risk groups. Vaccine manufacturers aim to avoid losses from surplus doses by accurately gauging demand each year. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended expanding flu vaccine coverage to include healthy young children aged 6 to 23 months for the 2004-2005 season. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended expanding flu vaccine coverage to include healthy young children aged 6 to 23 months. Medicare began covering the full cost of flu vaccine and administration in 1993 to encourage vaccination. The Healthy People 2010 project set a goal of 90% influenza vaccine coverage for high-risk groups. CDC published guidance in 2000 to increase flu vaccination coverage in institutionalized populations through standing orders programs. In 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) removed the physician signature requirement for flu vaccine. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) removed the physician signature requirement for flu vaccine for Medicare and Medicaid participating facilities. The ACIP recommends healthcare workers receive flu vaccine as it reduces mortality in elderly residents. The path of flu vaccine from manufacturers to distribution is complex and largely outside of government control. Vaccine may be transferred through multiple distributors along the way. CDC has access to distribution information for purchased products, but almost 90% of the product is circulated outside of government. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted the lack of a means to redirect flu vaccine during a shortage, a system that would depend on centralized tracking. In response to the 2004 shortage, HHS Secretary Thompson announced the setup of a secure website for state health officials to identify available vaccine. Aventis and its distributors provided proprietary information for the site, marking the first time such a system was used to track flu vaccine. FDA waived its prohibition against vaccine transfer among healthcare entities to facilitate reallocation efforts during the shortage. In response to the 2004 flu vaccine shortage, CDC and ACIP issued interim recommendations for priority groups to receive the limited doses. The target population was reduced from 185 million to 98 million, with an estimated 43 million doses needed for vaccination. CDC and ACIP acknowledged the shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, with about 43 million doses needed for priority groups. Despite efforts, reallocation of remaining vaccine was imperfect. The ACIP revised guidelines on December 17, 2004, recommending vaccination for individuals aged 50-64 and caregivers of high-risk individuals. Health departments were advised to delay expanded recommendations until January 3, 2005, to allow time for high-priority groups to seek vaccination. The shortage of flu vaccine in 2004 led to the abandonment of actions to encourage vaccination in lower-risk groups for that season. Federal recommendations for flu vaccine were revised before and after the shortage, with a focus on prioritizing high-risk individuals. During the 2004 flu vaccine shortage, states and localities issued orders prioritizing vaccine distribution to high-risk individuals. Some declared a public health emergency and imposed fines for administering vaccine to non-priority groups. Restrictions were relaxed when doses remained after high-risk individuals were vaccinated. During the 2004 flu vaccine shortage, states prioritized vaccine distribution to high-risk individuals. CDC lacked authority to compel manufacturers to provide information on supplies. Outgoing HHS Secretary did not declare a public health emergency or control vaccine distribution. CDC aimed to coordinate vaccine doses in distribution. CDC's plan to identify vaccine doses in distribution and coordinate a three-part information exchange for unmet need, available vaccine, and circulating flu virus is a new effort in preparedness for public health emergencies. Rationing of scarce resources, such as vaccines, has been done before in health-related services, with examples like organ donation and dialysis. Not all attempts at rationing have been successful, as seen in the 1960s when a hospital committee tried to ration dialysis based on \"social worth,\" leading to heavy criticism. Oregon developed a rationing system for its Medicaid program in the late 1980s, prioritizing coverage for those below the poverty line based on cost-effectiveness and medical service importance. The system caused controversy for explicitly involving rationing and determining which services would be covered. The Oregon Medicaid program implemented a rationing system in the late 1980s, prioritizing coverage based on cost-effectiveness and medical service importance. Despite moral difficulties, allocation of scarce medical resources is necessary when supply is insufficient. Various rationing mechanisms can be used, such as giving preference to those most likely to suffer health consequences. These mechanisms may be applied during an influenza pandemic or bioterrorism event. The Oregon Medicaid program implemented a rationing system in the late 1980s, prioritizing coverage based on cost-effectiveness and medical service importance. Various rationing mechanisms can be used, such as giving preference to those most likely to suffer health consequences during an influenza pandemic or bioterrorism event. Vaccine allocation prioritizes those most vulnerable to serious health effects from flu infection, but does not address the impact on essential services or stopping the spread of the flu. The Oregon Medicaid program implemented a rationing system in the late 1980s, prioritizing coverage based on cost-effectiveness and medical service importance. Various rationing mechanisms can be used, such as giving preference to those most likely to suffer health consequences during an influenza pandemic or bioterrorism event. Vaccine allocation prioritizes those most vulnerable to serious health effects from flu infection, but does not address the impact on essential services or stopping the spread of the flu. In vaccine distribution, special relationships can be a factor where certain individuals, like prisoners and military personnel, are given priority for vaccination. This method has been recommended by the American Civil Liberties Union for at-risk prisoners. In a selection system based on those most likely to spread disease, populations known for rapidly transmitting infection are vaccinated first, such as children and prisoners. Some scientific studies recommend this method to curb the spread of disease. Lottery system for vaccine allocation does not prioritize specific populations, but may face challenges in registration and communication with winners. It fails to address the impact of an epidemic on essential services and the state's obligation to those in custody. First come-first served selection system allocates vaccine to those who arrive first at a designated time and place. It is easy to coordinate but favors those with flexible schedules and transportation. It does not address the impact of an epidemic on social services and infrastructure. Some recent scientific studies suggest two additional methods of rationing vaccine based on effectiveness in different populations. One study found that vaccine is more effective in some populations than others, suggesting doses could be withheld from less effective groups. However, this may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations like the elderly. Another study found that less than a full dose of some flu vaccines may still be effective. One study suggests withholding vaccine doses from less effective groups, potentially affecting vulnerable populations. Another study found that a partial dose of some flu vaccines may still be effective, leading to the possibility of rationing by giving certain populations less than a full dose. This strategy has not been fully evaluated for effectiveness and was not implemented during the 2004 vaccine shortage. Some minority groups are less likely to participate in vaccination programs, so a rationing system could include mechanisms to encourage their participation. Various rationing methods may be used alone or in combination, with priority given to key personnel. During the 2004 flu season, states and localities used various rationing methods based on federal guidelines to prioritize vaccination for individuals most likely to suffer health consequences or spread the virus, as well as key personnel. Reports of price gouging by distributors were widespread following the announcement of the vaccine shortage. The announcement of a vaccine shortage led to widespread reports of price gouging by distributors, prompting lawsuits from Attorneys General in several states. Most states have laws against price gouging, and HHS urged aggressive prosecution of offenders. State action is needed to address vaccine price-gouging, as neither CDC nor FDA has the authority to act in this matter. HHS supported a price-gouging lawsuit in Florida, highlighting the public health threat posed by price gouging. The House Committee on Government Reform called for an investigation into flu vaccine price-gouging, citing risks to Medicare and Medicaid eligible patients. The Federal Trade Commission may take action under its general authority to prevent unfair practices. Vaccine supply for the U.S. market is primarily controlled by private, for-profit firms. The supply of flu vaccine in the U.S. is privately controlled, with CDC purchasing 11.4 million doses for the 2004-2005 season. The public purchase price ranged from $6.80 to $10.00 per dose, lower than private sector prices. Manufacturers face disincentives like poor profitability and production risks, while policymakers cite issues like few manufacturers and low vaccination rates. The 2004 flu vaccine shortage was caused by production failure of a company holding 50% market share, as there were only two companies producing injectable flu vaccine for the U.S. market. It is suggested that increased public purchase of vaccine could have helped by shifting the risk of over-production from manufacturers to the government. Having more manufacturers involved is seen as essential to mitigate the consequences of a single manufacturer's failure. Having more manufacturers involved is crucial to mitigate the impact of a single manufacturer's failure in flu vaccine supply. Diversification may reduce incentives for existing manufacturers, similar to issues discussed in Project BioShield for bioterrorism countermeasures. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 allows the temporary authorization of emergency use of non-licensed drugs and vaccines. The Secretary of HHS has the authority to authorize emergency use of non-licensed drugs and vaccines, including locating flu vaccine in other countries to address shortages. Congress is considering legislation to address concerns and expand vaccine production capacity. Making flu vaccine is not highly profitable and technically difficult, with lot failures not uncommon. Flu vaccine production challenges include time constraints due to using eggs, limited shelf life, and potential overestimation of demand leading to unused vaccine being discarded. Manufacturers face pressure to make sound business decisions and maintain transparency. Chiron faced inquiries and lawsuits following the failure of its flu vaccine production in 2004-2005. In December 2004, Chiron faced extended suspension of its Liverpool plant, impacting vaccine production for the upcoming season. Uncertainty around Chiron's status poses challenges for CDC in setting production targets. Proposals have been made to incentivize vaccine manufacturers and ensure market demand to increase annual supply. Government Buy-Back of Surplus proposes federal purchase of unused vaccine to encourage manufacturers to produce more, increasing supply. Congress allocated $100 million in FY2005 for year-round flu vaccine production capacity, potentially for purchasing surplus vaccine. The federal government proposed purchasing flu vaccine at the beginning of the season as a cushion if needed, but flu vaccine's short shelf life makes it less suitable for stockpiling compared to products like smallpox vaccine. CDC bought 4.5 million doses of flu vaccine for the 2004-2005 season at a cost of $40 million. The federal government purchased 4.5 million doses of flu vaccine for the 2004-2005 season at a cost of $40 million. Aventis produced 2.5 million doses to address the shortage, but it was insufficient. Stockpile purchasing could attract new manufacturers to enter the market, but they face significant regulatory and financial hurdles. Some propose tax credits to help new manufacturers enter the US flu vaccine market despite high costs and regulatory barriers. Aventis executive views injury liability as a business cost. Difficulty in obtaining information on the deterrent effect of liability claims on vaccine availability. Vaccine manufacturers can purchase insurance for protection against liability claims. Two potential avenues for protection against injury liability claims include purchasing insurance to cover costs and incorporating costs into the price of vaccines. Certain vaccines are covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which was established as a no-fault alternative to the tort system for resolving claims resulting from adverse reactions to mandated childhood vaccines. Individuals alleging injury from covered vaccines must seek compensation through the program first. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) program provides compensation for vaccine-associated adverse events, reduces liability for manufacturers and healthcare workers, and stabilizes vaccine markets. Some criticize the program's administration and performance. Federal agencies purchase vaccines at discounted prices, affecting overall vaccine market attractiveness. Examples include CDC purchases for uninsured children and Veterans Administration purchases. Medicare payment rates for flu vaccines have doubled. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have increased Medicare payment rates for the flu vaccine to $18.30 in 2004 to ensure beneficiaries can access it. An Institute of Medicine (IOM) panel recommended a new financing approach to ensure affordable vaccine coverage for target groups, but its implementation has not been widely accepted. Influenza circulates globally each year, with slight changes that provide partial immunity to healthy adults. However, a pandemic can occur when the virus changes significantly, resulting in severe illness and death. The CDC estimates that a pandemic in the US could cause over 200,000 deaths, disrupting services and social order. Concerns have been raised about the 2004 flu vaccine shortage impacting the national response to a pandemic. The 2004 flu vaccine shortage raised concerns about national pandemic preparedness. Issues included logistics of vaccine distribution, fairness in handling the shortage, limited resources, and equity in allocation. Severe vaccine shortages are expected during an influenza pandemic, with plans from WHO and HHS emphasizing infection control practices and guidance for handling large numbers of victims. The WHO advises countries to consider how to allocate the limited worldwide production capacity for influenza vaccine, prioritizing critical service providers like healthcare workers. Americans are used to deferring to the most vulnerable during vaccine shortages, but a pandemic may require a different approach. Some in Congress are concerned about U.S. flu vaccine supply being produced in foreign facilities, fearing that foreign governments may seize vaccines during emergencies. The global flu vaccine market is complex, with production in nine countries and companies based in one country but operating in multiple others. Aventis and Chiron are the only FDA-licensed companies producing injectable flu vaccine for the U.S. market. The FDA is producing injectable flu vaccine for the U.S. market, with other companies showing interest in future licensing. Concerns exist about access to antiviral drugs and healthcare facilities during a flu pandemic, leading to potential degradation of care. Providers seek federal guidance on managing mass casualty situations. The 2004 flu vaccine shortage highlights the concept of dual use in public health preparedness. The CDC's flu vaccine reallocation plan is a useful model for various public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. Efforts to enhance bioterrorism preparedness have also benefited pandemic preparedness. Advancements in pandemic influenza vaccine development will also improve annual flu vaccine production. The public response to government recommendations during the 2004 shortage showed that those not in priority groups mostly deferred vaccination. The public response to government recommendations during the 2004 flu vaccine shortage showed that many high-risk individuals did not seek vaccination due to doubts about availability. Questions remain about federal authority in controlling scarce vaccine doses and administration during an influenza pandemic. Compliance with recommendations is expected to be imperfect and should be considered in public health planning. The flu vaccine shortage raises questions about federal authority in managing scarce vaccine doses during public health emergencies. The current model relies on state authorities with federal assistance, but challenges arise in equitable distribution of remedies and burdens. Federal officials may struggle to take charge effectively in emergencies due to existing laws and traditions. The federal government does not dictate medical practices or compel businesses, allowing free market forces to operate during public health emergencies. Overcoming barriers since 2001, states have improved preparedness planning with uniform guidance for mass drug distribution. Decentralization of public health authority to states is manageable if all can respond effectively and consistently. The government uses proprietary information for surveillance during health events like the flu vaccine shortage. Legislative proposals aimed at addressing flu vaccine production or shortages include subjecting it to an excise tax. This provision was passed in P.L. 108-357, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Flu Protection Act of 2004, H.R. 3758, aims to increase influenza vaccine awareness, ensure vaccine supply, and prepare for a pandemic. Another bill, H.R. 5243, the Influenza Vaccine Emergency Act, focuses on emergency distribution of influenza vaccine. The Public Health Service Act was amended to address the shortage of influenza vaccine through various bills introduced in 2004. These bills aimed to provide emergency distributions of influenza vaccine, prohibit price-gouging during shortages, and enhance protections against chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents. Several bills were introduced in 2003 to address public health concerns related to biological, chemical, and radiological weapons. These bills aimed to increase research for countermeasures, improve vaccine affordability and availability, and include influenza vaccines in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Several bills were introduced in 2003 to address public health concerns related to biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, including the addition of hepatitis A and trivalent influenza vaccines to taxable vaccines. Additional bills in 2004 aimed to ensure an adequate supply and distribution of influenza vaccines and address shortages through various acts like The Flu Protection Act, The Influenza Preparation and Vaccination Act, and The Emergency Flu Response Act. The Flu Vaccine Incentive Act of 2004 aimed to encourage influenza vaccine production by eliminating price caps and providing tax credits. Appropriations bills for FY2004 and FY2005 included funding for influenza vaccine research and stockpile purchase. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 8, 2004, allocated funds for vaccine research and purchase. Various congressional hearings in November and October 2004 discussed issues related to the flu vaccine market, shortage, liability, and BioShield legislation. Various congressional hearings in 2004 addressed topics such as Influenza Vaccine, Influenza and the Elderly, Mercury and Autism, Global Diseases Programs Appropriations, Health System Preparedness, and the federal role in the flu vaccine shortage. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted an investigation into the shortage, requesting information from relevant parties. The House Committee on Government Reform is investigating FDA's role in the shutdown of the Chiron plant. They requested information from the Acting FDA Commissioner in October 2004. Additionally, various CRS reports on Vaccine Policy Issues, Project BioShield, Avian Influenza, and Isolation and Quarantine Authority were mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and testimonies related to public health emergencies, flu vaccine supply shortages, infectious disease preparedness, and childhood vaccines. It highlights the ongoing challenges and improvements in response capacity. Various reports and testimonies address public health emergencies, flu vaccine supply shortages, infectious disease preparedness, and childhood vaccines. The challenges and improvements in response capacity are highlighted. The CDC Influenza Home Page provides information for health professionals and the general public, including guidelines related to the current vaccine shortage. The CDC National Immunization Program Home Page offers information about CDC-funded vaccine purchases. The FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research provides information about influenza virus vaccine production for the 2004-2005 season. The HRSA National Vaccine Injury Compensation program is also mentioned. The curr_chunk provides additional resources related to influenza vaccine production and safety issues, including links to the HRSA National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases influenza Home Page, WHO Influenza Home Page, and relevant research articles.
