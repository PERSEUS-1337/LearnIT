    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act of 2011\". It includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, \"hydrologic condition\" as water quality and quantity, and \"owner or operator of a water system\" as entities responsible for water systems. The term \"water system\" includes community water systems, treatment works, and decentralized wastewater treatment systems for domestic sewage. The curr_chunk describes various components of a water system, including domestic sewage treatment, groundwater storage, water transport for irrigation, and floodwater management. The curr_chunk focuses on water infrastructure resiliency and sustainability. The Administrator will establish the \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program\" to award grants for improving water systems' adaptability to changing hydrologic conditions. Grant recipients must use funds for projects that conserve water or enhance water use efficiency. The \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program\" will award grants for projects such as conserving water, modifying water system infrastructure, preserving water quality, constructing water facilities, and enhancing water management. The \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program\" grants support projects involving green infrastructure, energy efficiency, advanced water treatment, and water demand management to improve water supply and quality for existing communities and agricultural land. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program grants support projects to improve water supply and quality for existing communities and agricultural land through practices like improved irrigation systems, water banking, groundwater recharge, and stormwater capture. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program grants aim to reduce flood damage and vulnerability by restoring floodplains, modifying levees, acquiring flood-prone land, and promoting land use planning to prevent future floodplain development. Studies and assessments are also conducted to support these efforts. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program grants focus on conducting studies to project the impact of changing hydrologic conditions on water systems and developing measures to increase resilience to rapid hydrologic changes or natural disasters. To apply for a grant, the owner or operator of a water system must submit a proposal for program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement, along with supporting research or data. The proposed program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement must demonstrate the risk to water resources and infrastructure from changing hydrological conditions, and how it would perform under these conditions. It should also describe how it will enhance the resiliency of the water system to anticipated hydrologic conditions. The proposed program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement must demonstrate the risk to water resources and infrastructure from changing hydrologic conditions. Priority will be given to water systems at the greatest and most immediate risk of facing significant negative impacts. The proposal should align with applicable climate adaptation plans. The Administrator selects applicants based on innovative approaches to meet goals such as promoting efficient water use, using low-impact development technologies, reducing stormwater runoff, and enhancing natural ecosystem functions. (D) Modifying, upgrading, enhancing, or replacing existing water system infrastructure in response to changing hydrologic conditions. Improving water quality or quantity for agricultural and municipal uses, including through salinity reduction. Providing multiple benefits, including water supply enhancement, water quality protection, increased flood protection, and ecosystem improvement. Cost-sharing requirement for grants awarded by the Administrator to water system owners or operators. The non-Federal share of the cost of a water system program or improvement under this Act should not exceed 50 percent, and in-kind services can be included in the calculation. The Administrator must report to Congress within 3 years. The Administrator must report to Congress every 3 years on the progress of implementing the Act, including information on project applications received and funded annually. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $50,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2012-2016. 20% limit on funds for flood damage reduction activities."
