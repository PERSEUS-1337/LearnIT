    "content": "The federal government supports the charitable sector through favorable tax treatment, including tax deductions for charitable contributions and exempting earnings on funds held by charitable organizations from federal income tax. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made temporary changes that reduced the tax benefit for charitable giving, leading to more individuals taking the standard deduction and exempting more estates from the estate tax, potentially reducing charitable donations. The report discusses changes in tax provisions affecting the charitable sector, including potential effects on charitable giving. It focuses on the magnitude of charitable deductions, sources, beneficiaries, and historical data. The report also addresses the incentive effects of deductions and policy options for charitable organizations. 501(c)(3) organizations are part of the broader nonprofit sector, which includes various tax-exempt organizations such as charities, social welfare groups, and political organizations. Most financial activity in the tax-exempt sector occurs within 501(c)(3) organizations, which are classified as either public charities or private foundations. In 2015, there were 1,088,447 registered 501(c)(3) public charities, with 314,744 reporting public charities filing Form 990 to disclose finances and activities. Private foundations file Form 990-PF, while smaller organizations are not required to file annually. Tax-exempt organizations, including private foundations, file Form 990-PF annually. Smaller organizations may file an electronic notice. Churches and qualifying religious organizations are exempt from annual reporting. Exempt organizations' informational returns are public. Tax-exempt organizations may need to file an income tax return for unrelated business income. Changes to unrelated business income tax (UBIT) took effect in 2018. Additionally, tax-exempt organizations must pay employment taxes. Tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofits, must pay employment taxes and file various tax returns. Federal statute provides tax preferences for charitable organizations, such as tax-deductible donations and exemption from most income taxes. Some tax benefits are considered \"tax expenditures\" by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The primary tax expenditure for charities is the charitable deduction, which allows individual taxpayers and corporations to deduct charitable donations to qualifying organizations. Contributions can also result in state and local tax benefits, such as property or sales tax exemptions. The charitable deduction allows individuals and corporations to deduct donations to qualifying organizations. Contributions to certain organizations are not deductible. There are limits on the deduction for charitable contributions based on the type of organization and the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Donations of appreciated property have lower deduction limits. Limits for long-term capital gain property donations to public charities, private foundations, or government are 30% of AGI, while contributions to other qualifying organizations are limited to 20% of AGI. Individuals can carry forward excess contributions for up to five years. Corporate charitable contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income. Transferring property to a charity can be a deductible charitable contribution or a business expense, but not both. Corporations can also carry forward excess contributions. Individuals and corporations can carry forward charitable contributions exceeding percentage limits for up to five years. Rules for valuing contributions vary, with cash donations valued at the amount donated. For property donations, deductions may be limited to fair market value, tax basis, or other amounts. Taxpayers can usually deduct the full fair market value of long-term capital gain property. Deductions for tangible personal property related to a charity's tax-exempt purpose may also be allowed. In some cases, deductions may be limited to the donor's tax basis in the property. Deductions for contributions of property may be limited to basis for contributions of inventory or short-term capital gain property, contributions of tangible personal property used for a purpose unrelated to the recipient's exempt purpose, or contributions to private foundations. Donations of appreciated stock to private nonoperating foundations are not subject to this limit and may be deducted using fair market value. Contributions of patents or other intellectual property may also be limited to the donor's basis in the property. Special rules provide an enhanced deduction for C corporations contributing inventory to 501(c)(3) organizations. The tax code provides enhanced deductions for C corporations contributing inventory to 501(c)(3) organizations for charitable purposes. Special rules also apply to donations of food inventory, vehicles, intellectual property, and clothing/household items. Tax-free distributions from IRAs for charitable purposes are allowed, benefiting nonitemizers by excluding the distribution from income. Charitable deductions are generally allowed only if the donor transfers their full interest in the property to a qualified recipient organization. Conservation contributions allow for charitable donations of conservation easements, protecting land, habitats, and historic sites without giving up ownership. Special rules increase the limit for appreciated property contributions for conservation purposes to 50% of AGI for individuals and 100% for farmers and ranchers. Excess contributions can be carried forward for 15 years. Individuals can also deduct donations of property with income rights for themselves or others in the future. In a charitable remainder trust, assets are transferred to a trust with a deduction taken for the future donation. Donors can receive income from the trust until death. Appreciated assets can be donated to the tax-exempt trust. The 2017 tax revision reduced the tax expenditure associated with charitable deductions. The revision expanded the AGI limit for individual cash contributions to public charities from 50% to 60% through 2025. The tax revision in 2017, including changes like the expanded standard deduction and limits on state and local tax deductions, reduced the number of itemizers and the incentive to give to charity for many taxpayers. Recent legislation has eliminated the AGI limit for charitable contributions made for disaster relief purposes, such as for Hurricane Harvey, Irma, or Maria, and the 2017 California wildfires. The JCT's tax expenditure budget includes various charitable tax expenditures, such as deductions for charitable giving and tax-exempt bonds. In FY2019, the tax expenditure for charitable deductions was $45.1 billion, down from $61.0 billion in FY2017. The decline is due to fewer taxpayers itemizing deductions after the 2017 tax revision. The tax expenditure for charitable deductions in FY2019 was $45.1 billion, a decrease from $61.0 billion in FY2017 due to fewer taxpayers itemizing deductions after the 2017 tax revision. Most of the forgone revenue from the charitable deduction comes from individual giving, with additional revenue effects from tax-exempt bonds for nonprofit institutions and hospitals. In 2015, charities had $32.6 billion in investment income, $35.8 billion in net capital gains, $4.0 billion in net rental income, and $3.9 billion in royalties. If subject to a 35% income tax, $26.7 billion in revenue would have been raised. Charities reported $3.8 trillion in assets, with a significant portion held in university endowments. A significant share of investment assets in charities, valued at $0.6 trillion in FY2018, is held in university endowments. Private foundations, often with a single donor or small group of donors, invest donated funds for future charitable donations. Contributions to foundations benefit from tax deductions and investment earnings exemptions. Concerns about foundations retaining earnings indefinitely have led to regulations. Tax laws require private foundations to have a minimum payout rate of 5% of assets and restrict activities that may benefit donors. The tax code imposes taxes and penalties for self-dealing, failure to distribute income, investments that jeopardize charitable purposes, and taxable expenditures. Private foundations are subject to a 2% excise tax on net investment income, which can be reduced to 1% with increased charitable distributions. In FY2017, excise taxes on private foundations generated $643.6 million in revenue. Donor-advised funds allow individuals to make tax-deductible gifts to sponsoring organizations. Donor-advised funds (DAFs) are sponsored by charities that can receive tax-deductible donations. Donors make recommendations for grants, but the sponsoring organizations ultimately decide on the recipients. DAFs have grown rapidly, with 463,622 individual DAFs in 2017, totaling $29.2 billion in contributions and $110.0 billion in assets. Recommended grants amounted to $19.1 billion. In 2018, Fidelity Charity managed donor-advised funds (DAFs) totaling $29.2 billion in contributions and $110.0 billion in assets. More than 200,000 donors had accounts at Fidelity Charity, with grants exceeding $5.2 billion. DAFs are organized by various charities, including national charities, community foundations, and single-issue charities. Supporting organizations, like DAFs, provide grants to public charities and can be categorized into Type I, Type II, and Type III organizations based on their structure and support for charities. A Type III non-FISO endowment fund has additional restrictions, including distributing 85% of net income or 3.5% of nonexempt-use assets. Private universities face scrutiny for growing endowment sizes alongside increasing tuition. The 2017 tax revision imposed a 1.4% excise tax on net investment income of nonprofit colleges and universities with assets over $500,000 per full-time student. This tax was expected to generate $0.2 billion annually. Private nonprofit hospitals must meet a community benefit standard to maintain tax-exempt status and eligibility for tax-deductible contributions and bond financing. This standard includes providing charity care, participating in means-tested programs like Medicaid, funding community health improvement, and making contributions to promote the health of the community. The IRS requires private nonprofit hospitals to meet a community benefit standard to maintain tax-exempt status. This includes providing charity care, participating in means-tested programs, funding community health improvement, and complying with additional requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2014, tax-exempt hospitals reported $63.0 billion in total net community benefit expenses, with $12.7 billion for charity care and $26.3 billion for unreimbursed means-tested costs. Studies estimated federal, state, and local subsidies for tax-exempt hospitals to be $24.6 billion in 2011. Nonprofit hospitals' community benefit expenses were 7.63% of total expenses in 2012, with incremental community benefits estimated at 5.71% of expenses. Charitable bequests from estates can be deducted from the estate tax, with a 40% rate on amounts above the exempted value. The estate tax exemption was temporarily doubled through 2025. Transfers to a spouse at death are excluded from the estate tax, and any unused exemption can be added to the second spouse's. Due to the large exemption, only a small share of estates are subject to the estate tax, impacting the amount of bequests benefiting from the charitable deduction. The data from decedents dying in 2013 showed $18.1 billion of bequests reported on estate tax returns, with $10.2 billion on taxable returns. Bequests on nontaxable returns may benefit from the tax deduction, with a revenue cost estimated at $4.0 billion to $7.2 billion. Estimates suggest a revenue cost of $4 billion to $5 billion post-2017 tax revision. Charitable sector data show $3.8 trillion in total assets for 501(c)(3) organizations in 2015. In 2015, 501(c)(3) organizations reported $3.8 trillion in total assets and $2.0 trillion in total revenues. Most filers are small or medium-sized charities, while large organizations with at least $10 million in assets hold the majority of assets, revenues, and contributions. Charitable contributions account for 12.9% of revenues, with program services being the primary revenue source at 73.1%. Charitable organizations' revenue sources depend on the type of charity, with program services like tuition and hospital payments being the main source. Charitable giving has increased over time, with total giving reaching $375.9 billion in 2015. In 2018, estimated total giving was $427.7 billion, accounting for 2.1% of GDP. Charitable giving has varied over time and across business cycles since 1978, averaging 1.9% of GDP. In 1995, the smallest share was 1.6% of GDP, while the largest share was in 2000 at 2.2% of GDP. Private contributions come from individuals, foundations, bequests, and corporate giving. In 2018, individuals were the largest source of charitable giving at $292.1 billion (68.0%), followed by foundations, bequests, and corporate giving. Individual giving as a percentage of GDP decreased by 6.0% between 2017 and 2018 due to fewer taxpayers itemizing deductions and lower tax rates. Bequests as a percentage of GDP also fell by 4.9% following tax law changes. Corporate charitable giving remained relatively stable with a slight increase of 0.3%. Giving from foundations as a percentage of GDP increased by 2.0% between 2017 and 2018, with religious charities receiving the largest share of charitable giving at 29.1% in 2018. Education ranked next at 13.7%, followed by human services at 12.1%, gifts to foundations at 11.8%, and health at 9.5%. Giving to most beneficiaries as a percentage of GDP fell between 2017 and 2018, except for gifts to international affairs. Giving to public-society benefit organizations and religious organizations as a percentage of GDP also decreased. In 2018, giving to religious organizations as a percentage of GDP fell by 6.4%, while giving to education as a percentage of GDP fell by 6.2%. Gifts to foundations experienced a larger decline, falling by 11.5%. Giving to religion and foundations has declined over time, while giving to most other beneficiaries has increased. Understanding how tax incentives influence charitable giving is crucial, as individuals give for various reasons. Tax benefits can influence charitable giving by reducing the cost of giving, with the federal government subsidizing charitable donations. The incentive effect is determined by the donor's marginal income tax rate for ordinary donations and gifts of appreciated property. Bequests are affected by the estate tax rate, but only a small fraction of estates are subject to tax. Corporate giving may be influenced by the corporate tax rate. Taxes also have income effects on charitable giving. Charitable giving is influenced by tax benefits, with deductions providing an incentive for donations. Prior to the 2017 tax revision, the majority of individuals' charitable giving was deducted. In 2016, $233.9 billion in charitable deductions were reported on tax returns, with approximately 80% benefiting from some subsidy. Approximately 80% of charitable deductions benefited from a subsidy in 2016. Taxpayers with higher incomes made up a significant portion of charitable contributions. The 2017 tax revision is expected to reduce the number of itemizers due to changes in deductions, such as a cap on state and local taxes. The Tax Policy Center estimated that the share of households benefiting from deducting charitable contributions would decrease from 21% to 9.1% due to the 2017 tax revision. Itemized charitable deductions were estimated to have fallen by about one-third, with a decrease from $212.1 billion to $143.1 billion as a result of the tax changes. Under prior law, charitable contributions itemized in 2016 would be projected at 54%, with tax savings falling by about a third. The steepest declines were in the middle and upper-middle income distribution. The average marginal tax rate across all donations fell from 20.7% to 15.2%. High-income taxpayers had a smaller share of cash contributions, with the price of charitable contributions for itemizers being (1-t), where t is the taxpayer's tax rate. The tax price for charitable contributions is (1-t), where t is the taxpayer's tax rate. Charitable giving is concentrated at higher income levels, and the effect of the incentive depends on the tax rate, which has fluctuated substantially since 1913. The top tax rate in the US has seen significant reductions over the years, from 70% in the past to 28% in 1986. Changes in tax rates impact the tax price of charitable giving, with fluctuations affecting the subsidy from the charitable deduction. The 2017 rate change had a relatively small effect compared to earlier changes, with the tax price rising by 6.9% across all taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center estimated a 6.9% increase in the tax price for all taxpayers due to changes in itemized deductions and tax brackets. Donating appreciated property, such as stocks, is common among taxpayers with incomes over $500,000. Currently, taxpayers can deduct the full cost of donated property without paying capital gains tax. The tax price for charitable giving of appreciated property is affected by the capital gains tax rate. The tax price for charitable giving of appreciated property is influenced by changes in capital gains tax rates. Appreciated assets held for a long time with faster growth rates can lead to an increase in the price of giving. Changes in capital gains tax rates can impact the price of giving, sometimes offsetting the effects of changes in ordinary rates. The estate tax exemption was doubled in 2017, reducing the number of estates subject to the tax. According to the TPC, the estate tax affected 0.2% of deaths before the exemption increase, which dropped to 0.1% after. IRS data from 2013 showed $18.1 billion in bequests, with $10.2 billion taxable. Between 30% and 53% of bequests received estate tax deductions. The estate tax rate is 40%, and the capital gains tax rate does not apply to assets passed on at death. The estate tax rate has fluctuated over time, with rates ranging from 77% post-World War II to 40% in 2013. There were reductions to 55% in 1981, 45% in 2007, and a repeal in 2010 with retroactive options. The tax rate was temporarily set at 35% in 2011 and 2012 before returning to 40% in 2013. The estate tax rates have varied over time, with a high of 77% post-World War II and a low of 40% in 2013. Significant price changes were fewer for bequests compared to inter-vivos gifts. Recent increases in exemptions have made the tax subsidy less applicable for charitable bequests, especially for large estates. Most charitable contributions benefiting from the tax subsidy come from estates of $20 million or more. Most charitable contributions benefiting from the tax subsidy would continue to do so under the new exemption level. Corporate giving is a small share of total giving, with total contributions of $15.9 billion in 2013 and $20.05 billion in 2018. The incentive effects for corporate giving depend on the motivation, with the corporate tax rate impacting the donation's effect on profit. The corporate tax rate has changed infrequently, with a decrease from 46% in 1981 to 34% in 1986. The corporate tax rate has fluctuated over the years, decreasing to 34% in 1986 and then increasing to 35% in 1993. It remained at this level until 2018 when it was reduced to 21%, resulting in a 25% tax price increase. Opportunities exist to enhance tax benefits for charitable contributions by accumulating untaxed earnings. For example, a dollar donated today to a tax-exempt charity and spent a year later would provide $1.10 in resources. The tax price of giving in a tax-exempt case is $0.61, compared to $0.63 in a taxable case. The tax price of giving is $0.61 in a tax-exempt case and $0.63 in a taxable case. Holding assets longer by a tax-exempt entity benefits charitable organizations, with $2.69 available after 10 years compared to $1.84 after paying taxes. Various methods, such as foundations and DAFs, allow for accumulating funds without tax on earnings. Taxing earnings at the corporate rate would reduce the incentive for high individual marginal tax rates. The tax price of giving is affected by changes in tax rates, but historical data shows little impact on charitable contributions as a percentage of GDP. Despite tax price increases at higher incomes, giving remained relatively stable. Contributions to charitable organizations as a percentage of GDP remained stable despite changes in tax incentives. Economists have used various statistical methods to estimate the effects of tax incentives on charitable giving, with little historical evidence suggesting a significant response to these changes. Price elasticity is used to measure the impact of tax price changes on charitable contributions. The price elasticity of charitable contributions is a negative number, indicating a decrease in giving with a tax price increase. Early estimates showed responsiveness to tax rate changes, but temporary effects and income fluctuations can skew results. Timing plays a role, with higher tax brackets prompting more giving. Statistical estimates are challenging due to these factors. The price elasticity of charitable contributions is negative, indicating a decrease in giving with a tax price increase. Studies show an elasticity of around -0.5, suggesting a 3.5% decline in individual charitable contributions due to the 2017 tax revision. This could result in a decline of around $11 billion in charitable contributions. The 2017 tax revision had a significant impact on charitable giving, with a decline in individual contributions and a decrease in giving as a percentage of GDP. The elimination of charitable deductions for middle and upper-middle-income taxpayers led to a decline of $13 billion in charitable giving. The 2017 tax revision significantly affected charitable giving, with a decline in individual contributions and giving as a percentage of GDP. Charitable deductions for middle and upper-middle-income taxpayers were eliminated, leading to a $13 billion decrease in charitable giving. The majority of charitable tax incentives are claimed by high-income individuals, with 91.5% of the benefit accruing to the top quintile. Higher-income individuals give a larger share of their contributions to organizations focused on health. Higher-income individuals give a larger share of their contributions to organizations focused on health, education, arts, the environment, and international aid compared to lower-income individuals. Conversely, lower-income individuals give a larger share to organizations focused on religion, youth and family services, community improvement, and basic necessities. Charitable giving by families with income over $200,000 is more directed towards education and benefits for the poor compared to families with income under $200,000. The PSID data suggests that charitable giving shifts towards organizations benefiting health, education, arts, environment, and international aid as income levels increase. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act concentrated charitable incentives towards high-income taxpayers, leading to less focus on helping the poor. Giving to foundations declined in 2018, despite a surge in 2017, indicating a trend towards transitory giving. In 2017, foundations were the main beneficiaries of transitory giving, with other organizations like public society benefit, religious, and educational organizations experiencing declines in donations. International affairs, environment, animals, arts, and health organizations saw an increase in donations or smaller declines. Price elasticities for bequests vary significantly, with evidence suggesting they are more responsive to taxes than inter-vivos contributions. The recent changes in the exemption in the 2017 act have a complex effect on bequests reported on estate tax returns. With an elasticity of -2.0 used in calculations, it is challenging to determine the impact. A significant discrepancy exists between the share of bequests represented by taxable returns (30%) and all returns (53%). Some returns benefit from the charitable deduction, while a smaller share of taxable estate returns would fall below the exemption. For estates under $20 million, 92% of taxable returns and 74% of all returns would no longer be subject to the estate tax, resulting in potential losses of the tax incentive for 2.4% and 13.8% of bequests, respectively. The tax price increase for estates affected by the TCJA is 66%, leading to a reduction in affected estates of 64% with an elasticity of -2.0. This results in a decline in bequests ranging from $0.6 billion to $3.5 billion in 2017. Eliminating the charitable deduction or repealing the estate tax could further reduce bequests by $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion, depending on the elasticity. The National Council on Nonprofits estimated a decline in bequests of $4 billion due to the 2017 tax revision. Empirical studies on corporate giving responses to taxes are limited and mixed, making it difficult to determine the effects on giving responses. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2017 increased the tax price for corporate giving by 22%, benefiting managers. Corporate giving was the smallest share of total giving at $19.5 billion in 2017, so the impact of TCJA on overall corporate giving is likely small. Proposals to revise tax treatment of charitable giving aim to increase incentives for giving, address distribution of incentives, and prevent perceived abuses. Tax incentives for giving mainly benefit higher-income households who itemize deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions. The concentration of tax benefits on higher-income individuals favors certain charities like health, education, and the arts, while disadvantaging religion and human services charities. The 2017 tax revision increased incentives for charitable giving among higher-income earners. Policymakers have proposed various policies over time to address the distribution of incentives for charitable contributions. Policymakers have proposed policies to extend charitable tax benefits to all taxpayers, including above-the-line deductions for charitable giving introduced by Representative Danny Davis in the 116th Congress. Similar bills were introduced in previous Congresses as well. In the 116th Congress, legislation has been introduced for an above-the-line deduction for charitable giving by Representatives Danny Davis, Henry Cuellar, and Christopher Smith. Studies estimate the cost of a nonitemizer deduction to be between $14.4 billion and $16.1 billion in 2020, with another estimate at $25.8 billion in 2018. The efficiency of encouraging charitable contributions through policy options is debated, with studies showing varying effects on charitable giving. If the price elasticity of giving is less than 1.0, induced charitable giving may be less than the revenue cost. Brill and Choe found a smaller increase in charitable contributions compared to lost revenue when evaluating an above-the-line deduction. The Indiana University study analyzed the impact of different scenarios on charitable giving, with potential revenue losses due to taxpayers moving to the standard deduction. Giving increased by $8.4 billion, $16.8 billion, and $24.9 billion under different elasticity scenarios. An above-the-line deduction could reduce revenues by $15.0 billion in 2020 while generating $8.4 billion in additional charitable giving. In the income-based elasticity scenario, the revenue reduction in 2020 is $16.1 billion, with additional charitable giving estimated at $24.9 billion. Charitable deductions may be smaller than the revenue cost if elasticities are less than 1.0. Above-the-line deductions could lead to charitable contributions going to causes favored by lower- and middle-income taxpayers, such as religion, youth and family services, community improvement, and providing basic necessities. The Indiana University study suggests providing enhanced nonitemizer deductions for charitable contributions, with single filers under $20,000 income able to deduct 200% and those under $40,000 able to deduct 150%. This policy could result in revenue losses of $15.9 billion to $18.2 billion in 2020, but charitable giving could increase by $9.2 billion to $27.7 billion. The rise in giving would outweigh the loss in revenue, encouraging more donations. The policy of providing enhanced nonitemizer deductions for charitable contributions could encourage additional giving by lower-income taxpayers. However, implementing this policy would increase the complexity of the tax code and enforcement challenges for the IRS. Allowance of charitable deductions or credits regardless of whether a taxpayer itemizes or takes the standard deduction would further shift taxpayers towards taking the standard deduction. The potential policy of providing a nonrefundable tax credit for nonitemizers could impact the share of taxpayers who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions. Studies estimate revenue effects and increased charitable contributions for a 25% credit, with differing approaches on whether it should replace or supplement the current itemized deduction. Indiana University projects a revenue cost of $20.6 billion to $24.6 billion in 2020, while Brill and Choe estimate a cost of $31.1 billion. Choe proposes a 25% credit to replace the current itemized deduction, costing $31.1 billion. Studies suggest the credit could increase charitable giving by $23.3 billion. Indiana University projects increased contributions of $35.1 billion for higher income-based elasticities. Concerns arise about the tradeoff between revenue loss and contributions. Shifting the incentive to lower- and middle-income individuals could benefit preferred beneficiaries. Expanding the benefit for charitable contributions may increase complexity. Expanding the benefit for charitable contributions could increase complexity in compliance and tax administration. A 15% credit option was considered in a 2011 report, costing less than a 25% credit. Some proposals would cap expanded deductions, like limiting the nonitemizer deduction to one-third of the standard deduction. In the early 1980s, a nonitemizer deduction was limited to a certain percentage of contributions in the first three years of the temporary policy. Proposals have been made to provide a floor for deductions, with a cap potentially being inefficient. A study suggests imposing a cap of $8,000 for joint returns and $4,000 for single returns on nonitemizer deductions could result in a revenue cost of $5.6. A cap of $8,000 for joint returns and $4,000 for single returns on nonitemizer deductions could result in a revenue cost of $5.6 to $16.6 billion in 2020, increasing charitable giving by $16.6 billion assuming high income-based elasticities. The Obama Administration proposed limiting itemized deductions to 28% of the value, which would decrease the charitable tax incentive for high-income taxpayers. Implementing floors for charitable deductions could increase efficiency of the incentive. A floor for charitable deductions could increase efficiency by reducing revenue loss without affecting incentives at the margin. A 2% floor was proposed in the 2014 tax reform. Brill and Choe's study estimated a significant decrease in revenue loss with a $1,000 floor for married couples and $500 for singles. The Indiana University study examined the impact of a modified percentage-of-income floor on charitable contributions. The estimates of revenue loss and induced giving depend on the assumed elasticity. In the high-elasticity case, giving in 2020 would increase by $23.7 billion, while the revenue loss would be $13.4 billion. In 2020, giving would increase by $23.7 billion with a revenue loss of $13.4 billion. Induced giving at an elasticity of -1.0 would be $15.9 billion with a revenue loss of $12.8 billion. At an elasticity of -0.5, induced giving would be $7.9 billion with a revenue loss of $12.3 billion. Implementing a floor for charitable contributions could simplify administration and compliance by excluding deductions for small contributions. A dollar floor would be transparent, while a percentage-of-income floor could benefit wealthy taxpayers. Senator Tim Scott has introduced legislation (S. 2476) to temporarily increase the limitation on charitable contributions made for relief efforts related to Hurricane Dorian. Other proposals in the 116th Congress aim to increase charitable giving limits following disaster events, such as the Tax Relief and Expedited Assistance for Disasters Act of 2019 (H.R. 3287) and the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 2284, S. 1133). Legislation in the 116th Congress also sought to increase the limitation on charitable contributions made for relief efforts for disasters in 2018. In 2018, legislation was introduced to increase the limitation on charitable contributions for disaster relief efforts. Gifts of appreciated property can receive a double benefit, creating an incentive to overvalue the gift for a larger charitable deduction. Charities may incur costs to maintain or sell the property, even if they do not want the contribution. Options for gifts of appreciated property include only allowing deductions for cash contributions or allowing a deduction equal to the basis in the property. One option to address the issue of overvaluing gifts of appreciated property for charitable deductions is to allow a deduction equal to the basis in the property. This would eliminate the double benefit and valuation problem, but may limit deductions in cases where the property is desired by the recipient. Another option is to allow the contribution of appreciated property but tax the appreciation as if it were a realized capital gain, which would address the issue of donating artwork to a museum. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 had provisions to limit valuation problems related to charitable contributions. The deduction for charitable contributions of appreciated property may be limited to basis, except for certain property related to the charitable institution's purpose. Another option is to allow a deduction only for the amount the charity receives from a sale. Proposals aim to address concerns about inflated values of easements, including limiting deductions to 2.5 times the partnership adjusted basis. The Conservation Easement Program Integrity Act of 2019, introduced by Senator Steve Daines and Representative Mike Thompson, aims to allow charitable organizations to reimburse volunteers for miles driven for charitable purposes without income tax consequences. The current charitable mileage rate of 14 cents per mile, set in 1997, has not been adjusted. Legislation in the 116th Congress, such as the CHARITY Act of 2019, seeks to align the charitable mileage reimbursement rate with the rate used for medical and moving expense purposes. The Tax Appreciation Act of 2019 (H.R. 2072) and the Nonprofit Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 3323) propose increasing the charitable mileage rate to match the business mileage rate. The DELIVER Act of 2019 (H.R. 2928) and (S. 1603) would raise the standard charitable mileage rate for meal delivery to homebound individuals. Increasing the charitable mileage reimbursement rate could encourage charitable activity and help adjust for the increase in automobile costs since the late 1990s. Some proposals suggest subjecting certain charitable organizations to rules similar to private foundations and requiring a minimum payout. Another option is to mandate all funds in a Donor-Advised Fund account to be distributed within five to seven years. The New York State Bar Association (NYSBA) Tax Section proposed that foundations could donate to Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) if the funds are distributed immediately. They also suggested applying the same rules to DAFs as to foundations for pledge distributions. Additionally, a proposal to allow IRA rollover contributions to charity to go to DAFs was included in the Charities Helping Act. The CHARITY Act of 2019 proposed changes to university endowments, including payout requirements and addressing offshore sheltering of earnings. The REDUCE Act of 2018 suggested an excise tax on undistributed payouts from endowments to support lower- and middle-income students. Other proposals aimed to modify or repeal the tax on endowment net investment income. The Higher Education Act (H.R. 5220) would repeal the endowment excise tax and reduce the excise tax rate on private foundations to 1%. Nonprofit hospitals must meet the \"community benefit standard\" to maintain tax-exempt status. The Affordable Care Act's increased health care coverage for low-income individuals has raised questions about the need for charity care. The 2017 tax revision raised questions about tax benefits for nonprofit hospitals, including the need for charity care and enforcement of the community benefit standard. Proposals are being considered to modify the UBIT provisions, such as eliminating separate business calculations to simplify administration and compliance. This change may address concerns about improper expense allocation for 501(c)(3) colleges and universities. The 2013 IRS compliance report highlighted improper expense allocation in 501(c)(3) colleges and universities' unrelated business activities. Criticisms have been raised about the 2017 tax revision subjecting transportation benefits to UBIT, including free parking. Legislation has been proposed to repeal certain fringe benefits from UBIT. Legislation has been proposed to repeal certain fringe benefits from UBIT, including bills introduced by various representatives and senators such as H.R. 1223, S. 632, S. 501, H.R. 1545, S. 1282, and H.R. 513. Additionally, proposals for administrative reforms like requiring electronic filing of 990 forms have been suggested. One proposal in the CHARITY Act of 2019 is to mandate electronic filing of 990 forms. Another suggestion is to allocate more funds to the IRS or establish a separate regulatory authority for monitoring charities, as the IRS focuses on revenue collection rather than nonprofit regulation. Studies on charitable giving elasticities are also discussed in the text. The studies on charitable giving elasticities include sensitivity analysis to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Results with no statistical significance are marked with an asterisk, indicating a lack of clear causal effect due to deviation from the estimated relationship. Tax return data, available to select researchers, provide superior information on giving and tax rates in these studies. The studies on charitable giving elasticities use tax return data for superior information, but replication and sensitivity analysis are limited. Some studies in Table A-1 used taxpayer data, with Treasury employees as authors or coauthors. Multiple results are reported with different specifications, with a preference for certain estimates by the authors. In the case of Bakija and Heim (2011), the preferred estimate for permanent elasticity is linked to state tax rate variations. Bakija and McClelland (2002) also estimated a standard pooled cross-section estimate, showing typical results of past studies. Transitory price effects are expected to be large, while transitory income effects are small. The permanent income hypothesis suggests small price elasticities and income elasticities in cross-section studies. Only two studies, Randolph (1995) and Bakija and Heim (2008), found lower permanent price elasticity and higher permanent income elasticity. Randolph (1995) focused on transitory effects using a 10-year panel, treating deviations from average income as transitory. Permanent tax rates varied through changes in the tax law, allowing for the possibility of reflecting some permanent price and income effects. The Randolph study examines permanent price and income effects, with results consistent with expectations based on aggregate data. The model allows for varying price elasticity by the share of giving, reporting both unweighted and weighted measures. Bakija (2000) replicates Randolph's results, emphasizing the significance of the weighted measure. Randolph's study uses public-use data to argue that the second weight, yielding an insignificant price elasticity, is more appropriate. His replications show similar effects to Randolph's unweighted results, especially for incomes over $100,000. However, his approach finds no evidence of a permanent price response, differing from other studies in how permanent income and transitory effects are estimated. Barrett et al. (1997) focus on intertemporal shifting variation and adjustment speed in their study on price elasticity. They find a rapid adjustment process and a lower price elasticity but a small income elasticity. Their panel does not consider tax rate changes post-1986. The study includes individual fixed effects to control for taxpayer heterogeneity. The Barrett et al. study focused on intertemporal shifting variation and adjustment speed in price elasticity, using individual fixed effects to control for taxpayer heterogeneity. However, the study did not address known changes in tax law post-1986, which could bias price elasticities upward. Bakija and McClelland reestimated their model using public data and found a lower elasticity. They base their analysis on Auten et al., introducing expected tax changes and adjustment lags. Bakija and Heim use a panel approach with fixed effects, focusing on preannounced tax changes for price elasticity determination. The authors examined changes in tax rates for higher-income individuals, considering fixed time effects. They reported effects using state, federal, and combined tax rates, with a focus on state tax rates for a more reliable measure of response. The study analyzed the effects of changes in tax rates on higher-income individuals, focusing on state tax rates as a more reliable measure. It found varying price elasticities across income levels, with statistically significant estimates for certain income classes. The elasticities of charitable bequests range from 0 to 1.2, with some biases in estimates due to fixed effects or short periods. The response to the 1986 tax revision suggests a higher transitory price elasticity. Only the Randolph study finds effects consistent with expectations, suggesting an elasticity of around 0.5. Seven studies attempt to estimate price and wealth elasticities of charitable bequests. The elasticities of charitable bequests vary, with studies showing that the price elasticity is more significant than the wealth elasticity. Charitable bequests are generally responsive to changes in the tax price of bequests, except for a study by Greene and McClelland. The history of the tax treatment of charitable contributions dates back to the War Revenue Act of 1917, which introduced the charitable deduction for individuals. The charitable deduction for individuals was introduced in the War Revenue Act of 1917. Over the years, deductions were added for trusts, estates, and corporations. The deduction limit has changed from 15% of taxable income in 1917 to 30% in 1954, with specific charities receiving an additional 10%. Carryover of unused deductions was first allowed for corporations in 1954 and extended to individuals in 1964. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 increased the percentage limit on individual contributions to charities to 50%, but restricted it to 30% for gifts of appreciated property. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 raised the percentage limit on corporate charitable contributions to 10% of taxable income. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 increased the limit on contributions to private foundations to 30% for cash contributions. Provisions requiring greater substantiation of gifts were introduced, such as written substantiation for contributions exceeding $2,000. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 lowered reporting requirements for donors of noncash gifts to $250. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 provided temporary additional benefits and added restrictions on certain charitable organizations. The 2006 law also tightened rules governing charitable giving in various areas and extended charitable giving incentives through 2009. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 increased the percentage-of-income limit for contributions to public charities to 60% and eliminated the phase-out of itemized deductions temporarily. Charitable organizations have been exempt from tax since the original 1913 income tax law, allowing them to earn income related to their mission. The Revenue Act of 1950 established the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) on income from commercial activities. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 imposed restrictions on private foundations, a 4% excise tax on investment income, and a minimum payout requirement. The 1969 legislation expanded the UBIT to all tax-exempt organizations and applied it to all debt-financed income. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 changed the minimum distribution requirement to 5% of assets. The Revenue Act of 1978 reduced. The Revenue Act of 1978 reduced the net investment income excise tax to 2%. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 exempted certain operating foundations from the excise tax and reduced it to 1% for foundations improving distributions. The 2017 tax reduction imposed a 1.4% excise tax on investment income of certain private colleges and universities, added fringe benefits to the UBIT base, and required separate UBIT calculations for each business activity."
