The Congress recognizes the significant impact of fire losses, including thousands of deaths and injuries annually, with an estimated economic loss of over $10 billion per year. It emphasizes the importance of fire safety education at the State and local levels to prevent fires and reduce associated costs. Additionally, there is a need to increase resources for fire prevention programs to support effective public education efforts by State agencies and local fire departments. Fire departments in countries with lower fire deaths spend 4-10% of their budgets on prevention, compared to less than 3% in the US. Accurate data analysis is crucial for directing educational efforts efficiently. The Administrator may contract with eligible entities to distribute fire safety education programs and resources at the state and local level. Funding allocation includes 25% for statewide programs, 25% for new regional or local programs targeting high-risk populations, and 50% for existing programs with demonstrated effectiveness in preventing fires and injuries. The Administrator can contract with States to implement the revised National Fire Incident Reporting System for better fire data collection. Eligible entities must submit applications for contracts, agreements, or grants. The entity receiving funds under section 3 must submit an annual report to the Administrator detailing program activities, support materials obtained, and initiatives for public-private partnerships. The Administrator will then submit an annual report to Congress. The entity receiving funds under section 3 must submit an annual report to the Administrator detailing program activities and materials developed.
