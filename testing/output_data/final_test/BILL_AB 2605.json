    "title": "AB 2605",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. California enacts the Permit Assistance Program under the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development to provide businesses with permitting and regulatory compliance assistance, access to resources, conflict resolution services, and collaboration with regulatory entities for process improvements. The Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development manages the office's website with information on licensing and permitting requirements. They collaborate with various public and private sector agencies and report annually to the Governor and Legislature on program activities. The Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development manages the office's website with information on licensing, permitting, and registration applications. The website provides direct links to download forms, instructions on submission, fee requirements, and schedules for state agencies. It ensures the website is user-friendly and updated with accurate information. The state agencies must provide direct links to their licensing, permitting, and registration requirements on the office's website. The office may charge a reasonable fee for accessing this information. Additionally, cities and counties establishing districts may be eligible for transportation funding. Section 65923.8 of the Government Code is amended to inform developers about the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development. Section 66033 of the Government Code is repealed, and sections 25199.4 and 25199.7 of the Health and Safety Code are also amended. Before filing an application for a hazardous waste facility project, the proponent must submit a notice of intent to the Department of Toxic Substances Control and the local agency. The notice should include project details and be accompanied by a fee. The local agency is required to notify affected parties through various means such as newspaper publication and direct mailing to property owners. A notice of intent for a hazardous waste facility project must be filed with a local agency along with a fee to cover processing costs. The notice is valid for one year or until withdrawn by the proponent, and is not transferable to another location. Within 90 days of filing a notice of intent for a hazardous waste facility project, the Department of Toxic Substances Control must hold a public meeting to inform the public about the project and approval procedures. The legislative body of the affected local agency appoints a seven-member local assessment committee to advise on land use decisions for hazardous waste facility projects. The committee must be appointed within 30 days of the application being accepted as complete, and the project proponent must pay a fee to cover the local agency's costs for establishing and convening the committee. The local assessment committee, broadly constituted to reflect the community makeup, includes representatives from various groups. Their primary function is to advise the appointing legislative body on the acceptability of proposed hazardous waste facility projects. The local assessment committee engages in dialogue with the proponent of a hazardous waste facility project to establish measures for public health and safety, environmental protection, and compensation for local costs. They also represent the interests of residents and adjacent communities, receive technical assistance grants, and establish necessary rules and procedures for their duties. The local assessment committee advises the legislative body on project approval terms and conditions agreed upon with the proponent. The legislative body provides staff resources for the committee's duties, and the committee ceases to exist after final administrative action on permit applications. The Department of Toxic Substances Control must be notified by a local agency within 10 days of a hazardous waste facility project application being accepted. Within 60 days, a meeting will be convened with relevant agencies, the proponent, local assessment committee, and the public to address project approval issues. Following the initial meeting, the proponent and local assessment committee will discuss terms for the hazardous waste facility project. The committee can request technical assistance grants to hire a consultant for project review. The local assessment committee will review the project application and environmental documents for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. They will also advise on terms and conditions for the project's acceptance by the community. The local agency requires a fee from the proponent of a hazardous waste facility project equal to any technical assistance grant provided. The fee funds are used exclusively for technical assistance grants. Fees are deposited in a treasury account and returned to the proponent if unused. This section applies only to specified hazardous waste facility projects. The Legislature aims to expedite permit reviews for energy projects and promote consideration of cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. The commission can offer technical assistance and grants to help local agencies site energy projects and integrate energy efficiency methods into their planning processes. Assistance is provided upon request. The commission provides assistance to local agencies for energy projects upon request. An energy project is defined as any project that produces, converts, or transmits energy as a primary function."
