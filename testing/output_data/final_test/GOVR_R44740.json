It works closely with federal agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support conservation efforts for plants, animals, and ecosystems. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) was established by Congress in 1984 as a nonprofit corporation to support conservation efforts for plants, animals, and ecosystems. NFWF activities are funded through various sources, including gifts, regulatory actions, project mitigation, and legal settlements. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) manages a total of $3.5 billion in grants from various funding sources, including federal agencies, private funds, and directed funds. Other federal land agencies like the Forest Service and National Park Service have associated foundations, but the Bureau of Land Management does not have one. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) manages $3.5 billion in grants from various sources. If Congress were to establish a foundation to support the work of the Bureau of Land Management or other federal agencies, NFWF, NFF, and NPF could serve as examples of how to structure additional foundations. The NFWF Board of Directors has 30 members approved by the Secretary of the Interior, including the director of FWS and the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Wildlife as ex officio voting members. Membership on the board does not constitute federal employment. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) was chartered in 1984 with authorization from the Secretary of the Interior for administrative services. After the authorization expired in 1989, DOI could still provide services based on availability and with reimbursement. NFWF no longer receives direct administrative support from DOI. The foundation collaborates with FWS and NOAA for conservation efforts, with funding set at $25 million for DOI and $5 million for the Department of Commerce. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) collaborates with federal agencies like FWS and NOAA for wildlife conservation projects. NFWF is authorized to receive $25 million from DOI and $5 million from the Department of Commerce for matching grants. Federal funds must not exceed half of the grant amount, and nonfederal partners must contribute at least half. NFWF projects with federal funds are part of the sponsoring agency's budget, not FWS or NOAA's. Federal funds cannot be used for salaries or overhead expenses. NFWF projects with federal funds are part of the sponsoring agency's budget, not FWS or NOAA's. Projects with no federal grant funds may occur on federal, state, tribal, or private lands. All NFWF-supported projects undergo peer review and involve governmental and nongovernmental partners. Matching funds from taxable nonfederal entities to NFWF are tax-deductible. An example is the massive conservation project on the Caminada Headlands in Louisiana, a collaboration between the state and NFWF to rebuild 13 miles of coastline along the Gulf of Mexico. The NFWF-funded project in Port Fourchon, Louisiana involves dredging sand from Ship Shoal in the Gulf of Mexico to create new dunes for migrating songbirds and shorebird habitats. The second phase of the project received $144.5 million from the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund in 2014, with significant progress made in 2015. Additionally, a plan was developed in 2015 by NFWF and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to address the decline of the monarch butterfly, with the federal agency committing $1.2 million. The NFWF committed $1.2 million in 2015 to create the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund, partnering with private and public sectors like Monsanto to increase monarch habitat. By fall, they awarded $3.3 million in grants to 22 projects, drawing $6.7 million in matching contributions for a total impact of $10 million in the first year. Walmart's Acres for America conservation program began in 2005 with a $35 million commitment to preserve wildlife habitat in the US. Walmart's Acres for America conservation program started in 2005 with a $35 million commitment to preserve wildlife habitat in the US. The program has exceeded its initial goal, protecting over 1 million acres of land and benefiting wildlife habitats and migration corridors over an area of more than 10 million acres. In fiscal year 2015, grants were awarded to protect over 235,000 acres in various states, bringing the total number of funded projects to 61 in 33 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These projects have not only preserved important wildlife habitats but also provided new public access to pristine natural areas. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) manages funds from voluntary contributions and settlements to support mitigation requirements for projects harming fish or wildlife. The largest settlement received was from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. NFWF may receive monetary damages for remediation of public fish and wildlife resources. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, NFWF received over $2.54 billion for Gulf Coast restoration from criminal settlements with BP and Transocean. The funds are managed through the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund (GEBF) for habitat restoration projects in the area of the damage. NFWF received over $2.54 billion for Gulf Coast restoration from criminal settlements with BP and Transocean after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The funds are managed through the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund (GEBF) for habitat restoration projects in the area of the damage, with 50% allocated to support projects addressing harm caused by the spill in Louisiana and the implementation of river diversion projects for coastal habitats. The remaining funds will be distributed to other Gulf states based on specific proportions. NFWF received $2.54 billion for Gulf Coast restoration from settlements with BP and Transocean. The funds are managed through the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund for habitat restoration projects in the damaged area, with allocations to individual states. NFWF consults with state and federal resource managers to identify projects and maximize environmental benefits. Louisiana projects consider the State Coastal Master Plan and Mississippi River study. Funds are obligated according to settlement terms. The National Park Foundation (NPF) and the National Forest Foundation support the work of the National Park Service and the Forest Service, respectively. These foundations, along with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), are federally chartered 501(c)(3) organizations with managing boards that include federal employees as ex officio members. However, they differ in their missions and approaches, with NPF focusing on gifts for the benefit of the National Park Service, while NPS is closely tied to the lands it manages in the National Park System. The National Park Foundation (NPF) primarily manages donations that support the National Park System, while the National Forest Foundation (NFF) focuses on the work of the Forest Service. The Forest Service (FS) manages the National Forest System and works on various programs related to forests and grasslands. The National Forest Foundation (NFF) supports the Forest Service's activities and services through private donations and assistance. The NFF's statutory purposes include administering gifts, conducting activities to further forest purposes, and providing educational and technical support for multiple use programs. These purposes are not solely tied to the National Forest System but also support the agency's broader mission. The management and conservation of the nation's fish and wildlife is a shared responsibility among state agencies, tribal managers, and federal jurisdictions. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) was created by Congress to address the administrative complexity of fish and wildlife conservation. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) was established by Congress for fish and wildlife conservation purposes. NFWF is linked to FWS and NOAA, but differs from other foundations like NPF and NFF. Congress may consider creating foundations for agencies like BLM and for purposes beyond federal land management. NFWF and other foundations provide different models for such efforts."
