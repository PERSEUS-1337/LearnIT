    "content": "The Act titled \"National Child Protection Amendments Act of 2001\" facilitates background checks under the National Child Protection Act of 1993. The National Child Protection Amendments Act of 2001 allows qualified entities to request fingerprint-based national criminal history background checks for providers caring for children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. The National Child Protection Amendments Act of 2001 allows qualified entities to request background checks through State criminal history record repositories, which then conduct searches and may involve the FBI if necessary, with a response expected within 15 business days. The FBI must conduct a search of its criminal history record system and respond to a State repository or qualified entity within 5 business days of receiving a request. Background checks under this section must adhere to the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact guidelines. To conduct background checks under the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact, a State must establish authorized agencies and procedures for forwarding fingerprints and obtaining provider information. The provider's identification, criminal history, and acknowledgment of background check request are documented in a statement. The provider's acknowledgment of a background check includes notification of potential access restrictions and rights under subparagraph (B). Each provider with an adverse fitness determination based on a background check has the right to request their criminal history record and challenge its accuracy with the State repository or FBI. An authorized agency receiving a criminal history record report without disposition information must make inquiries to obtain complete details. An authorized agency receiving background check results must determine if the provider is unfit to care for children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. A qualified entity can receive criminal history record information for making fitness determinations about a provider. The entity must maintain the security, confidentiality, and privacy rights of the provider. The qualified entity receiving criminal history record information for fitness determinations must ensure privacy rights, provide copies upon request, and not retain the information longer than necessary. The entity can forward the required statement to the authorized agency or retain it themselves. The Attorney General and the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council provide guidance on using the best technology for background checks and ensuring compliance with national standards. The Compact Council also offers model fitness standards for conducting national background checks. The Compact Council provides model fitness standards for specific providers, which can be used by States for making fitness determinations. A permanent NCPA Care Provider Committee is created to guide the process. The Council reports annually to the President and Congress on national background checks conducted under the NCPA. Penalties are imposed on any officer, employee, or authorized representative for non-compliance. Penalties are imposed on individuals who misuse criminal history record information obtained under the NCPA, with fines up to $5,000 for violations. Qualified entities are not liable for damages solely for failing to request background checks on providers or for willful violations. Qualified entities are not liable for damages unless violations are knowing and willful. Governmental entities are also not liable for damages related to the failure of a qualified entity to take adverse action based on background check results. An authorized agency can rely on information obtained for background checks. An authorized agency or qualified entity relying on criminal history record information from a background check is not liable for inaccuracies. Fees for background checks on volunteers with qualified entities must not exceed $18 or the actual cost. States must establish fee systems. States must establish fee systems to ensure that fees for background checks on volunteers do not discourage participation in child care programs. This does not affect the authority of the FBI or states to collect fees for background checks on paid care providers. Authorization of appropriations and conforming amendments are authorized in Section 3. Funding for improvement of child abuse crime information under the National Child Protection Act of 1993 is amended to assist states in offsetting costs for background checks on volunteer providers. Funding for grants under the National Child Protection Act of 1993 is authorized with $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and additional funding for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also authorized to receive $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and additional funding for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 to support the activities of the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Section 5 of the National Child Protection Act of 1993 is amended by removing and redesignating paragraphs, defining 'criminal history record repository', and expanding the scope of protection to include elderly persons and individuals with disabilities.

The National Child Protection Act of 1993 is amended to expand protection to include elderly persons and individuals with disabilities by removing references to \"child care\" and replacing it with \"care\" in certain subparagraphs. Additionally, there is an amendment to the National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act. Section 215 of the National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act is amended to ensure that direct access to certain records is not affected by the Compact. This includes access provided under various laws such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act is amended to ensure that direct access to Federal criminal history records authorized by law is not affected by the Compact. Criminal history records disseminated by the FBI through the III System will be subject to the Compact."
