    "content": "President Trump issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13813 on October 12, 2017, titled \"Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States.\" The order aims to facilitate the purchase of insurance across state lines and improve the healthcare system for Americans by addressing association health plans (AHPs), short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). This report provides FAQs about E.O. 13813 and background information on AHPs, STLDI, and HRAs. The Executive Order 13813 aims to expand access to AHPs, increase availability of STLDI, and expand HRAs. The private health insurance market evolves based on decisions made by stakeholders and regulators. Insurers may change their behavior in response to legislative changes. The health insurance market has changed due to legislative changes like the ACA. Costs have increased despite more people having coverage. Different proposals aim to address these issues, with E.O. 13813 focusing on health insurance costs. E.O. 13813 targets health insurance costs and access to less-regulated coverage options in individual and small-group markets. Federal agencies may respond based on private health insurance coverage sources and regulations. The directives of E.O. 13813 aim to expand availability of different health options, such as AHP addressing ERISA definitions for small businesses to self-insure or purchase large group health insurance. Unlike AHPs or STLDI, an HRA is an account authorized under the tax code that pays for or reimburses employees' medical expenses. The differences among these three health options lead to varying policy issues, federal requirements, and changes identified under the executive order. While states primarily regulate insurance, federal regulations impact private health insurance coverage. State laws may not apply to self-insured arrangements and tax-advantaged health accounts authorized under the federal tax code. Association health plans bring together employers or individuals to provide health insurance coverage through various organizations. AHPs are not clearly defined by federal statute and encompass a wide range of arrangements. Discussions about AHPs often involve small businesses. Association health plans (AHPs) bring together employers or individuals to provide health insurance coverage through various organizations, including large businesses. AHP coverage may include self-employed persons and sole proprietors, and can be fully insured or self-funded. Federal law governs AHPs based on their specific characteristics and participants, creating no separate market for AHPs. Association health plans (AHPs) encompass various arrangements beyond traditional associations, such as purchasing pools or alliances. These plans are offered through entities like associations, trusts, MEWAs, and purchasing cooperatives, leading to a lack of data due to the lack of uniformity. AHPs play a unique role in providing coverage to individuals or employers as a collective body. Association health plans (AHPs) provide coverage to individuals or employers collectively, aiming to replicate the advantages of larger groups in the private health insurance market. Larger groups can spread insurance risk more effectively, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic financial loss for the entire group. Additionally, administrative costs are lower for larger groups, and very large groups may have greater market power in negotiations with issuers. The large-group market has market advantages and fewer federal requirements compared to the small-group or individual market, making it an incentive to establish a large-group Association Health Plan (AHP). AHPs are regulated based on the characteristics of the organization offering the coverage and plan enrollees, such as size of employers and funding. Association Health Plans (AHPs) are regulated under ERISA by the Department of Labor (DOL) for employer associations providing coverage. AHPs must adhere to various requirements including fiduciary standards, reporting, benefits, premiums, and consumer protections. DOL treats AHPs as multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs) for regulation purposes. The Department of Labor (DOL) regulates Association Health Plans (AHPs) as multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs). DOL's regulation of AHPs relies on sub-regulatory guidance, such as advisory opinions, to determine the genuine relationship between associations and employer members, the commonality of interest standard, and the control over the plan. In most cases, associations are not considered employers for regulatory purposes, with individual employers within the association being the sponsors of distinct employer plans. The size of each association member (employer) determines the regulation of coverage under ERISA and the Public Health Service Act for Association Health Plans (AHPs). HHS guidance states that the group health plan exists at the individual employer level, not at the association level, impacting the scope of requirements. Association coverage is regulated based on the size of each member, determining if it falls under small-group or large-group coverage. Coverage provided through an association without a group health plan is subject to individual insurance requirements. The ACA made changes to requirements for health issuers and insurance products, impacting association coverage. The ACA expanded benefit mandates by requiring essential health benefits in small-group and individual insurance markets. A proposed regulation on AHPs aims to relax standards for sponsoring group coverage. The Department of Labor's proposed rule on Association Health Plans (AHPs) would allow employers in the same industry or geographic area to form a group health plan. It also allows self-employed individuals and sole proprietors to sponsor AHP coverage. The rule includes nondiscrimination provisions and seeks comments on issues like commonality of interest and working owner definitions. The rule does not provide a specific definition for AHPs or change existing federal regulatory standards for ERISA plans. The proposed changes in the rule for Association Health Plans (AHPs) would allow them to be regulated as large-group coverage instead of small-group or individual coverage at the federal level, potentially reducing federal requirements such as Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and premium determination. This could lead to a reduced regulatory burden for current AHPs and encourage the formation of new ones. The proposed AHP rule aims to allow associations to offer health coverage under a single plan, potentially providing more affordable options for small businesses. Concerns about risk selection and discrimination based on health factors are addressed in the provisions. Proponents believe the changes will expand coverage options and lower premiums, while opponents argue it may have adverse effects. Opponents of the proposed AHP rule argue that offering less comprehensive coverage through large-group AHPs could devalue coverage for high-need consumers and draw healthy consumers away from individual and small-group markets, potentially leading to higher premiums for those outside of AHPs. Proponents believe nondiscrimination provisions in the rule offer adequate consumer protections. Selling insurance across state lines allows state-licensed issuers to sell the same product in multiple states without complying with each state's requirements. Some states have laws allowing this. AHPs pool employers or individuals and are not state-licensed issuers. Self-funded health plans under ERISA are exempt from state laws, allowing large employers to offer the same benefits in multiple states. The concept of self-funding health coverage in multiple states is similar to selling insurance across state lines, although self-funded plans are not technically insurance. MEWAs, whether fully insured or self-funded, are subject to federal and certain state laws. Proposed AHP provisions have been introduced in Congress since the 103rd Congress, with common elements including defining AHPs, requirements for sponsors, and exemption from certain state laws. Short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI) is a type of health insurance designed to fill coverage gaps, especially during transitions between different types of coverage. It is not defined in federal statute but in regulations. Legislative proposals for Association Health Plans (AHPs) have included provisions to establish AHPs as large-group coverage for federal purposes and exempt them from certain state requirements, going beyond the scope of Executive Order 13813. The current definition of Short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI) is health insurance coverage lasting a maximum of three months, including any extensions. Consumers can purchase one- or two-month policies and extend them up to the three-month limit, but cannot purchase and extend a three-month policy. Short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI) allows consumers to buy consecutive short-term policies, which are not considered individual health insurance coverage for federal requirements. STLDI issuers are not required to accept every applicant and can deny coverage based on health status-related factors. STLDI is intended to fill gaps in health insurance coverage for individuals in specific situations such as job transitions, aging out of parental coverage, pre-Medicare retirement, or frequent international travelers. Consumers may have other coverage options besides STLDI, such as enrolling in an individual plan through their state's health insurance exchange during an open enrollment period. Short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) can be an alternative for individuals who do not qualify for special enrollment periods or annual open enrollment periods. These plans have no specific enrollment periods and can be purchased at any time, providing coverage in less than a day. However, STLDI plans are limited to three months, not renewable, and may result in increased premiums or denial of coverage based on new health conditions. Short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) plans offer lower premiums but come with higher consumer cost-sharing requirements and cover fewer benefits compared to comprehensive health insurance plans. Consumers may pre-purchase consecutive plans, but deductibles reset each time. Some individuals use STLDI as their indefinite source of coverage, seeking gap coverage. STLDI plans are not subject to federal requirements that apply to other plans, allowing issuers to charge higher premiums. Short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) plans have higher consumer cost-sharing requirements, cover fewer benefits, and can charge higher premiums based on health status. They cannot be sold through health insurance exchanges, making individuals ineligible for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies. STLDI plans do not qualify as minimum essential coverage, potentially subjecting individuals to penalties for not complying with the individual mandate. Despite constituting a small portion of the U.S. health insurance market, STLDI plans earned about $146 million in premiums in 2016, covering approximately 161,000 lives. Short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) plans are not considered individual health insurance coverage for federal requirements, allowing them to avoid compliance with regulations such as covering essential health benefits (EHB) and prohibiting annual or lifetime limits. They can deny coverage based on health status and charge higher premiums. STLDI plans are subject to state regulations, including licensing requirements and marketing rules. States have the authority to regulate short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) plans, including setting shorter maximum durations or prohibiting their sale. The definition of STLDI was updated by the Departments of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury in 2016 to specify coverage lasting less than 3 months after the original effective date of the contract. The updated definition of short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) specifies coverage lasting less than 3 months after the original effective date of the contract. This change went into effect on January 1, 2017, but enforcement began on April 1, 2017. The primary changes included reducing the maximum length of STLDI plans from 12 months to 3 months and adding a required disclaimer. The Departments updated the definition of short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) to specify coverage lasting less than 3 months after the original effective date of the contract. This change aimed to address concerns about STLDI plans being used as primary coverage, impacting risk pools and increasing individual market premiums. The Departments proposed changes to short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI) in response to concerns about its impact on risk pools and individual market premiums. The changes include increasing the maximum duration of STLDI and addressing consumer awareness of the differences between STLDI and ACA-compliant plans. The proposed changes to STLDI include increasing the maximum duration back to less than 12 months, reverting to the pre-2016 definition. Issuers must inform consumers that STLD plans do not comply with certain federal requirements, with modifications to the language suggested in the new proposed rule. Different versions of the language are to be used before and after January 1, 2019. The Departments are considering changes to STLDI policies, allowing issuers to offer indefinite coverage and streamlining the reapplication process for consumers. These changes aim to provide more flexibility for consumers in the individual market, especially those ineligible for ACA subsidies. The February 2018 proposed rule acknowledges potential negative impacts on the individual market for comprehensive coverage, including shifts in enrollment, premium increases, and higher federal outlays for premium tax credits. Comments were due by April 23, 2018, with changes effective 60 days after publication of the final rule. The Departments sought feedback on the possibility of a mid-year effective date. The rule does not affect states' ability to regulate short-term limited duration insurance plans. Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) are employer-funded accounts for medical expenses. HRAs are different from flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. Employees cannot contribute to HRAs directly. Payments from HRAs for medical expenses are tax-exempt for employees. Employers can contribute any amount to an employee's Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), which is tax-exempt for medical expenses. Distributions from the HRA lose their tax-advantaged status if used for non-medical expenses. Unused balances can be carried over indefinitely for medical care expenses, and employees can take the funds with them if they change jobs or retire. HRAs cannot be offered through cafeteria plans. Employers can offer HRAs to employees integrated with a non-HRA group health plan. HRAs cannot be integrated with individual market health insurance coverage. Integration requirement does not apply to HRAs covering fewer than two current employees. QSEHRAs are employer-established arrangements that reimburse employees for medical expenses and differ from HRAs. QSEHRAs do not require integration with a group health plan and prohibit employers from offering such plans. Employees must have minimum essential coverage to receive tax-advantaged distributions from a QSEHRA. Small employers with fewer than two employees can offer QSEHRAs. QSEHRAs are available to small employers with fewer than 50 full-time-equivalent employees. Payments are capped at $5,050 per year for self-only coverage and $10,250 per year for family coverage. QSEHRAs are only for current employees and are meant to cover unreimbursed medical expenses. The rules governing HRAs and QSEHRAs require individuals to have employer-sponsored or minimum essential coverage to qualify. Both are regulated under the Internal Revenue Code and IRS guidance. HRAs are tax-advantaged under IRC Sections 105 and 106, allowing for tax-exempt health plan benefits and employer contributions. IRS guidance affirms HRAs as a way to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses. QSEHRAs, established in legislation, are tax-advantaged for unreimbursed medical expenses. IRS guidance on QSEHRAs was issued in 2017, with a key change being the integration requirement. Previously, stand-alone HRAs were allowed without group health plan coverage. Stand-alone HRAs could be used to purchase health insurance coverage. The integration requirement, established in 2013, prohibits employers from offering stand-alone HRAs for purchasing health insurance coverage. This requirement was issued jointly by the Departments of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury. It states that HRAs must be integrated with another group health plan to comply with ACA requirements, including the prohibition on annual limits and the preventive services requirement. Employers offering group health plans must cover preventive health services without cost sharing. Noncompliant plans, including HRAs not integrated with a group health plan, may face a $100 per day per employee excise tax. The guidance addresses HRAs reimbursing individual market health insurance, stating they cannot be integrated with non-HRA group plans. Effective since January 1, 2014, for large employers, the guidance aims to ensure compliance with ACA requirements. QSEHRAs were established under the 21st Century Cures Act in response to the HRA integration requirement. Eligible employers could provide QSEHRAs starting in 2017, with IRS guidance issued on October 17, 2017. As of the report date, there have been no proposed changes to HRAs, but the IRS guidance included requirements for QSEHRAs. Executive Order 13813 directed consideration of revising guidance to increase compliance. The Treasury Department and IRS are revising guidance to increase the usability of HRAs, expand employer offerings, and allow HRAs to be used with non-group coverage in response to Executive Order 13813. Additional guidance may be issued in the future."
