    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure for publicly traded corporations, clarifying how existing SEC rules should be applied to financial filings. The release of the guidance was controversial and led to legislative efforts to repeal it in the 112th Congress. No bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress regarding the guidance. The report describes the guidance, presents opposing views, discusses potential corporate costs and benefits, and examines its impact on investors and corporations. The SEC issued guidance on climate change disclosure for publicly traded corporations, clarifying existing rules for financial filings. The guidance, effective since February 8, 2010, aims to specify disclosure requirements related to climate change impacts on business, legal, regulatory, or legislative developments. It emphasizes the importance of disclosing material information for informed investment decisions. The SEC issued guidance on climate change disclosure for publicly traded corporations under Regulation S-K, including Forms 10-K and 20-F filings. The guidance clarifies disclosure requirements related to climate change legislation, international accords, indirect consequences of regulation or business trends, and physical impacts of climate change. The SEC adopted guidance on climate change disclosure for publicly traded corporations, clarifying requirements related to legislation, international accords, business trends, and physical impacts. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro emphasized that the Commission's decision does not express opinions on climate change facts or causes, but companies must consider potential legislation and evaluate its impact on liquidity, resources, and operations for disclosure to shareholders. The SEC adopted guidance on climate change disclosure for publicly traded corporations, emphasizing the importance of disclosing material impacts and risks. The vote split 3-2, reflecting differing perspectives on the Guidance. Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar supported the Guidance, highlighting its significance for providing reliable information to investors. Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar supported the SEC's guidance on climate change disclosure, citing the established consensus on climate change reality and the material impact it has on corporate affairs and investors. He emphasized the importance of the guidance in helping investors understand how existing disclosure requirements apply to climate change, pointing to reports confirming the warming climate and the potential severe harm if climate change is left unchecked. The SEC's guidance on climate change disclosure is crucial due to the material impact on corporate affairs and investors. It clarifies existing rules and emphasizes the importance of disclosing risks and opportunities related to climate change. This information aids investors in decision-making and compliance with regulations. The SEC's guidance on climate change disclosure emphasizes the importance of disclosing risks and opportunities related to climate change to investors. A group of institutional investors supported the guidance, highlighting the significant risks climate change poses to economies and investments. The SEC's new interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure emphasizes the importance of disclosing risks and opportunities related to climate change to investors. Many businesses are starting to account for the impacts of climate change on their financial performance and developing energy-efficient products to improve competitiveness. However, few companies provide sufficient information in SEC filings for informed investment decisions. During the 111th Congress, Senator Christopher Dodd and Senator Jack Reed expressed support for the SEC's new guidelines on climate change disclosure, emphasizing the importance of providing investors with information on how climate change may impact investments. Dodd, then-chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, highlighted the need for transparency in disclosing risks related to severe weather and rising sea levels. Reed, then-chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment, also praised the SEC's efforts to increase informational transparency regarding climate change risks and opportunities in the economy. Major environmental risks and liabilities can significantly impact companies' future earnings and impair investors' ability to make sound investment decisions. SEC Commissioner Katherine Casey dissented against adopting climate change disclosure guidance, citing uncertainty in the science and law, adequacy of existing disclosure rules, and questionable usefulness of the information to most investors. SEC Commissioner Katherine Casey dissented against adopting climate change disclosure guidance, citing uncertainty in the science and law, and questionable usefulness of the information to most investors. Criticism of the Guidance also came from the Edison Electrical Utility Industry Trade Group in the private sector. The Edison Electrical Institute, a major industry trade group, criticized the SEC Guidance for requiring excessive speculation from corporate registrants on climate change-related matters. They expressed concerns that the guidance could discourage voluntary disclosures and be interpreted as mandating comprehensive reviews by corporate management. Management conducted a comprehensive review of climate change-related matters, deemed unnecessary and burdensome. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to prohibit enforcement of the SEC's climate change disclosure guidance, citing the need for the SEC to focus on protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. Our bill blocks the SEC from forcing American employers to conduct burdensome and expensive climate analysis. Representative Posey and 20 House colleagues opposed the climate change disclosure guidance in the 111th Congress. Former Representative Ron Paul and Representative Scott Garrett were among the signatories. Representative Spencer Bachus also expressed similar concerns in a letter to Chair Schapiro. Representative Bachus criticized the SEC's climate change guidance, stating it promotes a political agenda and imposes compliance costs on issuers without clear benefits to investors. A law review article later examined the potential costs and benefits for corporations. The SEC's climate change guidance requires expanded disclosure of all relevant information, raising concerns about added burdens and costs for corporations. Studies have examined the impact of the guidance from investor, corporate, and finance perspectives, with one study by Ceres showing its effects after the first year of implementation. Ceres, a nonprofit coalition, worked with companies to address sustainability challenges like climate change and water scarcity. They petitioned the SEC in 2007 for climate-related information disclosure in corporate filings. The SEC Guidance reflects their recommendations. Ceres also conducted reports on public company disclosures post-Guidance. Ceres conducted reports on public company disclosures post-SEC Guidance, focusing on climate change risk disclosures. The study found that while large companies have improved their disclosures, more work is needed to effectively communicate climate change risks. The study by Ceres found that climate change risk disclosures by public companies have improved somewhat in recent years, but still often fail to meet investors' expectations. Good disclosures are rare, with the majority being fair, poor, or lacking any disclosure of regulatory risks. Management commitment and regulatory attention are needed to ensure adequate disclosure. The Ceres report, Clearing the Waters: A Review of Corporate Water Risk Disclosure in SEC Filings, released on June 18, 2012, examined corporate disclosure regarding water risks. It found an increase in companies disclosing their exposure to water risk in 2011 compared to previous years. Management commitment, regulatory attention, and investor engagement are crucial for improving risk disclosure. The Ceres report in 2012 analyzed companies' disclosure of water risk exposure, noting a significant increase in reporting of water-related physical risks in 2011 compared to 2009. The oil and gas and chemicals sectors saw an increase in reporting. However, there was still a lack of data on water use and financial implications of water-related risks. Disclosure helps investors understand portfolio companies' exposure to water stress and regulatory developments. The report recommended that companies enhance their use of quantitative and qualitative data to address water-related risks, performance targets, and risk management disclosures. Another Ceres publication analyzed SEC disclosure by major oil & gas companies on climate and deepwater drilling risks. The report by Ceres in 2011 evaluated climate risk disclosure among 10 major oil and gas companies, including Apache, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Shell, Suncor, and Total. None of the companies received an excellent rating, with most lacking proper disclosure of climate change and deepwater drilling risks. Only 5 out of 60 disclosure ratings were rated good, while over half received poor ratings or were not disclosed at all. Companies varied in the specificity and comprehensiveness of their disclosures on regulatory and indirect risks. The report found that out of 50 deepwater drilling risk disclosure ratings, 4 were rated good, while 29 were rated poor or had no disclosure. After the Gulf of Mexico oil drilling disaster, disclosures on drilling and safety remained weak, with minimal information on safety or environmental statistics and investments in safety-related research and development. Overall, the findings on climate risk and deepwater drilling disclosures were concerning. The report highlighted concerns regarding the alignment of climate risk and deepwater drilling risk disclosures with SEC rules and investor expectations. A study by Davis Polk & Wardwell found that despite initial fears, the Guidance did not lead to excessive or distracting disclosures, with new generic weather risk factors being included. The report highlighted concerns about climate risk disclosures and deepwater drilling risk alignment with SEC rules and investor expectations. New disclosures emerged on changes in demand, fuel prices, and increased disclosure by greenhouse gas intensive industries, especially energy companies. However, there was little mention of potential reputational harm from climate change. Davis Polk & Wardwell studied post-guidance filings in detail, focusing on individual filings, while an article in an ABA newsletter took a different approach. The American Bar Association (ABA) newsletter analyzed changes in climate change-related disclosures following SEC Guidance. Before the Guidance, 1.8% of Form 10-K filings mentioned climate change or greenhouse gas, increasing to 2.8% in the first quarter of 2010 but dropping to 1.6% by the third quarter. The newsletter also discussed the views of corporations and finance professionals on these disclosures. Many companies showed little interest in climate change disclosures, viewing them as speculative and lacking standardized practices. Financial analysts and asset managers had limited interest in analyzing climate risks, with some companies believing there were few benefits to disclosing such information. Many companies believed there were few penalties from the SEC for not disclosing climate change matters, as the SEC's enforcement in this area was seen as negligible."
