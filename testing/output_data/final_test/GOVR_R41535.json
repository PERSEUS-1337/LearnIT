ONDCP, located in the Executive Office of the President, was established in 1988 and reauthorized in 2006. Its funding authorization expired in 2010, but it continues to receive appropriations. Congress is now considering its reauthorization. The director of ONDCP, known as the \"Drug Czar,\" has various responsibilities. The director of ONDCP, also known as the \"Drug Czar,\" is responsible for developing a National Drug Control Strategy, overseeing a National Drug Control Budget, and coordinating federal anti-drug policies. Former Director R. Gil Kerlikowske and current Acting Director Michael Botticelli have both criticized the term \"war on drugs\" as outdated. The Obama Administration advocates for a comprehensive drug control strategy. The Obama Administration emphasizes a comprehensive drug control strategy that includes prevention, treatment, and law enforcement elements. A majority of the American public is concerned about drug use in the United States. The National Drug Control Strategy, Budget, and evaluation are discussed, along with legislative issues for Congress to consider. When debating the reauthorization of ONDCP, Congress may consider the status of the war on drugs, whether drug use should be approached as a law enforcement or public health issue, the effectiveness of drug control resources in prevention and treatment versus law enforcement, the completeness of the National Drug Control Budget, oversight of ONDCP's evaluation of federal drug control programs, and ONDCP's stance on marijuana legalization. The ONDCP's funds are used for drug-related studies and contracts, opposing the legalization of Schedule I substances not approved by the FDA for medical use. The National Drug Control Strategy aims to reduce illicit drug consumption and its consequences by consulting with various stakeholders. ONDCP sets specific objectives in each Strategy to reduce drug use and its effects by 2015. The National Drug Control Strategy aims to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences by setting specific objectives to decrease drug use among youth and young adults. For example, goals include reducing the prevalence of 12- to 17-year-olds using illicit drugs in the past 30 days by 15%, 8th graders using alcohol, tobacco, or drugs in their lifetimes by 15%, and 18- to 25-year-olds using illicit drugs in the past 30 days by 10%. The National Drug Control Strategy aims to reduce illicit drug use among youth and young adults. In 2013, 21.5% of adults reported being current illicit drug users. The number of chronic drug users decreased by 15%. There were 43,544 drug-induced deaths in 2011. Drug-related morbidity also decreased by 15%. The prevalence of drugged driving decreased by 10% in 2013. The Strategy proposes initiatives to bolster community-based drug prevention efforts and expand health care opportunities. The 2014 National Drug Control Strategy aims to bolster community-based drug prevention efforts, expand health care opportunities for early intervention and treatment, end the cycle of drug use and crime, disrupt drug production and trafficking, strengthen international partnerships, and use science for program evaluation and policymaking. The Strategy identifies three policy priorities: reducing prescription drug abuse, addressing drugged driving, and preventing drug use before it starts. Special attention is given to new synthetic drugs and cooperation with international partners in combating organized crime. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that federal drug abuse programs are fragmented and overlapping, recommending coordination efforts by ONDCP. The Obama Administration released a prescription drug abuse plan in 2011 to address the nation's fastest-growing drug problem. The Obama Administration's prescription drug abuse plan in 2011 included action items to reduce demand, such as training for healthcare professionals, improved drug disposal programs, and enhanced prescription drug monitoring. Health statistics show the increasing issue of prescription drug abuse, with hospital visits for prescription drug abuse now as common as visits for illicit drug abuse. ONDCP issued supplemental strategies to address drug trafficking and border security. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, updated in 2011 and 2013, focuses on disrupting drug trafficking networks along the Southwest border. Concerns include the rise in heroin seizures by 232% from 2008 to 2012. The National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy, released in 2012 and updated in 2014, addresses illicit drug operations along the U.S.-Canada border, including cocaine trafficking and exploitation of tribal lands for drug smuggling. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) focuses on combating drug trafficking of MDMA and other synthetic substances from Canada into the United States. ONDCP consults with federal agencies to create the National Drug Control Budget, which underwent restructuring in FY2012 to review programs with a \"drug control nexus\" for eligibility based on budget estimation. The ONDCP reviews federal programs for drug control nexus and budget estimation methodology. 19 federal programs or agencies were added to the Budget, with several removed since FY2012. Departments and agencies funded under the National Drug Control Budget include Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Court Services, Department of Defense, Defense Health Program, Federal Judiciary, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human Services. The curr_chunk lists various federal agencies involved in drug control efforts, including the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, National Institutes of Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and others. The FY2015 Budget requests $25.4 billion for substance abuse prevention, treatment, drug interdiction, law enforcement, and international partnerships across various federal agencies. The FY2015 request includes $25.4 billion for substance abuse prevention, treatment, drug interdiction, law enforcement, and international partnerships. The ONDCP manages the HIDTA Program and Other Federal Drug Control Programs. The HIDTA program provides assistance to law enforcement in areas impacted by drug trafficking. The ONDCP director designates areas in the US as HIDTAs based on criteria like drug activity impact and resource allocation. There are currently 28 HIDTAs in the country. The ONDCP administers the Other Federal Drug Control Programs account to support high-priority drug control programs, including the Drug-Free Communities Program and Anti-Doping Activities. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign aimed to change youth attitudes about drug use but had limited success. The campaign was recreated as \"Above the Influence\" (ATI), showing potential positive impacts on attitudes and behavior. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 required ONDCP to submit a report on a national drug control performance measurement system to evaluate the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy. The report includes two- and five-year performance measures, targets for reducing drug use, availability, and consequences, and federal information and data descriptions. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy by assessing drug use, availability, and consequences. This evaluation includes federal programs, demand- and supply-reduction activities, and the consistency of agency goals and budgets with the Strategy. ONDCP uses a Performance Reporting System to gather data from various sources for evaluation, including national research and indicators like the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The Office of National Drug Control Policy uses a Performance Reporting System to evaluate the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy. The system monitors each agency's progress towards the Strategy's objectives and measures their contribution to reducing drug use and its consequences. ONDCP Director called for an end to the term \"war on drugs\" in 2009, emphasizing that the focus should be on combating illegal drugs and their effects, not individuals consuming drugs. Director Kerlikowske highlighted a shift in societal views on drug use, emphasizing it as a public health problem. In 2013, 24.6 million Americans were current illegal drug users, representing 9.4% of the population aged 12 and older. Drug abuse contributes to over 100,000 deaths annually in the United States. The FY2015 Budget request includes approximately $25.363 billion for addressing drug-related issues. The FY2015 Budget request for drug-related issues in the United States is approximately $25.363 billion, with an increase of $151 million from the previous year. The funding allocation includes 57% for supply-side functions and 43% for demand-side functions, with details on specific programs still unclear. Supply reduction activities focus on domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and international support, while demand reduction activities prioritize treatment. The National Drug Control Budget allocates funding towards supply-side functions ($1.389 billion) and demand reduction activities, including treatment ($9.597 billion) and prevention ($1.337 billion). Policy makers question the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the current focus on supply-reduction activities, as research suggests that demand-reduction programs may be more effective at reducing drug use. Former Director Kerlikowske highlighted the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment in the National Drug Control Budget. Research shows that drug treatment for high-risk populations can reduce societal costs, while enforcement efforts only provide short-term disruptions in the drug market. Policy makers may need to decide on specific supply or demand reduction programs during ONDCP's reauthorization. Congress could oversee the implementation of evidence-based activities despite the restructuring of the budget in FY2012. Experts have questioned whether the National Drug Control Budget fully captures the nation's counter-drug activities, as it did not include costs for prosecuting and incarcerating drug offenders in the past. The revised Budget now includes some drug-related prosecution costs for U.S. Attorneys and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is responsible for housing federal inmates, including those incarcerated for drug crimes. The revised Budget now includes costs for housing inmates convicted of drug-related offenses. Some experts question if certain elements in the Budget, like assisting foreign governments in combating drug trade, effectively address the nation's drug problems. Rule of law programs may impact drug source countries, potentially reducing illicit drug availability at home. Policy makers debate the relevance of Budget elements like international supply-reduction strategies to the National Drug Control Strategy. ONDCP was required to establish a national drug control performance measurement system by Congress in 1998. Critics argue that the previous measurement system using agency data and national research had limitations. ONDCP developed the Performance Reporting System (PRS) to holistically assess the accomplishment of the National Drug Control Strategy's goals. Congress oversees the new PRS to evaluate individual programs and agencies' contributions to the Strategy's goals. ONDCP reported significant progress in achieving goals for law enforcement, international partnerships, and youth substance use prevention. According to ONDCP, key source and transit countries have shown increased commitment to reducing drug trafficking and use. Progress is needed in reducing drug cultivation in countries like Afghanistan, Burma, Laos, Mexico, and Peru. ONDCP also highlighted the need for more efforts in preventing youth marijuana use and changing perceptions about its harm. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, prohibiting its unauthorized manufacture, distribution, and possession. Despite federal restrictions on marijuana, states have implemented various laws allowing for medical and recreational use. Congress may consider addressing ONDCP's stance on marijuana legalization during its reauthorization. The Obama Administration has emphasized the need for efforts to prevent youth marijuana use and change perceptions about its harm. The Obama Administration has emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach to drug control, shifting resources towards treatment and prevention. However, federal drug laws and control funds have not significantly changed in the last decade, with a focus on law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs. ONDCP's role in U.S. drug policy and its connection to the \"war on drugs\" may be questioned during reauthorization. The modern role of ONDCP in determining U.S. drug policy may be questioned or reconsidered."
