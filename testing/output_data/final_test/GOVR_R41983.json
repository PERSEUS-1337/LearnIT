    "content": "The regulation of drugs by the federal government began with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which prohibited the interstate commerce of adulterated and misbranded drugs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) was enacted in 1938, requiring drugs to be proven safe before manufacturers could sell them in interstate commerce. The Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments to the FFDCA in 1962 increased safety provisions and required manufacturers to demonstrate the effectiveness of drugs. The FFDCA has been amended multiple times to ensure the safety and efficacy of medicines. The FDA's history reflects the balance between drug availability and safety. Advocates push for faster or slower approval processes based on evolving science and public values. Since the 1992 PDUFA, FDA's drug program has had two funding streams. The FDA's human drugs program has two funding streams: budget authority and user fees. User fees initially targeted new drug application backlog and staff efforts. Congress expanded fee coverage to include generic drug applications in 2012. FDA also regulates products other than drugs, such as biological products, medical devices, and tobacco products. To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval by demonstrating safety, effectiveness, passing FDA inspection, and obtaining approval for labeling. The drug development process starts before FDA involvement, often with basic research funded by the government or private sector. The drug development process starts with research to identify a possible drug component, followed by prototype design and testing in animals. Private industry then continues development, leading to FDA involvement for testing in humans. FDA approval requires data from clinical trials to prove safety and effectiveness before marketing in the United States. Before clinical testing, the drug's sponsor must file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA, which includes study design, animal test data, investigator qualifications, and IRB approval. The application must describe the drug's purpose, target population, and potential risks. If the FDA does not object within 30 days, clinical testing can begin with a small number of human volunteers to assess safety. After IND status is granted, researchers conduct Phase I clinical trials in human volunteers to test safety and dosing. If successful, Phase II and III trials follow to gather evidence of efficacy and monitor safety. Upon completion, a new drug application (NDA) is submitted to the FDA for review, including clinical trial results and manufacturing information. A new drug application (NDA) submitted to the FDA includes product description, indication, labeling, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). There are two types of NDAs: 505(b)(1) with full safety and effectiveness reports by the applicant, and 505(b)(2) with information from studies not conducted by the applicant. During the NDA review, FDA evaluates the drug's safety and effectiveness data, inspects facilities, and checks labeling accuracy. FDA considers drug safety, effectiveness, labeling appropriateness, and manufacturing quality. FDA personnel assess the NDA in various categories, including Medical. The FDA evaluates drug safety and effectiveness data during the NDA review process. They consider various categories such as Medical, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Statistical, Clinical, Biopharmaceutics, Risk Assessment, Risk Mitigation, Proprietary Name, and Labeling. The agency requires substantial evidence of drug safety and effectiveness, typically through two well-controlled Phase III clinical studies. FDA can assess safety and effectiveness in different ways, including convening advisory panels of outside experts for some NDAs. FDA usually follows advisory panel recommendations for NDA approval, based on review of safety and effectiveness evidence, manufacturing controls, and labeling. Approval may include postapproval studies and restrictions on distribution. FDA must approve an NDA within 180 days, with specific review times under PDUFA. The FDA has a two-tiered system for review times: Standard Review takes about 10 months, while Priority Review aims for action within 6 months. If there are deficiencies, the clock stops until additional information is provided. If the manufacturer cannot respond, they may withdraw the application. Once the information is provided, the review continues. Approval results in an approval letter or tentative approval if there are patent issues. The FDA may issue a \"complete response letter\" if an NDA does not meet approval requirements due to various deficiencies. Reasons for rejection include issues with safety and effectiveness data, manufacturing controls, labeling, and patent information. Manufacturers can submit a supplemental NDA to make changes to an approved NDA. The FDA requires applicants to submit a supplement (supplemental NDA) with specific contents, including descriptions and analysis of clinical data from controlled and uncontrolled studies. The 21st Century Cures Act allows reliance on qualified data summaries for approval of supplemental applications for qualified drug uses. The 21st Century Cures Act allows the use of real-world evidence to support new indications for approved drugs, in addition to requiring the submission of qualified data summaries for supplemental applications. The Hatch-Waxman Act established an abbreviated approval pathway for generic drugs. The generic drug applicant relies on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness of the approved brand drug to obtain premarket approval. The generic product must be pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent to the brand-name product, meeting various requirements such as chemistry, manufacturing, controls, labeling, and testing. Differences between generic and brand drugs may exist in characteristics like shape, excipients, and packaging. FDA uses formal mechanisms like fast track and breakthrough product designations to expedite drug development and review processes. These designations do not change the evidence required for safety and effectiveness, but they can alter the administrative processes and approval criteria. Accelerated approval may be based on surrogate or intermediate clinical outcomes, while the Animal Rule allows approval when human efficacy trials are not feasible. The Animal Rule allows approval based on animal efficacy studies when human trials are not possible. Priority review designation affects review timing, not the process. FDA provides incentives like market exclusivity and priority review vouchers to expedite drug development. Regulatory exclusivity can be granted for defined time periods to NDA holders. During the exclusivity period, FDA grants market exclusivity to NDA holders for certain drugs, including generics, rare diseases, pediatric uses, and infectious disease products. Priority review vouchers can be awarded for drugs targeting tropical diseases, rare pediatric diseases, or national security threats, allowing for expedited approval. Other legislative acts also support faster drug development and approval processes. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 allow the HHS Secretary to authorize emergency use of products without FDA approval. FDA ensures drug safety and effectiveness post-approval through surveillance, studies, and labeling changes. Manufacturers and clinicians report adverse reactions to FDA for oversight. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research focuses on drug supply safety. The FDA's Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) focuses on identifying drug safety concerns and recommending actions to improve product safety. They review adverse event reports, conduct studies, monitor literature, review errors, and communicate balanced benefit and risk information to clinicians and consumers. They also stay in contact with international regulatory bodies. The FDA's CDER units, including the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, Division of Drug Information, and Office of Compliance, evaluate safety issues and address drug security, manufacturing quality, and unapproved drugs. The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) conducts field activities such as inspections. The Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee, established in July 2002, focuses on drug safety with members appointed by the commissioner representing expertise in science, risk communication, and risk management. The Drug Safety Oversight Board advises the FDA Commissioner on drug safety issues and includes members from various healthcare organizations. It was created as part of the 2005 Drug Safety Initiative and is required by FDAAA since 2007. Its role is to provide guidance on handling and communicating drug safety issues and to discuss potential safety concerns. The FDA's postmarket drug safety and effectiveness activities focus on product integrity, labeling, reporting, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, and direct-to-consumer advertising. Ensuring the integrity of drug products and protecting the supply chain from various risks are key concerns for the agency. FDA monitors manufacturers, processers, packagers, importers, and distributors to ensure compliance with FFDCA requirements. The FDA regulates manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and transportation plans to ensure drug product integrity. Manufacturers must meet various requirements such as annual registration, adherence to cGMP, inspection requirements, and reporting obligations. FDA monitors product integrity beyond initial manufacture. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 established track-and-trace requirements for prescription drugs, requiring manufacturers to put a product identifier on each package. Exchange of transaction information is required when transferring drugs within the supply chain. Verification and notification systems are also mandated for suspected product issues. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 established track-and-trace requirements for prescription drugs, requiring manufacturers to put a product identifier on each package. It also mandates verification and notification systems for suspected product issues, such as when a product may be suspect or illegitimate. The act aims to establish national standards for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. The regulation of compounding pharmacies, where pharmacists mix ingredients to create non-FDA-approved drugs based on specific prescriptions, is a state function but has raised concerns about businesses compounding drugs without patient-specific prescriptions. In 2012, a fungal meningitis epidemic linked to a compounding business raised concerns. The Compounding Quality Act of 2013 created outsourcing facilities for compounding sterile drugs beyond pharmacy regulations. These facilities must register with the FDA and follow CGMPs. FDA monitors drug safety by gathering information on adverse reactions reported by manufacturers. Health professionals and patients must report serious and unexpected adverse events to the FDA within 15 days. In 2016, FDA received 1.2 million new reports of adverse events for drugs. The agency uses the FAERS database to analyze reports and determine any potential drug problems. FDA scientists review reported adverse events to assess drug reactions and may recommend changes in drug labeling. The FDA conducts surveillance activities to monitor adverse events related to drugs. They may recommend changes in drug labeling or require further studies on observed associations. Limitations include passive reporting, potential unrelated events, and difficulty in interpreting the extent of the problem without knowing the total number of drug users. In response, the FDA initiated the Sentinel Initiative in 2008 to address these limitations and comply with FDAAA requirements. The FDA's Sentinel Initiative, established in response to limitations in drug surveillance, aims to actively identify and analyze postmarket risks. Utilizing data from various sources, including electronic health records and insurance claims, Sentinel operates on a larger scale since 2016. Independent assessments have highlighted its partnerships with data organizations, covering a significant number of lives, enabling more precise estimates of adverse events and informing FDA decisions. The FDA's Sentinel Initiative aims to actively identify and analyze postmarket risks using data from various sources. Independent assessments have highlighted its partnerships with data organizations, enabling more precise estimates of adverse events and informing FDA decisions. Researchers have mixed opinions on Sentinel's utility, with some noting little impact despite resources committed, while others emphasize the value of its continued efforts. FDA can require postapproval studies either at initial approval or once a drug is on the market, including when granting accelerated approval. FDA regulations require postmarket studies for drugs granted accelerated approval or approval based on the animal efficacy rule to verify and describe clinical benefit when there is uncertainty. Postmarketing studies are required for drugs granted accelerated approval or approval based on the animal efficacy rule to verify clinical benefit and assess safety. Applicants must include a plan for postmarketing study commitments. The Pediatric Research Equity Act mandates pediatric assessments for new drugs, specifying situations for deferral or waiver. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 added the option for postmarket requirements at the time of drug approval, allowing the Secretary to mandate specific postapproval studies or trials. This includes the ability to require a pediatric assessment for drugs already on the market under certain circumstances. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 allows the Secretary to mandate postapproval studies or trials under specified conditions based on newly acquired information. The FDA implements various tools to ensure approved drugs are safe and effective, including additional actions for specific drugs or circumstances. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 allows the Secretary to mandate postapproval studies or trials under specified conditions based on newly acquired information. FDA implements risk-management processes to minimize risks to patients, including the use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. The FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) when new information arises or for new drug applications. A REMS may include patient and healthcare provider information, distribution restrictions, and monitoring systems. The manufacturer must create a communication plan to disseminate information about REMS elements, drug risks, and safety protocols to healthcare providers. Elements to assure safe use (ETASU) are restrictions intended to minimize adverse events and block access to those at risk. FDA can approve a drug with ETASU to mitigate potential harm. FDA can approve a drug with restrictions under FFDCA Section 505-1(f)(3) to mitigate risks, including specific training for healthcare providers, certification for pharmacies, safe-use conditions for patients, monitoring, and enrollment in a registry. Approved REMS must include a timetable for reporting to FDA. FDA also disseminates drug safety information through various communication channels. The FDA uses various communication channels to distribute information on drug safety and effectiveness to healthcare professionals and the public. This includes a web page with links to drug-specific information, potential risks, and summary statistics, as well as Drug Safety Communications, FDA Drug Safety Podcasts, FDA Drug Info Rounds, and FDA Drug Information on Twitter. The FDA is required by law to inform the public, expert committees, and others about agency actions and plans related to drug safety and effectiveness. This includes establishing advisory committees and reporting on safety risks associated with FDA-regulated products. The FDA uses various communication channels to distribute information on drug safety and effectiveness to healthcare professionals and the public. This includes web pages with links to drug-specific information, potential risks, and summary statistics, as well as Drug Safety Communications, FDA Drug Safety Podcasts, FDA Drug Info Rounds, and FDA Drug Information on Twitter. FDA regulations on labeling dictate the material the labeling must provide along with required formatting. FDA included the following description when it issued its 2006 final rule on labeling: A prescription drug's labeling is more than the sticker the pharmacy places on the amber vial it dispenses to a customer. The FDA's 2006 final rule on labeling defines prescription drug labeling as FDA-approved information necessary for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. It includes brochures, booklets, and other materials for professional supervision. The FDA's 2006 final rule on labeling defines prescription drug labeling as FDA-approved information necessary for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. This includes various forms of printed, audio, or visual materials containing drug information for medical practitioners, pharmacists, or nurses. FDA requires labeling to start with a highlights section, including black-box warnings for emphasis, and lists required elements such as indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, and precautions. The FDA requires prescription drug labeling to include key information such as administration, dosage forms, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and clinical studies. Labeling is crucial for providing safety and effectiveness information to healthcare practitioners and patients. FDA may also require manufacturers to produce a Medication Guide for additional safety information. The FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) conducts research on risk and benefit communication to professionals and consumers, focusing on accessible, accurate, and up-to-date information. FDA-approved labeling is relevant for insurance coverage, market exclusivity, and liability discussions. Regulatory actions like labeling changes or drug withdrawals may occur in response to adverse events. The FDA can request labeling changes based on information from industry reports, postmarket studies, and adverse event reports. The FDA may require labeling changes based on new safety information from event reports. Manufacturers can also initiate label changes for new uses or marketing claims by submitting new data to the FDA. Generic drugs must have the same labeling as the innovator drug, with some exceptions. The FDA allows generic drug manufacturers to update labeling with new safety information voluntarily, even if it differs from the brand-name drug. This change can be made temporarily by submitting a supplement to the FDA for review. The FDA allows generic drug manufacturers to update labeling with new safety information voluntarily, even if it differs from the brand-name drug. The ANDA supplement for safety-related labeling changes would be approved upon approval of the same change for the brand-name drug. Opposition from the generic drug industry claims the rule would expose companies to new legal liability. FDA approves a drug based on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing requirements, and labeling. Despite approved labeling, a licensed physician may prescribe the drug without restriction. Off-label use of drugs, which involves prescribing medication for uses not listed in FDA-approved labeling, is a common practice. The FDA prohibits manufacturers from promoting drugs for off-label uses, as it can pose safety and effectiveness concerns that premarket studies may not have addressed. Manufacturers rarely conduct studies to establish the safety and effectiveness of their drugs for off-label uses. Drug and device companies argue that regulations hinder them from sharing information on off-label uses of their products. FDA held a meeting in 2016 to discuss this issue and issued draft guidance in 2017 on communicating data not in approved labeling but related to approved uses. The guidance addresses frequently asked questions and provides examples of acceptable information. The FDA provides guidance on what information is consistent with FDA-required labeling for a product, such as additional context about adverse reactions, and what is not consistent, such as promoting off-label uses. FDA regulates prescription drug advertising, while the FTC regulates nonprescription drug ads. FDAAA expanded FDA's enforcement tools. FDAAA expanded FDA's enforcement tools for advertising, allowing the agency to review television ads before dissemination and make recommendations for changes to protect consumers. The law also permits FDA to require certain disclosures in ads but does not mandate changes. The FDA can review TV ads before they are aired and recommend changes to protect consumers. The law allows the FDA to require specific disclosures in ads to prevent false or misleading information. Civil penalties can be imposed for disseminating false or misleading direct-to-consumer advertisements. Ads must present side effects and contraindications clearly, conspicuously, and neutrally. All published DTC ads must include a statement encouraging reporting of negative side effects to the FDA."
