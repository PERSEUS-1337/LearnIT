    "content": "The Act is titled \"Social Security for the 21st Century Act\" and includes provisions for Retirement Security Accounts under Part B. The Act \"Social Security for the 21st Century Act\" includes definitions for key terms such as Commissioner, electing individual, eligible individual, and retirement security account. The Retirement Security Fund, administered by the Retirement Security Fund Investment Board, defines the term 'retirement security account contribution' as per section 252(e)(2)(A). The Retirement Security Fund oversees the election and establishment of retirement security accounts. Sec. 252 allows eligible individuals to elect to make retirement security account contributions, which are irrevocable once made. The election can be done through W-4 forms or other methods prescribed by the Commissioner for ease of administration. The Commissioner must establish an account within 30 days of receiving the first contribution for the individual. The retirement security account is established for electing individuals, identified by their social security number. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers contributions from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund to the account. Contributions are irrevocable once made and must be done during an election period. During an election period, an amount equal to a percentage of wages or self-employment income is collected under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for electing individuals. The applicable percentage increases for each successive quarter, not exceeding 50 percent. During an election period, an amount equal to a percentage of wages or self-employment income is collected under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for electing individuals. The percentage increases by 2.5 points for each successive 4 quarters, and for amounts collected under section 1401(a) of the Code, it increases by 1.25 points for the first 4 quarters, not exceeding 25 percent. Each electing individual must designate one or more investment options for their retirement security account where contributions are credited. The Commissioner may prescribe intervals for ease of administration and reductions in burdens on employers. In the absence of an individual's designation, the Commissioner will designate an investment option for their retirement security account. Treatment of retirement security accounts: Any retirement security account will be treated similarly to an individual account in the Thrift Savings Fund under title 5, United States Code. Sec. 254 outlines the rules for distributions from a retirement security account, specifying that distributions can only be made once the individual starts receiving benefits. At least 75 percent of the account balance must be paid out in the form of annuities or equal monthly payments determined by the individual's life expectancy. The retirement security account rules require distributions to be made to the electing individual in a manner similar to benefits under title 5, with excess funds payable according to the individual's choice. In the event of death before distribution, rules apply for handling the account. Distribution of the balance in an individual's retirement security account upon death will be in a lump sum to the heirs, as per rules set by the Retirement Security Fund Investment Board. All distributions are tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Retirement Security Fund distributes the balance in an individual's account to heirs in a lump sum, following tax-exempt rules set by the Investment Board. The Retirement Security Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, similar to the Thrift Savings Fund. A Retirement Security Fund Investment Board is created to manage and report on the activities of the fund. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board manages and reports on the retirement security accounts similar to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. It conducts a study on increasing investment options for individual retirement security accounts. After the Social Security for the 21st Century Act is enacted, the Retirement Security Fund Investment Board will submit a report to the President and Congress detailing the results of a study and recommending legislative actions. The Retirement Security Fund and accounts are exempt from the US Government budget totals and limitations. Amendments apply to elections after December 31, 2000. Social Security benefits may be reduced upon election under Part B. The primary insurance amount for an electing individual under Part B will be reduced by 50 percent. This reduction will not affect the benefits of any dependent individuals. The amendment will be effective for benefits received after December 31, 2000. SEC. 3. Amends the Social Security Act to include an estimate of retirement security account contributions and balances in personal earnings and benefit statements. SEC. 4. Establishes a special reserve account. A special reserve account called the 'Protect Social Security Account' is established within the Treasury to save budget surpluses until a reform measure is enacted to ensure the long-term solvency of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay into the account an amount equal to 70 percent of the projected surplus in the total budget of the United States Government for a specified fiscal-year period. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will project the budget surplus for the United States Government for a specific fiscal-year period. The funds held in the account will be invested until a reform measure is enacted, allowing the issuance of public-debt obligations for purchase. The account holds funds that generate interest and proceeds from redemption of obligations. The term 'total budget of the United States Government' refers to all spending and receipt accounts. The amendment applies to fiscal years starting from October 1, 1999."
