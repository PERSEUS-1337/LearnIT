    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is amended to include the Territory of Guam in the definition of affected areas exposed to nuclear fallout. Congress finds that between 1946 and 1962, the United States conducted nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands, detonating a total of sixty-seven atomic and thermonuclear bombs. The Atomic Energy Commission detonated these nuclear devices with a total yield of 108,492.2 kilotons. Some detonations projected material into the jet-stream at heights of up to fifty-five miles. On October 31, 1952, the first true H-Bomb, Ivy Mike, was detonated at Elugelab Island, Enewetak Atoll. The 10.4 megaton device was the fourth largest ever tested by the United States, creating a massive mushroom cloud that reached 120,000 feet. On April 27, 2005, the National Research Council submitted a report to Congress on the Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program. The National Research Council reported on populations at risk for radiation exposure from nuclear testing, focusing on the RECA downwinder population near the NTS. Congress found that fallout from nuclear tests exposed people to radiation, leading to increased cancer risk. The United States conducted nuclear-weapons tests in areas other than NTS, including the Trinity test in New Mexico and Pacific tests. Downwinder populations exposed to radioactive fallout may be eligible for RECA compensation. Concerns about health effects from nuclear testing fallout reaching Guam led to the formation of the Pacific Association for Radiation Survivors. The National Research Council concluded that Guam received measurable fallout from nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific, recommending compensation for residents similar to downwinders. In 1974, the Laboratory of Radiation Ecology started a program to identify radionuclides in the Central Pacific's food, plants, animals, and soils. The study aimed to identify radionuclides in common foods and soils in Guam as part of a program to assess the impact of nuclear weapons testing fallout in the Central Pacific. Analysis revealed the presence of gamma-emitting radionuclides, Strontium 90, Plutonium 239,240, Cesium 137,210 PB, and 235 U in the soil. One notable finding was a high 137 Cs value of 18 pCi/g in the edible portion of a pandanus fruit from Guam. ELIGIBILITY TO FILE A CLAIM BASED ON PRESENCE DURING PERIOD OF TESTING. Claims relating to leukemia under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act are amended to include individuals physically present in the affected area for at least 1 year during a specific period. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is amended to include individuals present in the affected area from June 30, 1946, to November 30, 1974, for specified diseases. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is amended to include individuals present in the affected area from June 30, 1946, to November 30, 1974, for specified diseases, with specific criteria for eligibility. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is amended to include individuals present in the affected area from June 30, 1946, to November 30, 1974, for specified diseases, with specific criteria for eligibility. Amendments to RECA. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is amended to provide additional relief for individuals who resided in Guam during the specified time period. The National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will evaluate eligibility for compensation on a case-by-case basis. Eligible individuals can also receive compensation for other expenses. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is amended to provide relief for individuals in Guam. Eligible individuals can receive compensation for various expenses related to the specific disease contracted. The Health Resources and Services Administration will conduct an education program on the health risks of ionizing radiation exposure from fallout of US nuclear-weapons testing."
