    "content": "The \"Vanishing Wildlife Stamp Act of 2000\" is the short title of this Act. It introduces special postage stamps related to vanishing wildlife protection. The Postal Service will establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail to support vanishing wildlife protection programs. The rate will be no more than 25% higher than the regular rate and can be implemented without following standard procedures. It will be offered as an alternative to the regular first-class rate of postage. The Postal Service will establish a voluntary special rate of postage for first-class mail to support wildlife protection programs. Payments from this rate will be made to the Department of Interior Multilateral Species Conservation Fund at least twice a year. The Postal Service will establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail to support wildlife protection programs. The amount will cover costs incurred by the Postal Service, and it is the sense of Congress that this should not decrease funds received by government agencies or affect regular postage rates. Special postage stamps will be created under this section. Special postage stamps will be available to the public within 12 months of enactment. The Postmaster General must report on the operation of this section in each report under section 2402. This section will cease to be effective after 2 years. The section on special postage stamps will end after 2 years. The Comptroller General will report on its effectiveness and resource requirements to Congress before the end of the 2-year period. Technical and conforming amendments will also be made. The table of sections for chapter 4 of title 39, United States Code, is amended by removing the item relating to section 414 and inserting a new item. Section 414 of title 39, United States Code, is amended to include special postage stamps related to breast cancer and funding vanishing wildlife protection programs."
