The Middle Income Tax Relief Act of 1995 introduces a capital gains deduction for individuals with adjusted gross income over $200,000. The deduction is based on the net capital gain on the sale or exchange of qualified assets for the taxable year. Special rules apply for losses from sales or exchanges of qualified assets after January 1, 1995. The Middle Income Tax Relief Act of 1995 introduces a capital gains deduction for individuals with adjusted gross income over $200,000 based on the net capital gain on the sale or exchange of qualified assets for the taxable year. An irrevocable election can be made to not include qualified gain for the taxable year. Qualified assets are defined as any capital asset except collectibles. Certain cases, such as sales to related persons or individuals under 25, are exempt from this subsection. The Middle Income Tax Relief Act of 1995 introduces a capital gains deduction for individuals with adjusted gross income over $200,000 based on the net capital gain on the sale or exchange of qualified assets for the taxable year. An irrevocable election can be made to not include qualified gain for the taxable year. Special rules apply for determining the amount of qualified gain from the sale or exchange of real property, where the indexed basis of the property is substituted for its adjusted basis. The adjusted basis of real property described in the Middle Income Tax Relief Act of 1995 is multiplied by the applicable inflation ratio, which is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the acquisition and disposition months. The applicable inflation ratio for acquired assets is rounded to the nearest \\1/10\\ of 1 percent, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the calendar month. Real property includes land and section 1250 property. Gain from certain sales of interests in partnerships is subject to subsection (b). For subsection (b), gain from selling a qualified asset like a partnership interest is not considered gain from selling the asset if it's due to unrealized appreciation in the entity's property. The deduction is only available for sales after December 31, 1994, limited to the net capital gain determined under subsection (b)(3)(A). The net capital gain for tax purposes is determined by gains and losses from sales and exchanges after January 1, 1995. Any capital loss under section 1212 is treated as a loss from a sale or exchange after that date. To qualify, the holding period of the property sold must exceed 3 years. Adjusted gross income is used to calculate the gain under subsection (b). Adjusted gross income is determined without considering deductions allowed under this section, but after applying sections 86, 135, 219, and 469. For pass-thru entities, the sale or exchange timing is determined at the entity level. Pass-thru entities, including regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds, are defined for tax purposes. The deduction under section 1203 is not allowed for capital gains. The maximum capital gains rate is amended in subsection (h) of section 1. The maximum capital gains rate is amended in subsection (h) of section 1, limiting the tax imposed on net capital gains for taxpayers. The taxpayer's net capital gain for a taxable year can be reduced by electing to consider investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii). Additionally, the net capital gain amount is adjusted by deductions under section 1203. Conforming amendments include a new capital gains deduction in section 62 and adjustments to section 163(d)(4)(B)(i) for deductions under section 1203. The amendment under section 1203 limits deductions for losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets for taxpayers other than corporations. It also disallows the exclusion provided by section 1202 and the deduction provided by section 1203. Amendments are made to sections 172(d) and 172(d)(4) to reflect these changes. Section 220 is amended by inserting ``(2)(C),'' after ``(2)(B),'' and Section 220 now reads as follows. Section 220 is amended to include a new cross reference. The table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 is amended to include references to sections 1202 and 1203 for deductions related to net capital gains and decedents. The self-employment of options or commodities dealers is not excluded from gain or loss related to section 1256 contracts. The deduction provided by section 1203 does not apply. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part I of subchapter P of chapter 1. The amendments made by section 1203, regarding capital gains deduction for individuals, will apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1994."
