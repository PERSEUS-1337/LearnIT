    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Eliminating Dangerous Oil Cars and Ensuring Community Safety Act\" and involves retrofitting or phasing out certain tank cars. Section 20155 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require rail carriers to retrofit DOT-111 and CPC-1232 tank cars for shipping hazardous materials by specific deadlines. The retrofitting must adhere to the DOT-117 specification design for safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The deadlines vary based on the type of tank car and the materials being carried. The amendment to Section 20155 of title 49, US Code, mandates rail carriers to retrofit DOT-111 and CPC-1232 tank cars for transporting hazardous materials by specified deadlines. The retrofitting must meet the DOT-117 specification for safe rail transportation of flammable liquids. Deadlines vary depending on the tank car type and the materials carried, with different dates set for non-jacketed and jacketed CPC-1232 tank cars based on the Packing Group classification. The Eliminating Dangerous Oil Cars and Ensuring Community Safety Act mandates a national maximum volatility standard for transporting crude oil by rail or barge. Additionally, speed restrictions are imposed on trains with tank cars that do not comply with federal safety standards. The legislation mandates speed restrictions for trains with certain tank cars carrying hazardous materials that have not been retrofitted to meet safety standards. Trains with non-compliant tank cars cannot exceed 40 miles per hour in counties with high population density. In 2015, a final rule was established for the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail, limiting the speed to 40 miles per hour in counties with a population density of over 20 persons per square mile. Rail carriers are required to conduct additional inspections for internal defects on main line routes where high-hazard flammable trains operate. This includes 2 inspections for rail in Classes 3, 4, and 5 for every 40,000,000 gross tons transported or annually, and 4 track geometry inspections each calendar year. Additionally, there is a positive train control requirement in place. SEC. 6 amends Chapter 201 of title 49, requiring rail lines carrying crude oil or ethanol to have a positive train control system by December 1, 2018. SEC. 7 addresses oil spill response plans. Rail carriers transporting crude oil, petroleum, or hazardous products by rail must develop comprehensive oil spill response plans as per federal regulations. The Federal Railroad Administration will audit these plans to ensure they include procedures for preventing and responding to worst-case discharge incidents. The Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration, will update regulations to require comprehensive response plans for worst-case oil and petroleum discharge incidents involving unit trains or tank cars. SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. Close Call Reporting Systems and Derailment Reporting Requirements are being amended in Section 20901 of title 49, United States Code. Rail carriers must establish a system for employees to anonymously report safety-endangering incidents. Additionally, a new requirement mandates immediate notification after the derailment of a high hazard flammable train. The rail carrier must provide detailed information to the Federal Railroad Administration and county emergency management after a train derailment, including train number, locomotive models, tank car details, and specifications. After a train derailment, the rail carrier must provide information such as steel specification, grade, head shield, pressure relief valve setting, waybill details (origin, destination, goods, consignors), safety data sheet for hazardous chemicals, and emergency response documents for Class 3 flammable liquids within 90 minutes. After a high hazard flammable train derailment, the rail carrier must provide the Federal Railroad Administration with results of product testing, analysis of product samples, details of the flammable liquid involved, and information about the companies involved in testing and extraction. After a high hazard flammable train derailment, the rail carrier must provide the Federal Railroad Administration with details of the companies involved in transporting, loading, and handling the flammable liquid, including sampling and analysis, company names and locations, and a timeline of handling changes between railroads."
