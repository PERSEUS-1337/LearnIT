    "content": "Since FY2008, federal highway user taxes and fees have been insufficient to fund the surface transportation program authorized by Congress. The 2015 surface transportation act addressed the revenue shortfall through FY2020 by allowing the use of general funds for transportation purposes. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $20 billion annual gap between dedicated surface transportation revenues and spending after FY2020. This may lead to a renewed interest in tolling as a means of financing transportation projects without federal expenditures. States can impose tolls on roads, bridges, and tunnels built and maintained without federal assistance, and new federally assisted infrastructure may also be tolled. Existing federally assisted facilities can be converted to toll roads but must meet certain requirements for reconstruction or replacement. The report discusses federal policies on tolling for surface transportation projects, highlighting issues such as tolling existing Interstate System highways and the challenges faced by toll roads in the past. Tolling is seen as a potential source of revenue for transportation projects, especially as federal funds may not be sufficient after FY2020. The Federal-Aid Road Act of 1916 emphasized that roads should be toll-free, but the Oldfield Act of 1927 allowed toll bridges with state operation. Despite opposition from the federal Bureau of Public Roads, toll roads were built in the Northeast without federal aid after World War II, totaling 1,239 miles by 1955. By January 1, 1955, there were 1,239 miles of completed \"arterial toll roads\" in the United States, with more under construction and planned. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 prohibited tolls on new Interstate highways and established the Highway Trust Fund to finance the construction of the Interstate Highway System. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) was established to finance the Interstate Highway System using fuel and highway taxes. Federal funds, focused on Interstate highways, hindered the development of new toll roads by states. ISTEA in 1991 allowed tolling on non-Interstate highways after reconstruction, linking tolling to capacity additions. Subsequent acts like TEA-21 and SAFETEA permitted tolling on HOV lanes and pilot projects for tolling. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) reinforced the encouragement of tolls on high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and congestion pricing. MAP-21 allowed tolling on new Interstate System routes and additional lane capacity, while FAST Act clarified that public authorities may impose tolls. The MAP-21 and FAST Act encouraged tolls on HOV lanes and congestion pricing. FAST Act clarified that public authorities can impose tolls on single-occupant vehicles using HOV lanes. Federal approval for tolls on Interstate highway segments lapses if construction doesn't start within three years. FHWA does not set toll rates, and toll agreements no longer need to be negotiated with the U.S. Department of Transportation before federal participation in toll facility construction. Any eligible entity can implement tolling on eligible facilities. The legal ability to toll is based on exceptions to the 1958 \"Freedom from Tolls\" provision of 23 U.S.C. Section 301, with the only absolute prohibition being the retention of toll-free surface lane count on existing Interstate System highways. The decision to convert a free facility to a tolled facility must be made before completion of the qualifying reconstruction project, as once physical construction is finished, it is too late to make the decision to toll unless another qualifying project is undertaken. The legal ability to toll is based on exceptions to the 1958 \"Freedom from Tolls\" provision of 23 U.S.C. Section 301. Toll collection may be initiated when the contract is awarded for construction activities that render the facility eligible for conversion. Existing toll-free highways may be converted under the Value Pricing Pilot Program. High occupancy vehicle lanes can be converted to high occupancy toll facilities, allowing single-passenger vehicles access for a toll. Toll rates on toll roads are not regulated by FHWA. The FHWA does not regulate toll rates on toll roads, as it is the responsibility of the toll road owner or operator. The Regulation of Tolling provision requires bridge tolls to be \"just and reasonable,\" but this is not clearly defined. The FAST Act mandated that intercity buses have the same access and pay the same rates as public transportation buses. Public authorities operating high-occupancy toll lanes on the Interstate System must consult with affected metropolitan planning organizations on toll placement and amounts. The FHWA oversees the use of toll revenues, ensuring they are used for debt service, reserves, maintenance, and other necessary costs. The Regulation of Tolling provision does not regulate toll rates, leaving it to the toll road owner or operator. Intercity buses are mandated to have equal access and pay the same rates as public transportation buses. Public authorities must consult with metropolitan planning organizations on toll placement and amounts for high-occupancy toll lanes on the Interstate System. The Regulation of Tolling provision under MAP-21 requires annual audits to ensure toll revenues are used for debt service, maintenance, and other necessary costs. If a toll facility is not in compliance, toll collection may be discontinued until an agreement is reached. Toll roads must have sufficient traffic willing to pay to cover costs. Some toll roads struggle to generate enough revenue to cover construction and maintenance costs, leading to financial challenges. Publicly owned toll roads have had varying degrees of success, with some being able to fund capital improvements and contribute to other highway activities. However, others, like the 8 miles of express toll lanes on I-95 north of Baltimore, have faced difficulties since opening in December 2014. The toll lanes on I-95 north of Baltimore opened in December 2014 but struggled to generate expected revenue. Recent federal policy promotes tolling for private investment in highway construction, but some private toll roads like the Pocahontas Parkway in VA and SH-130 near Austin, TX have faced financial difficulties due to low traffic volumes. The SH 130 toll road in Texas, opened in 2012, had lower traffic volumes than forecasted, leading to the Texas Department of Transportation subsidizing truck tolls. In March 2016, the toll road operator filed for bankruptcy along with other toll roads like the South Bay Expressway in San Diego and the Indiana Toll Road. These failures have made investors cautious about toll revenue projects, leading to some private investors requiring regular payments from the government in public-private partnerships. Regular payments from the government to private entities reduce risk for the private sector but leave the public entity vulnerable if toll revenue falls short. Toll collection for transportation funding is less efficient due to high administrative costs compared to federal motor fuels taxes. Fuel tax collection costs less than 1% of the amount collected and is administratively simple with enforcement facilitated by a small number of collection points. Toll collection costs are significantly higher than fuel tax collection, making it challenging to determine the true cost. The study estimated that toll collection costs range from 16.5% to 92.6% of the amount collected, with some costs not readily identified in financial reports. Toll facilities now primarily collect tolls electronically, which should be more cost-effective than manual collection. However, many toll facilities still employ collectors for cash tolls. Recent financial reports show that collecting highway tolls costs between 8% and 13% of the amount collected, with detailed breakdowns including bank and credit card fees, transaction processing fees, and costs for in-vehicle transponders. Highway toll revenue nationwide totaled $14.35 billion. Highway toll revenue nationwide reached $14.35 billion in FY2014, with toll revenue as a share of total highway spending remaining steady at 5-6% for over 50 years. On average, $2.36 million was collected per mile of toll road or bridge in FY2014, with revenue varying among facilities. All toll revenue goes to state, local agencies, or private entities operating tolled facilities, not to the federal government. Expanding tolling could potentially reduce federal road expenditures. Increasing revenue from tolling can be achieved by expanding the extent of toll roads. Statistics show that there are 5,882 tolled miles of roads, bridges, and tunnels in the US as of January 1, 2015, representing a 25% increase since 1990. Toll-road mileage makes up only 0.6% of the total public roads eligible for federal highway aid. Despite the potential financial feasibility of tolling existing roads, proposals to do so have faced strong opposition in several states. Vehicle miles traveled in the US decreased after the 2007 recession but have been increasing since 2014. The increase in vehicle miles traveled per capita in 2015 and 2016 could lead to higher toll revenues. However, long-term trends like the popularity of city living may slow growth in motor vehicle use, affecting toll revenue. Lowering toll rates could increase road use, but the net revenue must exceed the revenue lost from lower rates. Increasing the average toll per mile is another option, but toll rates can be contentious politically, especially when revenue is used for purposes other than maintaining the toll facility. Trucking interests often oppose rate increases. Trucking interests frequently oppose rate changes that increase truck tolls relative to automobile tolls. Political concerns may lead to toll reductions on publicly owned facilities. Private concessionaires have contracts specifying maximum toll rate increases. State toll subsidies can be implemented due to public and political pressure. Large toll increases may divert motorists to non-tolled routes. Tolling individual transportation facilities may have limited impact on states overcoming federal grant reductions. Some states may struggle with federal grant reductions, and tolling individual facilities may not be sufficient. Congress may consider reducing the federal surface transportation program to address the shortfall in motor fuels tax revenue. Tolls can be effective for financing specific facilities but may not provide broad financial support for transportation programs. Networking toll facilities can offer advantages of scale and cross-subsidization within the network. Facilitating an increase in tolled Interstate System mileage has been a major issue in federal tolling policy. Nearly 750 miles of Interstate highways were built or converted to toll roads from 1990 to 2015, representing 64% of the increase in toll road mileage. Federal restrictions on tolling the Interstate System have been reduced since 1992, with the main remaining restriction being the requirement to maintain the same number of free lanes on surface Interstate highways. Expanding tolling on the Interstate System could involve requiring tolling on roads and bridges as they are rebuilt with less federal funding. Bonds could be issued to fund construction costs upfront, with toll revenues used to pay for costs. This gradual process could lead to a nationwide per-mile toll network, requiring legal changes at state and federal levels. Tolling the entire Interstate System could raise an estimated $104 billion in new revenue annually, potentially covering maintenance costs. However, this would impose a significant financial burden on users compared to current fuel taxes. Some sections of the system may struggle to generate sufficient revenue. A Transportation Research Board report in 2007 estimated that 21% of rural Interstate highways could be viable as toll roads, with the potential for tolls on heavily traveled roads to subsidize low-traffic rural routes. Federal funds for Interstate System projects account for 27% to 32% of total annual federal-aid highway obligations, amounting to about $11 billion to $12 billion annually. Converting all Interstate highways to a self-sustaining toll network could reduce federal highway program spending from $45 billion to around $33 billion per year, aligning it with motor fuels tax revenues supporting the Highway Trust Fund. An alternative could be to convert only urban Interstates, which make up approximately 8% of the total urban Interstate highway mileage. Converting currently free urban Interstates to toll roads could potentially generate nearly $40 billion in annual revenue, but operating costs may reduce this amount. Some urban Interstates may not generate enough revenue to cover conversion and ongoing expenses. The TRB report suggested that up to 8,000 miles of urban Interstates could benefit from high occupancy toll lanes or other pricing strategies. Converting urban Interstates to toll roads could generate significant revenue, but costs of tolling implementation and road reconstruction could be substantial. Estimates range from $1 trillion to $3 trillion for road-building costs if tolling is introduced alongside reconstruction. States would need to invest in toll-collection equipment, cameras, and communication infrastructure, potentially requiring higher tolls on busier routes to subsidize less busy ones. Bond financing would also add interest expenses. The conversion of a significant portion of the Interstate Highway System from free roads to toll roads would require studies, equipment, and infrastructure construction. Tolling may not significantly reduce the need for taxpayer funding over a 10- or 15-year period. Toll revenues can support highway projects relying on debt finance and private equity investment, as encouraged by Congress through innovative financing mechanisms like P3s. Innovative financing mechanisms like P3s utilize toll revenues to service municipal bonds for highway projects, supported by federal tax exclusions. Private activity bonds can also be funded with toll revenues, and the TIFIA provides federal credit assistance for leveraging nonfederal funding, including private sector investments. The TIFIA program supports loans for highway projects with dedicated revenue streams like toll revenues. A National Infrastructure Bank could also use toll revenues to fund highways and bridges. However, toll-supported financing may only cover a small portion of highway spending unless mandated for large-scale projects like Interstate highway reconstruction. The current federal-aid highway program operates as a state-run federal grant program. The federal-aid highway program is state-run, with states owning highways within their borders. Converting highways to toll roads would be at states' discretion, potentially leading to a piecemeal outcome. Congress could require states to implement toll roads on Interstates in exchange for federal grants, with FHWA determining the conversion sequence to avoid toll wars. Implementation of tolls on highways would require upfront investments in infrastructure such as gantries, transponder readers, and software. Federal oversight would prevent toll wars between states, with states operating toll roads directly or through a toll authority. Calls for greater federal involvement may arise if there is a significant increase in toll facilities or a decision to convert the Interstate System to toll roads. Implementing tolls on highways would require investments in infrastructure. Greater federal involvement may be needed if the Interstate System is converted to toll roads, leading to calls for federal regulation of tolling rates and strategies. This could involve setting federal standards for tolls and enforcing the requirement that tolls be \"just and reasonable.\" Congress would need to clarify which federal agency would oversee tolling regulations and rates, as some FHWA offices have been hesitant to enforce compliance with tolling laws. States have expressed concerns about implementing tolls and then facing repercussions from the FHWA. In the absence of federal toll regulation, legal issues have shifted to the courts. Electronic tolling allows operators to charge varying rates based on user residence, raising concerns about potential violations of the dormant Commerce Clause. Congress relies on the Commerce Clause to regulate interstate commerce, but questions remain about the constitutionality of toll variations based on residency. The Commerce Clause serves as the constitutional basis for many laws passed in the last 80 years, providing broad authority for Congress. Courts have interpreted the Commerce Clause to limit state actions that interfere with interstate commerce. Federal courts have distinguished between \"differentiation\" and \"discrimination\" in cases involving highway tolls, allowing discounted tolls for in-state residents as long as they do not favor in-state commercial interests. The modern standard for fees levied by states under the dormant Commerce Clause is effectively a. The modern standard for fees levied by states under the dormant Commerce Clause is a three-pronged inquiry: (1) fair approximation of facility use, (2) not excessive in relation to benefits, and (3) no discrimination against interstate commerce. In Cohen v. Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority, a toll schedule for the Newport Bridge was upheld despite challenges from out-of-state motorists. The court upheld the toll schedule for the Newport Bridge, stating that it did not discriminate against interstate commerce and was based on a fair approximation of facility use. In Yerger v. Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, a challenge to tolls in Massachusetts was also rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard an appeal regarding the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority's Fast Lane Discount Program, which offered discounted toll fares to Fast Lane users but not E-ZPass users. The court found that the toll structure was not discriminatory and considered whether the tolls were excessive in relation to the benefits provided. The court rejected motorists' argument that discounted tolls for Fast Lane participants violated the dormant Commerce Clause, indicating federal courts may not find in-state toll discounts to be in violation. However, challenges to other tolling variations could yield different results, with differential toll schedules potentially seen as discriminatory under certain circumstances. Some states may consider collecting tolls at state borders, potentially disadvantaging out-of-state companies. State legislation has proposed tax credits for residents to offset toll costs instead of border tolls. This raises concerns about interstate travel taxation and competitive disadvantages for businesses. The issue of tolling trucks at state borders and the potential challenges it poses under the dormant Commerce Clause. Truck tolls are higher than auto tolls due to the greater wear and tear caused by heavy trucks. Trucking interests prefer higher fuel taxes over tolls for funding. Trucking interests generally oppose tolls and prefer higher fuel taxes for highway funding. They argue that tolls could lead to easier increases for trucks than cars. Trucking associations have challenged toll revenue usage in New York and opposed truck-only tolls in Rhode Island. Tolling federally funded highways is objected to due to taxpayers already paying for their construction. Adding tolls to federally funded highways is a contentious issue as taxpayers argue it would be \"double taxation.\" One solution could be to credit users for motor fuels taxes and other highway taxes through electronic tolling facilities. However, this may lower toll revenue unless rates are adjusted upward. Another option is to reimburse drivers for fuels taxes paid during toll road use via tax return rebates, but not all users file tax returns. The cost of these rebates could be subtracted from the Highway Trust Fund. Proponents advocate tolling to increase spending on transportation infrastructure, but increased toll revenue may be offset by declines in other revenues. Congress has imposed \"maintenance of effort\" requirements on states receiving federal highway support. Implementing tolling on a larger scale would require more federal monitoring of transportation expenditures. The toll credit program allows states to use toll revenues for interstate travel investments as part of their required match. Some states heavily rely on toll credits to meet their matching share requirements for federal highway grants. A potential expansion of Interstate highway tolling could lead to states providing less state revenue funding for their matching shares, unless changes are made in the law. The FHWA is responsible for monitoring state spending to ensure efforts to improve the highway system are maintained, but a 2012 report found issues with the agency's approval process for toll credits. A vehicle miles traveled (VMT) charge is being considered as an alternative to fuel taxes for highway funding. VMTs would be imposed for using any road, unlike tolls which are specific to certain segments. VMTs could be structured similarly to existing tolls and could also be used for congestion pricing. However, there are concerns about accommodating drivers without credit cards for billing. Concerns about accommodating drivers without credit cards for billing and privacy issues with vehicle tracking systems have been less prominent in tolling discussions."
