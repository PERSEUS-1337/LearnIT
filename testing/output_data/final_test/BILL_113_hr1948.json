The Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act of 2013 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act regarding State Water Quality Standards. It specifies that the Administrator may not establish a new standard for a pollutant if the State has an approved standard unless the State agrees with the necessity of the new standard. The Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act of 2013 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by limiting the Administrator's authority to establish new standards for pollutants if the State already has an approved standard. It also restricts the Administrator from superseding a State's determination of compliance with certain provisions regarding discharges. Additionally, it prohibits the Administrator from withdrawing approval of State permit programs without specific limitations. The Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act of 2013 limits the Administrator's authority to object to State water quality standards or Federal guidance interpretation. The Act also restricts the Administrator from objecting to individual permits based on their interpretation of water quality standards.

The Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act of 2013 limits the EPA Administrator's authority to object to State water quality standards or Federal guidance interpretation. It also restricts objections to individual permits based on water quality standards. The Act amends Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to specify that a permit will not be denied if the State disagrees with the Administrator's determination of adverse effects from the discharge. Additionally, it allows States to administer their own permit programs for some or all discharges. SEC. 4. DEADLINES FOR AGENCY COMMENTS.\n\nSection 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require the Administrator and department heads to submit comments on permit applications within 30 days (or 60 days with a request for additional time).\n\nSEC. 5. APPLICABILITY OF AMENDMENTS. The amendments made by this Act apply to actions taken on or after the enactment date, including permit applications and new standards. Before taking a covered action, the Administrator must analyze the impact on employment levels and economic activity, using the best available economic models. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit an annual report to Congress on the economic models used for this analysis. The Administrator must post analysis of covered actions on the EPA website and request Governors to post it in their State Capitol if there is a significant negative impact. Public hearings are required in States with more than a minimal negative impact on employment or economic activity before the effective date of the action. The Administrator must notify the State's officials if a covered action will have a significant negative impact on employment or economic activity, at least 45 days before the action takes effect. Public hearings must be held at a convenient location prioritizing areas with the highest job losses. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the EPA. A \"covered action\" includes issuing regulations or implementing new programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. \"More than a de minimis negative impact\" is defined as a loss of over 100 jobs.
