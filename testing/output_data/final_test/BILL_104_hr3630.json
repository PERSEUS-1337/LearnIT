    "content": "The \"Women's Preventive Health Care Act of 1996\" requires coverage of screening mammography and Pap smears under health plans. Every health insurance policy and group health plan must include coverage for screening pap smears and low-dose screening mammography, which is a radiologic procedure for early breast cancer detection in asymptomatic women. The term \"screening pap smear\" includes a routine exfoliative cytology test for early detection of cervical cancer, along with a physician's interpretation of the results. Coverage under this section does not allow for deductibles or coinsurance. Coverage under this section does not allow for deductibles, coinsurance, or limitations for low-dose screening mammography or screening pap smears. Low-dose screening mammography should be provided according to a specific periodicity schedule, including baseline screening for women aged 35-40 and annual screenings for women aged 50 and older or those deemed at risk by a physician. Coverage under this section includes low-dose screening mammography and screening pap smears without deductibles, coinsurance, or limitations. Mammography is available every other year for women aged 50 and older or those at risk of breast cancer. A woman is considered at risk if she has a personal history of breast cancer, biopsy-proven benign breast disease, a family history of breast cancer, or has not given birth before the age of 30. Coverage of screening pap smears should not be provided more often than once a year, or as recommended by a physician. State regulators are responsible for enforcing the requirements of this section for insurers offering health insurance coverage. The Secretary may provide remedies, including civil money penalties, if regulators fail to enforce the requirements. The requirements of this section apply to group health plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. For other health coverage, the Secretary will develop enforcement mechanisms. State laws providing greater protection to women are not preempted.

The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the term \"State\" includes various territories.
