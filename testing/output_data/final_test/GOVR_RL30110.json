    "content": "This report explains common terms used in federal individual income tax discussions, following the structure of IRS Form 1040. Taxpayers often use tax software or paid preparers to determine their tax liability, which may make them unfamiliar with Form 1040 concepts. Total income, or gross income, is the broadest measure of income for tax purposes, including wages, interest, dividends, and business income. Gross income for tax purposes includes wages, interest, dividends, business income, capital gains, rents, royalties, trusts, estates, partnerships, pensions, and annuities. Exclusions from gross income are items not subject to tax, such as state and local bond interest, public assistance, small gifts, employer contributions for health care, and retirement plans. Social security and railroad retirement income may or may not be taxable depending on other income received. The taxpayer's retirement income depends on other sources of income. Exclusions from taxation include clergy housing allowance, foster care payments, scholarship grants, and limited disability pay. Gross income is reported on line 22 of Form 1040, with exclusions not explicitly listed. Adjustments to income, like above-the-line deductions, are allowed for certain payments related to earning income. Adjusted gross income (AGI) is calculated by deducting payments such as contributions to retirement accounts, interest on student loans, moving expenses, and alimony payments from gross income. These adjustments to income are listed on lines 23 to 35 of Form 1040 and are used to arrive at AGI, which is a taxpayer's total income minus adjustments. AGI is an important measure of income for all taxpayers, regardless of whether they use standard deductions or itemized deductions. Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is the basic measure of income before deductions and personal exemptions are taken into account for federal income tax purposes. It is listed on line 37 of Form 1040 and serves as the base for computing various tax law limits. Taxpayers can choose to itemize deductible expenses, including medical expenses, property taxes, and mortgage interest. Deductions from AGI are allowed for certain expenditures of income. Taxpayers can choose to itemize deductible expenses such as property taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions, or opt for the standard deduction. The standard deduction amounts vary based on filing status and age, with the 2016 standard deductions being $12,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly, $6,300 for single taxpayers, and $9,300 for heads of households. For taxpayers who qualify as the head of a household, standard deductions increase by $1,550 for those 65 or older and for the legally blind if single or head of household, and $1,250 if married filing jointly. These increases apply per classification and are adjusted annually for inflation. Approximately 30% of taxpayers itemized their deductions in the 2014 tax year. Deductions reduce a taxpayer's tax liability, but only by a percentage of the amount. Deductions reduce a taxpayer's tax liability based on their tax bracket. Higher-income taxpayers benefit more from deductions as they are equal to the taxpayer's tax rate times the deduction amount. Total itemized deductions are listed on line 40 of Form 1040, with individual components on Schedule A. Personal exemptions are allowed before calculating total income. Personal exemptions are allowed before calculating total income. Taxpayers can claim exemptions for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. The value of exemptions reduces taxable income, with specific rules for AGI thresholds. The number of exemptions claimed is listed on Form 1040. The taxpayer's taxable income, calculated on line 43 of Form 1040, is the base for applying income tax rates. Tax liability, or gross tax liability, is the amount owed before tax credits are deducted. The marginal tax rate schedule is progressive, meaning higher earners face higher tax rates. The 2016 marginal tax rate schedule in Appendix B shows tax rates and income ranges. A married couple with $80,000 taxable income falls into the 25% tax bracket. Some taxpayers (4.8% in 2016) must also consider the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The AMT is calculated by adding back certain deductions and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure of 26% and 28%. The AMT tax base is calculated by adding back certain deductions and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure of 26% and 28%. If the AMT liability exceeds regular income liability, the difference must be added to arrive at gross tax liability. The AMT was enacted to ensure everyone pays a minimum of taxes while preserving economic and social incentives in the tax code. Regular income tax liability is on line 44 of Form 1040, AMT liability on line 45, and gross tax liability on line 47. Nonrefundable tax credits reduce final tax liability directly. Tax credits directly reduce tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis and are available to all qualified taxpayers. Nonrefundable tax credits cannot exceed tax liability, except when they surpass it. Refundable tax credits can be claimed even if they exceed tax liability. Examples of nonrefundable credits include those for the elderly, child and dependent care expenses, and foreign taxes. Total nonrefundable tax credits are on line 55 of Form 1040, with individual credits listed on lines 48 to 54. Total tax liability, or final tax liability, is the federal income tax owed by the taxpayer after considering refundable tax credits. It represents the total federal income tax bill for the year, found on line 63 of Form 1040. Taxpayers make periodic tax payments through income withholdings, like W-2 withholding for employees and 1099 withholding for nonwage income. Taxpayers may have income withheld by the compensating party, forwarded to the IRS, or make estimated tax payments throughout the year. Estimated tax payments are necessary for income not subject to withholding or when expecting to owe more in taxes. Refundable tax credits can exceed tax liability, providing a form of tax payment. Taxpayers can claim refundable tax credits exceeding their tax liability, leading to a direct payment from the Treasury. The primary refundable credits include the earned income tax credit and child tax credit. A tax refund is issued when withheld taxes, estimated payments, and refundable credits surpass the final tax liability, resulting in an overpayment. The refunded amount owed to the taxpayer can be found on line 75 of Form 1040. If total tax liability exceeds federal taxes withheld, estimated payments, and refundable credits, the taxpayer will owe the government additional taxes. If total tax liability exceeds federal taxes withheld, estimated payments, and refundable credits, the taxpayer will owe the federal government an additional amount to cover the shortfall in paid taxes, found on line 78 of Form 1040."
