    "content": "Prescription drug abuse, particularly of pain relievers, is a significant issue in the United States, with an estimated 6.5 million current abusers. On average, 44 people die each day from prescription painkiller overdoses. Federal policymakers focus on balancing access to prescription controlled substances for medical use while preventing abuse. Coordination between law enforcement and health agencies is key in addressing this epidemic. The report focuses on federal roles and current approaches to reducing prescription drug abuse, particularly painkiller abuse. Congress has shown interest in addressing the issue through legislation like the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) would be authorized to administer grants and convene task forces under proposed legislation. Efforts by the Administration include an HHS opioid initiative and a Presidential Memorandum for training in opioid prescribing and access to medication-assisted treatment. Both Congress and the Administration have allocated funds to combat opioid abuse and overdoses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 includes funding for opioid-specific programs to address prescription opioid and heroin abuse. The federal government works to reduce drug abuse through various roles, including coordination, regulation, law enforcement, and health services. The federal government, through various agencies, works to reduce prescription drug abuse. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy coordinates efforts and federal funding to address this issue. The 2014 National Drug Control Strategy outlines priorities for reducing prescription drug abuse, with action items focusing on demand reduction. The federal government coordinates efforts and funding to reduce prescription drug abuse, with action items focusing on demand reduction. This includes additional training for healthcare providers, improved drug disposal programs, enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs, and enforcement actions against improper prescribing. Federal agencies like the DEA and SAMHSA are involved, along with state efforts such as prescription drug monitoring programs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) govern the regulation of prescription drugs. The FDA, under the Department of Health and Human Services, ensures drug safety and effectiveness throughout the product lifecycle. FDA activities include drug approval, labeling, and postapproval surveillance. The FDA regulates prescription drugs, including addressing the risk of addiction in postapproval surveillance. FDA reviews new drug applications for safety, effectiveness, labeling, and manufacturing methods. Approval may include conditions like distribution restrictions or postapproval studies. The FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for drugs post-marketing to ensure benefits outweigh risks. This strategy may include drug safety information and elements to assure safe use. FDA can approve a drug with restrictions to minimize risks and approve labeling that highlights key information. The FDA reviews manufacturer labeling, including black-box warnings, drug abuse risks, and new safety information requirements. FDA postmarket activities address drug production, distribution, and use, including REMS, product integrity, adverse event reporting, and surveillance programs. The FDA conducts postmarket activities such as surveillance, information dissemination, and postmarket studies. In September 2013, the FDA directed manufacturers of opioid drugs to conduct studies. The agency has a task force focused on combating opioid abuse throughout the drug life cycle. In February 2016, the FDA announced an opioids action plan to address abuse and increase postmarket data requirements. The FDA is taking steps to address opioid abuse by updating REMS, issuing guidance on abuse-deterrent formulations, increasing access to naloxone, supporting prescribing guidelines, and reassessing the risk-benefit framework for opioid approval. The Controlled Substances Act regulates the use of controlled substances for legitimate purposes and to prevent diversion for illegal use. Some prescription drugs, particularly powerful pain relievers, are regulated under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) due to their potential for abuse and dependence. The CSA assigns substances to five schedules based on their medical use and potential for addiction, with Schedule II containing drugs like morphine, codeine, OxyContin\u00ae, and Ritalin\u00ae. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates prescription drugs based on their potential for abuse and addiction. It assigns substances to five schedules, with Schedule II including morphine, codeine, OxyContin\u00ae, and Ritalin\u00ae. The CSA prohibits prescribing or dispensing controlled substances without a valid DEA registration and requires prescriptions for drugs in Schedules II-V. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) authorizes the DEA Administrator to suspend or revoke a physician's prescription privileges if they act against the public interest. Participants in the drug supply chain, such as wholesale distributors and pharmacists, have specific obligations to prevent the diversion of controlled substances. Physicians must prescribe controlled substances only for legitimate medical purposes. Pharmacists verify prescriptions before dispensing controlled substances to patients. Online pharmacies, including rogue sites, may engage in illegal practices such as selling unapproved drugs. Law enforcement faces challenges in shutting down rogue sites. The Ryan Haight Act was passed by the 110th Congress to regulate online pharmacies selling controlled substances without a valid prescription. Rogue websites often change names to avoid detection and may display fake logos to appear legitimate. Law enforcement struggles to shut down these illegal online pharmacies. Under the Ryan Haight Act, online pharmacies must be authorized by the DEA to sell controlled substances and report their dispensing activities monthly. Compliance with federal and state laws regarding controlled substances delivery is required. The Ryan Haight Act requires online pharmacies to comply with federal and state laws regarding the delivery of controlled substances. They must provide disclosure information such as pharmacy details, states where they are licensed, and pharmacist contact information. State attorney generals can take legal action against online pharmacies for violations of the Act. One approach to address prescription drug abuse is to reduce the accessibility of unused medications in households. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 amended the CSA to allow patients to easily dispose of their unwanted controlled substances, addressing the issue of unused medications accumulating in household medicine cabinets. The Drug Disposal Act of 2010 amended the CSA to allow patients to safely dispose of controlled substances through various options, including drug \"take-back\" events conducted by law enforcement agencies or community groups. The DEA allows entities to partner with law enforcement for community take-back events or become authorized collectors for unwanted controlled substances. Authorized collectors can conduct mail-back programs or manage secure collection receptacles for disposal. Long-term care facilities can also dispose of controlled substances on behalf of residents. The regulations allow authorized collectors to manage on-site collection receptacles for controlled substance disposal. Law enforcement aims to prevent prescription drug diversion and regulate their supply for legitimate purposes. The DEA's Office of Diversion Control works to prevent the diversion of controlled pharmaceuticals and listed chemicals for legitimate medical, commercial, and scientific purposes. DEA focuses on doctors prescribing controlled substances and traffickers, overseeing registrations for those involved in manufacturing, importing, exporting, selling, or dispensing narcotics. Federal agencies such as the DEA, VA, DOD, IHS, and BOP provide health care services and may prescribe PCS for various conditions. They also support health care services through financing, research, grants, and insurance premium payments. Federal agencies support health care services through grants, reimbursements, and insurance premium payments, including programs like Medicare, Medicaid, SAMHSA, FEHBP, NIH, NIDA, and CDC conducting research and public health surveillance on prescription drug abuse. The federal government, state, and private entities are working to reduce prescription drug abuse through various approaches targeting healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and abusers. The scheduling status of a prescription controlled substance (PCS) has significant consequences on patient access to the medication. The scheduling status of a prescription controlled substance (PCS) has significant consequences on patient access to the medication, regulatory requirements for controlled substance handlers, and criminal punishment for illegal traffickers. The CSA and its regulations impose limitations on prescribing and dispensing PCS based on the medication's schedule. For example, Schedule II substances require a written prescription from a practitioner for dispensing by a pharmacist. Controlled substances in Schedules III-V can be dispensed by pharmacies with a prescription, and may be administered by practitioners without a prescription. Pharmacists cannot refill Schedule II prescriptions, but can refill Schedules III and IV up to five times within six months. The schedule status of a PCS determines federal regulatory requirements for handlers of controlled substances. Manufacturers and distributors must store controlled substances in secure safes or vaults based on their schedule classification. Special order forms are required for shipping Schedule I and II drugs, with DEA monitoring distribution through reporting systems. Quantity limits are imposed on Schedule I and II substances produced annually. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) provides mechanisms for substances to be added, removed, or rescheduled within different schedules. Legislation can change the scheduling status of drugs, such as a bill to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II. DEA, HHS, or interested parties can initiate rulemaking proceedings to adjust drug schedules. The DEA can initiate federal rulemaking proceedings to change the schedule of a drug administratively. For example, in 2009, the DEA requested an evaluation from HHS to reschedule hydrocodone combination products from Schedule III to Schedule II. In 2013, HHS recommended reclassifying these products to Schedule II, and in 2014, the DEA published a final rule to make the change. This reclassification subjects those involved with these products to stricter regulatory requirements and sanctions. Safe storage and proper disposal of medication are important for preventing drug diversion, and the federal government supports these prevention measures. The federal government supports safe storage and disposal of prescription drugs, with DEA regulations requiring strict storage requirements and proper disposal options. Congress may monitor existing prevention measures to consider additional legislative action. DEA regulations mandate effective controls and security standards for storage of controlled substances. DEA regulations require applicants and registrants to comply with specific security standards for storing controlled substances. Different types of applicants have specific security requirements, such as storing substances in electronically monitored safes or securely locked cabinets. Practitioners must notify DEA of any theft or loss of controlled substances within one business day. DEA regulations require practitioners to notify DEA of any theft or loss of controlled substances within one business day. Practitioners are also prohibited from hiring employees with drug-related felony convictions or DEA registration issues. DEA recommends careful screening of employees to prevent hiring individuals with criminal convictions or unauthorized use of controlled substances. DEA sponsors various take-back programs for proper disposal of unused prescription drugs, including permanent collection locations, one-day drop-off events, and mail-in/ship-back programs. The Disposal of Controlled Substances final rule allows ultimate users to transfer unwanted drugs to authorized collectors for safe disposal. Some government agencies and organizations have drug disposal programs for safe disposal of unused medications. Federal law enforcement focuses on combating prescription drug abuse in specific regions. ONDCP analyzes drug trafficking patterns in HIDTAs. For example, the Rocky Mountain HIDTA has a high abuse of diverted prescription drugs. The region has a high rate of prescription drug abuse and overdose deaths. Federal law enforcement focuses on drug trafficking rather than drug abuse. The HIDTA Program funds initiatives targeting specific drugs and chemicals to reduce drug crimes. The National Methamphetamine & Pharmaceuticals Initiative aims to reduce pharmaceutical drug crimes through investigations and intelligence analysis. Priorities for prescription drug abuse prevention include effective pharmaceutical drug monitoring programs, training for personnel on drug crimes, trends, and best practices, and enhancing parcel interdiction. ONDCP monitors pharmacy robberies to identify trends in PCS diversion. Data sources can help identify high-risk behavior indicating potential PCS diversion and abuse. Prescription drug monitoring programs maintain electronic databases to identify potential diversion and abuse. Law enforcement uses PDMP data for investigations. Public health uses of PDMP data include preventing dangerous combinations of medications by checking a patient's record before prescribing. Congress funds state PDMPs through DOJ grants. Various entities have data related to prescription drug abuse, such as New York City's RxStat program. The RxStat program in New York City uses health and crime data, including PDMP data, to target efforts to reduce prescription drug abuse. The FDA is developing a national health care database to search for adverse events related to regulated products. Medicaid programs like Iowa's refer members who receive prescriptions from multiple sources to a \"lock-in\" program to limit their access to healthcare providers. The Alliance to Prevent the Abuse of Medicines is considering a program in Medicare to restrict certain beneficiaries to a single pharmacy. Pharmacies and healthcare systems use data to identify high-risk prescribers and patients. ONDCP emphasizes education to raise awareness about prescription drug abuse. Efforts to increase awareness and education about prescription drug abuse may focus on health care providers, patients, or the general public. Federal agencies may convene expert panels or encourage state-level activities to explore clinical decision support tools. FDA has published a \"blueprint\" for prescriber education and established a searchable online repository for educational activities. SAMHSA offers reports, pamphlets, and continuing medical education about prescription drug abuse at no cost. Efforts to increase awareness and education about prescription drug abuse may focus on health care providers, patients, or the general public. State and local governments, as well as private entities, can also engage in awareness activities. Some states have produced Public Service Announcements on prescription drug abuse. The Federation of State Medical Boards has a model policy for guidelines on prescription pain relievers. Treatment decisions for underlying conditions should consider the risk of prescription drug abuse. New products may be developed for treating both conditions and drug abuse. The VA and DOD have issued guidelines for treating chronic pain with prescription pain relievers while minimizing the risk of abuse. Ohio's guidelines suggest limiting prescriptions to a three-day supply to reduce medication circulation. NIDA recognizes medications and behavioral treatments as effective for treating prescription drug abuse. Treatment effectiveness varies among pharmacologic treatments. Treatment for addiction to opioids, including prescription pain relievers, can involve medication-assisted treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Research is ongoing for medications to treat stimulant addiction, but currently, no FDA-approved medications exist for this purpose. The federal government supports treatment for prescription drug abuse through various means such as direct service delivery, financing, and regulation of opioid treatment programs. New pharmaceutical products may include tamper-resistant or abuse-deterrent pain relievers. NIDA has identified the need for nonaddicting pain medications, including abuse-deterrent formulations like buprenorphine and naloxone to prevent abuse. Tamper-resistant formulations, such as extended-release oxycodone, are designed to prevent crushing or dissolving for abuse. The development of nonaddicting pain medications is a public health priority, with a focus on reducing the demand for prescription controlled substances (PCS) through non-pharmaceutical interventions."
