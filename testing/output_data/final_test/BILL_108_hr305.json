The Kate Mullany House in Troy, New York, is a National Historic Landmark with significance in American labor history.

The Hudson-Mohawk Urban Cultural Park Commission, led by Kate Mullany, manages historic resources in Troy, New York and neighboring areas. The area represents industrial development and labor themes, designated as a heritage area by the State of New York. RiverSpark is a pioneer in partnership parks for heritage conservation and economic development. The Kate Mullany National Historic site is part of this initiative. The Kate Mullany National Historic Site, in cooperation with the National Park Service and the Hudson-Mohawk Urban Cultural Park Commission, aims to preserve and interpret the home of Kate Mullany. It also seeks to highlight the connection between immigration and industrialization in the United States, focusing on Irish immigration, women's history, and worker history.
