Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2008 through 2011, $10,000,000 allocated to the Attorney General for prosecuting spyware, phishing, and pharming. SEC. 4. Findings and sense of Congress on enforcing cybercrimes. Congress finds that software and electronic communications are increasingly used by criminals to invade computers without authorization, particularly through spyware and phishing scams. These schemes aim to obtain personal information for theft, causing devastating damage and undermining confidence in using the Internet. Continued development of technologies is crucial in combating spyware. Response to consumer demand is crucial in the fight against spyware. Congress urges the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute those using spyware for crimes, phishing, and pharming scams. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 22, 2007."
