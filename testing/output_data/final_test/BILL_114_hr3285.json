    "content": "The Act titled \"Reducing Disparities Using Care Models and Education Act of 2015\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds disparities in health outcomes among different racial groups, including higher infant death rates and cancer death rates for African-Americans compared to Whites. Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have low cancer screening rates, with cervical cancer rates for Vietnamese-American women being significantly higher than for non-Hispanic Whites. In 2012, diabetes incidence was highest among Native Americans, followed by African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Whites. New cases of hepatitis and tuberculosis are higher in Asians and Pacific Islanders compared to Whites. Individuals in same-sex couples were more likely to report delays in getting necessary prescriptions. Infants born to Black women face higher health risks. Infants born to Black women and American Indian/Alaska Native infants face higher mortality rates. Low-income children have higher mortality and disability rates. White children have better health outcomes compared to Black and Latino children. Obesity rates are highest among African-Americans, followed by Hispanics, Whites, and Asians. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are also at higher risk of obesity. Pacific Islanders have a 30% higher obesity rate than non-Hispanic Whites. African-Americans have a higher risk of stroke and HIV infection compared to Whites. Black men who have sex with men aged 13 to 24 have the highest rate of new HIV infections among youth. Asian-Americans have the lowest rate of HIV testing. In the context of disparities in healthcare, Asian-American and Pacific Islander women have the lowest rate of HIV testing. Transgender women are at a significantly higher risk of acquiring HIV compared to the general population. Socioeconomic factors such as poverty and education level also play a role in HIV contraction and mental health issues. Only a small percentage of physicians practice in rural areas. Only 10% of physicians practice in rural areas where 25% of the population resides. Rural residents have less health care coverage and mental health services compared to urban areas. Transgender individuals have a higher suicide attempt rate, and persons with disabilities face barriers to seeing a doctor due to cost. Among the general population, 19% of transgender individuals have faced medical care refusal due to their gender identity, and 28% have experienced harassment in a medical setting. Over 20% of the US population speaks a language other than English at home, with 32% of Asian-Americans being limited English proficient. This lack of linguistically accessible care poses health access challenges and contributes to disparities for limited English speakers. SEC. 3. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE STUDY. The Secretary will arrange for the Institute of Medicine to study health disparities in preventive interventions, factors contributing to inequities, existing programs, best practices, priorities for intervention programs, and opportunities for expanding programs. The Institute of Medicine will study health disparities in preventive interventions, factors contributing to inequities, existing programs, best practices, priorities for intervention programs, and potential opportunities for expanding or replicating such programs. A report on the results of the study will be submitted to the Secretary and Congress within 20 months of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. The Secretary will develop guidelines for entities to reduce health disparities, including in children. These guidelines may be used by the Department of Health and Human Services. Grants may be awarded for programs to reduce disparities, following the guidelines. To apply for a grant under subsection (a), an entity must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information. The application must include a description of the target population and public health concern, an outreach plan for underserved populations, and strategies to align with program guidelines. To apply for a grant under subsection (a), entities must submit an application with specified information, including a description of the target population, outreach plan for underserved populations, and strategies aligning with program guidelines. Entities must also agree to provide data on the population served, improvements in reducing health disparities, and effectiveness of interventions used. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2017, with additional funding for fiscal years 2018 through 2021. SEC. 5. TESTING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND DELIVERY MODELS TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. The Secretary will test a payment and service delivery model to reduce health disparities, including incentives for all populations, with specific documentation and performance targets required for model testing. The Secretary will test a payment and service delivery model to reduce health disparities, including incentives for all populations, with specific documentation and performance targets required for model testing. This includes identification and selection of performance targets, making payments contingent on reducing health disparities, and monitoring progress towards reduction. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"health disparity\" refers to significant differences in disease rates compared to the general population. \"Intervention\" is an activity to reduce health disparities. \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
