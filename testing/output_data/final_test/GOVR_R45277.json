    "content": "Health savings accounts (HSAs) were authorized in 2003 under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. They are tax-advantaged accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses, tied to individuals with HSA-qualified high-deductible health plans. Contributions can be made by individuals, employers, family members, and others, with unused balances carrying over and accumulating without limit. Health savings accounts (HSAs) allow for unused balances to accumulate without limit and be invested. Withdrawals can be made without being enrolled in an HSA-eligible HDHP, but non-qualified medical expenses incur a penalty tax. HSAs offer tax advantages such as tax-deductible contributions, tax-exempt earnings, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. Individuals can establish and contribute to an HSA if they have coverage under an HSA-qualified HDHP, meet eligibility criteria, and are not claimed as a dependent. HSA eligibility is determined monthly, allowing for contributions in some months but not others. Withdrawals are allowed if ineligible, but contributions can only be made when eligible again. To establish an HSA, eligible individuals can choose institutions other than their insurer, such as banks or approved entities by the IRS. HSA-qualified health plans must meet specific criteria, including a minimum deductible and out-of-pocket limits, and can only cover preventive care before the deductible is met. Nonbank entities can become HSA trustees with IRS approval. To be HSA qualified, a health plan must have an annual deductible of at least $1,350 for self-only coverage and $2,700 for family coverage in 2018. The plan's coverage cannot be limited to a narrow set of services, and deductibles must be based on usual, customary, and reasonable charges for covered benefits provided in-network. Premiums cannot count towards meeting the deductible. To be HSA qualified, a health plan's annual limit on out-of-pocket expenditures for covered benefits must not exceed $6,650 for self-only coverage and $13,300 for family policies in 2018. Enrollee cost sharing, including deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance, must be taken into account for in-network coverage provided under the HSA-qualified HDHP. The out-of-pocket limits for HSA-qualified HDHP coverage include deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance for in-network services. These limits do not apply to out-of-network or non-covered services, premiums, or charges exceeding usual, customary, and reasonable amounts. Plans can still be HSA qualified without a deductible for preventive care or with a deductible lower than the minimum required for such services. The IRS guidance states that preventive care under HSA-qualified HDHPs includes various services like health evaluations, prenatal care, immunizations, and screening services. Preventive care does not cover treatment for existing illnesses, except when incidental to a preventive service. Compliance with federal requirements is necessary for HSA-qualified HDHPs. HSA-qualified HDHPs must cover specified preventive care services without cost sharing, including services rated \"A\" or \"B\" by the USPSTF, routine immunizations, and screenings for women and children. Individuals with other health coverage may be disqualified from contributing to an HSA. Individuals with an HSA-qualified HDHP must not have any other health coverage that is not HSA-qualified or duplicates benefits. They cannot contribute to an HSA if covered under a non-qualified spouse's policy or enrolled in Medicare. Certain types of health coverage, like dental care or long-term care, do not disqualify them from contributing to an HSA. HSA-qualified HDHP enrollees can still be considered HSA eligible even if they have access to employee assistance programs, disease management programs, or wellness programs, as long as these programs do not provide significant medical benefits. They can also remain HSA-eligible if they receive treatment for service-connected disabilities from the Veterans Health Administration. Additionally, individuals with HSA-qualified HDHP generally cannot have employer-established flexible spending accounts or health reimbursement accounts, unless these accounts have limited purposes or provide reimbursement only after the qualifying deductible is met. In 2018, HSAs have annual contribution limits of $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,900 for family coverage. Account holders aged 55 and above can make an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 each year. These limits are adjusted for inflation annually and apply to total contributions from all sources. Contributions to HSAs can be made at any time during the year. Contributions to HSAs can be made at any time during the year until the federal income tax return filing date, usually April 15 of the following year. The annual limits are calculated on a monthly basis, allowing individuals to contribute up to one-twelfth of the applicable annual limit for each month they are eligible. Individuals eligible in the last month of the year can contribute up to the annual limit for that year. Individuals can contribute to HSAs up to the annual limit before the tax filing date of the following year. Contributions must be made while maintaining HSA eligibility for the entire following year, except in cases of disability or death. Excess contributions are included in gross income and subject to penalty taxes if not withdrawn before the tax filing date. Individuals can make direct contributions to their HSAs, and employers, family members, and others can also contribute on their behalf. Contributions must not exceed annual limits. Employed individuals can contribute through pretax salary reduction agreements. These contributions are not tax deductible but are excluded from gross income. Employees must be allowed to adjust their contributions. The IRS allows employees to adjust their HSA contributions throughout the year under salary reduction agreements, with restrictions applying to all employees. Employers can provide accelerated HSA contributions for medical expenses exceeding current balances, to be repaid by year-end. HSA funds can be used for any purpose, but nonqualified withdrawals are taxable. Eligible individuals can make rollover contributions to their HSAs from other tax-advantaged accounts like Archer MSAs or another HSA once a year. They can also do a one-time distribution from a traditional or Roth IRA to deposit into an HSA, subject to different tax rules. Withdrawals from HSAs can be used for qualified medical expenses for the account holder, their spouse, or dependents. HSA withdrawals for nonqualified expenses are subject to income taxes and a 20% penalty. Account holders can withdraw funds regardless of coverage status. Medicare enrollment makes an individual ineligible to contribute but allows for withdrawals. Qualified medical expenses for the account holder, spouse, or dependents are tax-exempt. Qualified medical expenses for HSA purposes include costs for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, prevention of disease, transportation for medical care, and long-term care services. Health insurance premiums and over-the-counter medicines are not considered qualified medical expenses for HSAs. For HSA purposes, health insurance premiums are generally not qualified expenses, except for specific cases such as long-term care insurance, COBRA coverage, health insurance during unemployment, and premiums for individuals aged 65 and older. HSA withdrawals can be used for qualified medical expenses with no time limit, as long as records are maintained. Expenses incurred before establishing the HSA cannot be paid with HSA funds. Withdrawals from an HSA can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses with no time limit, as long as records are kept. However, expenses incurred before the HSA was established cannot be covered by HSA funds. Withdrawals not used for qualified medical expenses are subject to a 20% penalty, waived in cases of disability, death, or for individuals aged 65 and older. HSAs offer a triple tax advantage: contributions reduce taxable income, earnings grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax-free. Individuals who contribute to HSAs can claim a tax deduction on their federal income tax return, reducing their tax burden. The deduction is made above the line, allowing taxpayers to claim it regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemized deduction. The total tax effect of eligible HSA contributions depends on an individual's marginal tax rate and the amount contributed. The tax deduction for eligible HSA contributions is based on an individual's marginal tax rate and nonemployer contributions. Contributions from an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA rollovers are not deductible. Employer contributions are not deductible but are excluded from gross income for income tax liability. Contributions made through a pretax salary reduction agreement are considered employer contributions. In a pretax salary reduction agreement, employer contributions to an HSA are excluded from the employee's gross income and exempt from employment taxes. HSA balances can be invested like IRAs, and earnings accumulate tax-free. State income tax treatment may vary, with some states like California not recognizing HSAs as tax-advantaged accounts. The increase in state tax burden for taxpayers is due to factors like HSA deductions, interest earned, and employer contributions. Data on the entire HSA population is limited, as HSAs and HSA-qualified HDHPs are separate products with overlapping populations. Existing HSA studies often focus on either HSA-qualified HDHP enrollees or HSA holders, as these products can be administered by different institutions, leading to data discrepancies and challenges in direct comparisons. The next section highlights selected findings related to enrollment and contributions from various data sources, showing continued increases in HSA-qualified HDHP enrollment and HSAs since the mid-2000s. A report using survey data from insurers revealed a rise in enrollment in HSA-eligible HDHPs sold by commercial insurers from 2005 through 2017. A report based on survey data from employers with three or more workers showed an increase in the percentage of covered employees in HSA-eligible HDHPs between 2006 and 2017. Larger employers are more likely to offer HSA-eligible HDHPs to employees compared to smaller employers. There has been a rise in the number of HSA accounts, with an increase in the number of tax filers reporting HSA contributions or withdrawals from 2004 to 2012, and an increase in the number of accounts from 2011 to 2016. Around half of HSA account holders contribute individually. Around half of HSA account holders individually contributed in 2016, while the other half received employer contributions. HDHP-enrolled employees made double the average employee contribution compared to employers. The likelihood of contributing to an HSA increased with age, and across all income levels, the likelihood of maximizing contributions also increased. Fewer than 4% of HSAs in 2016 had investments other than contributions. HSA administrator data shows that less than 4% of HSAs in 2016 had investments other than cash, with older accounts more likely to have invested funds."
