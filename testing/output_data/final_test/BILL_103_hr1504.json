The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow common carriers to provide video programming and communication channels to subscribers in their service area through their own facilities or affiliates. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow common carriers to provide video programming directly to subscribers in their service area through their own facilities or affiliates. Additionally, provisions for the regulation of cable service provided by telephone companies are added to Title VI of the Communications Act. Part V of the Communications Act of 1934 defines cable service provided by telephone companies. The term 'affiliated video programming' refers to video programming owned or controlled by a common carrier and provided directly to subscribers in its telephone service area. 'Control' is defined as having the right to vote more than 50 percent of the outstanding common stock or having actual working control. The term 'basic video dial tone platform' is defined by the Commission's order in CC Docket No. 87-266. A 'rural area' is a geographic area that does not include places with 10,000 inhabitants or more or any territory in an urbanized area. SEC. 652. SEPARATE VIDEO PROGRAMMING AFFILIATE. SEC. 652. SEPARATE VIDEO PROGRAMMING AFFILIATE. A common carrier must not provide video programming directly to subscribers in its telephone service area unless through a separate video programming affiliate. The affiliate must maintain separate books, conduct its own marketing, and not share real or personal property with the carrier. Any business transactions between a common carrier and its video programming affiliate, including property sales, money loans, goods exchange, or asset transfers, must be regulated by the Commission. The Commission regulates business transactions between a common carrier and its video programming affiliate to ensure they are fully compensatory, auditable, and without cost to ratepayers. Waivers may be granted for good cause if in the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Establishment of basic video dial tone platform requires any common carrier providing video programming to establish a platform. Regulations will prevent discrimination in favor of the carrier's video programming affiliate. Provision of affiliated video programming is also addressed. The common carrier must provide capacity to unaffiliated video program providers on its basic video dial tone platform, with a limit of 75 percent. The Commission will evaluate the impact of this requirement on the video programming marketplace and make recommendations to Congress. Local broadcast signal carriage is excluded from this provision. The Commission may waive or modify subsection (a) if video programming is not available for transport by a common carrier to subscribers in its telephone service area. The waiver application must be approved or disapproved within a reasonable period of time. Subsection (a) will cease to be effective five years after the enactment of this part. SEC. 655 prohibits common carriers from including expenses related to video programming in telephone exchange service rates. SEC. 656 prohibits buyouts. No common carrier providing telephone service can acquire control over a cable system in its service area owned by an unaffiliated person, with exceptions for noncontrolling interests through joint ventures or limited use of transmission facilities. The FCC can waive these restrictions upon carrier showing. The FCC can waive restrictions on common carriers acquiring control of cable systems if the carrier shows that the system will be upgraded with modern technology, capacity and services will expand, the acquisition is in the public interest, and the local franchising authority approves. The Commission must approve or disapprove a waiver application within 180 days of filing. The FCC can impose fines and penalties on common carriers for willful violations of regulations. Additionally, customer protection measures are outlined in Section 658. The Commission must convene a Federal-State Joint Board to establish regulations for broadband services within 30 days of enactment. Recommendations must be issued within 270 days. Rules for interstate switched access service must be established within one year. This does not affect carrier regulation authority. Implement section 655, which does not limit or supersede the authority of states or the Commission regarding cost allocation for communication services. \"SEC. 659. Rural area exemption: Sections 652, 653, 654, and 656 do not apply to video programming in rural areas provided by a common carrier offering telephone exchange service in the same area.\""
