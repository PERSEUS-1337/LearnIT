    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Working Children's Human Rights Act\". The Congress acknowledges international principles on child labor, including the prohibition of employment before a minimum age and ensuring work does not harm a child's health or education. International labor conventions set a minimum age for employment, not less than compulsory schooling age or 15 years. According to the International Labor Organization, around 200 million children under 15 are working worldwide, often in hazardous industries like mining and fireworks. They make up a significant portion of the workforce in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, despite international labor conventions and laws prohibiting child labor. Child labor is prevalent in many developing countries due to widespread poverty, unemployment, and lack of education and training opportunities for adult workers. Children under 15 are often employed at low wages, depriving them of education and denying adults gainful employment. This practice undermines family stability and the need for job creation. The importance of increasing jobs, demand, and purchasing power among adults is crucial for the development of internal markets and achieving self-reliant economic growth in developing countries. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a reporting requirement on the United States policy to reduce violations of the human rights of working children internationally. This includes descriptions of policies, agreements, and programs implemented by the Department of State and Department of Labor. The report must detail the efforts and funding allocated for reducing violations of working children's human rights in the past, current, and upcoming fiscal years. It should also include a status report on child labor in each country receiving assistance, highlighting changes in conditions and policies towards child labor. The report must include a description of United States assistance provided to countries for the past, current, and upcoming fiscal years, analyzing the impact on child labor. It should also cover the plans, programs, and timetables adopted by countries for eliminating child labor, along with legal measures and achievements in line with these plans. The Act is amended to include a description of bribery and corruption facilitating violations of working children's rights. Chapter 12--International Human Rights of Working Children. SEC. 499. CONSULTATION REQUIREMENT. The Secretary of State, along with the Secretary of Labor, must consult with congressional committees after submitting a report on violations of human rights of working children. Consultations include in-person discussions to review global violations and the impact of US assistance on combating exploitation. Additionally, consultations must cover countries receiving US assistance in the upcoming year. The report must include a description of violations of human rights of working children and an analysis of factors affecting these violations. After consultations, congressional committees should hold hearings to review human rights of working children provisions in the report. Hearings should be open to the public unless determined otherwise. Annual certification procedures are also outlined. For each fiscal year, countries seeking US assistance must certify to the Secretary of State that they have laws prohibiting forced or compulsory child labor, set a minimum age for child employment, and ensure acceptable working conditions including minimum wages. The US assistance requirements for countries include laws against child labor, minimum age for employment, acceptable working conditions, prevention of bribery, and punishment of corruption. Countries not meeting these requirements can still receive assistance if deemed vital to US national interest. The President must certify the vital national interest at risk if assistance is not provided to a country, weighing this against the risk posed by the country's failure to adopt laws protecting the human rights of working children. The Secretary of State has the discretion to review the certification of any country. An individual can petition the Secretary to review a country's certification under paragraph (1)(A) if there is credible evidence of fraud or non-compliance. The Secretary must respond within 180 days. The Secretary will review a petition regarding a country's certification under paragraph (1)(A) if there is credible evidence of fraud or non-compliance, and must respond within 180 days. If the petition lacks credible evidence, the Secretary will provide reasoning for denying review within the same timeframe. The Secretary can revoke a country's certification if it fails to comply with requirements. Congress can also revoke certification through a joint resolution. 50% of US assistance can be withheld from countries each fiscal year. States assistance allocated each fiscal year for countries not certified or with revoked certification shall be withheld. The Secretary of the Treasury will oppose any international financial institution funding for uncertified countries. \"SEC. 499C. DEFINITIONS.\" \"For this chapter, 'appropriate congressional committees' refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate.
