    "content": "The farm bill is a multi-year law governing agricultural and food programs, renewed every five years. It traditionally focused on commodity support but has expanded to include nutrition, conservation, horticulture, and bioenergy programs. The omnibus nature of the bill allows for broad coalitions of support among conflicting interests. The Agricultural Act of 2014, known as the \"2014 farm bill,\" is the most recent omnibus farm bill, encompassing various programs such as commodity price supports, farm credit, conservation, research, rural development, energy, and food programs. It involves multiple stakeholders including national farm groups, commodity associations, state organizations, and advocacy groups representing various interests. The 2014 farm bill reshaped farm commodity support, expanded crop insurance coverage, and reauthorized nutrition assistance programs. When the farm bill expires, some programs cease to operate unless reauthorized, while others may continue to pay old obligations. Farm commodity programs would revert to permanent law from the 1940s if not reauthorized. Nutrition assistance programs require periodic reauthorization, but appropriations can keep them operating. Many discretionary programs would lose statutory authority if the farm bill expires. The history of agricultural policy in the United States dates back to the creation of the USDA in the 1800s. Stand-alone agricultural laws were passed in the early 1900s to assist farmers with credit and marketing, as well as consumer protection. The first \"farm bill\" was introduced in 1933 in response to the economic depression and dust bowl, providing subsidies and production controls. Commodity subsidies continued to evolve through the 1960s. The farm bill has evolved over the years to include various provisions such as food assistance, conservation, trade, credit, crop insurance, organic agriculture, research programs, bioenergy, and horticulture. It authorizes programs in mandatory and discretionary spending categories, with mandatory programs operating as entitlements funded through multi-year budget estimates. The farm bill includes mandatory and discretionary spending programs. Mandatory programs, such as nutrition and crop insurance, dominate the budget debate. The current farm bill, enacted in 2014, estimated $489 billion for mandatory programs over five years, with nutrition comprising 80% of the total cost. The 2014 farm bill allocated 13% of mandatory program costs to farm commodity support and crop insurance, with an additional 6% for USDA conservation programs. Other titles, such as horticulture and research, saw increased shares compared to the 2008 farm bill. CBO has updated government spending projections multiple times based on new information, with lower costs for SNAP and farm commodity prices reflected in recent estimates. The estimated cost of the 2014 farm bill is $455 billion for the four largest titles, down from $484 billion four years ago.

The estimated cost of the 2014 farm bill is $455 billion for the four largest titles, down from $484 billion four years ago. Projections show SNAP outlays are $26 billion less than expected for FY2014-FY2018, while crop insurance and conservation programs are also projected to be lower. Farm commodity and disaster program payments are expected to be higher due to lower commodity market prices and increased livestock payments due to disasters. Conservation program spending has increased steadily, while farm commodity program spending has fluctuated with market conditions. Program costs have generally decreased over the past decade, but crop insurance costs have risen as the program expanded to cover more commodities. Crop insurance costs now exceed traditional farm commodity program costs. Insurance costs have surpassed traditional farm commodity programs in total costs. Nutrition program assistance in the farm bill (SNAP) increased sharply after the 2009 recession but has started to decline more slowly during the recovery. The allocation of baseline among titles is not a zero-sum game over time, as baseline projections fluctuate based on economic conditions. The nutrition share of the farm bill has grown from 67% in the 2008 bill to 80% in the 2014 bill, but this does not mean nutrition grew at the expense of agricultural programs. Legislative changes in each farm bill only account for a fraction of the observed changes. Projected five-year SNAP outlays rose at an annualized rate of 13% per year from the 2008 to 2014 farm bill, with a $202 billion increase mainly due to changing economic expectations. Crop insurance outlays also increased at a similar rate, with a $20 billion rise mostly from economic changes. Farm commodity program outlays decreased by 9.1% per year between the same farm bills, with an $18 billion reduction from restructuring program payments. Legislative changes in the farm bills only contributed a fraction to the observed changes. Under the 2014 farm bill, farm support for traditional commodity crops is restructured by eliminating direct payments, the counter-cyclical program, and the Average Crop Revenue Election program. Producers can choose between Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) programs to receive payments in response to price or revenue declines. For more detailed information, refer to CRS Report R43076, The 2014 Farm Bill (P.L. 113-79): Summary and Side-by-Side. The 2014 farm bill restructures farm support for traditional commodity crops by eliminating direct payments and introducing Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) programs. The bill also makes significant changes to U.S. dairy policy, replacing previous programs with a new one that provides payments to dairy producers when the national margin falls below a certain level. Additionally, the bill sets a $125,000 per person cap on total payments and makes changes to program eligibility. The 2014 farm bill restructures farm support by introducing ARC and PLC programs, replacing direct payments. It sets a $125,000 cap on total payments and adjusts eligibility based on AGI. Title I reauthorizes livestock and tree assistance programs, with retroactive coverage from FY2012. The bill consolidates conservation programs, reauthorizing larger ones like CRP and EQIP.

Title I reauthorizes livestock and tree assistance programs, with retroactive coverage from FY2012. The bill consolidates conservation programs, reauthorizing larger ones like CRP and EQIP. Additionally, smaller conservation programs were rolled into two new programs - ACEP and RCPP. ACEP focuses on wetland and agricultural land easements, while RCPP partners with various organizations for conservation efforts. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and amended USDA's food aid, export market development, and export credit guarantee programs, including conservation compliance for agricultural producers on highly erodible land or wetlands.

It disqualifies certain ex-offenders from receiving SNAP benefits if they do not comply with the terms of their sentence. The law establishes new policies related to the SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) program, including a pilot project for work programs for SNAP participants. Changes to SNAP law pertain to retailer authorization, benefit issuance and redemption, requiring stores to stock a greater variety of foods and more fresh foods, retailers to pay for their electronic benefit transfer (EBT) machines, and providing additional funding for combatting trafficking. New federal funding supports organizations offering bonus incentives for SNAP purchases of fruits and vegetables through Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grants. The 2014 farm bill includes changes to SNAP and related programs, such as Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grants for fruits and vegetables. It also makes minor changes to farm lending statutes, allowing alternative legal entities for loans, increasing down-payment loan sizes, and removing term limits on guaranteed operating loans. Additionally, it increases the percentage of conservation loans that can be guaranteed and adds a lending priority for beginning farmers.
