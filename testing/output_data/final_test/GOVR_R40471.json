    "content": "Since 1989, the federal government has spent over $96.1 billion for disaster assistance provided by FEMA. Predicting the level of federal disaster assistance is a fiscal management challenge. FEMA has received $2.9 billion in regular appropriations and $21.9 billion in supplemental appropriations for Disaster Relief. Congress faces challenges in managing disaster costs, but hazard mitigation can potentially reduce federal costs. FEMA allocated $4.4 billion for hazard mitigation activities out of the $96.1 billion expended for disaster assistance since 1989. The report discusses federal hazard mitigation assistance, highlighting Congress's historical approach to disaster relief legislation. In 1950, the Federal Disaster Relief Act aimed to authorize federal assistance before disasters occur, emphasizing the importance of preparation for unforeseen emergencies. The Disaster Relief Act of 1950 shifted decision-making for federal disaster assistance from Congress to the President, allowing states access to federal funds for hazard mitigation. This legislation continues to influence the federal role in disasters, with provisions for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program discussed in the report. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) presents challenges to federal fiscal management and raises questions about the federal role in hazard mitigation. Efforts to mitigate natural hazards have been ongoing for decades, with communities facing various disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires. Mitigation aims to reduce the impacts of such events, but the complexity of modern disasters poses new challenges for public officials. Mitigation, defined by FEMA as sustained action to reduce risk from hazards, aims to prevent disasters and decrease the need for response. It can save lives, reduce property damage, and protect critical community facilities. Mitigation activities are categorized as structural and nonstructural. Mitigation activities can be structural or nonstructural, involving physical changes to structures or community planning initiatives. Federal disaster mitigation assistance, such as the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, funds both types of activities. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments established guidelines for federal disaster assistance in response to major disasters like Hurricane Carla, Hurricane Betsy, Hurricane Agnes, and an earthquake in Alaska. This legislation reduced the need for case-by-case legislation for each disaster event. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments reduced the need for individual disaster legislation. Congress addressed the increasing federal costs and loss of life by introducing hazard mitigation legislation to ease the impact of disasters. In response to hurricanes and floods in the 1960s and 1970s, Congress encouraged mitigation activities by amending the legislation in 1988. The 1988 amendment to the Disaster Relief Act, renamed as the Stafford Act, established the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to reduce future disaster impacts. HMGP provides federal funds for long-term hazard mitigation projects after a major disaster declaration, such as elevating properties, acquiring properties for open space, retrofitting buildings, and constructing floodwall systems. The 1988 amendment established the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) for long-term projects like elevating properties, acquiring open space, and constructing floodwall systems. Disasters in the 1980s and 1990s led to reassessment of HMGP, with federal spending exceeding $7.6 billion from 1989 to 1993. Hurricanes and floods shifted focus to disaster risk reduction. The Mitigation Act of 1993 brought significant changes to HMGP. The Mitigation Act of 1993 increased federal cost-share for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) from 50% to 75% and raised the funding amount by changing the formula. It also expanded the basis for funding to include all grant expenditures under Title IV of the Stafford Act, added property acquisition and relocation assistance provisions, and increased the formula percentage to 15%. In 1993, the Stafford Act was amended to prioritize hazard mitigation by encouraging property purchase and conversion to open space in flood-affected areas. This shift in policy was a response to disasters like the Northridge earthquake in California and hurricanes in other states, prompting Congress to increase federal assistance under Section 404. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 further increased funding for mitigation activities. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 increased the percentage cap for federal assistance under Section 404, incentivizing states to develop mitigation plans and implement projects to reduce future disaster costs. The cap for hazard mitigation was decreased to 7.5 percent in 2003 for states without an approved plan, with further changes made by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The statutory determination of HMGP awards under the Stafford Act sets caps based on the level of disaster assistance provided. The caps are 15% for amounts up to $2 billion, 10% for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and 7.5% for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion. Legislation would be required for mitigation funding for disasters exceeding $35.333 billion. The Stafford Act allows the President to adjust the percentage and maximum funding for hazard mitigation. President George W. Bush reduced the HMGP formula percentage after 9/11. Presidential discretion is supported by the legislation language, giving the President a role in determining federal disaster assistance. HMGP funds usage is clarified in regulatory provisions, with statutory restrictions in place. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to expand mitigation funding for disasters exceeding $35.333 billion. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to expand allowances for HMGP funds in the Gulf Coast, including bills like S. 825 for the Road Home Program, S. 1541 for Commonsense Rebuilding Act, and S. 1668 for Gulf Coast Housing Recovery. The proposed bills sought flexibility in fund usage by removing FEMA restrictions related to the Louisiana Road Home Program requirements. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress includes bills that could expand hazard mitigation activities through financial assistance, tax incentives, and a hurricane research initiative. Bills such as H.R. 1239, H.R. 308, and H.R. 327 aim to establish a homeowner mitigation loan program, provide a tax credit for mitigation expenditures, and create a National Hurricane Research Initiative. HMGP regulations provide guidance on eligibility, project criteria, and the application process for grant assistance administered by FEMA. The HMGP, developed by FEMA, administers projects for state and local governments, ensuring compliance with state and local plans, cost-effectiveness, and other standards. Eligible applicants include state and local governments, private non-profit organizations, and Indian tribes. Private non-profit organizations must meet specific criteria to be eligible. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) administers projects for state and local governments, private non-profit organizations, and Indian tribes. Eligible facilities for funding include water and sewage treatment facilities, fire and police stations, assisted living facilities, museums, zoos, and homeless shelters. Projects may involve acquisition of high-risk properties, elevation of properties, retrofitting buildings, vegetative management, stormwater management, structural flood control projects, and post-disaster code enforcement activities. Additional projects may be considered for cost-effective hazard mitigation benefits. FEMA requires a Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) to determine project cost-effectiveness for hazard mitigation measures. The President can contribute up to 75% of the cost for measures that substantially reduce future risks. Eligible projects must be cost-effective and reduce the risk of future damage from disasters. The Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) is essential for determining the cost-effectiveness of hazard mitigation projects. FEMA recommends including a BCA with all HMGP project applications. Some projects may not be assessable with a BCA but can still receive funding if they provide significant hazard mitigation benefits to the community. Five percent of HMGP funds can be allocated to such projects. Projects eligible for funding under this provision include the use of new mitigation techniques, warning systems for hazard events, hazard mapping equipment, GIS software for mitigation, public awareness campaigns, and other activities prioritized in the State's Hazard Mitigation Plan. Predicting specific projects that may qualify is challenging. The Hazard Mitigation Plan prioritizes projects eligible for funding under the 5 Percent Initiative. However, regulations prohibit the use of HMGP funds to replace other federal funding for projects, giving FEMA officials discretion to determine alternative funding sources. FEMA allows HMGP funds to be used for projects eligible for CDBG and SBA disaster loan programs. State and local governments must have a FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan to qualify for HMGP funds, which must include a risk assessment and mitigation strategy. The FEMA regional director may fund projects in communities without an approved mitigation plan if completed within one year. This exception is typically for small or impoverished communities or in extraordinary circumstances, like after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. DMA 2000 increased HMGP funds available, with states having an Enhanced State Mitigation Plan eligible for up to 20 percent of Title IV. The Enhanced State Mitigation Plan (ESMP) allows states to receive up to 20 percent of Title IV disaster assistance under the Stafford Act. The ESMP must include all components of a standard state mitigation plan, integrate with other planning initiatives, and be approved by FEMA within three years of a disaster declaration. Changing the cost-share by increasing federal funding and reducing state contributions helps state and local governments implement hazard mitigation projects. The Mitigation Act of 1993 reduced the state cost-share from 50 percent to 25 percent to make mitigation projects more affordable for states. This change encouraged implementation of projects but did not completely resolve the issue of unexpended HMGP funds. HMGP funds are available after a major disaster declaration, and the amount available to a state depends on the level of disaster assistance provided. Future HMGP funding needs cannot be predicted. The HMGP federal share obligations have seen spikes in funding after major disasters like floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks. These spikes occur three to four years after the disaster due to the grants administration process. Projects awarded HMGP funding can take several years to complete, especially those involving structural renovations. The HMGP funds are typically expended three to four years after being obligated for mitigation projects, which often involve structural renovations. States historically initiate requests for federal assistance under the Stafford Act, with the federal government providing aid while recognizing state authority in disaster response. The intent of Congress is to provide ongoing assistance to states and local governments in alleviating suffering and damage from major disasters. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments did not change the states' role in federal disaster assistance. Requests for federal aid must be initiated by the governor of the affected state, reinforcing the primary role of states, localities, and voluntary organizations in coordinating disaster assistance funds. The federal government may seek a more active role in overseeing federal disaster assistance funds as levels increase. FEMA statistics show a significant increase in disaster costs since 1950, leading to congressional consideration of changing program cost-shares and block granting hazard mitigation programs. This highlights the evolving federal role in disasters since the Disaster Relief Act of 1950. The federal government is reconsidering its role in disaster-related policy areas, such as catastrophic risk insurance, taxation, public health, and housing issues. Federal oversight of state and local disaster preparedness has grown since events like September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina. The National Strategy for Homeland Security provides guidelines for health care providers and first responders, with plans to evaluate preparedness at all levels. The National Response Framework outlines the federal role in overseeing preparedness. Congress may need to address the changing federal role in disasters. Congress may need to consider if the Stafford Act is still the best framework for federal disaster response, especially regarding the delay in allocating HMGP assistance after disaster declarations like Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. As of September 1, 2008, only 17% of the total allocated funds had been expended, raising concerns about grants administration. Grants administration complications have led to ineffective program implementation, with only $119.3 million (17% of total allocated funds) expended. Delays in HMGP expenditures are attributed to poor grant management systems, project prioritization disputes, and other factors. Congress may need to address funding delays by consolidating federal hazard mitigation grant assistance for more streamlined administration. The delays in HMGP expenditures are due to decision-making disputes at the local level and between local, state, and federal officials. Political gridlock impedes the project selection process, leading to a lack of eligible project applications and hindering fund expenditure. Disputes between state and FEMA officials regarding the mitigation benefits of proposed projects also contribute to delays. FEMA has the authority to approve HMGP project applications. FEMA has the authority to approve HMGP project applications, but disputes can arise over the perceived mitigation benefits of proposed projects. For example, there is debate over whether responder communication systems provide a direct mitigation benefit or simply improve emergency response time. This was evident in the case of Mississippi seeking approval for a wireless communication system enhancement project after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. After unsuccessful discussions with FEMA officials, state officials sought congressional intervention for a system enhancement project. Congress allocated $20 million of HMGP funds for Mississippi to fund the project, resolving the dispute. Congressional intervention may be needed to prevent withdrawal of HMGP funds due to delays in expenditure. Specific provisions for state administration of the program could reduce the need for presidential intervention and loss of funding. One method to expedite HMGP grant administration is for states to pre-identify mitigation projects before disasters occur. This allows for quick funding allocation when HMGP funds become available. States can prioritize buy-outs of repetitive loss properties and pre-certify them for HMGP funding in advance. The benefits of hazard mitigation activities are widely understood, but timely action is crucial to reduce risks for communities. Congress may need to consider setting aside a portion of HMGP assistance to expedite projects already in local and state hazard mitigation plans. While some argue it is costly, others believe it will result in future cost savings. The Multihazard Mitigation Council study in 2005 found that for every dollar spent on hazard mitigation, there was an average savings of four dollars. Changes to HMGP percentages were influenced by this study, with the Mitigation Act of 1993 and DMA 2000 increasing the percentage of funds allocated for mitigation efforts. This \"spend now and save later\" approach highlights the importance of investing in hazard mitigation to reduce future disaster costs. The Mitigation Act of 1993 and DMA 2000 led to a significant increase in HMGP federal share obligations, promoting hazard mitigation as a cost-effective policy tool that saves lives and property. Congress faces challenges in estimating costs and funding levels for hazard mitigation, as seen in the difficulty of allocating funds highlighted by the CBO's cost estimate of the Mitigation Act of 1993. The Mitigation Act of 1993 resulted in a much higher annual outlay increase than projected by the CBO. Successful disaster mitigation programs like HMGP rely on accurate risk assessments for fund prioritization at all levels of government. Communities face tough decisions on allocating limited resources for hazard assessment and mitigation projects. Risk assessment tools like flood maps and computer simulations are crucial for prioritizing hazard mitigation projects. Inaccurate assessments can lead to inefficient use of funds. Legislation in the 111th Congress proposed the National Hurricane Research Initiative to improve hurricane preparedness through various research areas. This initiative could be expanded to include assessing the accuracy of flood insurance rate maps. The accuracy of flood insurance rate maps is crucial for hazard mitigation projects. Local, state, and federal officials use tools like Benefit-Cost Analysis to make funding decisions. Outdated maps or default variables in simulation models can lead to inaccurate disaster predictions. State and local governments lack the expertise to evaluate risk assessment tools effectively. Congress may need to increase funding for technical expertise in risk assessment and disaster impact predictions. Congress may need to consider enacting an overarching risk analysis mandate to ensure uniformity in regulations and predictive tools used in public safety policy areas. BCA requirements, such as those in the HMGP, are similar to risk analysis requirements for other federal agencies. Implementing a mandate for risk analysis of federal agencies involved in public safety could be beneficial. In 2005, the MMC study found that every dollar spent on mitigation saved an average of four dollars. The MMC study in 1997 established the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) as a tool for prioritizing mitigation projects. Projects with a BCR of four or higher were considered most competitive by FEMA. The BCR assigns a dollar benefit to various variables, aiding in estimating less quantifiable benefits like risk reduction. While projects with a lower BCR are still eligible for funding, those with a higher BCR are often prioritized. Congress may want to enhance the emphasis on BCR in project funding decisions. Congress may consider increasing technical expertise at the local and state level to ensure equal access to federal funding for hazard mitigation programs. Various federal programs offer funding for activities such as Pre-Disaster Mitigation, Flood Mitigation, Repetitive Flood Claims, and Severe Repetitive Loss. Some suggest that consolidating these programs into block grants could improve administration efficiency and grant flexibility, though it may pose challenges for Congressional oversight. Hazard mitigation block grants could enhance state discretion in allocating funds and address decision-making complications. Congress may consider consolidating federal hazard mitigation grant programs into one block grant. Hazard mitigation scholars suggest linking spending to disaster declarations for immediate action. President George W. Bush proposed replacing HMGP with a competitive grant program in the FY2003 budget. Congress rejected the Bush Administration's proposal to eliminate HMGP but shifted resources to the Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program. Delays in HMGP fund expenditure prompt consideration for funding authorization not tied to disaster declarations. Private businesses are currently ineligible for HMGP funding, with funds typically funneled through state agencies to local governments. Legislation in the 111th Congress (H.R. 308) aims to provide tax credits for property improvements by business owners and individuals. The state disaster recovery programs may include funds for repairing or developing commercial rental properties as part of a housing recovery plan. Small businesses can benefit from property acquisition and relocation provisions under Section 404, allowing structures with repetitive flood damage to be purchased with HMGP funds. The HMGP funds can be used to purchase structures with repetitive flood damage and relocate them to safer areas. State implemented projects funded by FEMA mitigation grants, like the Jericho Road Drainage Project in Massachusetts, have successfully reduced flood damage to public and private structures. FEMA grants also support disaster planning efforts at the state and local levels. The federal funds awarded to state and local governments for disaster mitigation plans include requirements for private businesses to participate in prioritizing projects eligible for assistance. Congress may consider expanding eligibility requirements for private businesses to undertake hazard mitigation activities. Hazard mitigation is widely accepted as saving lives and protecting property in disasters, but challenges exist. Economic conditions have highlighted fiscal management challenges in government. The fiscal management challenges in hazard mitigation programs, supported by federal agencies, are highlighted in light of recent catastrophic events and economic conditions. While the burden for hazard mitigation primarily falls on individuals and local governments, the federal government encourages state and local governments to address hazards through programs like HMGP. Understanding these challenges is crucial for evaluating current and future programs, including complications in implementation. The challenges in implementing hazard mitigation activities include delays in federal assistance expenditure, grant administration complexities at different levels, and the need to balance cost savings with estimating costs. Potential solutions may involve increasing federal assistance, restructuring grants, and evaluating risk analysis for more effective hazard management. Federal programs and public safety regulations can enhance hazard mitigation efforts. With hazard mitigation now widely accepted, Congress should consider additional measures to strengthen the existing foundation."
