    "content": "The \"Medicare Patient IVIG Access Act of 2009\" includes provisions for Medicare payment for intravenous immune globulins (IVIG), coverage and payment of IVIG in the home, data collection and review of complexity codes for physician administration of IVIG, and reporting requirements. The Medicare Patient IVIG Access Act of 2009 addresses the need for Medicare payments to correspond to the cost efficient providers incur in furnishing care, particularly for intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy which is crucial for various chronic conditions and has significantly improved the quality of life for patients. The FDA recognizes each IVIG brand as a unique biologic, with differences in fractionation and modifications leading to distinct products. IVIG therapies are not interchangeable, with patient tolerance varying between brands. The complexity of IVIG manufacturing requires substantial upfront investment. The Medicare reimbursement methodology for IVIG changed in 2003, reducing rates for providers. A 2007 OIG report found that Medicare reimbursement for IVIG was inadequate to cover provider costs. The 2007 OIG report highlighted that Medicare reimbursement for IVIG was insufficient for providers, leading to many sales occurring above Medicare payment amounts. A shift in care settings from physician offices to hospitals resulted in a lack of continuity of care and adverse impacts on health outcomes. Physicians sent patients to hospitals for IVIG treatment due to inability to purchase IVIG below Medicare payment amounts. Some physicians stopped providing IVIG to Medicare beneficiaries. OIG's 2007 report warned that any improvement in Medicare reimbursement for IVIG could be eroded if manufacturers increased prices in the future. CMS provided temporary additional payment for IVIG preadministration-related dislocations experienced by patients and providers. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 established an IVIG home infusion benefit for persons with primary immunodeficiency disease, paying only for IVIG and excluding coverage of administration services. The ASPE report found that Medicare's IVIG home infusion benefit does not cover the cost of infusion services. The ASPE report highlighted that Medicare's IVIG home infusion benefit does not cover the cost of infusion services like nursing and clinical services in the home. This leads to home infusion providers not accepting new PIDD patients with only Medicare coverage due to limitations in service caused by healthcare providers not being able to acquire IVIG at affordable prices and not being reimbursed for infusion services provided by a nurse. Physicians administering IVIG to Medicare beneficiaries are reimbursed at a low complexity level, despite the special preparation, handling, patient risk, and prolonged administration involved. The administration of IVIG involves significant patient risk and requires prolonged nursing time for monitoring during infusion. SEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULINS (IVIG). The Medicare Patient IVIG Access Act of 2009 amends Section 1842(o) of the Social Security Act to collect data on payments to physicians for immune globulins and review costs incurred by physicians for furnishing these products. The Medicare Patient IVIG Access Act of 2009 requires the Secretary to review data on access to immune globulins and provide additional payments to physicians for furnishing these products for a period of 2 years. The Medicare Patient IVIG Access Act of 2009 mandates the Secretary to review data on immune globulins access and offer extra payments to physicians for 2 years. The Medicare Patient IVIG Access Act of 2009 requires the Secretary to review survey and pricing data on immune globulins access and collect information on payment differences. Additional payment authority will be granted after data collection is completed. The Secretary will provide additional payment to hospitals furnishing immune globulins as part of a covered OPD service for all related items, starting within 7 months of enactment and continuing for 2 years. SEC. 4. COVERAGE AND PAYMENT OF INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULIN IN THE HOME. Coverage and payment for intravenous immune globulin in the home under the Social Security Act are amended to include items and services related to administration. This includes changes to subsections (s)(2)(Z) and (zz) of Section 1861 and paragraph (1)(E)(ii) of Section 1842(o). The Secretary will provide separate payment for items and services related to the administration of intravenous immune globulins, based on a review of data and information, including a specific study. Payment may consider pharmacy overhead, patient service costs, and supply costs. The Secretary will provide separate payment for intravenous immune globulins based on a review of data and information, including a specific study. The payment amount for 2010 or later will be determined by the percentage increase in the consumer price index. Effective January 1, 2010. The text chunk \"SEC. 5. COLLECTION OF DATA AND REVIEW OF COMPLEXITY CODES FOR PHYSICIAN ADMINISTRATION OF IVIG.\" is about the collection of data and review of complexity codes for physician administration of IVIG. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may contract for data collection on IVIG infusion practices within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Data review must be completed within 6 months, including input from the medical community on infusion payment codes. The Secretary will modify codes based on the collected data within 7 months of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may contract for data collection on IVIG infusion practices and modify existing infusion codes for reimbursement under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. If necessary, a report on the need for an additional infusion payment code must be submitted to Congress and the RBRUS Committee. SEC. 6. REPORTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress within 7 months of the Act's enactment. The report will include the results of data collection and review, as well as whether additional payments will be provided to physicians for intravenous immune globulins. The MedPAC Report, due 2 years after the Act's enactment, will analyze the impact of additional payments to physicians for intravenous immune globulins on beneficiary access under Medicare. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will analyze the implementation of a new payment methodology for intravenous immune globulins under Medicare Part B, assess the feasibility of reducing lag time for data used to determine average sales price, and provide recommendations for legislation and administrative action.
