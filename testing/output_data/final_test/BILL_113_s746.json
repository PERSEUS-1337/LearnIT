    "content": "The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 is amended to include a new section on a market-driven inventory system. The new section defines key terms like inventory cap, market commodity, program, and storage period for the market-driven inventory system program. Recourse loans are available under this program. For the 2014 through 2018 crops, the Secretary will offer recourse loans to producers who participate in the program for market commodities. Enrollment is voluntary and ongoing, with potential restrictions based on market prices. The program for market commodities includes enrollment restrictions based on market prices. Participation is limited for corn, wheat, and soybeans to specific bushel amounts. Storage periods are also specified. During the storage period, producers must store, maintain, and not sell the market commodity. Title remains with producers, with the Secretary having a first lien. During the storage period, the Secretary makes storage payments to producers at a rate of $0.40 per bushel of market commodity. The Secretary will terminate storage payments when the release price is triggered. Loan repayment and release are authorized by the Secretary for a market commodity. The Secretary authorizes loan repayment and release for a market commodity when the release price is triggered, which is 160 percent of the applicable recourse loan rate. Producers on a farm can either sell the commodity or continue to store it without additional storage payments. The Secretary may establish a maximum release quantity for a market commodity if the total quantity stored would depress market prices. Producers on a farm enrolled in the program can sell or release the commodity first. The program allows producers to sell or release stored market commodities into the market. Producers without this option can still receive storage payments. Recourse loan rates are set for various crops for the 2014-2018 crop years. Additionally, a set-aside program is established. The set-aside program allows producers to remove acres from production if the inventory cap is reached and the market price is below the loan rate. Eligibility requires producing the commodity in the last 2 years, with a cover crop condition for participation. Producers in the set-aside program must maintain an approved cover crop on all enrolled acreage. They have planting flexibility for acreage not in the program. The Secretary determines payment amounts and percentage of acreage planted to the market commodity.
