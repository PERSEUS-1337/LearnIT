The Act defines key terms such as \"Association,\" \"Director,\" \"Federal component,\" \"High Plains Aquifer,\" and \"High Plains Aquifer states.\" The Act defines key terms such as \"Association,\" \"Director,\" \"Federal component,\" \"High Plains Aquifer,\" and \"High Plains Aquifer states.\" The term \"High Plains Aquifer States\" includes Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"State component\" pertains to the State component of the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Characterization, Mapping, Modeling, and Monitoring Program. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT. The Secretary, through the US Geological Survey, will establish the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program to map, model, and monitor the aquifer's groundwater levels and withdrawals. The High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program will focus on monitoring water levels, factors affecting water migration, and loss of saturated thickness. Funding will be split between state and federal components, with priorities including coordinating data at all levels. The High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program aims to integrate data, maps, and models at all levels, support state and local activities with specialists, and provide technical capabilities not available locally. The Federal component includes interdisciplinary studies to enhance hydrogeologic characterization, mapping, modeling, and monitoring. The State Program Component focuses on hydrogeologic activities such as characterization, mapping, modeling, and monitoring. The State component of the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program focuses on groundwater depletion issues and resource assessment. Recommendations from State panels guide priorities, with Federal funds divided among State geological surveys and competitively awarded to State or local agencies for hydrogeologic activities. The State component of the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program focuses on groundwater depletion issues and resource assessment. Federal funds are competitively awarded to State or local agencies for hydrogeologic activities based on recommendations from State panels and final approval from the Federal Review Panel. The Federal Review Panel coordinates and reviews the priorities of the Federal and State components of the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program. It is composed of representatives from the United States Geological Survey and the geological surveys and water management agencies of the High Plains Aquifer States. The Federal Review Panel for the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Program consists of representatives from the United States Geological Survey and State agencies. Panel members are appointed for a 3-year term and receive technical and administrative support. Expenses are covered by program funds. Restrictions are placed on the use of Federal funds for indirect charges by the USGS and recipients of awards. The Secretary, with input from various organizations, will prepare a plan for the High Plains Aquifer Hydrogeologic Program, addressing priorities, management structure, and roles of the USGS and States. Reporting requirements will also be established. The Secretary will submit reports on the implementation of the program established by the Act and the status of the High Plains Aquifer to relevant committees and Governors of the High Plains Aquifer States."
