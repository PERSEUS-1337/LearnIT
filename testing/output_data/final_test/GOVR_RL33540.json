    "content": "President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13505 on March 9, 2009, allowing federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. This decision removed barriers to responsible scientific research and directed NIH to issue new guidelines within 120 days. Scientists can now use federal funds for research on previously ineligible cell lines, eliminating the need for separate federally funded research facilities. The Obama administration's policy change in 2009 allowed federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research, enabling scientists to use federal funds for research on eligible cell lines. This decision aimed to restore scientific integrity to government decision-making. Opponents of the research later challenged federal funding in court, citing the Dickey amendment. The Dickey amendment initially barred federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, but a court ruling allowed funding to continue under 2009 guidelines. The Obama executive order revoked previous restrictions on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. The Bush decision limited federal funding for research on 21 stem cell lines created before August 2001. Legislation to codify the Obama stem cell policy was introduced but not passed. The Dickey Amendment prohibits federal funds for creating human embryos for research or their destruction. Stem cell research involves non-specialized cells with the potential to become various cell types in the body, aiding in organ and tissue repair. Embryonic stem cells, derived from early-stage embryos, have the ability to develop into any cell type in the human body. This section provides background, history, and potential applications of stem cell research. The potential applications of stem cell research began with the isolation of embryonic stem cells from mouse embryos in 1981 and primate embryos in 1995. Human embryonic stem cells were successfully isolated in November 1998 by two groups of U.S. scientists, one at the University of Wisconsin and the other at Johns Hopkins University. The cells were derived from embryos or fetuses donated for research with parental consent, and were manipulated in the laboratory to create stem cell lines that can divide for extended periods. Research on human embryonic stem cells involves creating cell lines that can divide for extended periods. Many individuals opposed to abortion are also against research involving embryos, as they believe it is morally unacceptable to destroy embryos for harvesting stem cells. Some suggest using alternatives like induced pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cells. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues in Japan showed an alternative method. Shinya Yamanaka and his team at Kyoto University discovered a way to reprogram mouse and human skin cells to behave like embryonic stem cells by introducing specific genes. This breakthrough, known as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, earned Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in 2012. In 2007, similar results were achieved with human cells by another research group at the University of Wisconsin. The research teams reprogrammed adult skin cells using a retrovirus to transport four genes. Some argue that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells may replace the need for human embryonic stem cell research, while others believe more comparisons between the two cell types are necessary. Alternative mechanisms for reprogramming adult cells are being explored, such as using safer viruses or chemical methods to activate genes. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), also known as cloning, is another potential source of embryonic stem cells. Scientists in Scotland used SCNT to create Dolly the sheep, the first mammalian clone. SCNT can be used for reproductive cloning or therapeutic cloning to create genetically identical stem cells for research purposes. This method can help avoid tissue rejection issues in patients. While SCNT has been successful in creating cloned embryos in various mammals, attempts at primate embryo creation have been unsuccessful. In June 2007, researchers at the Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully derived stem cells from a rhesus monkey embryo created via SCNT. The announcement by Clonaid in December 2002 of a cloned child's birth added to the controversy over human embryo research. Scientists at the Seoul National University in South Korea isolated stem cells from a cloned human embryo in February 2004 and made advances in creating cloned human embryos and isolating stem cells in May 2005. In November 2005, concerns arose about ethical misconduct in the research on cloned human embryos and stem cells at Seoul National University. The lead researcher, Hwang Woo Suk, admitted to fabricating research results in papers from 2004 and 2005. Research on adult stem cells from sources like bone marrow and umbilical cord is also being conducted, with bone marrow transplantation being used for treating blood-related conditions for 50 years. Hematopoietic stem cells, which can differentiate into all blood cell types, can be sourced from umbilical cord blood. Some argue for adult stem cell research over embryonic stem cells due to ethical concerns, but others highlight limitations in adult stem cells such as shorter lifespan and limited versatility compared to embryonic stem cells. Scientists advocate for research on both types to compare their potential. Embryonic stem cells are recommended for research, along with adult stem cells, according to reports from the NIH and IOM. In FY2004, $10 million was allocated for a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank. The IOM conducted a study on cord blood stem cells as an alternative for treating various disorders. The IOM report outlines the process for establishing a national cord blood banking system, setting standards for collection and storage. President George W. Bush signed the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, allocating funds for cord blood treatment and research, as well as reauthorizing the national bone marrow registry. The C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation program was established to help health care workers search for cord blood and bone marrow matches. Legislation authorized $53 million annually through FY2015 for the program. Challenges in increasing cord blood collection include resource limitations and competition from other banks. Stem cells offer potential for studying cell growth and differentiation, understanding birth defects and genetic abnormalities, testing new drugs, repairing side effects of medical treatments, and treating diseases like diabetes and Parkinson's. Stem cells hold promise for various medical applications, including treating diseases and injuries. However, significant advancements in cell biology and clinical techniques are needed before stem cell therapies can be widely used. Regulatory decisions, such as those by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, would be necessary for approval of tissue-based therapies. Challenges include controlling stem cell differentiation and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, like cancer. Research may involve creating chimeras with genetically distinct cell types. Stem cells may hold the key to overcoming immune rejection in transplantation therapy. Scientists are exploring the creation of genetically identical stem cells to the patient to potentially avoid tissue rejection issues. This approach could provide a solution for successful stem cell therapeutic applications. Scientists believe that stem cells may offer the best hope for tissue transplantation. Federal funding for human embryo research has been restricted since the late 1970s, with policies evolving through different administrations. The Ethics Advisory Board was established in 1978 to oversee human embryo research. The Ethics Advisory Board (EAB) was formed in 1978 to oversee human embryo research following the recommendations of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The EAB reviewed a research proposal involving IVF in 1978 after the birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in July 1978. The EAB released a report in May 1979 stating that IVF research was ethically acceptable and could receive federal funding. The Ethics Advisory Board (EAB) recommended in 1979 that IVF research could be federally funded, but no action was taken by the Secretary, leading to the dissolution of the EAB in 1980. This decision effectively prevented any federal support for IVF and related research, including cloning and stem cells. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 later removed the requirement for EAB review of IVF proposals. Section 121(c) nullified the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals, removing an 18-year barrier to such research. Congressional intent of Section 121(c) can be found in the report language that accompanied the House bill, which aimed to lift the de facto moratorium on federal support for research on human in vitro fertilization. The NIH established the Human Embryo Research Panel in 1994 to assess moral and ethical issues related to human embryo research. The panel recommended guidelines and identified areas of research that required additional review, including certain types of cloning techniques. Federal funding for cloning techniques followed by transfer to the uterus was deemed unacceptable for the foreseeable future. The NIH Panel recommended federal funding for certain areas of human embryo research, including SCNT and stem cells, but not for creating embryos solely for research. President Clinton directed NIH not to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes, except for spare embryos and human parthenotes. Following this directive, NIH developed guidelines for research using spare embryos. The Dickey Amendment, enacted in 1996, halted NIH plans to develop guidelines for embryo research using federal funds. This amendment prohibits the use of appropriated funds for creating or destroying human embryos for research purposes, leading to a reliance on private or non-federal funding for such experiments. The Dickey Amendment, enacted in 1996, prohibits the use of federal funds for creating or destroying human embryos for research purposes. This has led to a reliance on private or non-federal funding for such experiments. The amendment is found in Section 508 of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2012. The Dickey Amendment, enacted in 1996, prohibits federal funds for creating or destroying human embryos for research. This includes organisms derived from human gametes or diploid cells. No federal funds supported stem cell research from human embryos or fetal tissue before the August 2001 Bush Administration decision. Successful isolation of human embryonic stem cells was announced in November 1998 by the University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins University. The University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins University successfully isolated human embryonic stem cells in November 1998 with private funding from Geron Corporation. HHS determined that federal funds could be used for research on human stem cells as they do not meet the statutory definition of a human embryo. The HHS stated that human stem cells cannot develop into organisms and NIH could support research using stem cells derived from private funds but not from embryos with federal funds due to the Dickey Amendment. NIH planned to fund research on stem cells from human embryos once guidelines were developed. A working group drafted guidelines in April 1999, with public comments received until February 2000. On August 25, 2000, NIH published the draft guidelines in the Federal Register. NIH published final guidelines in August 2000 for human embryonic stem cell research, stating that NIH funds could only be used for studies with stem cells derived from embryos created for fertility treatment. Funding for research involving the derivation of human stem cells from embryos was prohibited by the Dickey Amendment. Other ineligible areas for NIH funding included research involving human stem cells contributing to human embryos or combined with animal embryos. Research guidelines for human embryonic stem cells were published by NIH in August 2000, restricting funding to studies using stem cells from embryos created for fertility treatment. Funding for research deriving human stem cells from embryos was prohibited. Other ineligible areas for NIH funding included research involving human stem cells combined with animal embryos or used for reproductive cloning. Grant applications for research projects using human stem cells were accepted immediately after the guidelines were published, with a deadline of March 15, 2001. Applications were reviewed by the NIH Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group to ensure compliance. The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) was established to ensure compliance with the August 2000 guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research. The first meeting was scheduled for April 25, 2001, but was postponed by the new administration following the election of George W. Bush. The group consisted of 12 members with diverse expertise, including a \"mainstream Catholic.\" The Bush Administration conducted a legal review of the Clinton Administration's policy decisions on federal support for stem cell research. The NIH report released on July 18, 2001, at a Senate hearing recommended pursuing both embryonic and adult stem cell research. President George W. Bush announced on August 9, 2001, that federal funds would support research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines to explore their potential without crossing moral boundaries. President George W. Bush announced that federal funds would support research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines, while also supporting research on stem cells from other sources like adult tissues. The federal government aimed to ensure that taxpayer funding did not encourage the destruction of human embryos with the potential for life, and only supported scientifically sound, legal, and ethical stem cell research. The Bush administration allowed federal funds for research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines, while prohibiting the creation of new embryos for research or cloning of human embryos. The NIH created a registry for eligible cell lines, replacing previous guidelines from the Clinton administration. Research proposals underwent peer review without additional scrutiny from the HPSCRG. In 2002, NIH approved the first expenditures for human embryonic stem cell research, with 78 eligible cell lines listed in the registry. Many stem cell lines approved for federally funded research under the Bush policy were found to be unavailable or unsuitable. Concerns arose over the limited number of pre-2001 cell lines, which were genetically unstable and harder to work with. In response, U.S. research groups developed new stem cell lines using private or state funding to prevent scientists from relocating. States initiated funding for stem cell research to counter the restrictions imposed by the Bush policy. Without federal direction, concerns arose over duplication of research efforts, lack of oversight, and potential loss of U.S. preeminence in stem cell research. In 2004, over 200 House Members urged President George W. Bush to revise the stem cell policy and utilize excess embryos from infertility treatments. The letter highlighted the need to donate frozen IVF embryos for research to prevent their destruction. Concerns were raised about funding restrictions hindering research progress, leading scientists to move to countries with more supportive policies like the United Kingdom. The shift in research leadership to the UK was noted, emphasizing the importance of this scientific area in the biotech industry. President Bush's stance on human embryonic stem cell research is based on his opposition to using taxpayer funds for the destruction of embryos with potential for life. In 2004, there were calls to expand federal stem cell policies due to concerns about the US losing leadership in this research field to other countries. NIH announced the establishment of Centers of Excellence in Translational Stem Cell Research and a National Embryonic Stem Cell Bank in July 2004. In response to calls for expanding federal stem cell policies, NIH established Centers of Excellence in Translational Stem Cell Research and a National Embryonic Stem Cell Bank. Secretary Tommy Thompson emphasized exhausting the potential of existing stem cell lines before broadening the policy. However, the President of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research argued that creating a bank for pre-2001 stem cell lines does not address the inadequate supply for research. NIH Director Zerhouni expressed concerns about the limited stem cell lines available for funding, stating that adult stem cells may hold as much potential as embryonic stem cells. In contrast to the Bush Administration policy, there was a call to support human embryonic stem cell research, emphasizing the need for NIH to maintain its leadership in the field. President Bush signed an Executive Order in 2007 to support research on stem cells capable of producing various cell types for disease treatments. President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13505 on March 9, 2009, to remove barriers to responsible scientific research involving human stem cells. This order revoked previous orders by President Bush and allowed for the support and conduct of human embryonic stem cell research by the Secretary of HHS through NIH. The Obama administration's Executive Order 13505 in 2009 allowed federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research, overturning previous restrictions. NIH was directed to issue new guidelines within 120 days, ensuring all federally funded research followed the same principles. Opponents of the research later challenged federal funding in court. The Dickey amendment prohibited federal funding for research involving human embryos at risk of harm. The court case debated whether this included activities leading to the destruction of embryos. Ultimately, the court upheld the narrower interpretation allowing federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. The Dickey amendment history supported HHS's narrower definition of \"research,\" allowing federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research under 2009 guidelines. The Supreme Court upheld the D.C. Circuit's opinion in 2013. The Obama policy eliminated the need to separate federally funded research from state or private funded research, potentially impacting state funding for stem cell research. The Obama Administration released draft guidelines for human stem cell research in 2009, with final guidelines issued by NIH in July. These guidelines specified conditions for using human embryonic stem cells in research conducted with federal funds. The guidelines for using human embryos in research specify conditions for donation, consent, and care at the health care facility. The guidelines emphasize the importance of separating decisions regarding the creation of human embryos for reproductive purposes from decisions to donate embryos for research. Consent for donation should be obtained from individuals seeking reproductive treatment. Donors should have given consent for the donation of embryos for research purposes at the time of donation. They should have been informed of their right to withdraw consent until the embryos were used for deriving stem cells. The consent process included information on the use of embryos for stem cell research and the potential long-term storage of derived stem cells. The 2009 NIH guidelines restrict the use of human embryonic stem cells for research, specifying who can receive medical benefits, prohibiting direct benefits to donors, and addressing commercial potential. Funding is not allowed for stem cells derived from SCNT, parthenogenesis, or IVF embryos created for research. Dr. Kington highlighted strong support for federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research from embryos created for reproductive purposes, citing legislation passed by Congress. However, there is less support for other sources of stem cells. A survey found 783 cell lines from excess IVF embryos, but none specifically created for research purposes. Concerns exist that cell lines eligible under the 2001 Bush policy may not meet the detailed consent requirements of the 2009 NIH guidelines. The 2009 NIH guidelines allow a Working Group to review the ethical principles of obtaining informed consent for embryo donation. A new NIH registry of eligible human embryonic stem cell lines was created in 2009, with a proposal in 2010 to expand the definition to include early stage embryos up to the blastocyst stage. In April 2010, NIH approved four stem cell lines for federal funding, including the widely used H9 stem cell line. Currently, there are 200 stem cell lines listed in the registry. Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research was briefly halted in 2010, but grant awards funded before August 23, 2010, were not affected. The NIH ordered intramural researchers using human embryonic stem cells to stop experiments immediately on August 30, 2010. Eight research projects were affected, potentially delaying breakthroughs in biomedical research for conditions like spinal cord injury and diabetes. The Association of American Medical Colleges, Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and Council on Governmental Relations expressed concern over a court injunction blocking potential life-saving research and threatening peer-reviewed science. NIH funding for stem cell research was supported by a $10 billion stimulus package. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for stem cell research regulated by the FDA. Stem cells, including embryos, cord blood, and adult cells, fall under the category of human cells, tissues, and cellular products (HCT/Ps). Other examples of HCT/Ps are bone, skin, corneas, and heart valves. FDA oversees the regulation of HCT/Ps for implantation or infusion into patients. HCT/Ps, including ligaments, tendons, dura mater, heart valves, oocytes, and semen, are regulated under 21 CFR 1271 by the FDA. The regulation focuses on limiting the risk of disease transmission, minimizing contamination, and ensuring safety and effectiveness. Some HCT/Ps are regulated under Section 361 of the PHS Act, meeting criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10 without FDA premarket review. Establishments manufacturing HCT/Ps meeting criteria in CFR 1271.10 must register with FDA, list HCT/Ps, and comply with CFR 1271. Exceptions listed in CFR 1271.15 include nonclinical/scientific use, same-individual implantation, or transfer to a sexually intimate partner. HCT/Ps not meeting criteria or exceptions are regulated as drugs/devices under FDA. In January 2009, FDA approved a request to begin tests of human embryonic stem cells in patients with recent spinal cord injuries. Geron, a California biotechnology company, conducted the Phase I clinical trial, but in November 2011, they announced the halt of their stem cell therapy program due to financial issues. Despite monitoring four patients who received stem cell injections, there were no significant improvements in reversing the spinal cord injury. In November 2010, Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) received FDA approval for a clinical trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat blindness. Concerns about tumor formation from transplanted stem cells were addressed through rodent studies. Non-federal entities provided guidelines for stem cell research due to a lack of federal regulation during the George W. Bush Administration. The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) also played a role in setting standards for human embryonic stem cell research. The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) developed guidelines in 2002 to promote global collaboration in stem cell research. The National Academies established guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research in 2004, focusing on therapeutic and research uses while advocating for a ban on human reproductive cloning. The committee released its guidelines in 2005, emphasizing informed consent of donors. The guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research were developed by the National Academies in 2005, emphasizing the importance of informed consent and prohibiting financial incentives for donation. Institutions were advised to establish oversight committees with experts in science, ethics, and law, as well as public members. A national panel was recommended for ongoing oversight. In 2007, revised guidelines were published with minor changes to the introduction and establishment sections. In 2007, the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) released guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research, developed by a committee of experts from 14 countries to encourage international collaboration and adherence to uniform practices. The guidelines were updated in September 2008 to include a new section on iPS cells. The ISSCR released guidelines in December 2008 for the clinical translation of stem cells to ensure safe and effective therapies. They also developed a handbook to help patients and doctors evaluate stem cell therapies, aiming to prevent rogue clinics from exploiting patients with unproven treatments. A study by the University of Alberta found that many Internet sites offering stem cell therapies overpromise results and underestimate risks. State laws restrict stem cell research, with some states allowing research with parental consent and others prohibiting research on certain types of embryos. Louisiana, Illinois, and Michigan have specific restrictions on embryo research, while other states prohibit research on cloned embryos. Several states have laws that prohibit cloning for pregnancy but allow it for research. Some states limit state funds for cloning or stem cell research, with restrictions on the use of public monies for reproductive or therapeutic cloning in certain states. Nebraska statutes restrict state funds for embryonic stem cell research, and restrictions only apply to state healthcare cash funds. Several states have laws prohibiting cloning for pregnancy but allowing it for research, with restrictions on state funds for embryonic stem cell research. Illinois Executive Order 6 (2005) prohibits the use of state funding for reproductive cloning or research on fetuses from induced abortions. In response to federal restrictions, states like California, Connecticut, and New York have provided funding for various types of stem cell research to stay competitive and retain scientists and biotechnology firms. The change in federal policy under the Obama Administration has prompted some states to reassess their stem cell research efforts. The current economic situation has led some states to reconsider their stem cell research efforts. Legislation in the 111th and 112th Congresses aimed to codify the Obama stem cell policy, ban funding for reproductive human cloning, and establish ethical guidelines for stem cell lines. However, no further action was taken on this legislation."
