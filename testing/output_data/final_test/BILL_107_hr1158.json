    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Homeland Security Agency Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the security of the United States homeland from nontraditional and emerging threats must be a primary national security mission. Attacks on US soil, potentially causing heavy casualties, are likely in the next quarter century due to the proliferation of technical means and actors. These attacks may involve weapons of mass destruction and disruption, with cyber borders being particularly vulnerable. The United States' critical infrastructure is vulnerable to targeting by governments and individuals due to its preeminence and openness. Despite the serious threat to homeland security, the government has not prioritized it as a national security mission, leading to fragmented and inadequate structures and strategies. Ensuring homeland security while protecting civil liberties is crucial. The United States Government must prioritize the privacy of its citizens while improving national security. A comprehensive strategy and new organizational structures are urgently needed to prevent and protect against attacks on the homeland. The National Homeland Security Agency will enhance planning, coordination, and readiness to prevent attacks and facilitate recovery if prevention fails.
