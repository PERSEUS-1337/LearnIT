    "content": "ERISA, enacted in 1974, initially had limited regulation on health plan coverage. However, starting in 1986, Congress added requirements such as health care continuation coverage, limitations on preexisting condition exclusions, parity between medical and mental health benefits, and minimum hospital stay for new mothers. COBRA, added in 1985, allows for temporary continuation of health care coverage for plan participants and beneficiaries under certain circumstances. Plan sponsors with 20 or more employees must offer \"qualified beneficiaries\" the option to continue coverage under the employer's group health plan. Under ERISA, employers must provide continuation coverage under COBRA for qualified beneficiaries in the case of certain events like death, termination, or reduction of hours of employment. The coverage typically lasts for 18 months but can be longer depending on the event. COBRA benefits must be identical to those offered to non-COBRA beneficiaries, and premiums cannot exceed 102% of the plan's cost. The health plan may charge a premium to COBRA participants, not exceeding 102% of the group rate. After 18 months, certain participants may be charged 150% of the group rate. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides COBRA premium subsidies of 65% for up to nine months to help the unemployed afford health insurance coverage. This subsidy is available to those who meet income criteria and were involuntarily terminated between September 1, 2008, and January 1, 2010. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40420. HIPAA added Part 7 to ERISA for health plan coverage requirements, applying to group health plans and insurers. It aims to improve health insurance portability by limiting preexisting condition exclusions. Preexisting condition exclusion under group health plans or insurance coverage can apply based on health status information before coverage starts. Exclusions cannot exceed 12 months (or 18 months for late enrollees) after enrollment, and must be reduced by days of prior creditable coverage. HIPAA prohibits preexisting condition exclusions under certain circumstances, such as for pregnancy-related conditions. Newborns and adopted children cannot be subject to exclusion if they had creditable coverage within 30 days of birth or adoption, with no gap exceeding 63 days. HIPAA requires health plans to offer special enrollment opportunities for certain individuals, such as new dependents through marriage, birth, adoption, or loss of other health coverage. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 amended ERISA to allow employees and dependents to enroll in group health plans in specific circumstances, like loss of Medicaid or becoming eligible for financial assistance under Medicaid. HIPAA and ERISA provide special enrollment opportunities for individuals who become eligible for financial assistance under Medicaid or SCHIP. ERISA Section 702 prohibits health plans from basing coverage eligibility on health-related factors and prevents discrimination based on genetic information. GINA further amended ERISA to reinforce these protections. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) amended ERISA to prevent genetic discrimination in health plans. It prohibits adjusting premiums based on genetic information and restricts requesting genetic tests, except for research purposes with conditions. GINA also prohibits using genetic information for underwriting purposes. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits the use of genetic information for underwriting purposes in health plans. It also restricts requesting genetic tests for underwriting before an individual's enrollment. Additionally, HIPAA added Section 703 of ERISA to prevent denial of coverage to employers under certain circumstances. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) requires health plans offering mental health benefits to not impose lower annual and lifetime dollar limits on these benefits compared to medical benefits. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) requires health plans to have equal annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health benefits as for medical and surgical benefits. Plans can choose which mental health benefits to offer, but substance abuse treatment is not covered by the parity requirements. Some plans may be exempt, such as those covering employers with 50 or fewer employees or those experiencing a 1% increase in claims costs due to compliance. Recent legislation has expanded the MHPA's requirements for group health plans starting after October 3, 2009, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The act amends federal laws to require parity between mental health/substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits in group health plans. It includes financial requirements and treatment limitations, applying to defined mental health and substance use disorder benefits. Plans may be exempt based on actuarial determination. The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act (NMHPA) amended ERISA to establish minimum hospital stay requirements for mothers after childbirth, prohibiting plans from limiting stays to less than 48 hours for vaginal delivery or 96 hours for cesarean section. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act requires group health plans to cover prosthetic devices for mastectomy patients. ERISA requires group health plans to cover prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery for mastectomy patients. \"Michelle's Law\" allows dependents to stay on their parents' plan during a medical leave from full-time student status for up to one year. Michelle's Law allows dependents to remain on their parents' health plan during a medically necessary leave of absence if they were enrolled in the plan as a full-time student at a postsecondary education institution. The law applies to plan years starting on or after October 9, 2009."
