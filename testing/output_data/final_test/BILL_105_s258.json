    "content": "The Act titled \"Milk Price Discovery Improvement Act of 1997\" is also known as the \"Milk Price Discovery Improvement Act\". The National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin is the primary cash market for bulk cheese in the US, influencing milk prices and serving as a price discovery mechanism for the industry. The National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin is a thinly traded, illiquid, and highly concentrated market that is increasingly volatile. A report funded by the United States Department of Agriculture concluded that the Exchange is vulnerable to price manipulation, leading to widespread producer concern about price validity. It is crucial to ensure competitive price determination on cash markets affecting milk prices and improve price discovery for dairy products. SEC. 3. BASIC FORMULA PRICE. Section 143(a) of the Agricultural Market Transition Act is amended to prohibit the use of prices from the National Cheese Exchange in determining milk prices regulated by the Secretary. The Secretary is required to review and amend regulations within 60 days. The Secretary must ensure that regulations comply with specified requirements and allow for further revisions or replacements of the basic formula price, as long as they are consistent with the initial subparagraph. SEC. 4. DAIRY PRICE DISCOVERY AND REPORTING SYSTEM. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include a Dairy Price Discovery and Reporting System. The Secretary is required to develop a price discovery system for raw milk, bulk cheese, and other dairy products within a year to facilitate orderly marketing conditions. This system will collect and disseminate statistically reliable information on prices and terms of trade for spot and forward contracts in cheese manufacturing areas in the United States. The Secretary is mandated to develop a price discovery system for raw milk and bulk cheese, provide technical assistance for organizing a cash market alternative to the National Cheese Exchange, and conduct a study on improving futures trading volume for dairy products in cooperation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Secretary is required to develop a price discovery system for raw milk and bulk cheese, provide technical assistance for organizing a cash market alternative to the National Cheese Exchange, and conduct a study on improving futures trading volume for dairy products. Additionally, a study and report to Congress on the feasibility of creating an electronic exchange for cheese and dairy products is mandated, with confidentiality measures in place for information provided to the Secretary. SEC. 5. Oversight of cash markets affecting federal milk marketing orders. The Agricultural Adjustment Act is amended to include oversight of cash markets affecting federal milk marketing orders, defining noncompetitive practices as actions that manipulate prices or create monopolies. The Secretary shall prohibit noncompetitive practices in cash exchanges for milk and milk products to ensure fair trade practices and orderly marketing conditions. This does not affect the authority of other federal agencies or states. The Department of Justice, Federal agencies, and State agencies are prohibited from regulating noncompetitive practices in cash exchanges for milk and milk products. Enforcement provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 apply to this regulation."
