The Secretary will reimburse each State for uncollected State and local sales tax during the sales tax holiday period, based on predetermined and reconciliation amounts. The Secretary will reimburse each electing State for uncollected State and local sales tax during the sales tax holiday period, based on predetermined and reconciliation amounts. The State must inform the Secretary of their intention to qualify for reimbursement by not collecting sales tax during the holiday period. The chief executive officer of the State must inform the Secretary, Director of Management and Budget, and retail sellers of tangible property about the intention to elect for reimbursement of a reconciliation amount by November 28, 2001. Additional information may be required for retail sellers regarding reporting periods, including the sales tax holiday period. The chief executive officer must report the determined amount to the Secretary and Director of Management and Budget by February 15, 2002. If the payment exceeds the determined amount, the excess must be remitted to the Secretary by March 6, 2002. The State's chief executive officer must certify certain conditions for retail sellers. During the sales tax holiday period, retail sellers can report sales revenue as a good faith effort to comply with requirements. They will not be held liable for errors unless they acted recklessly or fraudulently. In home rule States, the chief executive must certify conditions for retail sellers. During a sales tax holiday period, retail sellers can report sales revenue in good faith. The chief executive officer of a home rule State must certify conditions for retail sellers, and agree to pay each local government's share of reimbursement within 20 days. The Director of Management and Budget certifies reimbursement amounts for states electing to receive it. The reimbursement of local sales taxes to a State is determined based on the ratio of local sales tax to State sales tax, using data from the Bureau of the Census. Definitions include a \"home rule State\" as one that does not control local taxes, \"local\" as a subordinate revenue authority, and \"sales tax\" as a tax on retail sales of taxable items or services. The curr_chunk discusses sales tax on tangible property and services in Illinois, excluding taxes on food, beverages for immediate consumption, alcohol-containing beverages, and tobacco products. It also defines the term \"sales tax holiday period\" as starting after December 7, 2001. The curr_chunk defines terms like \"period,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"use tax\" in relation to sales tax on tangible property."
