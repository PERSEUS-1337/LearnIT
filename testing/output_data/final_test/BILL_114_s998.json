Congress should consider a miscellaneous tariff bill within 180 days after reports on proposed duty suspensions and reductions are issued. SEC. 3 outlines the process for consideration of duty suspensions and reductions. The purpose of this section is to establish a process for submitting and considering proposed duty suspensions and reductions. The appropriate congressional committees are required to establish a process by October 15, 2015, and October 15, 2018, for the inclusion of duty suspensions and reductions in a miscellaneous tariff bill. The Commission must publish a notice requesting the public to submit proposed duty suspensions and reductions, along with disclosure forms. This process must be completed within a 60-day period, with submissions sent to Congress promptly after. The Commission must submit proposed duty suspensions and reductions to Congress within 15 days after the 60-day period, and publish them on a publicly available website. The Commission must submit reports to Congress within 90 days of proposing duty suspensions and reductions, detailing information on each proposed duty suspension or reduction, including a determination on domestic production impact. The Commission must submit reports to Congress within 90 days of proposing duty suspensions and reductions, detailing information on each proposed duty suspension or reduction, including domestic production impact, technical changes, tariff revenue implications, and availability to importers. The Commission will establish procedures for duty suspension compliance and operate under its authorities as per the Tariff Act of 1930. The Department of Commerce, in collaboration with relevant agencies, will submit a report within 90 days of proposed duty suspensions and reductions. The Department of Commerce, along with other Federal agencies, will submit a report to congressional committees on proposed duty suspensions and reductions. The report will include information on domestic production, objections from domestic producers, and any necessary technical changes to article descriptions for importation. Proposed duty suspensions or reductions by Members of Congress will not receive preferential treatment. The treatment of proposed duty suspensions or reductions submitted by the public will not be more favorable than those submitted by Members of Congress. SEC. 4. REPORT ON EFFECTS OF DUTY SUSPENSIONS AND REDUCTIONS ON UNITED STATES ECONOMY. The Commission is required to submit a report on the effects of temporary duty suspensions and reductions on the US economy, including an assessment of the economic impact on producers, purchasers, and consumers. The report should also include recommendations for domestic industries that could benefit from permanent duty suspensions or reductions. The report required by this section will focus on inequities created by tariff inversions and may include a classified annex. SEC. 5. JUDICIAL REVIEW PRECLUDED. The exercise of functions under this Act shall not be subject to judicial review. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.
