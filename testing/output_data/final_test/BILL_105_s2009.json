Congress finds that the military health care system and Veterans Health Administration manage over 1,500 facilities worldwide, serving more than 11 million beneficiaries. These institutions are undergoing significant changes post-Cold War, with a decrease in medical personnel and hospitals. The Department of Veterans Affairs has restructured by creating 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. In response to rising medical costs and increased demand for healthcare services, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have implemented various collaborative programs, expanding shared services and joint venture operations at medical facilities. The number of facilities with sharing agreements increased from 102 in 1984 to 420 in 1997, with shared services growing from 3,000 to over 6,000 services. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs are conducting health care joint ventures in several states, with plans for more ventures in other states. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 2. The Sense of Congress commends the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for their cooperation in delivering medical care.
