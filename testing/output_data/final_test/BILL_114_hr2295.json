The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to define 'Federal lands' for natural gas pipeline right-of-way applications, excluding Indian trust lands and Outer Continental Shelf lands. The Secretary is authorized to designate National Energy Security Corridors on suitable Federal lands for the construction, operation, and maintenance of natural gas transmission facilities. The Secretary is authorized to designate National Energy Security Corridors on suitable Federal lands for natural gas transmission facilities, balancing energy security needs with land use principles and seeking input from various stakeholders to determine cost-effective routes. The Secretary is authorized to designate National Energy Security Corridors on Federal lands for natural gas transmission facilities, ensuring reliability, reducing congestion, lowering gas prices, and meeting demand. Procedures are established to expedite and approve pipeline applications within these corridors, with a transparent review process and a maximum approval time of 1 year. The Secretary can designate National Energy Security Corridors on Federal lands for natural gas transmission facilities. The Governor of a State can request the designation of Corridors on Federal land, and the Secretary must respond within 30 days with a timeline for granting, denying, or modifying the request. The Secretary can grant, deny, or modify requests for National Energy Security Corridors on Federal lands, coordinating with other departments to minimize duplicative pipeline rights-of-way and ensure effective connections. Input from utility and pipeline industries is used to site corridors in economically feasible areas that reduce impacts on local communities. Designation of a Corridor under this subsection is not considered a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. There is no limit on the number or size of Corridors the Secretary can designate. The authority to issue rights-of-way on Federal land outside designated Corridors is not affected. NEPA clarification is required for applications for rights-of-way for natural gas transmission facilities across Corridors. The Secretary of the Interior must designate at least 10 National Energy Security Corridors within 2 years. Applications for right-of-way before designation will be reviewed independently. Environmental protections apply to natural gas transmission facilities across designated Corridors. The Secretary of the Interior must notify specific committees of Congress when any agency or official fails to comply with schedules under the Natural Gas Act."
