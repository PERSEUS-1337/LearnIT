Congress finds that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasizes the importance of finding common ground with other nations and investing in social development. Polling data shows that humanitarian assistance from the United States led to more favorable views in Indonesia and Pakistan. International volunteering is effective in addressing human needs and promoting mutual understanding.
