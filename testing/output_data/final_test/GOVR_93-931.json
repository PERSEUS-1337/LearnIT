    "content": "Politics in Haiti have been violent and authoritarian since the country's independence in 1804, with a history of despotic rulers and resistance to democratic reform. The government is still influenced by Duvalierist appointees, hindering progress towards change. Haitian history is marked by conflict between the mulatto elite and majority blacks. The mulattos controlled the business sector, while black rulers emphasized African roots. Race relations have improved, but recent events have heightened tensions within Haiti. Recent political events in Haiti have heightened racial and class tensions. The mulatto elite holds most of the power and resists wealth redistribution. The United States intervened in Haiti in 1915 to prevent civil strife and establish control. The U.S. military presence in Haiti was both welcomed and resented for interfering with Haitian sovereignty. The U.S. withdrawal began in 1932 under President Hoover, with a commission finding that while the occupation brought improvements, it excluded Haitians from real authority. President Roosevelt signed a disengagement agreement in 1933, and the last U.S. Marines left in 1934. Francois Duvalier, known as \"Papa Doc,\" became President of Haiti in 1957 through elections marred by irregularities. He quickly established himself as a dictator, leading a regime marked by repression, torture, and arbitrary imprisonment. The Duvaliers' private militia, the Tontons Macoutes, enforced their rule through violence and extortion. In 1964, Duvalier amended the constitution to become president-for-life. In 1971, three months before his death, Francois Duvalier amended the constitution to name his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude president-for-life. Jean-Claude Duvalier's opulent lifestyle and marriage to a prominent mulatto stirred resentment among the poor black majority living in poverty. Fiscal corruption was rampant in his government, leading to popular dissatisfaction and repression. Facing massive demonstrations and pressure, Jean-Claude fled to France in 1986 with US assistance. Aristide's 1991 ouster led to the seventh government in five and a half years since Duvalier's departure. The 6-man military-dominated National Council of Government (CNG) disbanded the Tontons Macoutes, drafted a new constitution, and held elections in Haiti in 1988. Despite violence and election interference by Duvalierists, a civilian government was inaugurated in February 1988. In January 1988, the CNG held elections that were seen as rigged in favor of Leslie Manigat. However, Manigat was ousted in a military coup led by Lt. General Henri Namphy in June 1988. Namphy's 31-month rule saw an increase in human rights violations, including political killings. He was succeeded by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who also faced criticism for human rights abuses. Avril's regime was marked by violent protests, leading to his resignation. In March 1990, a civilian government was appointed with the goal of holding elections promptly. Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman on the Supreme Court, was selected as provisional President by a coalition of political and civic organizations with the mandate of holding elections soon. Despite facing challenges in controlling the military, Trouillot established an independent electoral council that successfully organized elections at the end of the year, marking a hopeful shift towards democracy in Haiti. The democratic movement in Haiti led to free and fair elections with a 70 percent voter turnout. International observers, economic support, and the presence of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President were key factors in the success of the elections. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President with 67.5 percent of the vote in Haiti, inaugurated on the fifth anniversary of the Duvalier dictatorship's collapse. A controversial populist Roman Catholic priest, he is seen as a martyr defending the poor and advocating \"liberation theology.\" Aristide's detractors view him as a potentially dangerous demagogue, with his inflammatory speeches possibly inciting violence. Aristide's book denies violence endorsement, expelled by Salesian order for preaching politics. Initially against democratic elections in Haiti, he joined the race due to Lafontant's potential candidacy. Lafontant's coup attempt to prevent Aristide from taking office failed. After Lafontant's failed coup attempt, Aristide faced criticism for not condemning street violence quickly enough. The popular celebration turned violent as suspected Macoutes were lynched, and the cathedral was burned down. Foreign diplomats criticized Aristide for his response to the violence. Despite some successes in curbing crime and reducing state employees, Aristide faced serious social, economic, and political challenges in Haiti. The new government faced criticism for not reaching out to establish cooperation among democratic elements. Aristide's appointment of judges and ambassadors without consulting the Senate led to strained relations with the legislature. Aristide's call for a life sentence for Lafontant, who received it despite constitutional limits, sparked further controversy. Many observers expressed concern over the trial of Lafontant under Aristide's government, citing similarities to trials under the Duvaliers. The trial lasted over 20 hours, key witnesses were not called, and inexperienced lawyers were appointed to defend Lafontant. Despite initial criticism, Aristide's government presented a successful economic reform plan in July 1991, securing $440 million in aid for FY1992, most of which was suspended due to a coup in September 1991. Aristide received mixed reviews for his human rights record, criticized for condoning mob violence but also credited for other efforts. Aristide received mixed reviews for his presidency, criticized for condoning mob violence but also credited with reducing human rights violations. He polarized Haiti by refusing to condemn violent acts and threatening mob violence against dissenters, including the practice of \"pere lebrun\". Former TontonsMacoutes with \"pere lebrun.\" Aristide reportedly said, \"You are watching all macoute activities throughout the country. We are watching and praying. If we catch one, do not fail to give him what he deserves. In exile, Aristide condemned the practice of necklacing. Observers contend that in the speech Aristide also threatened the bourgeoisie for not having helped his government enough, leading to his overthrow just days later. Members of the bourgeoisie were accused of financially supporting the coup leaders. The report on Aristide's human rights record criticized his support for Pere Lebrun and highlighted his failure to speak out against human rights abuses. It also recognized him as the legitimate Haitian head of state elected with a two-thirds majority. The report emphasized the need to address human rights shortcomings but stated they should not justify further violations. Most human rights monitors credit the Aristide government with addressing the need to improve respect for human rights and the needs of the poor majority. Aristide created a greater sense of security in Haiti by reducing common crime and removing corrupt sheriffs who ruled rural areas through extortion and violence. State Department reports for 1991 and 1992 show no disappearances during Aristide's term. After Aristide's term, disappearances and political killings increased dramatically. The September 1991 coup occurred shortly after Aristide's UN address, leading to hundreds of coup-related deaths. The Haitian army obstructed the democratic process under military-dominated interim governments, but some believed it had transformed to support democracy by 1990. The army played a role in maintaining order during the 1990 electoral process. The Haitian army underwent changes, including the attrition of anti-democratic elements and pressure for civilian democracy. Initially accepting Aristide's authority, the army later ousted him, citing his interference in military affairs. Analysts suggest the army's reluctance to relinquish control is linked to profiting from illegal activities. Efforts to establish civilian authority over the military faced challenges. The Haitian constitution mandates civilian authority over the military, with the police under the Ministry of Justice. Military abuses against civilians should be tried in civilian courts. Aristide aimed to combat corruption and reform the army before being overthrown. The military used violence to suppress political opposition after the coup. Rights reports indicated that the military used violence to intimidate political opposition, popular organizations, the urban poor, and the media. Former members of the army and the Tontons Macoutes continued to terrorize the population by engaging in contraband, robbery, and extortion. The interim governments failed to prosecute perpetrators of human rights violations, leading to public acts of \"popular justice\" against suspected Macoutes. The Aristide government was accused of condoning such tactics but also credited with reducing crime in the capital and detaining many \"terrorists\". After Aristide's removal, Tontons Macoutes activity resurged. After Aristide's ouster, there was a resurgence of Tontons Macoutes activity in Haiti. The country has a population of 6.4 million, with French spoken by only 10% and Creole spoken by the entire population. The majority of the population is of African origin, with a small percentage of mixed African-European and European origin. The predominant religion is Roman Catholicism, with a majority also practicing Voodoo. The GNP in 1991 was $2.27 billion, with a negative growth rate. Life expectancy is 55 years, adult literacy is 47%, and the infant mortality rate is 94 per 1,000 live births.
