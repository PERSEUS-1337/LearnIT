    "content": "The Forest Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009, also known as the Carbon Incentives Program, aims to achieve supplemental greenhouse gas emission reductions on private forest land. The Forest Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009, also known as the Carbon Incentives Program, defines an \"avoided deforestation agreement\" as a permanent conservation easement covering eligible land enrolled in a climate mitigation contract, ensuring it will not be developed. The agreement must comply with guidelines set by the Forest Legacy Program or other approved programs for permanent conservation easements. The Forest Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009 defines a \"climate mitigation contract\" as a contract for eligible land in the United States, specifying practices, acreage, compensation, and verification schedule. Eligible land refers to privately owned forest land, and eligible practices include forestry practices for improved forest management. The Forest Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009 establishes a carbon incentives program to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions on private forest land in the United States. The program aims to promote forestry practices that increase carbon sequestration and storage beyond customary practices. The Secretary of Agriculture will oversee the program and provide financial incentive payments to participants. The Secretary will provide financial incentives to landowners for practices that increase carbon sequestration and storage over time, as well as for avoided deforestation agreements on eligible land. Eligibility for payments based on increased carbon storage does not require a deforestation agreement. The Secretary will provide financial incentives to landowners for practices that increase carbon sequestration and storage over time, as well as for avoided deforestation agreements. To participate in the program, an owner of eligible land must enter into a climate mitigation contract with the Secretary. The program aims to achieve 100,000,000 tons of carbon reductions by 2020 and 200,000,000 tons by 2030 through climate mitigation contracts. The program provides financial incentives to landowners for increasing carbon sequestration and storage through climate mitigation contracts. Emission reductions or sequestration achieved through the program are not eligible for crediting under federal carbon offset programs. Compensation for program activities should not exceed the estimated benefit under federal carbon offset programs, considering credit issuance costs and compliance with reversal provisions. The Secretary shall specify requirements for addressing intentional or unintentional reversal of carbon sequestration in climate mitigation contracts. If an owner intentionally violates the contract, the Secretary will terminate it and require repayment reflecting lost carbon sequestration. The Secretary will reevaluate and may modify or terminate climate mitigation contracts if an eligible practice is unintentionally reversed due to events outside the owner's control. This will consider lost carbon sequestration and future potential. Regulations will be issued within a year to specify eligible practices, compensation rates, and guidelines for entering into contracts. The program sets aside at least 35% of funds for incentives and forest carbon monitoring to enhance environmental benefits under climate mitigation contracts with landowners. The program allocates funds for compensating owners for avoided deforestation agreements, incentivizing additional management activities, and monitoring carbon gains. The program allocates funds for compensating owners for avoided deforestation agreements, incentivizing management activities, and monitoring compliance with climate mitigation contracts, including reporting on annual and cumulative reductions achieved. The program allocates funds for compensating owners for avoided deforestation agreements, incentivizing management activities, and monitoring compliance with climate mitigation contracts. Reports on program results and adjustments are made available to the public through the Department of Agriculture website. The Secretary adjusts eligible practices and compensation rates every 2 years based on monitoring and reporting results. Authorization of appropriations is provided as necessary."
