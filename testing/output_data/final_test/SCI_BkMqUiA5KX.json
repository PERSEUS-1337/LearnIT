    "content": "Powerful generative models in Natural Language Modelling are often trained by maximizing a variational lower bound on data log likelihood. An alternative approach to latent variable modeling involves tying a stochastic autoencoder with a variational autoencoder to encourage perfect reconstruction and capture information in the latent variable. This model, while different from a VAE, achieves the same lower bound with the addition of a simple pre-factor, providing a formal interpretation of commonly used training pre-factors in VAEs. Latent variable models, like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are widely used in machine learning and statistics for generating new data and providing insight into low dimensional representations. These models have been successfully applied in natural language modelling tasks with varied architectures for both the encoder and decoder. A VAE approach to language modeling involves a generative model of sentence x based on latent variable z. The model maximizes the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) on the log likelihood by parameterizing both the generative model (decoder) and variational distribution (encoder) using LSTM recurrent neural networks. The autoregressive generative model q(z|x) is parameterized using an LSTM recurrent neural network. The model achieves maximum ELBO without significant use of the latent variable, relying mainly on the decoder. The KL term in the objective function converges to zero, indicating trivial convergence of the approximate posterior distribution to its prior. The relationship between latent variables and decoder capacity is a common phenomenon. The KL term in the ELBO is prevented from going to zero by using KL annealing, which allows the model to utilize its latent variable to some extent. This approach ensures that the model does not ignore the latent entirely while maintaining a high capacity decoder. A new generative latent-variable model inspired by autoencoders is proposed to leverage latent variables effectively in language modeling. Autoencoders in framework BID6 BID5 reconstruct data through a low-dimensional bottleneck layer, creating a dimensionally-reduced representation. This overcomes issues faced by VAEs where the latent variable is ignored. A 'stochastic autoencoder' (SAE) maximizes the likelihood of reconstruction to encourage high-fidelity results. Training such a model can be challenging. The text discusses the challenges of training a Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model. The proposed approach aims to maximize the likelihood of both SAE and VAE under certain assumptions, combining the strengths of both models for generation and reconstruction tasks. This approach differs from traditional VAE training methods and represents a new model combining elements of both SAEs and VAEs. The text discusses the relationship between VAEs and SAEs in the AutoGen model, assuming equal generative and reconstruction models with a shared prior. This allows for generation from the prior and high-fidelity reconstructions, specifying a single probability model. The AutoGen model assumes equal generative and reconstruction models with a shared prior, allowing for generation from the prior and high-fidelity reconstructions. The AutoGen objective is not a lower bound on the VAE. The AutoGen objective in training a generative model balances spontaneous generation and high-fidelity reconstruction. It does not dictate how latent variables encode information but requires them to represent the data well for reconstruction. This approach can be extended to maximize log likelihoods of multiple tied reconstructions. In training generative models, the AutoGen objective balances generation and reconstruction quality. Multiple tied reconstructions can be optimized for higher likelihoods. Four language models were trained using LSTM networks, including VAE variants with different objectives. Data from the BookCorpus dataset was used, with sentences limited to 5-30 words and a vocabulary of 20,000 words. Training data was split into 90% for training and 10% for testing. The training process involved splitting data into 90% for training and 10% for testing, resulting in 58.8 million training sentences and 6.5 million test sentences. Models were trained without KL annealing, using word drop and AutoGen for a million iterations with specific network configurations. The objective functions varied among the models, making direct comparisons meaningless. In the training process, models were trained without KL annealing, using word drop and AutoGen for a million iterations with specific network configurations. The objective functions differ between the four models, making direct comparisons meaningless. Despite AutoGen having a larger pre-factor, the KL term becomes more significant for AutoGen with m = 1 and m = 2 compared to VAE, suggesting less emphasis on matching the prior p(z). Comparing the VAE ELBO of the four models during training shows that it is a tight lower bound on the log likelihood only for VAE. The AutoGen model, when compared to the VAE, shows a similar ELBO, indicating it is maximizing the log likelihood. The baseline AutoGen tracks the VAE well, while the more aggressive AutoGen with m = 2 has a decreasing ELBO. This suggests that the baseline AutoGen can provide decent reconstructions without compromising generation from the prior, unlike AutoGen (m = 2) which may struggle to generate well. The VAE and AutoGen models are compared in terms of their ability to generate sentences. The reconstructed sentences from the VAE and AutoGen are analyzed, showing that the baseline AutoGen can provide decent reconstructions without compromising generation from the prior, unlike the more aggressive AutoGen with m = 2. AutoGen outperforms the VAE in reconstructing sentences, showing better qualitative results. The study compares reconstructions from both models, with AutoGen generating more accurate sentences even when not reconstructed verbatim. AutoGen outperforms the VAE in reconstructing sentences by generating coherent sentences with similar meanings using semantically similar words. The VAE reconstructions often produce sentences unrelated to the input without annealing. A survey comparing reconstructions from both models showed that AutoGen's reconstructions were judged better by respondents. AutoGen outperforms the VAE in reconstructing sentences by generating coherent sentences with similar meanings using semantically similar words. A survey comparing reconstructions from both models showed that AutoGen's reconstructions were judged better by respondents. The survey results are shown in TAB0, with AutoGen (m = 2) outperforming. The survey results in TAB0 show that AutoGen with m = 2 outperforms AutoGen with m = 1, VAE with annealing, and VAE in generating coherent sentences. Results have over 99% confidence. AutoGen prioritizes higher-fidelity reconstructions over sentence generation from its prior. A comparison of samples from VAE and AutoGen's prior shows no qualitative difference. A survey of 23 people was conducted to further evaluate the models. The survey of 23 people evaluated sentences generated by different models, including AutoGen and VAE. Results showed that VAE produced shorter sentences, which were more likely to be meaningful. The survey results are presented in Table 4, with sentences categorized as short or long based on their length. The VAE with annealing outperforms AutoGen in generating short sentences, while both models perform equally well on longer sentences. AutoGen (m = 2) shows significantly worse results in a blind survey testing generation quality. The interpolation from z1 to z2 was not cherry-picked and showed smoother results for AutoGen (m=1) compared to VAE with annealing. The reconstructions of a linear interpolation between two encoded sentences were qualitatively smoother for AutoGen, with fewer instances of reconstructing the same sentences. The reconstructions from the VAE without annealing and AutoGen (m = 2) show non-smooth interpolations with little similarity between subsequent sentences. Results for these models have been omitted, and only a single sample interpolation is provided. Smoothness is expected in AutoGen due to its theoretical construction and previous robust results. The sample shown aligns with expectations but is not considered a definitive empirical result. AutoGen successfully improves the fidelity of reconstructions from the latent space. AutoGen improves reconstruction fidelity from latent variables compared to VAEs by explicitly modeling data generation and high-fidelity reconstruction. Other approaches focus on managing representation structure, such as disentanglement. An example is restricting decoding to local information in images to allow latents to describe global information. AutoGen improves reconstruction fidelity by explicitly modeling data generation and high-fidelity reconstruction, while other approaches focus on managing representation structure like disentanglement. Comparing to BID4, where a factor of \u03b2 is introduced to improve disentanglement in latent representations, AutoGen's m represents the number of times high-fidelity reconstruction is demanded, making \u03b2-VAE with \u03b2 > 1 equivalent to demanding a higher level of reconstruction. AutoGen introduces a parameter m to improve reconstruction fidelity, while \u03b2-VAE with \u03b2 > 1 focuses on disentanglement. The authors in BID4 discuss how \u03b2-VAE trades off more disentangled representations for lower-fidelity reconstructions. In contrast, AutoGen aims to trade off higher-fidelity reconstructions for slightly inferior generation from the prior. The parameter m can be tuned for specific tasks, with smaller values improving generation from the prior and larger values improving reconstruction quality. AutoGen introduces a parameter m to improve reconstruction fidelity, with smaller m improving generation from the prior and larger m improving reconstruction quality. Tuning m allows for demanding exact reconstructions from the latent, and KL annealing involves smoothly reducing m during training to optimize the AutoGen lower bound. Autogen can be adapted for multimodal generation by requiring a larger number of reconstructions for one data modality than the other. AutoGen is a novel approach in generative modeling that combines high-fidelity reconstructions via a stochastic autoencoder with a VAE. It introduces a parameter m to improve reconstruction quality, with smaller m enhancing generation from the prior and larger m improving reconstruction fidelity. AutoGen can be adapted for multimodal generation by requiring a larger number of reconstructions for one data modality than the other."
