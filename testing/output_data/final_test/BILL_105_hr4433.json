    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trading With the Communist Chinese Military Act of 1998\". It includes findings and policy statements. The Congress finds that the People's Liberation Army of China is responsible for repression, including the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the occupation of Tibet since 1950. They also control the People's Armed Police to suppress protests. The People's Liberation Army is modernizing its military capabilities through owning companies and factories that support military activities. These companies export various products to the United States and seek investment in joint ventures with US companies. The People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police have established 23 companies in the United States over the past decade. American consumers unknowingly purchase products from these companies, inadvertently supporting the operations of the Chinese military. The Chinese government, with the assistance of the military, continues to violate human rights. The United States aims to prohibit entities owned or controlled by the Chinese military from operating in the country or conducting business with US individuals. This is in response to the Chinese government's violations of human rights, including persecuting religious practices and restricting trade unions. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF COMMUNIST CHINESE MILITARY COMPANIES. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other key officials, must compile and publish a list of Communist Chinese military companies operating in the US or its territories within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Updates to the list must be made every 6 months based on the latest information available. The term \"Communist Chinese military company\" refers to entities engaged in commercial activities owned or controlled by the People's Liberation Army of China or the People's Armed Police of China. This includes entities listed in specific Defense Intelligence Agency publications, with updates required every six months. The agency must update the report every 6 months to identify Communist Chinese military companies, starting 90 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS. Prohibitions include restrictions on individuals serving in positions within businesses owned by Communist Chinese military companies, mandatory divestiture of such businesses, prohibition of importing goods from these companies, and restrictions on contracts and loans involving them. It is prohibited for individuals to provide loans or acquire ownership in Communist Chinese military companies. Exporting items on the United States Munitions List to these companies is also unlawful, with exceptions for humanitarian items like food and medicine. The President will issue regulations to enforce the Act. Penalties for violating the Act include fines up to $100,000 or imprisonment up to 1 year for the first offense, and fines up to $1,000,000 or imprisonment up to 4 years for subsequent offenses. The Act defines the \"People's Liberation Army\" as the military services of the Communist Government of China, and the \"People's Armed Police\" as the paramilitary service of the same government."
