    "content": "Israeli electoral outcomes for Congress and U.S. policymakers could impact U.S.-Israel relations, decisions on Iran's nuclear program, and overall U.S. policy in the Middle East. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is a key figure in this context. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called for early elections in 2013, with polls predicting his re-election. His Likud party is paired with Yisrael Beiteinu, but a drop in support followed Avigdor Lieberman's resignation due to indictment. This could impact Israeli electoral outcomes and U.S.-Israel relations. Netanyahu's dependence on small right-of-center or ultra-Orthodox parties may increase with the Likud/Yisrael Beiteinu list. Renewed mandate theories vary, with potential influences from coalition partners and a rightward shift within Likud. Challenges include the Iranian nuclear issue, budgetary concerns, and the Palestinian situation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In light of security measures protecting civilians from Palestinian terrorism, Israel's voting public shows little eagerness to change the governing status quo. Netanyahu's opponents have struggled to form a viable political alternative, with potential leaders including Shelly Yachimovich, Tzipi Livni, and Yair Lapid. Support has shifted away from Kadima, the largest party in the Knesset in recent years. Netanyahu's consistent polling advantage over possible rivals has led to posturing among Yachimovich, Livni, and Lapid to avoid a Netanyahu-led coalition. Criticisms vary, with Livni focusing on Palestinian issues, Yachimovich and Lapid on socioeconomic policies. Challenges to the governing status quo are uncertain due to disagreements over political tactics. The status quo is shaped by disagreements over political tactics among key players like Yachimovich, Lapid, and Livni. Lapid demands joint negotiations with Netanyahu, while Livni wants a centrist candidate for premiership. Ha'bayit Ha'yehudi/National Union may impact Likud Beiteinu's vote share by appealing to settlement supporters. Israeli electoral and coalition-building processes are complex. The Israeli electoral system allows for smaller parties to have significant influence in coalition-building due to a low entry threshold. Recent elections have seen a shift towards issues like the Iranian nuclear crisis and political changes in the Arab world, challenging the traditional focus on Palestinian matters in Israeli politics. This has raised doubts about the feasibility of peace through territorial compromise. Many in Israel question the possibility of peace through territorial compromise due to regional and international changes. Skeptics argue that Iran's support for militias and instability in neighboring countries have undermined the land-for-peace formula proposed in 1967. Despite this, some Israeli elites still advocate for a mutually acceptable arrangement. Center-left concerns in Israel focus on the lack of a durable arrangement with Palestinians, which they believe undermines Israel's long-term security and international legitimacy as a Jewish-majority, democratic state. They warn that renewed conflict or instability in the West Bank and Jerusalem could worsen Israel's regional security and increase its international isolation. Netanyahu's government was formed to support his leadership on security issues, leading him to be hesitant to act against his coalition partners' interests. Changing demographics in Israel are influencing the political landscape, with a shift towards nationalism and right-of-center policies. The current Jewish population is more nationalistic and hawkish on foreign policy than in previous generations. This trend is partly attributed to the increasing share of the population leaning towards these ideologies. The traditional support of Mizrahi Jews for nationalistic parties like Likud has been strengthened by alliances with Russian-speaking immigrants and Haredim. Arab parties are also present in the Knesset, but Israeli leaders prefer coalitions with Jewish parties due to perceived differences in ideology. The long-term impact of Israel's political evolution on internal cohesion and international relations remains uncertain. Criticism of Netanyahu's government by some U.S. and international observers has been intense, especially regarding settlement expansion. Some question Israel's political tradition of secular, pluralist Zionism. Netanyahu has spoken against discrimination, but some critics fear a potential illiberal turn. Critics from the Jewish-American community argue that international actors overlook Israel's security challenges and Netanyahu's efforts to control settlement construction. Key questions have emerged ahead of the 2013 Israeli elections, impacting voting results and the new government's composition, potentially affecting future policies and relations with the United States. Speculation arose following Avigdor Lieberman's resignation due to impending indictment. Since mid-December, Israeli media has been speculating about the impact of recent events on the upcoming election and a potential Netanyahu-led government. Reports suggest Netanyahu merged with Likud/Yisrael Beiteinu to secure his position as prime minister, while Lieberman aimed for the same role. However, recent polls show a decrease in voter support for \"Likud Beiteinu,\" possibly weakening Netanyahu's coalition-building and governing leverage. Lieberman's troubles also play a role in the election dynamics. Lieberman's troubles and uncertainty may contribute to a decline in popularity for Likud Beiteinu. Concerns among core constituencies could dilute their relative power within the joint list. Some right-of-center voters may feel supporting smaller parties won't harm Likud Beiteinu's coalition prospects. Netanyahu's leadership may protect Yisrael Beiteinu from uncertainty following Lieberman's indictment. If Lieberman can't serve as a minister in the next government, Netanyahu may have more flexibility in offering positions. If Lieberman is unable to serve as a minister in the next government, Netanyahu may have more flexibility in offering prestigious ministerial positions to potential coalition partners. Lieberman's absence could be welcomed by some due to his negative reputation among U.S. and other Western officials, but it may not reverse broader Israeli political trends and security concerns. Netanyahu might temporarily act as caretaker of a ministry until Lieberman's case is resolved, or appoint someone else willing to do so. Several regional and international issues could influence Israeli electoral outcomes, including Iran's nuclear program, conflict in neighboring Arab states, and the aftermath of a 2012 conflict with Palestinian militants in Gaza. Jewish settlements in Palestinian-populated areas may also sway voters, especially those choosing between right-of-center parties, as these issues are closely tied to Israeli national identity and daily life. The Netanyahu government's settlement plans and construction announcements in late 2012 have sparked strong condemnation from the United States and Western European countries. This backlash is seen as a response to the UN General Assembly's decision to upgrade Palestine's status to a \"non-member state.\" European Union member states have suggested they may take further action against Israeli settlements if policies do not change. The vociferous opposition to settlements is substantively curbing European political and economic cooperation with Israel. Netanyahu's critics blame him for distancing Israel from President Obama and eroding worldwide goodwill. Likud Beiteinu's drop in support coincides with increased backing for the pro-settler Ha'bayit Ha'yehudi/National Union party. A Palestinian Authority budget crisis has led to protests in the West Bank, potentially causing instability before the elections. The Israeli government's withholding of tax revenue from the PA has led to delays in paying salaries, causing potential political blowback for Netanyahu and Likud Beiteinu. The upcoming government will face challenges in addressing various issues while maintaining coalition support. Netanyahu's coalition choices will be crucial, with traditional partnerships possibly shifting depending on priorities such as addressing Iran. The composition of a new Netanyahu coalition and government could significantly depend on various issues such as addressing Iran, the Palestinians, settlements, and socioeconomic questions. Netanyahu's response to Naftali Bennett's comments on refusing orders regarding evacuating a Jewish settlement has caused political implications, with other parties trying to leverage the situation for their benefit. Polls show a rise in support for Ha'bayit Ha'yehudi and a decline in support for Likud Beiteinu. The composition of a new Netanyahu coalition and government could significantly influence Israel's politics and foreign relations, including with the United States. Enlisting coalition partners from different political spectrums may help Netanyahu gain Western support and domestic approval. However, center-left ministers in the coalition could hinder efforts to overcome opposition within Israel's security establishment and potential unilateral military action against Iranian nuclear facilities. In late December, Netanyahu dismissed rumors of appointing Livni to a ministerial position for Palestinian issues. The composition of his cabinet, including moderate figures like Meridor, Begin, Dichter, and Eitan, could impact U.S.-Israel relations. Likud's primary elections favored nationalists over these moderates, potentially shaping the new coalition. Binyamin Netanyahu's leadership in forming a new coalition government in Israel is influenced by domestic and international factors, including the challenge of Iran's nuclear program. Other concerns include threats at Israel's borders, Palestinian instability, and relations with neighboring countries like Egypt and Syria. Netanyahu's choices of coalition partners and ministers reflect his priorities and constraints in policy initiatives, providing insight for U.S. policymakers to assess U.S.-Israel relations and options in the Middle East."
