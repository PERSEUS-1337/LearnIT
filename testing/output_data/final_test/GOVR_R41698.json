    "content": "The House passed H.R. 1, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, which included funding levels for various federal departments and agencies. The Senate did not pass the bill, leading to funding uncertainties for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other accounts. The House-passed bill, H.R. 1, included funding modifications and restrictions for EPA accounts and program activities. Several EPA regulatory actions were debated but omitted from the Senate substitute amendment. This report highlights provisions affecting EPA programs and funding levels specified in H.R. 1. The report includes excerpts of the bill language related to EPA programs in H.R. 1. Funding for EPA was provided through interim CRs until the enactment of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. Continuing Appropriations Amendments, 2011 extended funding for federal departments and agencies until April 15, 2011, under P.L. 112-8. EPA's appropriations have been allocated within eight statutory accounts since FY1996. During a CR, EPA must adjust program activities based on FY2010 funding levels. The Continuing Appropriations Amendments, 2011 extended funding for federal departments and agencies until April 15, 2011, under P.L. 112-8. EPA's appropriations have been allocated within eight statutory accounts since FY1996. During a CR, EPA must adjust program activities based on FY2010 funding levels, with incremental funding affecting programs differently based on various factors. CRs generally extend appropriations at prior year levels, with specific funding adjustments for certain accounts or activities. Title VII of Division B in H.R. 1 specified funding levels for certain EPA accounts for the full fiscal year, along with provisions restricting the use of funds for certain regulatory activities. The House-passed H.R. 1 included provisions relevant to EPA's regulatory actions on environmental pollution control statutes. The Senate substitute amendment (S.Amdt. 149) proposed different funding levels and omitted House provisions related to EPA activities. The House-passed H.R. 1 and Senate substitute amendment (S.Amdt. 149) proposed different funding levels for EPA appropriations compared to FY2011 and FY2010 enacted amounts. FY2011 funding was specified for only some EPA accounts in the House-passed CR and Senate amendment. The remaining accounts would have been funded at FY2010 levels unless affected by general provisions. Funding in the proposals is compared to FY2011 and FY2010 enacted appropriations. The House-passed H.R. 1 and Senate substitute amendment (S.Amdt. 149) proposed different funding levels for EPA appropriations compared to FY2011 and FY2010 enacted amounts. The overview of funding levels is followed by tables presenting excerpts of provisions in H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149 for selected EPA programs. Funding in the proposals is compared to FY2011 and FY2010 enacted appropriations. The House-passed H.R. 1 and Senate amendment (S.Amdt. 149) proposed different funding levels for EPA appropriations in FY2011. Table 1 compares the FY2010 enacted amounts with the FY2011 requested levels for selected EPA accounts. Only five of the eight EPA appropriations accounts were specified in H.R. 1, with S.Amdt. 149 providing funding for each of these accounts except for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Program. Funding levels for three accounts were not expressly specified in the appropriations bill. The FY2011 appropriations and two proposals specified funding levels for EPA accounts. Funding for accounts not specified in the act were funded at FY2010 levels. House-passed H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149 generally provided FY2011 funding at FY2010 enacted levels. Table 1 shows the comparison of FY2011 funding for these accounts. The Appendix presents EPA appropriations for FY2008-FY2011, including rescissions. Various legislation proposed rescissions from unobligated balances in the STAG account. EPA has implemented regulations for pollution control statutes in the past two years. Many stakeholders and Members of Congress are concerned about the EPA potentially overstepping its authority and not fully considering the costs and economic impacts of proposed rules. The agency argues that its actions are in line with statutory mandates and court rulings. Recent focus has been on EPA controls for greenhouse gas emissions and addressing pollutants from various industries under the Clean Air Act. Actions under the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act have also been debated. The House-passed H.R. 1 included provisions restricting EPA regulatory actions related to air quality, climate change, water quality, and waste management. These provisions were categorized under Title VII of Division B and Division D. Related provisions under other agencies were listed separately. The tables provide information on EPA's appropriations since FY1996, including amounts enacted and the President's request for FY2011 compared to previous fiscal years. Details include transfers of funds between accounts and funding levels for specific program areas. Data is based on reports accompanying annual appropriations bills."
