    "content": "On March 16, Crimea held a referendum on joining Russia, with 96.77% approval and a turnout of 83.1%. The annexation was condemned by Ukraine, the US, EU, and others as illegal. President Putin signed a treaty on March 18 to incorporate Crimea into Russia, sparking further criticism. The Russian takeover had been bloodless until March 18 when one Ukrainian soldier was killed during a base storming in Simferopol. On March 24, Ukraine announced the withdrawal of its military personnel from Crimea due to threats from Russian forces. Russian Defense Minister confirmed control over military installations in Crimea and the departure of loyal Ukrainian troops. Sanctions were imposed on Russian and Crimean officials, with expanded sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy. On March 18, 2014, President Putin signed a treaty annexing Crimea to Russia, presenting it to the Russian Federal Assembly for ratification. He emphasized Russian domination over Ukraine and the unity of Russian and Ukrainian people. President Putin asserted that Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia and accused Ukrainian nationalists of resorting to terror, murder, and riots in early 2014. He claimed that Russia allowed Crimeans to freely vote on their future, citing their right to self-determination similar to that of Ukraine in 1991. Putin also argued that if Kosovo Albanians were encouraged to claim independence, then Russians, Ukrainians, and Crimean Tatars could do the same. President Putin criticized the U.S. and Western countries for their history of abuses against Russia, citing the orchestration of a coup in Ukraine as a breaking point. He accused the U.S. of disregarding international law and acting unilaterally, forcing its will on other countries. Putin also condemned the U.S. for supporting \"color revolutions\" that impose foreign standards on other nations. Putin criticized Western countries for imposing foreign standards on other nations, leading to chaos and violence. He claimed Russia had to act to prevent NATO from taking over Crimea and protecting Russian-speakers. The annexation of Crimea was almost unanimously approved by the State Duma and Federation Council, with Putin signing the bill into law. On March 27, 2014, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity and terming the Crimea referendum illegitimate. Russia's U.N. ambassador argued for Crimea's self-determination, with Armenia and Belarus voting against the resolution. In late March 2014, President Obama expressed concern about the build-up of Russian forces on Ukrainian's borders and called for their pullback. Russia remains a nuclear superpower with a major impact on U.S. national security interests in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. U.S.-Russia relations have faced severe challenges posed by Russian foreign behavior. Russia, a potentially important trading partner, has a greater range of natural resources than the United States, including oil and gas reserves. It is the world's second-largest producer and exporter of oil and the largest exporter of natural gas. Russia has a well-educated labor force and scientific establishment, with needs in areas where the United States is competitive. It is a multi-ethnic state with a complex federal structure inherited from the Soviet period. Russia has a complex federal structure inherited from the Soviet period, with regions, republics, and territories. Under Boris Yeltsin, many regions gained autonomy, but President Putin strengthened central government control. The ethnic Russian population is expected to decline, leading to changes in domestic and foreign policies influenced by minority groups. The Russian Constitution combines elements of various systems with a strong presidency. The president can dissolve the legislature and appoint a prime minister, who heads the government. The bicameral legislature is called the Federal Assembly, with the State Duma being the more powerful chamber. The State Duma, the more powerful chamber of the Federal Assembly, has 450 seats filled through party list elections with a 7% threshold. The Federation Council, the upper chamber, has 166 seats, with two representatives from each of the 83 regions and republics of Russia. Constitutional amendments in 2008 extended the presidential term to six years and the term of State Duma deputies to five years. The judiciary in Russia is considered the least developed branch, with some Soviet-era practices still in place. The judiciary in Russia is perceived to be subject to political manipulation and control, with jury tampering by prosecutors and defendants being a persistent issue. The Supreme Court is the highest appellate body, while the Constitutional Court rules on governmental acts and disputes. Putin proposed to abolish the Arbitration Court in 2013, which some viewed as a move to increase government control over the judiciary. Former President Boris Yeltsin's surprise. Former President Boris Yeltsin's resignation in 1999 allowed Vladimir Putin to become acting president and later elected in 2000. Putin focused on strengthening the central government, restoring Russia's power, and controlling the media. The Putin era in Russia saw a crackdown on media, with Russian radio stations ceasing to broadcast programs from Voice of America and Radio Liberty. Journalists critical of the government faced imprisonment, attacks, and even killings. A significant event was the 2003 arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, head of Yukos, for criticizing Putin and supporting opposition parties. Khodorkovsky was later convicted of tax evasion and fraud, sentenced to eight years in prison, and Yukos was dismantled. In December 2010, Khodorkovsky was found guilty in a new trial on charges of embezzlement, theft, and money-laundering, leading to additional years in prison. The conviction was alleged to be influenced by higher authorities, with the Russian Supreme Court upholding the sentence on appeal in late May 2011. However, the Moscow City Court slightly reduced the sentence in December 2012. In December 2010, Khodorkovsky was found guilty of embezzlement, theft, and money-laundering, leading to additional years in prison. The Moscow City Court slightly reduced the sentence in December 2012. In August 2013, the Supreme Court upheld the sentence but reduced it by two months, with Khodorkovsky's release set for August 2014. President Putin commuted his sentence on humanitarian grounds in December 2013. Another significant event was the 2004 terrorist attack in Beslan, North Ossetia, which led to political changes by Putin to strengthen his centralized control over the political system. President Putin implemented measures to consolidate his power, including appointing regional governors and republic heads instead of popular elections, and requiring all Duma Deputies to be elected from national party lists. This made governors dependent on the federal president and eliminated independent deputies, strengthening pro-presidential parties. Putin also signed a law regulating NGOs, criticized for giving the government power to shut down politically troublesome organizations. After the 2007 Duma election, where United Russia Party won, Putin endorsed Dmitry Medvedev as his successor. President Putin endorsed Dmitry Medvedev as his successor for president, ensuring political continuity. Medvedev won the 2008 election with 70% of the vote, amidst manipulation of election laws. Despite hopes for more democracy, Medvedev's presidency largely continued Putin's political system. In late 2008, President Medvedev implemented political changes, including extending presidential and State Duma terms, reducing voting hurdles for party representation, and granting more rights to small political parties. In 2016, the representation in the State Duma was reduced from 7% to 5%, marking a supposed advancement in democratization. Putin announced his candidacy for the 2012 presidential election, with Medvedev endorsing him and potentially becoming prime minister if Putin won. Analysts questioned the legitimacy of Putin's return to the presidency due to potential violations of the constitution. Critics warn that Putin may violate the constitution by seeking two more terms as president until 2024, surpassing Brezhnev's 18-year rule. Concerns arise as United Russia Party loses popular support before the 2011 State Duma election. Russian authorities were accused of using illicit means to retain a majority in the ruling party during the election. OSCE observers noted government manipulation, biased electoral commissions, and protests against the flawed election in Moscow and St. Petersburg. On December 10, a large authorized rally in central Moscow saw about 5,000 protesters demanding fair elections and the release of political prisoners. Boris Nemtsov presented a list of demands, including new Duma elections and the registration of banned parties. Some protesters chanted \"Russia without Putin.\" Local authorities approved the demonstration, and police showed restraint. Another significant protest by the \"For Fair Elections\" group took place on December 24, 2011. In response to December opposition protests, authorities quickly organized counter-demonstrations with state workers and patriots. On February 4, 2012, the \"For Fair Elections\" group held peaceful protests in Moscow and other cities, calling for the inclusion of disqualified candidate Grigory Yavlinsky in the presidential election, release of \"political prisoners,\" and legal reforms. A counter-demonstration labeled \"Anti-Orange Protest\" was organized in Moscow by pro-Kremlin parties and groups. Moscow police estimated 138,000-150,000 individuals joined a protest led by Dmitry Rogozin's ultranationalist group. Counter-protesters accused \"For Fair Election\" demonstrators of wanting to destroy Russia and claimed the US was behind regime change. President Medvedev proposed democratic reforms in response to the 2011 protests, including amendments to the law on political parties allowing new party registration with 500 signatures. However, strict reporting requirements on party activities and finances remained in place. The number of registered parties in Russia increased from seven to 63 by the end of 2013. A law signed on May 2, 2012, eliminated the need for political parties not represented in the Duma to gather signatures for elections. This law also reduced the number of signatures required for parties to field presidential candidates. Another law reestablished gubernatorial elections with a hybrid direct and indirect electoral procedure. The president or municipal legislators may nominate candidates and remove governors. New conditions were placed on the election of mayors of regional capitals. Five candidates registered for the 2012 presidential election, including Putin and candidates nominated by parties with seats in the Duma. Opposition Yabloko Party head Grigory Yavlinsky was disqualified for invalid signatures. In the 2012 presidential election, Putin won with 63.6% of the votes, facing criticism for media advantage and irregularities in vote-counting. Prokhorov was eliminated as a potential opposition candidate due to invalid signatures. In the aftermath of Putin's 2012 election win, protests organized by opposition politicians in Moscow turned violent, with reports of police and protesters being injured and hundreds detained. Regional authorities allegedly tried to prevent dissidents from traveling to the demonstration. About 100 police and protesters were injured, with hundreds detained, including Navalny, Nemtsov, and Udaltsov. 18 individuals faced serious charges for inciting violence during the May 6 protests. Security measures were heightened for Putin's presidential inauguration on May 7, 2012, following the Bolotnaya Square protest. The public was forced to watch the event on television as the motorcade passed through a heavily secured, empty Moscow. After his presidential inauguration, Putin issued decrees to implement campaign pledges, including healthcare and education improvements, financial aid for families with multiple children, increased pay for government workers, and housing services improvements. He also called for reforms to increase birth rates, decrease death rates, formulate a new foreign policy concept, and increase defense spending. Putin stepped down as the leader of the United Russia Party, recommending Medvedev as his successor. In late May 2012, Putin recommended Medvedev for the chairmanship at a United Russia Party congress, citing the role of the head of government in overseeing legislative efforts. After Putin's return to the presidency, repressive laws were passed that seemed to reverse democratization and human rights initiatives from Medvedev's presidency. These laws included increased fines for public order violations and unapproved demonstrations, as well as requiring NGOs receiving foreign grants to register as \"foreign agents.\" In 2012, NGOs faced closure for not registering under a new law, with fines of up to $16,000 imposed. Nearly 7,000 NGOs were inspected. Putin approved a law restoring defamation as a civil offense with fines up to $155,000. Another law aimed to protect children from harmful Internet content. Critics saw these laws as suppressing media reporting and citizen complaints about official misconduct. In 2012, Putin signed laws targeting child pornography, drug advocacy, and hate speech online. A blacklist of Internet sites was created, raising concerns about website blocking. A law broadened the definition of treason to include divulging state secrets. The EU expressed worries about the legislation limiting civil society development. Putin later signed a law allowing regions to rescind direct control. In early April 2013, Putin signed a law allowing regions/republics to remove direct gubernatorial elections. Parties in regional legislatures can propose candidates, narrowed down by the president to three, with one selected by the legislature. The Russian government claimed it was to protect minority rights in ethnically diverse regions, but critics believed it was to limit electoral competition. Another reason could be to appoint more compliant governors before the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. In December 2013, Aleksandr Khloponin called for North Caucasus republics to avoid direct elections of their heads. In June 2013, Putin signed a law imposing fines for promoting \"non-traditional sexual relations,\" targeting homosexuality. The law prohibits propaganda on such relationships and allows for the arrest and deportation of foreigners engaging in them. The law in Russia imposes fines for promoting \"non-traditional sexual relations\" and allows for the arrest and deportation of foreigners engaging in them. Concerns have been raised about LGBT individuals and organizations being banned from the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The US State Department and Congress have called on Russia to protect the human rights of all people attending the Olympics. Eleven Senators also raised concerns to the International Olympics Committee about the law violating the Olympic Charter. President Putin signed laws in 2013 aimed at restricting LGBT rights in Russia, including penalties for offending religious practitioners and banning same-sex couples from adopting. He also proposed changes to the election process for the Federation Council to involve regional voters. The 2013 laws signed by President Putin restricted LGBT rights in Russia and changed the election process for the Federation Council to involve regional voters. The new process allowed governors to select three possible senators for the ballot, with one being designated as the regional senator. Critics argued that this indirect method of choosing senators was problematic. In October 2012, gubernatorial elections were held for the first time since 2004, with concerns raised about the lack of improvements in candidate registration and voting procedures. The selection of candidates was reportedly controlled by the ruling United Russia party, leading to the reelection of incumbent governors. In mid-June 2013, Putin took over the leadership of the Popular Front, a civic group composed of officials, United Russia Party members, and pro-Putin parties and NGOs. The organization aimed to empower Russians to create a \"Great\" society. The organization aimed to create a \"Great Russia,\" a modern country with traditional values. Speculation suggests the Popular Front may become a new political party. Local elections in Russia in 2013 saw United Russia Party's control over the process, except in Ingushetia and Dagestan. The Civil Platform Party head called for the abolition of the \"municipal filter\" in regional legislative assemblies. Golos, a civic organization, monitored the September 2013 elections and found electoral processes increasingly problematic, with fairer elections in Moscow and Yekaterinburg. The death of Sergey Magnitsky in November 2009 highlighted the failure of the rule of law in Russia, with evidence showing his arrest was unlawful and he was possibly tortured while in detention. The death of Sergey Magnitsky in November 2009 raised concerns about the rule of law in Russia. Officials were accused of ordering doctors not to treat him, leading to his death. Investigations concluded his death was due to negligence, but reports suggested he was beaten and denied medical treatment. Charges were filed against prison officials, but some were dropped. President Putin claimed Magnitsky died of a heart attack, sparking further controversy. The death of Sergey Magnitsky in November 2009 raised concerns about the rule of law in Russia. Officials were accused of ordering doctors not to treat him, leading to his death. Investigations concluded his death was due to negligence, but reports suggested he was beaten and denied medical treatment. Charges were filed against prison officials, but some were dropped. President Putin claimed Magnitsky died of a heart attack, sparking further controversy. The question arose whether Magnitsky was given timely aid. The prison medical official was acquitted on the grounds of accidental death with no negligence. The Constitutional Court upheld the resumption of criminal proceedings against Magnitsky, despite the family denying a formal request for the trial to resume. The Moscow Helsinki Committee condemned the trial of a dead man and persecution of the family as a degradation of Russian justice. Magnitsky was found guilty of tax evasion in July 2013, and the judge in the case was reportedly promoted later that year. H.R. 4405, S. 1039, and S. 3406 imposed sanctions on individuals involved in Sergei Magnitsky's detention, abuse, or death, as well as those responsible for tax fraud in Russia. Amendments were made to specify sanctions pertaining to Russia. The bills were ordered to be reported by their respective committees in 2012. The Finance Committee reported H.R. 6156, the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, which was approved by the House and Senate in late 2012 and signed into law as P.L. 112-208. The bill authorized normal trade relations treatment for Russia and Moldova. The State Department announced visa restrictions for Russian individuals responsible for Magnitsky's detention and death. A Russian human rights group listed over 300 individuals violating human rights, angering Russian officials. Foreign Minister Lavrov mentioned a Russian visa ban list including U.S. citizens linked to Guantanamo Bay, Bagram, and Abu Ghraib incidents. A bill was introduced in the Duma on December 10. A bill introduced in the Duma on December 10, 2012, aimed to bar U.S. citizens who violated Russian citizens' rights. The bill also included provisions to freeze assets, close NGOs funded by the U.S., and halt U.S. adoptions of Russian children. Named the \"Dima Yakovlev Act,\" it was signed into law by President Putin on December 28, 2012. The U.S. Treasury Department released the \"Magnitsky list\" on April 12, 2013, imposing visa bans and asset freezes on 18 Russians. The \"Magnitsky list\" contains names of 18 Russians facing visa bans and asset freezes due to their involvement in the death of Sergey Magnitsky or other human rights violations. The State Department also has a separate list of Russians linked to the Magnitsky case. Russia threatened a \"symmetrical response\" if the list is published. Moscow planned to release its own list of banned U.S. citizens. Senator Jim McGovern suggested listing 240 Russians tied to the Magnitsky case. On April 13, 2013, Russia released its own list of 18 U.S. citizens, including former Bush Administration officials and Guantanamo base commanders allegedly involved in torture. Some Americans on the list were denied visas. Foreign Minister Lavrov mentioned the Magnitsky Act as a point of contention in U.S.-Russia relations. An annual report submitted to Congress on December 20, 2013, did not add new names to the Magnitsky list. In 2013, the Administration did not add new names to the Magnitsky list of Russian officials subject to sanctions, but stated that cases were under evaluation. Senator Bob Corker called for an explanation for the lack of new names. President Putin endorsed the Dima Yakovlev legislation, criticizing U.S. treatment of Russian adoptees and calling the U.S.-Russia adoption treaty \"absurd.\" He referred to U.S. actions as undeserved provocations and slaps in the face. Foreign Minister Lavrov and Moscow Helsinki Group head criticized the Duma bill calling for the termination of the adoption treaty. Putin signed the bill into law in 2012, justifying the ban by citing U.S. culture as violent and Americans as prejudiced against Russian adoptees. The Foreign Ministry claimed that the U.S. has not ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. has not ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, citing American approval of spanking and incarcerating children. Russian authorities criticized the deaths of Russian children at the hands of American adopters, claiming it was just the \"tip of the iceberg.\" They also accused the U.S. judicial system of excusing murders of Russian adoptees due to ethnic prejudice. Lavrov justified the adoption ban by stating that Russian authorities believed the U.S. adoption system had low standards. The Russian Supreme Court clarified that local courts should allow finalized adoption cases to proceed, transferring children to their adoptive parents. The State Department urged the Russian government to allow completion of adoptions for U.S. families, especially in cases where prospective parents have met with orphans. In response to the Russian government's adoption ban, Members of Congress protested and urged Russia to reconsider its implications for U.S. parents and Russian orphans. The Senate approved S.Res. 628 expressing disapproval of the Russian Dima Yakovlev law and calling for adoptions in process to be permitted to proceed. Representative Michelle Bachmann introduced a similar bill in the 113th Congress. Representative Michelle Bachmann introduced S.Res. 628 in the 113th Congress, while Representative Christopher Smith introduced H.Res. 34 expressing sadness over the deaths of adopted Russian children in the US and urging Russia to allow adoptions to proceed. The Congressional Coalition on Adoption and Russian officials discussed concerns about the adoption ban. In April 2013, Russian and U.S. officials met to address concerns about Russian adoptees' well-being and unblocking adoption processes for around 259 cases. A working group was established to monitor Russian adoptees in the U.S. In May 2013, U.S. families proposed solutions to unfreeze adoptions, including increased Russian access to adopted children. Representative Dana Rohrabacher led a delegation to discuss blocked adoptions with Russian officials, and a letter signed by over 150 Members of Congress was sent regarding the issue. In June 2013, Russian Child Rights Ombudsman Pavel Astakhov visited the United States and reiterated that pipeline adoptions would not move forward. He refused to meet with concerned Members of Congress. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution calling for member states to honor adoptions in the pipeline, even if future adoptions are halted. In September 2013, reports surfaced about Internet \"re-homing\" websites in the U.S. The Russian Foreign Ministry requested the U.S. to investigate reports of illegal trafficking of Russian adoptees through \"re-homing\" websites. The Russian Investigations Committee launched a criminal case involving 26 Russian adoptees. The European Court for Human Rights asked for information on halted adoptions from U.S. families. Astakhov stated that Russia was not obligated to report to the ECHR. Astakhov claimed Russia had no obligation to report to the ECHR or U.S. Department of State on adoptees. He requested detailed information on U.S. families from the State Department. He mentioned that most U.S. families had not visited the adoptees in Russia. Astakhov stated that out of 259 children, all but 79 had been settled with Russian families. He criticized the State Department for not providing timely information on the adoptees in the U.S. In 2012, members of the \"Pussy Riot\" group were sentenced to prison for singing anti-Putin songs in a Russian church. President Putin justified the sentences, stating they were undermining morality. Two members were sent to Siberian work camps but later released. In 2013, activist Alexey Navalny was found guilty of stealing timber and sentenced to five years in prison. Despite concerns raised by President Putin, Navalny was released pending appeal and ran for Moscow mayor, coming in second. His sentence was suspended in October 2013, leading to his disbarment as a lawyer. The People's Alliance Party, led by Navalny, was not registered by the Justice Ministry. The People's Alliance Party, led by Navalny, was not registered by the Justice Ministry. Opposition activist Leonid Razvozzhayev was detained in Ukraine and charged with conspiracy to carry out mass disturbances. Sergey Udaltsov, leader of the Left Front coalition, was placed under house arrest for involvement in the Bolotnaya Square violence. Authorities claim increasing evidence of a conspiracy to overthrow the government in the Bolotnaya Square violence case. Case material for Udaltsov, Razvozzhayev, and other defendants was submitted for trial in May 2013. Putin demanded strict implementation of laws on NGOs receiving foreign funding, leading to inspections of several NGOs, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In early April 2013, President Putin defended inspections of NGOs in Russia, including prominent organizations like Golos and Memorial, despite concerns raised by Chancellor Merkel and the State Department. The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the inspections as a \"witch hunt\" and denounced plans to fund NGOs through third parties as interference in internal affairs. In April 2013, a Moscow court fined Golos about $12,000 for not registering as a foreign agent, leading to the suspension of its operations by the Justice Ministry. Out of 2,226 NGOs in Russia receiving foreign funding, 215 were labeled as \"foreign agents\" for their political activities, with 193 closing down as a result. President Putin announced $180 million in foreign funding over the past three years. 193 NGOs closed or stopped accepting foreign funding, while 22 still operated without registering as foreign agents. Concerns were raised about some NGOs belonging to the President's Human Rights Council. To address restrictions on foreign funding, federal funding for human rights NGOs was established, with grants totaling $6 million provided to 124 groups in December 2013. In December 2013, several human rights NGOs in Russia received grants, but some were required to register as \"foreign agents.\" The law was amended to allow surprise inspections of NGOs, leading to the suspension of activities for some organizations. Critics warned that the grants aimed to make NGOs dependent on the state. An official in the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner expressed concerns about the government's excessive control over NGOs. President Putin called for tightening the law on NGOs to prevent foreign influence, citing concerns about civil society groups being funded by foreign countries. Proposals included requiring institutes and universities receiving foreign funds to register as \"foreign agents\" if they spread \"dangerous ideas.\" Observers noted a crackdown on political opposition and human rights activists after the Sochi Olympics, with eight defendants in the Bolotnaya Square case sentenced to prison the day after the Games ended. A Moscow Court sentenced eight defendants in the Bolotnaya Square case to prison terms ranging from 2.5 to 4 years, with protests and detentions outside the courthouse. Aleksey Navalny was placed under indefinite house arrest. Outgoing U.S. Ambassador McFaul criticized the convictions as excessive. Razvozzhayev and Udaltsov are still in detention pending their trials. Media restrictions were reported after the Olympics and Russia's annexation of Crimea. The North Caucasus area of Russia experienced disorder after the Soviet Union's breakup in 1991, with Chechen separatism gaining traction. In the 1990s, Chechen separatism led to the breakup of the Chechen-Ingush Republic along ethnic lines. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin allowed regional autonomy, but Chechnya demanded independence. A bloody campaign in 1994-1996 resulted in thousands of casualties and displaced persons. Ceasefire accords in 1996 gave Chechnya self-rule, leading to increased organized crime and Islamic extremism. In 1999, Chechen terrorists bombed apartment buildings in Moscow and invaded Dagestan. Putin ordered military forces into Chechnya in response. Fighting continued for years, resulting in casualties and displaced persons. In 2005, Chechen rebel leader declared a Caucasus Front against Russia. Doku Umarov succeeded the previous leader and called for jihad to establish an Islamic Caucasus Emirate. Russia's pacification policy in Chechnya involves a pro-Moscow government and local security duties. Pro-Moscow Chechen clans, led by Ramzan Kadyrov, have aided Russia's success. Human rights abuses have been committed by police forces under Kadyrov's authority. In 2010, southern regions were divided into two districts, with a presidential envoy appointed for each. The North Caucasus Federal District was formed from more restive areas. The Federal District was formed from restive areas including Chechen, Dagestan, Ingush, Kabardino-Balkar, Karachay-Cherkess, and North Ossetia-Alania Republics and the Stavropol Kray. A Southern Federal District was formed from more stable areas including Astrakhan, Volgograd, and Rostov Regions, Adygea and Kalmykia Republics, and the Krasnodar Kray. The division allowed separate development plans for each district, driven in part by the selection of Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics. A North Caucasus Federal District development strategy was established in 2010, focusing on agriculture, tourism, energy, and industry. The North Caucasus Federal District development strategy aims to boost sectors like tourism, health resorts, energy, and light industry. It envisions a significant increase in wages and decrease in unemployment by 2025. Prime Minister Putin and later Prime Minister Medvedev emphasized the importance of economic development in the region. The government allocated $76 million for this purpose in late 2012. The government allocated $76 billion for economic and social development through 2025, with 90% of the funding from foreign and domestic investment. Terrorist attacks in the North Caucasus increased from 2007 to 2009 and decreased thereafter, with successful counter-terrorist efforts resulting in more killed or captured terrorists. The number of terrorist incidents in Russia fluctuated from 2008 to 2013, with 1,185 security personnel and 2,038 terrorists killed over the six-year period. In the period from 2008 to 2013, 1,185 security personnel and 2,038 terrorists were killed. Umarov's appeal in 2012 for his fighters to stop mass casualty attacks contributed to a decrease in terrorist incidents. However, in 2013, Umarov called for disrupting the Olympic Games in Sochi. There has been a shift in terrorist incidents, with fewer in Chechnya and more in Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Ingushetia, where Salafi Islam has gained influence, leading to clashes with security forces. In Dagestan, Salafists clash with security forces and traditional Sufi Islam practitioners. Terrorist violence in Dagestan accounted for over half of all North Caucasus terrorism in 2012. The situation remained serious in 2013, with the Russian military sending more troops. Recent incidents include an alleged plot to assassinate Putin and Medvedev, and two suicide car bombings in Makhachkala in May 2012. In Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, a large-scale attack plot for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was uncovered by Russian and Abkhazian security agents. Stashes of weapons were found in Abkhazia, with allegations of ties to Georgia's intelligence services. Tatarstan Mufti Ildus Faizov was injured by a car bomb on July 19, 2012. On July 19, 2012, Tatarstan Mufti Ildus Faizov was injured by a car bomb and his deputy Valiulla Yakupov was killed in Kazan. The \"Mujahadeen of Tatarstan\" claimed responsibility. Islamic fundamentalism has increased in Tatarstan. On August 28, 2012, Sufi scholar Sheikh Said-afandi al-Chirkavi and five others were killed by a suicide bomber in Dagestan. Extremist attacks were rising in some areas of Russia. In mid-January 2013, a Dagestani Supreme Court judge was killed by the Caucasus Emirate's Dagestani branch. The republic head was replaced in late January 2013 by Ramazan Abdulatipov. In February 2013, a suicide bomber killed four policemen in Khasavyurt, Dagestan. Another suicide bombing in May 2013 killed one policeman in Makhachkala. In October 2013, a female suicide bomber blew up a bus in Volgograd, resulting in seven deaths and over three dozen injuries. In December 2013, a series of bombings occurred in Volgograd, resulting in seven deaths and over three dozen injuries. The attacks were linked to the Dagestan jamaat, with speculation that they were aimed against the Sochi Olympics. The bomber's husband and others involved were killed by police in Dagestan. Additionally, a car bomb exploded in Pyatigorsk, killing three people, and six presumed terrorists were arrested in Kabardino-Balkariya. On December 29-30, 2013, two suicide bombings in Volgograd resulted in nearly three dozen deaths and over 100 injuries. A video released on January 18, 2014, showed the bombers claiming membership in Ansar al-Sunna and threatening more attacks until Russia allows the North Caucasus region to secede. On January 8, 2014, bodies of six men were found near villages in southern Stavropol Kray with explosive devices nearby. On January 12, 2014, a Fatwa was published by a website associated with the Caucasus Emirate justifying the attacks. On January 12, 2014, a Fatwa was published by a website linked to the Caucasus Emirate, justifying the Volgograd attacks as essential to enrage the infidels. In January 2014, Abu Muhammad (Aliaskhab Kebekov) referred to Umarev's death and later announced as the new military head of the Caucasus Emirate. Kebekov, appointed as Qadi' in 2010 by Umarev, is expected to continue his policies in the Caucasus Emirate. Observers note the difficulty in finding a replacement for Umarev, indicating a weakening of the group due to Russian counterinsurgency efforts. Kebekov's Aver ethnicity from Dagestan shows the Emirate's expanded focus beyond Chechnya's independence goal. Analysts warn that the Caucasus Emirate is a hub of Islamic terrorism in Russia, receiving support from global terrorist networks and providing assistance to numerous combat jamaats in the region. The Caucasus Emirate, led by Kebekov, has expanded its operations globally with support from global terrorist networks. The group has revived the \"Riyadus Salikhin\" Martyrs' Battalion and is carrying out suicide bombings across Russia. Major ideologists of the global jihadi movement have praised these bombings and supported the Caucasus Emirate. Cells have been discovered in various countries, including Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, France, and Azerbaijan. U.S.-Russian cooperation in combating terrorism in Chechnya and elsewhere is crucial. U.S.-Russian cooperation in combating terrorism in Chechnya is a key priority. The United States acknowledges links between Osama bin Laden and Chechen terrorism, supporting Russian counter-terrorism actions. CIA Director Tenet warns of foreign sympathizers training in Chechnya and posing a threat to U.S. interests. A Working Group on Afghanistan was established during a U.S.-Russia summit in June 2000. Russian President Putin agreed to set up a Working Group on Afghanistan to discuss joint efforts to combat global terrorism, including Taliban support for terrorist activities. The Working Group was later renamed to focus on counter-terrorism, with discussions on the U.S. Georgia Train and Equip Program to combat Chechen and al Qaeda-linked terrorism. Regular meetings of the Working Group have addressed issues related to Chechen and North Caucasian terrorism, and in 2009, it became part of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission. The U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) includes the Counter-terrorism Working Group, which some critics feel has declined in significance. In 2002, a U.S.-Russia Letter of Agreement on Law Enforcement Cooperation and Counter-Narcotics was signed, providing support for combating terrorism. In 2005, Representatives from the U.S. and Russia signed a joint statement on opposition to international terrorism. In 2011, Russia and the United States signed a joint statement on combating terrorism following a terrorist bombing at Moscow's Domodedovo airport. President Obama proposed greater cooperation in combating terrorism to then-President Medvedev, leading to enhanced counter-terrorism cooperation agreements at a summit meeting in France. Measures included bolstering airport security and exploring enhanced in-air security methods. The Transportation Security Administration and the Russian Ministry of Transport signed agreements to enhance security assessments at airports and exchange threat information. President Medvedev thanked the US for designating the Caucasus Emirate as a terrorist organization. Both countries pledged to strengthen cooperation in countering terrorism, including intelligence sharing and coordinated operations. They also agreed to collaborate on security for the Sochi Olympic Games. In 2012, the Chairmen discussed cooperation in the Global Counter-terrorism Forum, countering violent extremism, terrorist threats to the tourism industry, terrorist designations, and preparations for the Sochi Olympics. Russia participated in joint military exercises, collaborated on nuclear and transportation security, and engaged in joint financial monitoring programs. Additionally, Russia continued to participate in the Four-Party Counter-terrorism Working Group with the FBI, FSB, and CIA, sharing operational and intelligence information on terrorism-related threats. FBI-FSB relationships at the working level improved during the year. In 2012, FBI-FSB relationships improved. Russia was active in NATO-Russia Council's Counter-terrorism Working Group. Obama and Putin pledged cooperation, but Russia ended U.S.-Russia Law Enforcement Cooperation Agreement in 2013. After Boston bombings, Obama and Putin agreed to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation. In April 2013, John Kerry and Sergey Lavrov discussed counter-terrorism cooperation at a NATO-Russia Council meeting. FBI Director Robert Mueller visited Moscow in May to discuss cooperation on the Boston bombing. In June 2013, the two Presidents pledged greater counter-terrorism cooperation. Challenges have arisen due to tensions in U.S.-Russia relations. The Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs, designated as Global Terrorists, carried out terrorism acts in Russia, threatening U.S. citizens and national security. The groups were linked to al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban. Assets of these groups in the U.S. were blocked. Doku Umarov, leader of Caucasus Emirates, was designated as a terrorist to prevent support to him. The United States designated the Caucasus Emirate as a Global Terrorist group and included Doku Umarov in the \"Rewards for Justice\" program with a $5 million reward for information on his location. Congress criticized Russia's human rights abuses in Chechnya and called for sanctions. In November 2006, Senator Patrick Leahy urged President Bush to address human rights abuses by Russian troops in Chechnya and proposed U.N. involvement in conflict resolution. H.Res. 1539 (Alcee Hastings) in July 2010 called for raising human rights issues in Russia at international forums. U.S. aid to Russia was banned in FY2012. In FY2012, Congress allocated $5 to $9 million for humanitarian assistance in Chechnya and the North Caucasus through U.N. agencies and NGOs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act endorsed $7 million for various assistance programs in the North Caucasus, with restrictions on aid to Russia unless access to Chechnya was granted to international NGOs. Despite Russia's ban on direct U.S. aid, indirect assistance continued through U.N. agencies. Despite a significant reduction in armed forces size since the Soviet period, the Russian military remains formidable and relies on nuclear forces for power. Russia aims to enhance security cooperation with other CIS states and passed legislation in 2009 allowing the use of troops abroad. This suggests a willingness to use military force to assert its interests in neighboring countries. The improvement of Russia's economy since 1999, fueled by rising oil and gas prices, enabled increased defense spending in the 2000s. Despite lagging behind U.S. and former Soviet levels, systemic corruption reduces the efficacy of larger defense budgets. Military activities like multi-national exercises and strategic bomber patrols near U.S. and NATO airspace have resumed under President Putin. In early 2007, President Putin appointed Anatoly Serdyukov as defense minister to transform the armed forces from a mobilization model to permanently staffed smaller brigades. Problems in force composition, training, and equipment were highlighted during the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, leading to a reform plan in 2008 to cut the officer corps, revamp noncommissioned officer training, and reduce personnel at the Defense Ministry and General Staff. The Russian armed forces underwent reforms in 2008 to reduce the number of personnel, change the command system, and shift towards a professional military. However, challenges remain with conscription due to a decline in births and unhealthy living conditions. Potential solutions include adjusting to a smaller armed forces or increasing the length of service. In late 2010, Russia consolidated its military districts and launched a $700 billion weapons modernization plan for 2011-2020. The rebuilding of the defense industrial complex is crucial for modernization, with some arms technologies being imported to aid in this effort. However, the policy of acquiring foreign arms technologies came under scrutiny in 2012, with concerns raised by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and President Putin about the continuation of this practice. Putin emphasized the importance of cooperation with foreign partners in some areas but stressed that Russia should not overly rely on foreign arms technology. In March 2013, Rogozin stated that Russia would not purchase finished military products abroad, but would emphasize granting citizenship and incentives to encourage military arms specialists to move to Russia. On May 7, 2012, edicts were signed to boost military pay, pensions, and housing allowances, increase troops under contract, create a reserve of troops, and modernize defense industries. Critics pointed out that these initiatives were not included in the 2012 budget or planned budgets for 2013-2014, warning of increased military spending. In 2012, President Putin announced defense initiatives including $89 billion for weapons modernization and defense industrial sector improvements. In November 2012, Serdyukov was fired by Putin due to corruption allegations and opposition to his reforms by officials and military officers. In 2012, President Putin announced defense initiatives including $89 billion for weapons modernization and defense industrial sector improvements. Serdyukov was fired by Putin in November 2012 due to corruption allegations and opposition to his reforms by officials and military officers. The governor of the Moscow region, Sergey Shoygu, was appointed as the new defense minister, replacing Makarov with Valery Gerasimov as Chief of the General Staff. Analysts suggest Serdyukov's dismissal was due to friction with defense industries over modernizing weaponry and opposition to foreign arms technology acquisitions. The Defense Ministry under Shoygu continues Serdyukov's military reforms, focusing on reducing officers, establishing unified commands, and transitioning to a professional armed forces. Political influence from arms industries hinders modernization efforts. U.S. and Russia resumed military cooperation in 2009 as part of the Obama Administration's \"reset\" in relations. The United States has pursued military-to-military ties with Russia to promote cooperation in counter-terrorism, peace-keeping, democracy, and human rights within the Russian military. In April 2013, both countries signed a Military Cooperation Working Group work plan, which included various programming events such as delegations visiting each other's military institutions. A Russian delegation led by General-Major Konstantin Smeshko visited the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization headquarters in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency participated in a Russian Ministry of Defense-hosted Nuclear Security Exercise. Bilateral military cooperation was also shown through the European Command's Colonels Working Group meeting in Berlin to finalize the 2014 work plan of military contacts. Bilateral military cooperation between the United States and Russia includes the signing of a memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism cooperation and the establishment of a Working Group on Defense Relations. Meetings between Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Defense Minister Shoygu have focused on boosting military cooperation and sharing best practices for modernization efforts. The two officials, as co-chairs of the Working Group, agreed to enhance military cooperation and instructed staff to increase engagement. They also discussed stability in Afghanistan, missile defense, and chemical weapons in Syria during a meeting at the NATO defense ministerial. Additionally, Under Secretary of Defense James Miller and Deputy Minister of Defense Anatoly Antonov met in New York to discuss missile defense, prompt global strike, Counter-IED cooperation, and bilateral defense engagement. The Resources Sub-Working Group met in Colorado Springs in October 2012 to discuss cadet exchanges and other matters. The Russian co-head, Yekaterina Priyezzheva, was ousted shortly after. The Enhanced Missile Defense sub-Working Group convened in April 2013 for the first time since 2011. They coordinated the \"Vigilant Eagle 13\" exercise in August 2013 and are now planning for \"Vigilant Eagle 14.\" Russia appointed Yekaterina Priyezzheva as co-chair of the Joint Commission on POW/MIAs in June 2011. In June 2011, Russia appointed Yekaterina Priyezzheva as co-chair of the Joint Commission on POW/MIAs with 30 commissioners. The first meeting under her leadership was held in St. Petersburg in June 2012. However, Priyezzheva was dismissed in December 2012, and as of December 2013, Russia has not designated a new co-chair. In January 2014, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper highlighted Russian military improvements and focus on professionalization and rearmament. The military has been involved in out-of-area operations in the eastern Mediterranean, Latin America, the Arctic, and other regions. In various regions like the eastern Mediterranean, Latin America, the Arctic, and beyond, Russia is expanding its military presence through negotiations for access to military infrastructure globally. These bases are primarily for 'show the flag' and 'presence' operations, rather than for significant power projection. Russia will continue engaging with the United States on mutual priorities such as Syrian CW, Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea. The United States is open to security cooperation with Russia in areas of shared interest like Syria, Iran, and post-2014 Afghanistan, as stated in the Quadrennial Defense Review 2014. The Quadrennial Defense Review 2014 highlights the need to engage Russia in areas of shared interest like Syria, Iran, and post-2014 Afghanistan. General Philip Breedlove expressed concerns about Russia's adversarial behavior, prompting changes in NATO's strategic planning. The Russian economy has seen periods of growth and turmoil since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The Russian economy experienced strong growth from 1999 to 2008, driven by increases in world oil prices. However, it was severely impacted by the global financial crisis. The Russian economy experienced significant growth from 1999 to 2008 due to high oil prices, but was heavily affected by the global financial crisis in 2008. The crisis revealed weaknesses in the economy, such as its reliance on oil exports and a fragile financial system. The government's control over key industries, particularly in energy, also hindered economic performance. Despite a brief period of growth, GDP declined in 2009 and has since shown slow recovery. Russia's economy remains vulnerable unless it reduces its dependence on oil and diversifies and reforms its economy. President Obama has issued executive orders authorizing sanctions on Russia, including seizure of U.S. assets and travel bans. The latest sanctions target individuals in various sectors of the Russian economy, such as financial services, metals and mining, engineering, and defense. The sanctions aim to pressure Russia to diversify and reform its economy, which former President Medvedev also emphasized. The key issue is whether President Putin will carry out economic reform or maintain the status quo. The sanctions imposed by President Obama on Russia target individuals in sectors like financial services, metals, mining, engineering, and defense. These measures are designed to hit specific areas of the Russian economy rather than the economy as a whole. The crisis over Ukraine has caused tension, leading to a decrease in the Russian stock index and depreciation of the Russian ruble. Russia applied for accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1993, which was taken up by the World Trade Organization in 1995. Russia officially joined the WTO on August 22, 2012, committing to comply with WTO rules such as nondiscriminatory treatment of imports, binding tariff levels, transparency in trade measures, limiting agriculture subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights, and avoiding local content requirements. Congress had an indirect role in the accession process. The United States played a role in granting Russia permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status, necessary for Russia's accession to the WTO. Congress passed H.R. 6156 authorizing PNTR for Russia on December 14, 2012. The legislation granting Russia permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status was signed into law on December 14, 2012 (P.L. 112-208), which also included provisions of the \"Magnitsky Act.\" Russia's oil and natural gas industries play a significant role in the global energy market, with Russia possessing the largest natural gas reserves and a substantial share of global oil reserves. The personal and political fortunes of Russia's leaders are closely tied to these industries, which contribute significantly to the country's government revenue. European dependence on Russian energy and Russia's influence in Europe's energy distribution infrastructure are seen as long-term threats to transatlantic relations. Russia supplies about 30% of the EU's natural gas, with some Eastern European countries heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas. Russia uses its natural resources as a political tool, aiming to strengthen its global influence. However, Europe is also a crucial market for Russian natural gas exports, with Gazprom relying on European demand. Russian natural gas exports are a significant concern, with 53% going to the EU and 30% to the Commonwealth of Independent States. Issues with payment and supply reliability have arisen, particularly with Ukraine. In 2009, Gazprom halted gas supplies through Ukraine due to disagreements. Europe heavily relies on Russian gas, with past disputes leading to gas cutoffs. The Russian-Ukrainian dispute in 2006 led to a gas cutoff to Europe. Disputes between Russia and Belarus in 2010 and 2011 also caused temporary reductions in oil and gas supplies. Concerns about gas transit through Ukraine prompted the support for new pipeline projects to bypass Ukraine. Nord Stream pipeline was established in 2011 to transport gas directly from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Russia's proposal for a third and fourth Nord Stream pipeline was rejected by Germany. Many EU countries are worried about overdependence on Russian gas. The EU is concerned about overdependence on Russian energy and supports the construction of the \"Southern Corridor\" to transport gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia to Europe. The TAP pipeline will transport gas from Azerbaijan to Italy by 2019, but its small capacity will not significantly reduce European reliance on Russia. Russia aims to hinder Europe's diversification efforts and has tried to undermine the Southern Corridor. Russia is competing with the EU's Southern Corridor project by planning the South Stream pipeline to transport gas from Russia to Europe via the Black Sea. Construction began in late 2013, with the first deliveries planned for the end of 2015. Russia has enticed Western European companies to participate in the project to build political support in European countries. The South Stream pipeline project, aiming to transport gas from Russia to Europe via the Black Sea, faces challenges due to EU regulations and doubts about Russia's gas production capacity. The European Commission has raised concerns about Gazprom's ownership of the pipeline and the need for fair access to third-party gas producers. Russia's annexation of Crimea also raises questions about the project's future. Russia is trying to control Ukraine's pipeline system, which transports gas to Europe. They already control Belarus's gas infrastructure. Gazprom plans to modernize Belarus's system and add a new pipeline by 2019. Factors like shale gas in the US and Europe could reduce Russia's leverage over gas supplies. The spot market for natural gas and LNG infrastructure in Europe could also help. The expansion of liquefied natural gas infrastructure in Europe could diversify supplies and reduce dependence on Russian-controlled pipelines. European companies have pressured Gazprom to cut prices, but Gazprom resists changes to its pricing formula. Russia plans to increase gas exports to Asian countries, but faces challenges due to pricing differences with China. After the collapse of the Yanukovych regime in February 2014, Gazprom warned Ukraine of potential supply cuts due to unpaid debts. This could lead to a third natural gas crisis in Europe. Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev announced Russia's intention to revoke the Kharkiv agreements, potentially increasing Ukraine's gas prices to $500 per thousand cubic meters. This would be significantly higher than what other European countries pay for gas. During the Putin era, Russia aimed to restore its global prestige and dominance in the former Soviet space. Fueled by petro-dollars, Moscow grew self-confident before the 2008 economic downturn. Concerns arose in Europe and the US over Russia's increasingly contrarian foreign policy. During the Putin era, Russia pursued a contrarian foreign policy, opposing US missile defense in Eastern Europe, suspending compliance with the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, and strongly opposing NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia. President Putin became alarmed after popular revolts in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, viewing them as part of a US-led conspiracy to reduce Russia's influence. In February 2007, President Putin criticized Bush Administration policies at the Munich Security Conference, condemning the alleged \"unipolar\" world the US wanted. Tensions with the West escalated during Medvedev's first two years in office, especially after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Russia opposed NATO enlargement to Georgia and Ukraine, occupied Georgian regions, and cut off energy supplies in disputes with Ukraine and Belarus. Putin also strengthened ties with Cuba and Venezuela and tried to limit airbase use in Central Asia. In 2009, President Obama's efforts to \"reset\" bilateral ties somewhat eased tensions with Russia. Analysts believe Medvedev's presidency played a role in this by presenting a more reasonable face of foreign policy. The EU-Russia partnership has focused on commercial ties, natural gas, and cooperation on foreign policy issues like Iran's nuclear program. The EU has reevaluated its approach to Russia following the annexation of Crimea, viewing Russia as a potential adversary. The EU, along with the US, condemned the Crimea referendum as illegal and imposed sanctions on Russian officials. Talks on a visa waiver agreement and a new framework agreement with Russia have been suspended. The EU has threatened wider sanctions against Russia for actions in Ukraine, with energy, trade, and economics shaping debates. Russia's significant energy supply to the EU and trade relationship are key factors in reluctance to impose harsher sanctions. Most European leaders believe EU countries must be willing to risk economic consequences to stand against Russian aggression. The EU's economic leverage, as Russia's main trade and investment partner, could significantly impact the Russian economy if European investors pull out or avoid the market. The EU-Russia energy relationship is crucial for both sides, with Europe being a vital energy market for Russia. The EU's economic leverage as Russia's main trade partner could impact the Russian economy if European investors pull out. Europe is a vital energy market for Russia, and gas sales to EU countries are important revenue sources. Tensions in Central and Eastern Europe stem from energy dependence and aggressive Russian energy policies. Diversifying energy supply to decrease reliance on Russia is crucial. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have heightened the urgency for the EU to mitigate risks by completing a more interconnected internal energy market. Gazprom's operations are under scrutiny. The EU has been investigating Gazprom for price fixing and rules violations in eastern EU member states, potentially resulting in a \u20ac10 billion fine. EU energy legislation aims to increase competition by separating gas production from distribution. Russian officials argue that these requirements unfairly target Gazprom and violate WTO rules. The European Commission has also challenged bilateral deals between Russia and six EU member states related to the South Stream pipeline construction as illegal. EU member states have differing attitudes towards Russia, with some like Germany, France, and Italy favoring a pragmatic approach based on engagement, while others like Poland and the Baltic States view Russia as a potential threat due to historical experiences. The EU's relationship with Russia has been marked by tensions over various issues, but maintained through a pragmatic \"strategic partnership.\" The annexation of Crimea has shifted perceptions, aligning advocates of pragmatism with those skeptical of Russia. Despite strong reactions, some suggest that aspects of normal business relations may continue. Some skeptics believe that despite tensions, elements of \"business as usual\" may persist, especially in commercial and energy sectors. However, concerns arise from Russia's military actions near Ukraine and lack of transparency, leading to fears of further territorial ambitions in regions with Russian populations. This has prompted a narrative of Putin's Russia being a threat to peace and stability. Putin's Russia is seen as a threat to peace and stability in Europe, particularly due to events in Ukraine and its opposition to the EU's Eastern Partnership. Russia views the partnership as a challenge to its regional influence, leading to tensions with the EU. Russia has countered the Eastern Partnership in Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia, with NATO condemning its annexation of Crimea and reassessing its partnership with Russia. NATO has suspended meetings and cooperation with Russia, marking a turning point in their relations. NATO-Russia partnership efforts post-Cold War have been mixed. Russian suspicion and skepticism towards NATO, especially under Putin, persist. Disagreements over missile defense plans hinder closer cooperation. Member states criticize hostile rhetoric and human rights concerns. The NATO-Russia Council (NRC) was established in 2002 to promote political dialogue and joint operations between NATO and Russia. However, formal staff-level meetings of the NRC were suspended in 2014, and many believe that the NRC has not reached its full potential due to Russian suspicion about NATO's intentions. NATO's enlargement in 1999 and 2004 to former Soviet-oppressed states is often cited as a source of Russian mistrust. Russia's opposition to NATO enlargement to former eastern bloc countries was fueled by the establishment of U.S. and NATO airbases in Central Asia and military facilities in Bulgaria and Romania. Tensions escalated after Russia's actions in Ukraine, sparking a debate within the alliance on how to respond. There is a strong debate within NATO regarding Europe's response to Russia's aggressive foreign policy. Concerns have been raised about NATO's credibility in collective defense, especially in light of Russia's actions in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Ukraine. Some allies feel NATO lacks appropriate contingency planning for potential Russian aggression against a NATO member or partner. In response to potential Russian aggression, NATO has taken steps to affirm its commitment to defending its members. This includes augmenting the Baltic Air Policing Mission, conducting surveillance flights over Poland and Romania, and enhancing military awareness. The U.S. Administration has called for new contingency plans for the defense of eastern European member states, with many allies willing to conduct military exercises in these regions similar to the 2013 Steadfast Jazz exercise. Steadfast Jazz was the largest NATO exercise in the region in over ten years, certifying command and control elements of the NATO Response Force. Some criticized the US for sending only 300 troops to the 6,000-man exercise. Russian officials objected to the exercise near its border, calling it \"in the spirit of the Cold War.\" Ongoing NATO-Russia cooperation could be impacted by NATO's response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Challenges identified include ongoing instability in Afghanistan, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, piracy, and natural and man-made disasters. NATO-Russia cooperation has expanded in some areas since the 2010 Lisbon Summit, with specific areas of cooperation defined in a \"program of activities\" for 2014. This includes support to the Afghan government, joint counterterrorism efforts, combating piracy at sea, and a new program to dispose of ammunition in Kaliningrad. U.S. and NATO officials highlight cooperation with Russia in Afghanistan as a successful example. Cooperation with Russia in Afghanistan has been successful, with Russia allowing transit of cargo for NATO's ISAF since 2008. Training Afghan, Pakistani, and Central Asian counter-narcotics officers has also been a joint effort, with over 3,000 officers trained by the end of 2013. Russian helicopters operated by civilian crews have provided transport in Afghanistan, and a Helicopter Maintenance Trust Fund has been established by the NATO-Russia Council for maintenance and repair support. The Helicopter Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by the NATO-Russia Council to provide maintenance, repair support, and training for Afghan National Security Forces. Progress has been made in training Afghan helicopter maintenance staff, but disagreements persist within the alliance and between NATO and Russia on core issues such as missile defense cooperation and Georgia's territorial integrity and NATO membership. Progress has been made on Georgia's territorial integrity and NATO membership prospects, the unratified CFE Treaty, and Russian influence in Euro-Atlantic security. Moscow criticizes NATO for not recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence and opposes closer NATO ties with Georgia and Ukraine. Russia prioritizes cooperation within the CIS and views the CSTO as key for regional security threats. The February 2010 Military Doctrine prioritizes military-political cooperation with Belarus, the CSTO, and the CIS. Despite Russia's focus on the CIS, progress towards integration has been limited. Many CIS summit meetings have failed due to criticism of lack of progress and Russian dominance. In 2011, then-Prime Minister Putin proposed creating a \"Eurasian Union\" to integrate economically, politically, and militarily, uniting structures of the CIS, Union State, CSTO, and Eurasian Economic Community. Putin's vision for the \"Eurasian Union\" aimed to integrate Soviet successor states quickly, forming close ties with the EU. Critics viewed this as campaign rhetoric, with some accusing Putin of appealing to Soviet nostalgia. In 2012, he appointed a Russian ultranationalist as an advisor on Eurasian integration, and by 2013, Russia pressured Soviet successor states to join the Eurasian Economic Community and Customs Union instead of signing association agreements with the EU. In 2013, Armenia and Ukraine suspended negotiations with the EU on association agreements and opted to join the Customs Union. The effectiveness of the CSTO, formed in 2002, has been debated among its members. President Medvedev proposed forming a new CSTO rapid reaction force based in Russia in 2009. In February 2009, President Medvedev proposed creating a new CSTO rapid reaction force based in Russia to rival NATO. Uzbekistan and Belarus had concerns and delayed signing the agreement. Despite lack of consensus, Russia unilaterally assigned troops to the force for repulsing military aggression, responding to disasters, and combating terrorism and crime. The force can be deployed at the request of member states' presidents. At a CSTO summit in December 2011, members signed a pledge against nonmember military bases on their territories without unanimous agreement. They also agreed on intervention procedures in \"emergency\" situations within a member state. Uzbekistan objected to these procedures, leading to its decision to leave the CSTO. In December 2012, a new CSTO Collective Security Force was established, including rapid reaction forces and special operations components. President Putin called for enhancing capabilities. Armenian President at CSTO summit calls for organization to strengthen capabilities in response to ISAF drawdown in Afghanistan. Concerns raised about lack of support for Armenian foreign policy on Azerbaijan. Improved relations between Russia and Ukraine under pro-Russian President Yanukovych. Agreement to extend Russian Black Sea Fleet stay in Crimea until 2042 in exchange for discounted gas supplies to Ukraine. In late 2013, Russia pressured Ukraine to not sign an Association Agreement with the EU by banning imports and threatening further disruptions to exports. This gave Moscow more leverage over Kyiv, leading to economic concessions. Following the collapse of the Yanukovych regime in February 2014, Russia reacted with hostility towards the new pro-Western leadership in Ukraine. Moscow criticized Western partners for their actions and refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new government in Kyiv. Additionally, Russia quickly seized Ukraine's Crimea region in late February 2014. In late February 2014, heavily armed Russian-speaking troops seized Crimea, claiming to be local self-defense forces but identified as Russian armed forces by observers. Ukrainian, U.S., and EU officials rejected Putin's denial, stating that Russian military forces invaded Crimea. On March 11, Ukraine reported nearly 19,000 Russian troops in the country. On March 16, Crimea held a referendum on annexation to Russia. Authorities held a referendum on Crimea's annexation to Russia, with a reported approval rate of 96.77% and a turnout of 83.1%. The annexation was formalized by a treaty signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18, despite condemnation from Ukraine, the US, the EU, and other countries. The move was seen as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and international law. The takeover had been relatively peaceful until March 18 when one Ukrainian soldier was killed during a Russian storming of a base in Simferopol. The Ukrainian soldier was killed during a Russian storming of a base in Simferopol. Ukraine announced the withdrawal of its military personnel from Crimea due to threats from Russian forces. Russia declared control over military installations in Crimea, with remaining Ukrainian troops leaving the peninsula. Pro-Russian protestors in eastern and southern Ukraine demand union with Russia or greater autonomy from Kyiv. The Ukrainian government accuses Russia of sending militant demonstrators. Observers speculate about Russia's goals and next moves regarding Ukraine, following the surprise annexation of Crimea. Ukrainian officials claim proof of Russia's involvement in stirring up demonstrations in eastern Ukraine. With 100,000 combat-ready Russian troops near Ukraine's borders, there are concerns about a potential invasion. Russia could also aim to destabilize and discredit the pro-Western government in Kyiv. Russia's actions include destabilizing the pro-Western government in Kyiv, imposing trade sanctions on Ukrainian imports, launching cyber attacks on Ukrainian government servers, and potentially harassing Ukrainian citizens in Russia. Belarus remains a loyal ally to Russia, with Moscow focusing on gaining control of Belarus's economic assets to keep it within its geopolitical orbit. Belarus has faced economic pressure from Russia, leading to closer ties between the two countries. Russia has used various tactics such as manipulating gas prices, providing loans, and pushing for privatization of state-owned firms. Belarus is seeking to join the WTO but faces challenges due to its close relationship with Russia. Belarus faces economic pressure from Russia, leading to closer ties with the US and EU. Lukashenko's repression of political opposition damages relations with the West. Russia's invasion of Crimea puts Lukashenko in a difficult position. In Moldova, Russia aims to hinder EU integration and NATO cooperation. Russia has tried to dissuade Moldova from signing an Association Agreement with the EU by banning imports of wine and spirits. Despite this, Moldova initialed the agreement in November 2013 and plans to sign it in June 2014. Russia may use further import bans and support for Transnistria to pressure Moldova. Russian forces are stationed in Transnistria, and Russia provides subsidies to the breakaway region. The withdrawal of Russian troops is linked to the resolution of Transnistria's status. Transnistrian leaders seek Russia's recognition of independence, observers speculate Moscow might recognize it after Crimea. Moscow uses Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to exert influence in South Caucasus. International community condemned Russia's actions in Georgia in 2008. Russian troops deployed to new bases in Abkhazia. In 2008, Russian troops were deployed to new military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with the United States and international community calling for Russia to reverse these actions. In 2013, Armenia announced plans to join the Russia-led Customs Union, citing heavy dependence on Russia for security and economic interests dominated by Russian industries. Georgia and Russia have yet to reestablish diplomatic relations since 2008. Switzerland mediated talks in 2011 to address Georgia's customs control demands for Russia's WTO accession. After Bidzana Ivanishvili became prime minister in 2012, hopes for improved political and economic relations with Russia were raised. Formerly restricted trade relations have been partly restored. Russia's policy in Central Asia has been to exclude U.S. influence, with some temporary reversals. In 2005, Uzbekistan demanded the closure of a U.S. airbase, likely influenced by Russia and China. Kyrgyzstan accepted a large loan in 2009. In 2009, Kyrgyzstan accepted a large loan from Russia and requested the closure of the Manas airbase by the United States. After negotiations, Kyrgyzstan allowed U.S. and NATO cargo transit through Manas, causing tension with Russia. Cooperation between the U.S. and Russia regarding transit to Afghanistan has fluctuated over the years, with Russia eventually advocating for the closure of the Manas airbase in 2013. The early 1990s spirit of U.S.-Russian partnership has since been replaced by increasing tension and mutual recrimination. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S.-Russian relations were initially based on cooperation against terrorism and Putin's goal of integrating Russia economically with the West. Tensions escalated on various issues leading to discord. Bilateral ties deteriorated after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, reaching a low point since the Cold War. The 2009 Obama Administration attempted to improve relations with Russia by starting a fresh dialogue. The Obama Administration aimed to reset U.S.-Russian relations, starting with a dialogue in 2009. This included joint statements on nuclear weapons talks and a commitment to deal as equals to solve global issues. The Obama Administration aimed to reset U.S.-Russian relations in 2009, including joint statements on nuclear weapons talks and a commitment to work as equals with \"other countries\" to solve global problems. President Obama met with then-Prime Minister Putin during the summit, establishing a U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) to strengthen consultations and diplomacy. The BPC, with the presidents as co-chairs, aimed to greatly expand communications between the two countries. The Obama Administration established the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) to enhance relations with Russia, focusing on global nonproliferation, combating extremism, trade, rule of law, and cooperation in Europe and Asia. The Obama Administration established the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission to enhance relations with Russia, focusing on global nonproliferation, combating extremism, trade, rule of law, and cooperation in Europe and Asia. The Administration plans to update the strategy in 2014. President Medvedev visited the United States in 2010 to focus on business and technology ties. Shortly after his visit, 11 Russian spies were arrested in the U.S. for charges including money-laundering and not registering as foreign agents. The spies had been living in the U.S. for up to 10 years. The 10 Russian agents were swapped in Vienna, Austria, on July 9 for 4 Russian citizens alleged to be U.S. or British spies. Some observers suggested that the focus on public information gathering reflected Russia's political leaders' paranoia. The quick resolution of the spy case indicated a concerted effort to preserve the \"re-set\" in bilateral relations between the United States and Russia. Presidents Obama and Medvedev met at various summits in 2010 to work on cooperation on common security challenges. In May 2011, President Obama and then-President Medvedev met at the Group of 8 (G-8) meeting in Deauville, France to discuss U.S. missile defense plans, counter-terrorism cooperation, and Russia's entry into the WTO. They agreed on cooperation in security challenges, resuming ballistic missile defense exercises, and exploring modernizing the CFE Treaty, signaling a partnership between Russia and NATO. During talks in 2011, Medvedev and Obama discussed Russia's concerns over NATO missile defense plans, with no breakthrough achieved. They signed agreements on visa issues, counter-terrorism, and the Bering Strait Region, and created working groups on innovation and the rule of law to support Medvedev's modernization campaign. President-elect Putin cancelled plans to attend the May 18-19, 2012, G-8 meeting at Camp David, citing the need to select new cabinet ministers. This decision was seen as a possible snub towards the NATO-Russia Council meeting in Chicago due to lack of progress on missile defense issues. At the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, Presidents Obama and Putin issued a joint statement. At the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, Presidents Obama and Putin issued a joint statement listing areas of cooperation, including Afghanistan, investment, trade, health, environment, and education. However, activities of the Working Groups and Sub-Working Groups of the BPC had decreased, possibly due to electoral cycles and anti-Americanism in Russia. Putin and Medvedev openly supported Obama's reelection. Russia requested the US to end USAID programs by October 1, 2012, which were part of the BPC process. In 2012, Russia refused to renew an agreement sanctioning Cooperative Threat Reduction programs with the US, citing interference in its affairs. Putin's anti-Western stance was evident in the increased activities of the propaganda organ RT in the UK and US. RT in the US was accused of undermining faith in the US government. Putin merged state news agencies into RT in December 2013. In December 2013, Putin merged state news agencies into RT, appointing Dmitry Kiselev as its head. This move was seen as part of Putin's efforts to justify his conservative policies to international audiences. The Obama Administration aimed to maintain cooperative ties with Russia but expressed concerns about restrictions on civil society, leading to the US withdrawing from the Civil Society Working Group in January 2013. The State Department expressed hope to continue assisting civil society groups in Russia despite the US withdrawal from the Civil Society Working Group in January 2013. Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov discussed Syria policy during meetings in February and April 2013, agreeing to step up activities of the Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC). National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon also visited Russia in April 2013. During his visit to Russia in April 2013, Donilon carried a letter from President Obama to President Putin outlining areas of cooperation between the two countries. General Breedlove highlighted Russia's aspirations as a superpower but noted internal stressors that could challenge its goals. The US and NATO need to reassure allies in Russia's sphere of influence while maintaining engagement with Russia. During a meeting on the sidelines of the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, Presidents Obama and Putin issued joint statements on bilateral relations, counter-terrorism cooperation, and cyber-security. They acknowledged disagreements on the Syria crisis but expressed commitment to organizing a conference between warring factions. The Statement on Enhanced Bilateral Relations emphasized areas of engagement like arms control, trade, countering terrorism, and exchanges. During the meeting, Presidents Obama and Putin announced plans to expand dialogue and launch a \"two plus two\" dialogue involving key officials. They also agreed on exchanging operational information for countering terrorism and establishing communication links for cyber-security. Additionally, a new Cyber Security Working Group was formed as part of the Bilateral Presidential Commission. The U.S.-Russia summit finalized negotiations for a follow-on protocol to the expiring Comprehensive Threat Reduction Agreement. Relations strained after Edward Snowden sought asylum in Russia, leading to the postponement of a planned presidential summit. Senator John McCain criticized Russia's actions and called for a more realistic approach to relations, including expanding the Magnitsky list and denouncing human rights abuses. The U.S. postponed a planned U.S.-Russia presidential summit in Russia due to inadequate progress in bilateral agenda, including issues like missile defense, arms control, trade, global security, and human rights. The grant of temporary asylum to Edward Snowden was also a factor. Despite the cancelation, Foreign Minister Lavrov and Defense Minister Shoygu visited Washington for discussions on bilateral issues. President Obama traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia for the G-20 meeting where he briefly met with the Russian President to discuss the Syria conflict. The Annual Report of the BPC indicated some revival of activities, with meetings of Working Groups and sub-Working Groups scheduled. Many activities, however, have been delayed or involve person-to-person contacts rather than substantive meetings. Russia's foreign policy concept prioritizes relations with Euro-Atlantic states and the CIS. It emphasizes developing trade and economic ties with the U.S. post-\"reset\" and expects non-interference in domestic affairs. President Putin mentioned \"fundamental cultural differences\" complicating U.S.-Russia relations. Relations between the U.S. and Russia were complicated by \"fundamental cultural differences\" according to President Putin. He highlighted differences in American and Russian identities, with the U.S. seen as having an imperial attitude. Despite granting Snowden asylum, Putin hoped for no harm to U.S.-Russia relations. Obama's delegation for the Sochi Olympics did not include the President or Vice President. Janet Napolitano led the delegation for the opening ceremony of the Sochi Olympics, while William Burns headed the delegation for the closing ceremonies. Members of the delegations were prominent in the LGBT community. The President and Vice President did not attend the Games due to scheduling issues but expressed disapproval of Russia's anti-LGBT legislation and other human rights issues. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned about worldwide threats in his testimony to Congress in January 2014. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned in January 2014 that Russia and China pose persistent intelligence threats to the U.S., targeting government, defense industries, and key sectors like energy and finance. He highlighted President Putin's crackdown on political opposition, the need to balance a growing Muslim population with ethnic Russian nationalism, and the risks to Putin's rule from economic slowdown affecting military and social welfare plans. The Russian-mediated chemical weapons initiative in Syria strengthened Russia's role in the Syrian conflict and added legitimacy to the Syrian regime. Russia will continue to pursue Eurasian integration, competing with the EU in the West and China in Central Asia. The bilateral relationship with the United States remains a priority for Russian foreign policy, focusing on issues like Syrian CW, Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea. In the lead-up to the 2014 Olympic Games, terrorist attacks occurred in Russia, prompting offers from Western countries to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation. President Putin welcomed world leaders who attended the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, and others. U.S.-Russia relations deteriorated after Russia deployed military forces to Ukraine's Crimea region, leading to canceled meetings, halted trade talks, and sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. On March 6, 2014, President issued Executive Order 13660, declaring a national emergency due to actions undermining democratic processes in Ukraine's Crimea region. This order authorized the blocking of U.S. property and interests of individuals threatening Ukraine's peace and sovereignty. The Administration imposed visa restrictions on officials complicit in threatening Ukraine's sovereignty, including unauthorized Russian troop movements. Discussions with Russia on trade were also emphasized. The White House press secretary announced on March 6 that discussions with Russia on trade and investment were suspended, military engagement was on hold, and planning for a G-8 meeting in Sochi was also on hold. On March 17, 2014, President issued Executive Order 13661, expanding on the previous order, citing Russian military presence in Crimea as a threat to Ukraine's sovereignty and U.S. national security. Sanctions were imposed on eleven individuals, with more to be determined by the Treasury Secretary. The Treasury Secretary determined additional Russian individuals to be sanctioned, including government officials and those in Russia's arms industries. Entry into the U.S. for these individuals is suspended. The seven Russians sanctioned include Yelena Mizulina, Leonid Slutsky, Andrey Klishas, Valentina Matviyenko, Dmitry Rogozin, Vladislav Surkov, and Sergei Glazyev. Additionally, four Ukrainian individuals, including former president Viktor Yanukovych, were sanctioned under EO13660. The former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, two Crimean separatist leaders, Sergey Aksyonov and Vladimir Konstantinov, and the pro-Yanukovych head of the Ukrainian Choice Party Viktor Medvedchuk were sanctioned under EO13660. Aksyonov and Konstantinov advocated for Russian military intervention and annexation in Crimea, while Medvedchuk supported Crimea's secession from Ukraine. Executive Order 13662 was issued on March 20, 2014, expanding the national emergency to include sectors of the Russian economy. The latest Executive Order expands sanctions on individuals and businesses in Russia's economy due to their actions in Crimea and Ukraine. Key figures associated with President Putin, including the Rossiya Bank, are targeted. Key figures associated with President Putin, including his partner in Rossiya Bank, Andrey Fursenko, chief of the presidential staff Sergey Ivanov, and others, have been dismissive of the Administration's sanctions. Putin's alleged friends, such as Yuri Kovalchuk and the Rotenberg oligarchs, are also targeted. On March 20, 2014, Russia issued visa bans on nine U.S. citizens, including high-ranking officials. President Obama condemned Russia's actions in Crimea and announced further sanctions on Russian officials and Rossiya Bank. He warned of potential escalation and discussed actions with allies. President Obama signed a new executive order to impose sanctions on parts of the Russian economy if necessary, emphasizing that further escalation will isolate Russia from the international community. He called for upholding principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging support for Ukraine's economy and reaffirming commitment to NATO's defense capabilities. U.S.-Russia diplomacy continues with efforts to de-escalate the conflict and promote talks between Russia and Ukraine. The G-7 countries reaffirmed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and condemned Russia's illegal annexation of the region. They warned of increased sanctions if the situation escalated and urged Russia to engage in diplomatic talks with Ukraine. The G-7 leaders decided not to participate in a planned Sochi summit due to Russia's actions being incompatible with their shared values. The G-7 countries decided to suspend participation in the G-8 format and not attend a planned Sochi summit due to Russia's actions violating shared values. President Obama criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea, stating it challenged the international system of law and democracy. He emphasized the need to condemn the invasion and reject the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum. The United States and its allies aim to isolate Russia but do not seek a new Cold War as Russia does not lead a bloc of countries or espouse a global ideology. NATO also does not seek conflict with Russia, with hopes for Western unity. President Obama emphasized the importance of condemning Russia's actions in Crimea and rejecting the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum. He rejected Putin's comparison of annexation to Kosovo's independence effort and argued that the United States has attempted to work within the international system. Obama also stated that it was \"absurd\" for Russian voices to claim the United States orchestrated political developments in Ukraine and does not respect the Russian people. He highlighted past efforts to strengthen U.S.-Russian relations and Russian engagement with the world. President Obama acknowledged past cooperation with Russia on issues like Syria's chemical weapons and nuclear disarmament but cautioned against Russia's aggression towards its neighbors, particularly Ukraine. Critics of the Obama Administration's \"reset\" policy point to Russia's actions in Georgia and Ukraine as evidence of its failure. Despite this, some policymakers advocate for continued cooperation with Russia on mutual strategic interests. President Obama addressed Russia's role as a regional power threatening its neighbors out of weakness, not strength. He emphasized that Russia's actions are a problem but do not pose the number-one national security threat to the United States. Additionally, he mentioned Russia's involvement in various international agreements and conferences. \"Russia's return to the Middle East is mainly diplomatic, with limited capabilities and interests. President Putin aims to increase Russia's influence in the region but lacks a coherent policy, reacting to U.S. policies. Some Russian elites oppose a strong superpower role in the Middle East. Analysts suggest Russia prioritizes relations with Europe, Asia, and Soviet successor states over the Middle East. Russia offers itself as a mediator in regional conflicts but plays a minor role compared to the United States.\" Since 1992, the United States has spent over $10 billion on nuclear disarmament programs in former Soviet states, including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. This funding supported the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR) managed by the Department of Defense, helping to eliminate nuclear weapons and improve security at storage facilities. The United States funded improvements in security and construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility in Russia. U.S. threat reduction assistance evolved to focus on securing and eliminating chemical and biological weapons, as well as securing storage sites for nuclear warheads. The United States increased funding for projects to secure borders and track materials to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. The Memorandum of Understanding governing U.S.-Russian cooperation in threat reduction and nonproliferation expired in 2013, replaced by a bilateral protocol under the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program in the Russian Federation Agreement. Cooperation will continue in some areas of nuclear security, but projects for nuclear weapons dismantlement and chemical weapons destruction will cease. The Obama Administration pledged to pursue arms control negotiations with Russia. The United States and Russia negotiated a new treaty to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), limiting each side to no more than 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM and SLBM launchers and deployed heavy bombers equipped with nuclear armaments. The New START Treaty signed in 2010 also limits each side to no more than 1,550 deployed warheads. The New START Treaty signed in 2010 limits each side to no more than 1,550 deployed warheads and includes complex monitoring provisions for verification. The treaty aims to strengthen U.S. security, promote transparency, and support nuclear nonproliferation goals. Some question the necessity of the treaty for maintaining stability and reducing nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. The Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senate Intelligence Committee held hearings and briefings with officials and analysts in 2010 regarding the New START Treaty. Witnesses praised the treaty for modest reductions in nuclear weapons, enhancing stability, and restoring monitoring capabilities between the U.S. and Russia. Some concerns were raised about potential restrictions on U.S. missile defense programs. The New START Treaty was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 16, 2010, and ratified by the full Senate on December 22, 2010. It entered into force on February 5, 2011, with ongoing implementation. Some concerns were raised about potential restrictions on U.S. missile defense programs, but supporters argued that addressing Russia's stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons could come after ratification and implementation of New START. The New START Treaty was ratified in 2010 and has been implemented positively. Questions about its future arose during the Crimea crisis in 2014, with Russia considering suspending inspections if the US imposed sanctions. However, the US State Department believes inspections should continue despite tensions. President Obama aimed to negotiate further reductions in nuclear weapons with Russia, but Russia has shown little interest in the proposal. Russia has shown little interest in further reducing offensive nuclear weapons until the US agrees to limits on its missile defense programs. The US has rejected this proposal and seeks separate talks on missile defense cooperation. The Bush Administration supported a ballistic missile defense system to counter threats from North Korea and Iran, proposing a ground-based defense system in Europe in 2007. The Bush Administration proposed a European missile defense system with interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. However, the Obama Administration canceled this program in 2009. Instead, they introduced the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for regional missile defense using existing sensors and interceptors like Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis BMD. The Obama Administration introduced the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for regional missile defense, utilizing existing interceptors like THAAD and Aegis BMD. The plan aims to evolve over the next decade to include defense against intermediate- and long-range Iranian ballistic missiles, with Congress largely supporting the effort. Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) was completed in 2011, with a shift in focus towards adding ground-based interceptors to the existing GMD site in Alaska by 2017. The Obama Administration introduced the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for regional missile defense, utilizing existing interceptors like THAAD and Aegis BMD. Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) was completed in 2011, with plans to add ground-based interceptors to the existing GMD site in Alaska by 2017, representing a 50% increase in ICBM interceptors. The Pentagon is examining options for \"beyond Phase 3\" of the EPAA, which has significantly affected U.S.-Russia relations. President Putin criticized the Bush Administration's proposal, leading to tensions and Russia suspending compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. Russia strongly objected to the U.S.-Poland agreement on missile defense, warning that Poland hosting interceptors could make it a target for a nuclear attack. Analysts suggested Russia's objections were to sow discord among NATO members and divert attention from its own actions. Differences in views on missile defense remained between Presidents Obama and Medvedev in 2009. In 2009, Presidents Obama and Medvedev acknowledged differences in their views on U.S. missile defenses in Europe but pledged to explore new possibilities for cooperation. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov discussed U.S.-Russia-NATO cooperation on missile defense, contingent on the U.S. canceling the EC program and taking political and economic measures to eliminate the threat. President Medvedev praised Obama's responsible approach to a new European-based BMD program. Moscow supports U.S. President's responsible approach to agreement. Russia backs away from deploying Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad. Poland agrees to host SM-3 missiles as part of Obama's BMD program. Critics question White House's lack of gains from Moscow. Obama Administration supporters believe Russia may offer concessions in the future. In December 2009, NATO and Russia showed willingness to cooperate on missile defense, forming a working group to study the issue. NATO Secretary General hoped for a joint system by 2020, but Russia later criticized the U.S. plan, citing concerns about its nuclear forces. Prime Minister Putin tied discussions over quid pro quo to the issue. In December 2009, Prime Minister Putin linked missile defense talks to the renegotiation of START, stating Moscow's need to strengthen its nuclear forces for strategic balance. The US rejected constraints on its missile defenses, while the US and Poland agreed to deploy Patriot missiles near Kaliningrad in January 2010. Poland plans to deploy Patriots near Kaliningrad, prompting Russia to consider strengthening its Baltic fleet. In February 2010, the US and Romania agreed to host interceptor missiles to extend missile defense into southern Europe. The system is not aimed at Russia, but rather to protect against potential threats from other regions. Russia's general staff chief believes the missile defense system is aimed at Russia, which could hinder arms talks. Moscow is concerned about U.S. Aegis ships in the Black Sea. Russia acknowledges doubts about Iran's uranium enrichment goals. A military analyst admits that SM-3 interceptors in Europe cannot intercept Russian missiles, with Moscow's main objections being lack of consultation and system vulnerability. The Romanian Foreign Ministry stated that Russia was informed about the U.S. missile defense system deployment in Romania. Russia is worried that the SM-3 interceptors could be upgraded without their knowledge, potentially affecting their security. Bulgaria's prime minister expressed support for participating in the missile defense system. Bulgaria's prime minister supported participation in the U.S. missile defense system, which also aimed to protect Russia from Iranian missiles. Russia expressed surprise at the announcement and tried to link missile defense discussions to the renegotiation of START, but the U.S. refused. The New START Treaty was eventually signed in April 2010, acknowledging the relationship between offensive and defensive systems. On July 3, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton and Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski signed an annex allowing the deployment of U.S. BMD in Poland, using SM-3 missiles. NATO officially recognized territorial missile defense as a core alliance objective in response to ballistic missile proliferation threats. The NATO-Russia Council endorsed cooperation in missile defense during their meeting. The NATO-Russia Council endorsed cooperation in missile defense during their meeting, agreeing to discuss pursuing missile defense cooperation, conducting a joint ballistic missile threat assessment, and resuming Theater Missile Defense Cooperation. Russia approved the involvement of Russian technicians in the planning and development of the system, with President Medvedev emphasizing the need for a full-fledged strategic partnership between Russia and NATO in the future. Despite initial reservations, Russia has agreed to cooperate with NATO on missile defense. The United States will not accept any limitations on its missile defense plans. Prime Minister Putin warned that Russia will deploy new missile systems if it feels its nuclear deterrent is compromised. Analysts suggest Russia joined the program to influence its shape as it couldn't block or restrict it otherwise. On December 20, 2010, Foreign Minister Lavrov indicated that Russian acceptance of and participation in NATO missile defense would be fundamental for improved Russia-NATO relations. NATO and the United States want to engage Russia in partnership on BMD, with a plan for Russia and NATO to guard the airspace above their respective territories. NATO countries would shoot down any missiles heading towards Russia over Europe. Moscow seeks agreement on a missile defense plan due to concerns about compromising its nuclear forces. NATO rejects Russia's proposal for a \"common\" system and insists on maintaining independent systems. Analysts note that Russian missile defense technology lags behind NATO's capabilities. NATO emphasizes its responsibility for protecting member states' territory and populations. Negotiations between Russia, the United States, and NATO continued in 2011 regarding missile defense architecture. Key meetings took place between Vice President Biden, President Medvedev, Prime Minister Putin, and military officials. Russia objected to missile defense radar in Turkey and Aegis ships in Spain. Discussions focused on Moscow's proposal for sectoral missile defense and legal guarantees that the shield would not target Russia. NATO rejected Russia's demands for legal guarantees that the missile shield would not target them, as it would compromise alliance defense doctrine. In response, the State Department suggested offering Russia written assurances instead. In 2011, Russian officials opposed NATO's missile defense plans and threatened to develop counter-measures against them. The Russians announced new missiles with counter-measures to thwart missile defenses and potential deployment of Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad. Moscow also plans to base a radar station in the exclave and may withdraw from the New START Treaty. NATO officials reaffirmed their commitment to the EPAA at a meeting with Russia, with NATO Secretary General Rasmussen warning against investing in countermeasures. Some observers speculate that the Russian leadership's hardline stance on missile defense proposals may be driven by domestic political considerations or a desire to create a rift within NATO. In March 2012, Medvedev announced plans to upgrade Russia's nuclear forces in response to the EPAA upgrades, stating the need for dialogue while preparing for potential conflict. President Obama also discussed missile defense with Medvedev during an arms control summit, mentioning his upcoming election. During a conversation with the Russian leader, Obama mentioned his upcoming election and flexibility after the election. Medvedev agreed to relay the message to Putin. Obama's remarks were criticized by Mitt Romney as \"caving\" to Russia. Representative Turner requested clarification, while Biden defended Obama's statement as obvious given the election year context. A State Department official later stated disagreement with Russian preconditions on missile defense deployment. At a NATO summit, alliance leaders declared EPAA to have an \"interim capability,\" with plans for \"initial operational capability\" in 2015 and \"full operational capability\" by 2018. Russian Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Nikolai Makarov expressed openness to considering guarantees but warned of using force preemptively in response to EPAA development. Newly reelected President Putin skipped NATO and G-8 meetings in May 2012. The NATO summit proposed a transparency regime for missile defense cooperation with Russia, reassuring that NATO's missile defense in Europe is not directed against Russia. Despite Russian dissatisfaction, dialogue continues with hopes for cooperation based on precise military information. Legal guarantees of the nontargeting of missile defense against Russian nuclear forces are crucial for cooperation, despite conflicting statements. NATO reassured Russia that their missile defense in Europe is not aimed at them, urging against unnecessary defense budget increases. Putin and Obama discussed missile defense at the G-20, agreeing to seek solutions despite differing views. Russia continues to push for a joint missile defense system and written guarantees, despite NATO's reassurances that their missile defense capability is not directed against Russia. NATO Secretary General Rasmussen highlighted a previous declaration with Russia to not use force against each other, emphasizing continued commitment to this agreement. Russia remains committed to the declaration with NATO that they will not use force against each other. Despite little progress on the missile defense issue, talks between Russia and NATO are ongoing. President Putin stated that the deployment of a missile defense system could worsen relations but emphasized the need for patience and compromise. Russian officials have expressed mixed views on the situation in early 2013. Russian officials sent mixed signals on missile defense in early 2013, calling for legal assurances from NATO and the US. Despite discussions, Russia's position remained unchanged. The Obama Administration announced the curtailment of the fourth phase of EPAA and plans to add interceptors in Alaska. Observers noted this final phase was intended to establish a defense against potential threats. Observers noted that Russia objected to the final phase of the missile defense system in Alaska, prompting an apparent call for dialogue. Russian Defense Minister reached out to Secretary of Defense for discussions, with NATO expressing optimism for negotiations. U.S. Air Force General Breedlove reaffirmed commitment to engage with Russia on missile defense through joint technical studies and exercises. On May 6, 2013, Russia's Deputy Defense Minister responded to the cancellation of the 4th stage of EPAA, stating that \"essentially nothing has changed\" and expressing frustration with the lack of predictability on the American side. He mentioned a potential opportunity to agree on missile defense but dismissed the proposal for written assurances, emphasizing the need for legal guarantees. Additionally, he highlighted concerns about the U.S. side's ability to secure congressional ratification of an agreement and noted that some Members of Congress viewed the missile defense system as a deterrent against Russia. On March 13, 2013, Representative Mo Brooks introduced H.R. 1128, the Protecting U.S. Missile Defense Information Act of 2013, to restrict sharing missile defense capabilities with Russia. In July 2013, the House approved an amendment to prohibit funds for agreements with Russia on missile defenses. Secretary of State Kerry emphasized no concessions to Russia on missile defense. Russian officials insisted on legal guarantees for cooperation. In July 2013, Russia's Security Council secretary expressed optimism about reaching an understanding on missile defense with the U.S., citing the threat from Iran and North Korea. Russia destroyed S-300 missiles intended for Iran in August 2013 and increased naval presence in the Arctic in response to potential NATO/U.S. voyages. The Kremlin objected to the construction of the \"Aegis Ashore\" missile defense facility in Romania in October. In Romania, U.S. Undersecretary for Defense Policy James Miller attended a ceremony at the base in Deveselu. Despite Russia's initial openness to talks on missile defense cooperation, President Putin later scrapped an interagency working group and eliminated the Special Envoy position. Concerns were raised by Lithuania, Poland, and the U.S. State Department over reports of Russia deploying Iskander tactical ballistic missiles to Kaliningrad, within striking range of a planned NATO interceptor site. President Putin later contradicted the initial confirmation, mentioning the possibility of deploying Iskander complexes in Kaliningrad. Russian officials have argued that if Iran halts its nuclear program, there would be no need for the EPAA. In response to Russia's aggressive stance towards Ukraine and Crimea, some policymakers suggest resurrecting the Bush Administration's plan for European ballistic missile defense, which would station interceptors in Poland and a radar facility in the Czech Republic. Reviving the plan is seen as a message of determination to Russia and solidarity to Central and Eastern European allies. Some policymakers suggest resurrecting the Bush Administration's plan for European ballistic missile defense, stationing interceptors in Poland and a radar facility in the Czech Republic. Critics argue that this would not effectively deter Russian ICBMs and propose targeted sanctions as a more effective means of pressuring Russia. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed The European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) in 2009. The European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) was proposed in 2009 to replace the static plan approved during the Bush Administration. The new system, largely sea-based, is designed to defend against threats from Iran and has the capability to take down ICBMs launched from other locations. Aegis-ashore interceptors are set to be installed in Romania in 2015 and in Poland in 2018 as part of NATO's commitment to building a missile defense system in Europe. Russian President Putin has expressed concerns about NATO's missile defense capability. The European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) was proposed in 2009 to replace the static plan approved during the Bush Administration. The new system, largely sea-based, is designed to defend against threats from Iran and has the capability to take down ICBMs launched from other locations. A senior Obama Administration official commented that missile defense \"has never been about Russia.\" Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul suggested ceasing cooperation with Russia on joint missile defense under NATO-Russia Council due to the Ukraine/Crimea crisis. Talks with Russia on missile defense cooperation were suspended by the Administration. U.S.-Russian trade and investment flows have increased post-Cold War, with experts suggesting further expansion. U.S. imports from Russia have grown significantly. U.S. imports from Russia have grown significantly, largely due to the rise in world prices of oil and natural resources. Russia accounted for 1.2% of U.S. imports and 0.7% of U.S. exports in 2013. The United States was the 28th largest export market and 18th largest source of imports for Russia in 2013. By the end of 2012, the United States accounted for less than 0.5% of total foreign investments in Russia. The majority of investments from Russia were repatriated to countries like the Netherlands, Cyprus, and Luxembourg. U.S. exports to Russia have increased, particularly in energy exploration equipment and technology. However, Russia's role as a supplier of U.S. imports is expected to remain small due to the lack of competitiveness in non-natural resource sectors. U.S.-Russian investment relations could strengthen if Russia's business climate improves. The U.S. business concerns about Russian government intervention in energy and other sectors could deter investors. Economic relations between the U.S. and Russia are strained due to the Crimea annexation and confrontation with Ukraine. President Obama imposed sanctions on Russian officials involved in actions against Ukraine, including aides to President Putin and Crimean government members. Former Ukrainian president Yanukovich was also included in the sanctions for seeking Russian intervention. President Obama expanded sanctions on Russian officials involved in actions against Ukraine, including aides to President Putin and Crimean government members. Former Ukrainian president Yanukovich was also sanctioned for seeking Russian intervention in Crimea. U.S. assistance to Russia began after the collapse of the Soviet Union to address nuclear proliferation risks and humanitarian needs, with aid declining over the years. U.S. aid to Russia declined from FY1992 to FY2010, totaling nearly $19 billion. The majority of assistance focused on security programs like CTR (Nunn-Lugar) to prevent WMD proliferation and combat crime. Other aid supported democratization, market reform, and health needs, with conditions set in annual appropriations bills. U.S. aid to Russia, approved in FY1998 and subsequent years, had conditions related to religious freedom, democratization, and human rights. Waivers were issued due to ongoing issues, and aid was tied to Russia's sale of nuclear reactor technology to Iran, resulting in a 60% cut in planned assistance. In recent years, little aid was directly provided to the central government of Russia. Aid conditions included cooperation with international investigations of war crime allegations in Chechnya and access for NGOs. The war crime provision was dropped due to Russian cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. Waivers were issued after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. At the APEC summit in Vladivostok, Clinton learned that Russia planned to end USAID programs by October 1, 2012. Russia criticized USAID for interfering in political processes and stated that the country no longer needed external aid.
