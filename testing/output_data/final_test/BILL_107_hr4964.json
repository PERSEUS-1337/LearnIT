    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Slave Memorial Act\". The Congress acknowledges the historical enslavement of Africans in the United States and the economic benefits derived from slave labor. Africans were treated as chattel upon arrival in North America and provided free labor for over 250 years. Slavery in the United States caused African Americans to suffer enormous damages and losses, including the loss of human dignity, liberty, careers, income, and opportunity. It denied them the fruits of their labor and was an immoral deprivation of life, liberty, and happiness. Despite the achievements of African Americans in overcoming slavery, the nation failed to grant all Americans their rights and cultural heritage. Many African American slaves fought in wars for national freedoms, knowing they would never fully enjoy them. African American art, history, and culture reflect experiences of slavery and freedom, with inadequate recognition of their contributions in society. There is a need for institutions and monuments to promote cultural understanding and enhance racial harmony. On June 19, 1865, the last group of slaves were informed of their freedom, marking the historic abolition of slavery. Congress should recognize this day, express regret to African Americans, and support reconciliation efforts to enhance racial harmony. SEC. 3. NATIONAL SLAVE MEMORIAL. The National Foundation for African American Heritage is authorized to establish a memorial in Washington D.C. to acknowledge the injustice of slavery and honor those who contributed to the United States. The memorial should be located near the Lincoln Memorial. The Secretary of the Interior and the National Capital Memorial Commission must determine a location for the memorial within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. The Foundation, in consultation with the Secretary and the Commission, will solicit design proposals from architects within 6 months and select a design within 2 years. The Secretary of the Interior can accept donations for funding the memorial. The Secretary may accept donations from the Foundation and private sector sources to design, construct, and maintain the memorial. Accepted funds will be deposited into a separate account in the Treasury for this purpose, available for expenditure without further appropriation. The Secretary of the Interior is required to submit periodic reports to Congress every 6 months regarding activities related to the memorial. A final report, including the recommended design of the memorial, must be submitted within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Authorization of appropriations is also included in the Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of the Interior for the Act, with a limitation that at least half of the memorial construction costs must be donated from private sources."
