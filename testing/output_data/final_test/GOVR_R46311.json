    "content": "Robocalls, also known as \"voice broadcasting,\" are the top complaint received by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and a consistent congressional concern. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) regulates robocalls, which are any telephone calls delivering pre-recorded messages using an automatic dialing system. Legal robocalls are used for political, public service, and emergency messages, while illegal ones are associated with fraudulent telemarketing campaigns and often include misleading Caller ID information. The report addresses illegal robocalls using spoofing to deceive recipients by disguising the caller's identity. Scammers use tactics like \"neighbor spoofing\" to make calls appear local or from trusted sources. The number of robocalls in the US continues to rise, fluctuating based on efforts to stop them and robocallers' evolving tactics. In 2019, U.S. consumers received 58.5 billion robocalls, a 22% increase from 2018. The FCC receives over 200,000 complaints about robocalls each year, making it the biggest consumer complaint category. The agency has fined violators of Truth in Caller ID rules and expanded rules to combat spoofed robocalls. The FCC has taken steps to combat illegal robocalls, including allowing voice service providers to offer call-blocking services by default and tracing back illegal spoofed calls. The TRACED Act, signed into law in December 2019, empowers the FCC to take specific actions against robocalls, with potential public benefits estimated at $3 billion annually. The FCC is implementing measures to combat illegal robocalls, including using the STIR/SHAKEN framework to authenticate calls and protect subscribers from unwanted calls. They are also working with the Department of Justice to enforce the prohibition of certain robocalls and considering modifying policies to reduce access to numbers by potential violators. STIR/SHAKEN is crucial for achieving cost savings associated with these efforts. The FCC and the telecommunications industry are working together to combat illegal robocalls by implementing STIR/SHAKEN technology by June 30, 2021. The FCC has expanded rules to allow providers to block calls from suspicious numbers and has authorized measures to stop unwanted text messaging. The FCC has authorized wireless providers to block unwanted text messages and calls, with the implementation of the \"Do Not Originate\" (DNO) Registry. This registry allows blocking of numbers requested by subscribers and unassigned numbers to prevent fraud. USTelecom maintains the registry and collaborates with the industry. The FCC released a public notice seeking comments on call blocking issues mandated by the TRACED Act. Comments were due by January 29, 2020, and reply comments by February 28, 2020. Illegitimate robocallers often spoof their originating number to disguise their identity, making it important for consumers to verify Caller ID information. The telecommunications industry has developed the STIR/SHAKEN framework to verify Caller ID information, reducing illegal spoofing and identifying robocallers. The FCC mandated the adoption of STIR/SHAKEN on March 31, 2020. The USTelecom Industry Traceback Group (ITG) includes over 30 voice service providers to trace illegal robocallers. The USTelecom Industry Traceback Group (ITG) works with law enforcement to trace illegal robocalls, resulting in over 1,000 tracebacks in 2019. This led to more than 20 subpoenas and a status report in January 2020. Reassigned phone numbers can lead to unintentional violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The FCC proposed creating databases to help callers identify reassignments. The FCC proposed creating a reassigned numbers database to help callers verify if a number has been disconnected before calling, to prevent unwanted calls. Public comments were requested on the technical requirements developed for the database by NANC. Additionally, the FCC adopted a ruling to target and eliminate unlawful robocalls. The FCC's ruling empowers phone companies to block illegal robocalls by default and allows consumers to opt in to more aggressive call-blocking tools. Call-blocking programs have become popular and effective, with numerous tools available for different platforms. Providing call-blocking as the default option can increase consumer participation while maintaining choice. The FCC ruling allows phone companies to block illegal robocalls by default and lets consumers opt in to more aggressive call-blocking tools. White-list programs require consumers to specify allowed numbers, with smartphones enabling easy updates. The FCC proposed measures like safe harbor for call authentication failures and protections for critical calls. Comments were due by July 24, 2019, with a focus on measuring robocall solutions' effectiveness. The FCC proposed a safe harbor for voice service providers offering call-blocking programs based on SHAKEN/STIR authentication to limit liability for blocking legal robocalls. They also sought comments on ensuring wanted calls are not blocked and possibly maintaining a \"critical calls list\" of emergency numbers. The FCC proposed a safe harbor for voice service providers offering call-blocking programs based on SHAKEN/STIR authentication to limit liability for blocking legal robocalls. They also sought comments on ensuring wanted calls are not blocked, including a \"critical calls list\" of emergency numbers that must not be blocked. The FCC requested feedback on implementing the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework if major voice providers miss the end-of-2019 deadline for voluntary implementation. They also asked for input on creating a mechanism to inform consumers about the effectiveness of voice providers' robocall solutions. The FCC published new rules requiring Caller ID authentication using STIR/SHAKEN by June 30, 2021. Experts believe this will reduce illegal spoofing and help law enforcement identify bad actors. The FCC also requested public comments on expanding STIR/SHAKEN implementation. The FCC is seeking public comments on expanding STIR/SHAKEN implementation to cover more voice service providers, extending the deadline for small providers by one year, and promoting caller ID authentication on non-IP voice networks. Other actions include enforcing robocall regulations, extending the ban to international callers, and creating a hospital robocall protection group. The FCC has imposed or proposed $240 million in forfeitures against robocallers since January 2017. In 2018, Congress amended the Communications Act to prohibit spoofing activities directed at U.S. consumers from callers outside the United States. The FCC issued rules in July 2019 to expand the prohibition on misleading Caller ID information. The TRACED Act of 2019 mandated the FCC to establish a Hospital Robocall Protection Group to address challenges faced by hospitals due to robocalls. At Tufts Medical Center, administrators received over 4,500 threatening calls in April 2018, with callers speaking in Mandarin and demanding personal information to avoid deportation. The FCC is forming a group to combat unlawful robocalls to hospitals and develop best practices for protection. The FCC has already taken steps to stop illegal robocalls, including imposing fines and requiring call authentication technologies. The FCC has taken steps to combat illegal robocalls, including fines on law breakers and mandating call authentication technologies. Despite these efforts, scammers are persistent in defrauding consumers. While tools are being developed to stop robocalls, it may take time for telecommunications providers to fully implement them, leading to a delay in a long-term decrease in robocall numbers. The FCC's efforts to combat illegal robocalls include fines and call authentication technologies. Despite these measures, scammers continue to defraud consumers. Congress may oversee the impact of FCC initiatives on fraudulent robocalls and the potential negative effects on the telemarketing industry."
