    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community AIDS and Hepatitis Prevention Act\". Congress finds that approximately 12,000 Americans contract HIV/AIDS and 19,000 contract hepatitis C annually from contaminated syringes. Studies show syringe exchange programs effectively reduce HIV transmission and are cost-effective. Additionally, these programs are crucial in preventing the transmission of hepatitis B and C. Syringe exchange programs are crucial in preventing the transmission of hepatitis B and C, as they provide counseling, testing, education, and tools to reduce health risks related to drug use. These programs also offer links to addiction treatment, overdose prevention, and referrals to other medical and social services. Syringe exchange programs reduce HIV prevalence among injection drug users by providing safe disposal of used injection equipment and increasing referral rates to addiction treatment. They also significantly decrease the number of improperly discarded syringes in the community, reducing the risk of blood-borne diseases for police, sanitation workers, and children. Syringe exchange programs reduce HIV prevalence among injection drug users and decrease improperly discarded syringes in the community. Supported by various American scientific and professional organizations. According to recent data from the CDC, in 2005, 185 syringe exchanges were operating in 36 States, the District of Columbia, and supported by various American scientific and professional organizations. Despite the consensus on the effectiveness of syringe exchange programs in reducing HIV, a ban on funding for such programs has been in place since 1998. However, the ban on the District of Columbia's use of its own funds for needle exchange programs was lifted in 2008. This change aims to empower localities to use their funding efficiently to prevent HIV and viral hepatitis. The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 imposes a ban on funding needle exchange programs. Federal funds can be used for syringe exchange programs to reduce the transmission of bloodborne pathogens, including HIV and viral hepatitis."
