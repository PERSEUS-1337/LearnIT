    "content": "The P-R Act directs proceeds from federal excise taxes on firearms and ammunition to the Wildlife Restoration Trust Fund for wildlife programs and hunter education. The tax, dating back to 1919, is 10% for pistols and revolvers, 11% for other firearms, shells, and cartridges, collected by manufacturers and also applies to imports. An 11% tax on archery equipment also contributes to the Fund. The P-R tax includes excise taxes on pistols, revolvers, firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment. Total collections from firearms and ammunition taxes were $749.8 million in FY2016 and $761.6 million in FY2017. One-third of the non-archery excise tax revenues come from pistols and revolvers, other firearms, and ammunition. Funds collected in a fiscal year are available for expenditure in the following fiscal year. The P-R tax has exemptions for the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations. The Pittman-Robertson tax, administered by the TTB, includes excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment. Exemptions exist for the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations. Producers of fewer than 50 guns annually and personal-use exemptions are also in place. The ATF previously administered the tax before it was transferred to the Department of Justice in 2002. The Pittman-Robertson tax, administered by the TTB, includes excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment. The tax revenues support wildlife restoration and hunter education, similar to gasoline taxes for roads. The funds go into the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Congress provided a permanent appropriation for the fund, distributed to states and territories. The Pittman-Robertson tax funds wildlife restoration and hunter education. Interest on the fund goes to the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund. Funds are allocated based on relevant sections of the P-R Act for administration, hunter education grants, safety programs, firearm and archery ranges, and multistate conservation projects. The Pittman-Robertson tax funds wildlife restoration and hunter education programs for state fish and game departments. States and territories receive funds for basic hunter education and wildlife restoration projects, with a 75% federal cost-share cap. Eligible entities include the 50 states, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. States and territories receive funds in two phases from the Pittman-Robertson tax for wildlife restoration and hunter education programs. A preliminary apportionment is made each October based on early data, with a final apportionment in February. FWS may deduct administrative expenses, with an annual cap of $10.1 million from FY2007 to FY2017. The P-R Act limits administrative expenses to personnel, support, and administration costs related to the P-R Trust Fund. $8.0 million annually has been allocated for firearm and bow hunter education and safety program grants since FY2003. These grants support hunter education, development, and safety activities. Enhanced Hunter Education grants, accounting for 1.72% of the average annual apportionment from FY2007 to FY2017, support hunter education, development, and safety activities. Grants are distributed to states based on population ratios, with a maximum of $3.0 million set aside annually for Multistate Conservation Grants. The federal share of costs for eligible projects is capped at 75%, with a waiver possible for some territories. Eligible territories receive a fixed percentage of the set-aside funds. Multistate conservation grants, accounting for 0.65% of average annual apportionments from FY2007 to FY2017, benefit multiple states or regional fish and game departments. These grants can be awarded to states, the FWS, or NGOs for activities outlined in the program. The remaining apportionments are divided between two funding programs, with 95.48% going to states. Half of the excise tax on certain items is allocated to states for hunter education programs, receiving $91.4 million annually on average during the same period. The Education program received $91.4 million annually from FY2007 through FY2017, with apportionment based on state population. The federal cost share is capped at 75%. Wildlife restoration projects received an average of $419.6 million annually during the same period, with a small percentage allocated to territories. The apportionment for wildlife restoration activities is divided in half based on state area and paid hunting licenses. States receive between 0.5% and 5% of the total amount apportioned. The federal cost share is capped at 75%. Federal regulations on firearms include the 1934 National Firearms Act and the Gun Control Act of 1968. The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) contains federal restrictions on firearms and ammunition not covered by the National Firearms Act (NFA). The ATF administers both laws, with tax receipts totaling $68.6 million in FY2016. The GCA requires federal licensing for those manufacturing, importing, or selling firearms as a business, and prohibits certain interstate firearms transfers and sales. The Gun Control Act of 1968 imposes federal restrictions on firearms and ammunition, requiring licensing for manufacturers, importers, and dealers. Dealers must maintain records of commercial gun sales. Fees for non-NFA firearms include a $150 license fee every three years for manufacturers and importers, and a $200 license fee for the first three years for dealers. To deal in NFA firearms, individuals need to be licensed under the GCA and NFA, with fees of $3,000 every three years for manufacturers, importers, and dealers. The National Firearms Act (NFA) imposes special occupational taxes on manufacturers, importers, and dealers of firearms. Manufacturers and importers with gross receipts under $500,000 pay a reduced tax, while dealers pay $500 per year. The NFA also imposes a $200 \"making\" tax on unlicensed individuals who build NFA firearms and a $200 transfer tax for transfers of NFA firearms. These taxes have not been increased since 1934. ATF places a tax stamp on approved transfers before the transferee can take possession of the firearm. The NFA regulates the transfer of NFA firearms, requiring ATF approval before possession. Unlicensed individuals can acquire NFA firearms through approved transfers, making and registering one (except machine guns), or inheriting one. Registration with the Attorney General is mandatory for production and distribution tracking. The ATF maintains the National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record (NFRTR) for NFA firearms. It is illegal to possess or transfer an unregistered NFA firearm. The NFA regulates the transfer of NFA firearms through ATF approval. It is illegal to possess or transfer an unregistered NFA firearm. Recent legislative proposals include the Hearing Protection Act (HPA) to shift silencers out of NFA coverage and increase firearm excise taxes. In the 115th Congress, the HPA would remove firearm silencers from NFA regulation but allow for some regulation under the GCA. The Hearing Protection Act (HPA) aims to change the regulation of firearm silencers, shifting them out of NFA coverage and increasing firearm excise taxes. The HPA was reported as Title XV of the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act (H.R. 3668) in the 115th Congress. Firearm silencers are currently regulated under the NFA and the GCA, with definitions under the GCA including any device for silencing, muffling, or diminishing the report of a portable firearm. The Hearing Protection Act (HPA) aims to change the regulation of firearm silencers, shifting them out of NFA coverage and increasing firearm excise taxes. H.R. 3668 would preempt state or local taxes on silencers and prevent marking or recordkeeping requirements, redefining firearm silencers and mufflers. The Hearing Protection Act (HPA) aims to change the regulation of firearm silencers, shifting them out of NFA coverage and increasing firearm excise taxes. H.R. 3668 would require FFL manufacturers and importers to identify silencers by a serial number and levy a 10% P-R excise tax on the making or importing of silencers. Several Congresses have considered proposals to amend the P-R Act. In the 115th Congress, various bills were introduced to amend the P-R Act, allowing states to use more funds for public target-range projects by adjusting the federal cost-share cap. Similar proposals were also introduced in the 114th Congress. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to increase the federal cost-share cap for public shooting ranges from 75% to 90% for land acquisition, expansion, and construction. This adjustment would not affect the cap of 75% for range operation and other activities. The bills introduced in the 115th Congress aimed to increase the federal cost-share cap for public shooting ranges from 75% to 90% for land acquisition, expansion, and construction. This provision allows states to access up to 10% of the funds for enhanced education and safety grant money. The deadline for using grant money for these purposes would also be extended. The bills aim to extend the deadline for using grant money for land acquisition, construction, and expansion related to target ranges from one fiscal year to five fiscal years. They also emphasize cooperation between federal agencies and state/local authorities for waste-removal activities at public target ranges on federal lands. Additionally, the bills include language on \"limits on liability\" for actions related to the management of federal land for target-shooting purposes. The bills in the 115th Congress aim to broaden the purposes of the P-R Act to include funding for hunter and recreational shooter recruitment and retention activities. This includes providing financial and technical assistance to states for promoting hunting and recreational shooting. Additionally, the bills amend the Multistate Conservation Grant Program section within the P-R Act to allocate up to $5 million for grants to support hunter and recreational shooter recruitment. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, various legislative proposals were introduced related to the Pittman-Robertson Act (P-R Act). These proposals included funding for state wildlife authorities for Mexican gray wolf management, transferring revenues from energy and mineral development for conservation, and extending the date for interest earned on P-R funds. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to extend the availability of interest earned on obligations in the P-R fund for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended the interest availability to FY2026. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 167 proposed increasing excise taxes on ammunition to provide assistance to the Teacher Victims Family Trust. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to extend interest availability for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 167 proposed increasing excise taxes on ammunition to support the Teacher Victims Family Trust. Representatives Pascrell and Danny K. Davis reintroduced the Gun Violence Prevention and Safe Communities Act as H.R. 4214, which includes proposals to modify the treatment of silencers and increase excise taxes on firearms. The bill proposed increasing excise taxes on firearms and ammunition, with additional revenues allocated for various purposes including hiring law enforcement personnel, gun violence research, and school discipline strategies. It also included doubling occupational taxes for importers, manufacturers, and dealers. The proposed bill aimed to increase transfer taxes on firearms and other weapons, adjusting for inflation. It also sought to reclassify certain semiautomatic pistols as firearms subject to a higher transfer tax. Additionally, another bill in the 113th Congress and H.R. 3830 in the 114th Congress proposed additional taxes on firearm sales, with proceeds allocated for mental health services and crime control initiatives. The bill proposed in the 113th Congress aimed to impose a 10% retail tax on concealable firearms and establish a database of lost or stolen firearms. It also included grants for firearm buyback programs funded by the new tax revenues. None of the tax increase proposals were further pursued in subsequent Congresses."
