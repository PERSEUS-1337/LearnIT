    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act of 2003\". Congress finds that Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native Village Corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) for the Native Village of Saxman. Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under ANCSA, unlike other village corporations in Southeast Alaska. Cape Fox was also restricted from selecting lands within six miles of the boundary of the City of Ketchikan to protect the watersheds in the area. The six mile restriction limited Cape Fox Corporation's land selections, preventing them from choosing valuable timber lands and commercial properties in their core township and surrounding areas. This restriction also forced them to select nonproductive land in the remote mountainous northeast corner of their township. Additionally, Cape Fox was further restricted by the presence of the Annette Island Indian Reservation within their selection area, making those lands unavailable for ANCSA selection. Sealaska Corporation, the Alaska native regional corporation for Southeast Alaska, needs to adjust its selections and conveyances to avoid split estates with National Forest System lands. There is a need to resolve existing areas of Sealaska/Tongass split estate, where Sealaska holds rights to subsurface lands that affect management of Tongass National Forest surface lands. The Tongass National Forest lands identified in this Act for selection by Cape Fox and Sealaska aim to resolve land entitlement issues without impacting forest resources. Adjustments to Cape Fox and Sealaska's land selections under ANCSA are in accordance with the Act's purposes and the public interest. SEC. 3. Cape Fox is waived from selecting 160 acres of Federal lands. SEC. 4. Selection allowed outside exterior boundary. Cape Fox may select approximately 99 acres of surface estate in Tongass National Forest outside their current boundary. Upon selection, the Secretary of the Interior will convey the surface estate to Cape Fox and the subsurface estate to Sealaska. The Secretary of the Interior will convey the subsurface estate to Sealaska within 180 days of receiving notice of Cape Fox's selection of surface estate in Tongass National Forest. SEC. 5. EXCHANGE OF LANDS BETWEEN CAPE FOX AND THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST. The Secretary of Agriculture will exchange Federal lands in Tongass National Forest with Cape Fox for lands identified by Cape Fox. Cape Fox has 60 days to identify lands to be exchanged to the United States. Cape Fox must identify lands for exchange with the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior within 60 days. The identified lands, totaling approximately 2,900 acres, must be contiguous to National Forest System lands and in compact tracts. A public trail easement designated on a map dated March 15, 2002, must be included unless agreed otherwise. The easement's value will be considered in the total land exchange value. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine if Cape Fox's identified lands are equal in value to the lands described in subsection (b). If not, additional Cape Fox lands will be identified for exchange. Federal lands offered to Cape Fox will include surface and subsurface estate, subject to valid existing rights. The Secretary of Agriculture will aim to finalize an agreement with Cape Fox within 90 days of the Act's enactment for a land exchange. The exchange must be completed promptly after the agreement is signed, with the Secretary of the Interior conveying Federal lands to Cape Fox within 180 days of the agreement's execution. SEC. 6. EXCHANGE OF LANDS BETWEEN SEALASKA AND THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST. Upon conveyance of Cape Fox lands and relinquishment by Sealaska, the Secretary of the Interior will convey Federal lands to Sealaska. Sealaska will select approximately 9,329 acres from Tongass National Forest lands for exchange. The lands are designated on a map available for inspection in Juneau, Alaska. Within 60 days of Cape Fox's identification of exchange lands, the process will proceed. Sealaska will identify lands for exchange with Cape Fox in no more than two contiguous tracts. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine if the selected lands are of equal value and may adjust the amount. The exchange conveyance will include surface and subsurface estate, subject to valid existing rights and ANCSA provisions. Sealaska will exchange lands with the United States, including subsurface estate under Cape Fox and Tongass National Forest, as well as rights to additional subsurface estate. The Secretary of Agriculture aims to finalize the agreement within 90 days of Sealaska's land selection. Sealaska will exchange lands with the United States, including subsurface estate under Cape Fox and Tongass National Forest. The Secretary of Agriculture aims to finalize the agreement within 90 days of Sealaska's land selection. The exchange agreement will be signed promptly, and the Secretary of the Interior will complete the interim conveyance of Federal lands to Sealaska within 180 days. This agreement will modify the Sealaska Corporation/United States Forest Service Split Estate Exchange Agreement. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The exchanges under this Act must be of equal value, with Cape Fox and Sealaska providing estimates of land value. They must convey title to the Secretary of Agriculture for lands to be exchanged. Parties are not liable for hazardous substances in the land. The Act does not affect ANCSA selections. (d) Any conveyance of Federal lands to Cape Fox or Sealaska under this Act is considered as land conveyed under ANCSA, with no change to their total land entitlement. They will be responsible for lands exchanged or conveyed under this Act, but not for lands received under specific sections. The exchanges will result in conveyances to Native Corporations under ANCSA, and lands transferred to the United States will be part of the Tongass National Forest. (e) Lands conveyed or selected will not affect Statehood selections. The Act specifies that lands conveyed to or selected by the State of Alaska under the Alaska Statehood Act cannot be selected or conveyed without Alaska's consent. Maps referenced in the Act will be kept in the Forest Service Region 10 Regional Office in Juneau, Alaska. Federal lands conveyed to Cape Fox or Sealaska will only be subject to agreed-upon public easements. The Act specifies that lands conveyed under this Act must have easements for access to national forest or public lands. The Secretary of Agriculture will add an equal number of acres to old growth reserves on the Tongass National Forest as are transferred out of Federal ownership.
