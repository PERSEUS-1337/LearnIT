    "content": "The Act titled \"Black Carbon and Other Aerosols Research Act of 2009\" is for the purpose of conducting research on black carbon and other aerosols. The Act aims to develop a monitoring and research plan to identify sources of black carbon and other aerosols, assess their impact on climate change and air quality, and focus on their regional impacts, especially in polar regions and snow-covered areas. The Act aims to estimate black carbon and other aerosol concentrations globally, develop models to understand their transport and impact on climate, and collaborate with partners to improve knowledge on their distributions and climate-forcing properties. The Act aims to estimate black carbon and other aerosol concentrations globally and establish a monitoring and research program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Act aims to estimate black carbon and other aerosol concentrations globally and establish a monitoring and research program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Black carbon\" is a light-absorbing aerosol produced by incomplete combustion of fuels, biofuel, and biomass, associated with air quality and climate change. \"Other aerosols\" are fine particles in the air contributing to climate change, including inorganic, organic, dust, and carbonaceous components. \"Other aerosols are fine particles in the air contributing to climate change, including inorganic, organic, dust, and carbonaceous substances.\" SEC. 4. BLACK CARBON AND OTHER AEROSOLS MONITORING AND RESEARCH PLAN. The Administrator is required to develop a plan for monitoring, modeling, and researching black carbon and other aerosols. This plan includes analyzing gaps in scientific methods, identifying research priorities, and creating a framework for modeling the effects of these pollutants on climate change and air quality at regional and global scales. The plan developed by the Administrator focuses on studying the impact of black carbon and other aerosols on climate at regional and global scales. This includes analyzing their transportation, transformation, influence on clouds, and appropriate methods for identifying sources and measuring atmospheric concentrations. The Administrator will establish a Black Carbon and Other Aerosols Advisory Panel to assist in developing and implementing a monitoring and research program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A report must be submitted to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House within 270 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will establish a Black Carbon and Other Aerosols Advisory Panel to assist in developing a monitoring and research program. A report must be submitted to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Science and Technology. SEC. 5. BLACK CARBON AND OTHER AEROSOLS RESEARCH AND MONITORING PROGRAM. The Administrator will establish a black carbon and other aerosols monitoring and research program under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This program includes coordinated monitoring and research activities to understand sources, concentrations, and interactions of black carbon and aerosols on climate change regionally and globally, as well as strategic modeling activities to improve knowledge of aerosol transportation and transformation. The black carbon and other aerosols monitoring and research program under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to understand their roles in climate change on regional and global scales. It includes educational opportunities for interdisciplinary exploration, increased interactions between measurement and modeling communities, and public outreach activities to improve scientific knowledge. The Administrator will establish a grant program for research on black carbon and other aerosols' impact on climate change, coordination with relevant agencies, and assessing their role in climate change and air quality. The Administrator will establish a grant program for research on reducing the impacts of black carbon and other aerosols on climate. This includes consultation with the Black Carbon and Other Aerosols Advisory Panel, collaboration with federal agencies, and awarding grants through a competitive peer-reviewed process. The Administrator will coordinate with other agencies for the development of the plan and research program. They have the authority to execute contracts, leases, grants, or agreements as needed for the purposes of the Act. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 includes $10,000,000 for grants under section 5(b) and $10,000,000 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
