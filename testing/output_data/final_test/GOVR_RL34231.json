    "content": "As of January 2011, there have been four Directors of National Intelligence (DNIs). Ambassador John Negroponte was the first DNI, confirmed on April 21, 2005. He was succeeded by retired Admiral J. Michael McConnell on February 7, 2007, and then by retired Admiral Dennis C. Blair on January 28, 2009. Blair resigned on May 28, 2010. On May 20, 2010, Blair resigned as DNI, and on August 9, 2010, James R. Clapper, Jr. was sworn in as the fourth DNI. The Director of Central Intelligence had responsibilities for providing national intelligence to the President and Congress, heading the intelligence community, and managing the annual budget for national intelligence programs. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) had various responsibilities, including overseeing the National Intelligence Program (NIP), heading the CIA, and conducting covert actions. Critics argued that the DCI position was unworkable, leading to poorly coordinated intelligence efforts and a lack of legal authority to establish priorities. The DCI position faced criticism for limited authority and poor coordination among intelligence agencies, with major agencies in the Department of Defense prioritizing military needs over national policy requirements. The 9/11 Commission recommended replacing the DCI with a National position. The 9/11 Commission recommended replacing the DCI with a National Intelligence Director to oversee the national intelligence program. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 established the position of DNI and a separate head of the CIA, but there were disagreements over the DNI's authorities, particularly regarding budget preparation and execution for intelligence agencies in DOD. The act included a provision (\u00a71018) for the President to issue guidelines ensuring the DNI's authorities respect other departments' statutory responsibilities. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 established the position of DNI and a separate head of the CIA. The DNI has not issued guidelines to respect other departments' statutory responsibilities, leading to no calls for such guidelines from DOD or other agencies. The DNI's responsibilities include providing intelligence to senior officials and Congress, heading the intelligence community, and overseeing the CIA through the DCIA. The DNI's responsibilities include gathering intelligence through various means, evaluating and disseminating it for national security, coordinating collection by human sources outside the U.S., performing other intelligence-related duties as directed by the President or DNI, and coordinating relationships between U.S. and foreign intelligence services. In April 2007, DNI McConnell expressed concerns about lacking sufficient authority to lead the 16-agency intelligence community. DNI McConnell expressed concerns about lacking authority to lead the 16-agency intelligence community, as he did not have direct line management authority over every agency except CIA. The executive branch submitted an FY2008 Intelligence Authorization Act to strengthen the DNI's authorities. McConnell also announced a \"100 Day Plan\" to improve integration and collaboration within the intelligence community by clarifying roles and responsibilities of agency heads and DNI authority. In 2008, President George W. Bush revised Executive Order 12333 to define the roles and mission of the intelligence community. DNI Blair and Gen. Clapper expressed their intentions to exercise their authorities fully and improve them. Congressional intelligence committees had differing approaches to the issue of DNI authorities. The Senate Intelligence Committee approved proposals to strengthen DNI authorities in the FY2008 Intelligence Authorization Act, while the House Intelligence Committee adopted a more limited approach. The Senate FY2009 bill aimed to give the DNI new authorities, including increased employee compensation and extended detail periods. The Senate Intelligence Committee approved enhanced pay authority and new authorities for the DNI in the FY2008 Intelligence Authorization Act. The House bill would have provided the DNI with a more limited number of new authorities. The House Intelligence Committee expressed disappointment in the DNI's lack of coordination within the Intelligence Community and inconsistency in setting goals. They proposed enhancements to DNI authorities in the FY2009 authorization bills. The House Intelligence Committee proposed enhancements to DNI authorities in the FY2009 authorization bills, which were approved by the House but not by the full Senate. In September 2010, both the House and Senate passed intelligence authorization legislation for FY2010, providing additional oversight and authority to the DNI. The DNI is tasked with assessing personnel levels, conducting vulnerability assessments, reviewing acquisition costs, and submitting budget projections and intelligence plans. New provisions give the DNI greater management authorities over the Intelligence Community, supplementing the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act. Intelligence authorization legislation for FY2011 and FY2012 did not extensively address the DNI's authorities, but rather reflected ongoing oversight by the intelligence committees. Congress approved the Intelligence Reform Act in 2004 to strengthen the DNI's authority. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 granted the DNI additional powers, including control over the budgets of the 16 intelligence agencies. Some question if the DNI will assert this authority effectively. The act also provides new budget authorities that were previously unavailable to DCIs. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 granted the DNI more control over intelligence community spending by allowing the OMB to direct funds to agencies and departments. This change strengthens the DNI's authority over budget allocation and allows for consequences if agencies do not comply with spending priorities. Additionally, the DNI now has the power to develop and determine the National Intelligence Program budget, giving them more control than DCIs had. The DNI has increased control over intelligence community spending, with authority to develop and determine the National Intelligence Program budget. They also have the power to ensure effective budget execution and provide guidance to non-NIP elements. The DNI's influence on DOD intelligence spending is extensive, similar to DCIs but with stronger budget authorities. The Secretary of Defense retains substantial budgetary and administrative powers not affected by the 2004 legislation. The Intelligence Reform Act grants the DNI authority to participate in developing military intelligence programs. DNI Clapper intended to submit an independent National Intelligence Program budget but faced opposition. The DNI can transfer NIP funds with OMB approval after consulting department heads, unlike DCIs who needed parties' approval. The DNI can also transfer personnel within the intelligence community for specific periods. The Intelligence Reform Act grants the DNI expanded appointment authority and allows for the transfer of personnel within the intelligence community for specific periods. The DNI's \"concurrence\" is required for certain appointments, unlike the more limited DCI appointment authorities. The DNI has broader appointment authority compared to the DCI, including milestone decision authority on major acquisitions and managing national intelligence tasks. The NCTC director reports to the DNI under the Intelligence Reform Act. The NCTC director reports to the DNI for counterterrorism intelligence analysis and operations, and to the President for national interagency counterterrorism policy. The NCTC's authorities extend across the executive branch, raising concerns about interpretation by different agencies. The Intelligence Reform Act requires the President to issue guidelines for the DNI's authorities, which some believe could weaken them. Ambiguities in the Act regarding relationships among agencies with their own authorities may impact the DNI's role. The 112th Congress may focus on the DNI's relationships with the Defense Department and law enforcement. The Intelligence Reform Act grants the DNI more authority than DCIs had under the National Security Act of 1947. The DNI's overall authority will depend on factors like assertiveness, support from the President and Congress, and establishing a transparent budget process."
