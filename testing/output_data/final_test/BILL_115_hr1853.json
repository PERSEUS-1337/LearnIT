The \"Kalief Browder Reentry Success Act of 2017\" or \"Kalief's Law\" establishes a pilot program for mental health services in correctional facilities before individuals are released from custody. The \"Kalief Browder Reentry Success Act of 2017\" establishes a pilot program for mental health services in correctional facilities before individuals are released from custody, ensuring access to mental health services, psychiatric medications, medical records, and assistance with housing, employment, and personal records post-release. The pilot program under the \"Kalief Browder Reentry Success Act of 2017\" requires State and local correctional facilities to submit an application to the Attorney General, including a plan for providing specified services. The Attorney General will select 5 Federal correctional facilities for the program, prioritizing those with a high percentage of prisoners in restrictive housing. The pilot program under the \"Kalief Browder Reentry Success Act of 2017\" requires correctional facilities to submit an application to the Attorney General, prioritizing those with high rates of restrictive housing or recidivism. At least one facility for males and one for females must participate, while private facilities are ineligible. The program will terminate on a specified date. The pilot program under the \"Kalief Browder Reentry Success Act of 2017\" will terminate 2 years after funds are distributed to participating correctional facilities. A report must be submitted to Congress within 1 year after the program concludes, detailing demographics of individuals using mental health services, conditions at facilities, and use of restrictive housing. The section discusses statistics and information related to individuals in restrictive housing, including employment, housing, education, mental health treatment, recidivism, and reincarceration. The term \"eligible individual\" is defined as someone serving a term of imprisonment or detained pending trial, set to be released within 180 days. The pilot program allows for incarceration in restrictive housing within 180 days of receiving funds. Restrictive housing involves removal from the general inmate population, placement in a locked room, and inability to leave for most of the day. $20,000,000 is authorized for the program annually from 2018 to 2020."
