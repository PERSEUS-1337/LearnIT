    "content": "Recent events have renewed congressional interest in safe management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. The report focuses on the current situation with spent nuclear fuel storage in the United States, primarily at current and former reactor facilities for the foreseeable future. No nation has established a permanent disposal repository for high-level radioactive waste yet. In the United States, the debate over a disposal repository for high-level radioactive waste, including SNF, has been ongoing for decades. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository was terminated in 2009, leading to uncertainty over long-term storage solutions. Key issues include strategies for interim SNF storage, location of storage facilities, and management structures. The Blue Ribbon Commission's report has sparked a renewed debate on these topics. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future released its final report in January 2012, modifying a draft from July 2011 after extensive public testimony. Debates include safety concerns, with some advocating for wider use of dry storage methods. Cost and investment impacts are also considered, with recommendations for interim centralized storage at a volunteer location. Some recommend limited consolidation of interim SNF storage at existing operational reactor sites, using wet pool and dry cask storage technologies. Senator Dianne Feinstein emphasizes the need to rethink spent fuel management, transitioning from pools to dry cask storage after 5-7 years. In California, fuel assemblies are re-racked in wet spent fuel pools for long-term storage. Reports from Japan show no issues with dry cask storage at Dai-ichi, prompting consideration for quicker movement of spent fuel to dry cask storage. Senator Feinstein urges NRC to encourage the transfer of nuclear fuel from pools to dry cask storage systems, citing a 2006 NAS study on safety and security of spent nuclear fuel storage. Senator Feinstein urged the NRC to expedite the transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage for safety and security reasons. The NRC has included spent nuclear fuel storage needs in its Fukushima Dai-ichi incident response. There is a push for consolidated interim storage of spent nuclear fuel to enhance safety and security, as well as fulfill federal obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The issue of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage has faced opposition despite widespread support. Worldwide, there are operational and shut-down nuclear power reactors, with no country having established a permanent disposal site for SNF. The United States, like other nations, relies on long-term SNF storage. The United States has a permanent geological repository for plutonium-contaminated waste in New Mexico called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). It does not accept spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or high-level waste, but is seen as a model for waste facility siting efforts globally. Other countries store SNF in pools or dry cask facilities despite lacking permanent disposal sites. The United States stores substantial amounts of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in pools or dry cask facilities, despite the ongoing delay in opening a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain. Long-term storage of SNF will be necessary regardless of the progress on disposal repositories. The United States faces challenges in storing spent nuclear fuel due to delays in opening a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. Despite the need for long-term storage, current laws limit the amount of waste that can be placed in the first repository, leading to a requirement for commercial interim storage until at least 2056. The current quantity of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste being stored would exceed the legal limit set by Congress for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository, requiring the need for a second repository or a change in the legal limit. DOE has determined that Yucca Mountain could hold more than the 70,000 MTU limit imposed by Congress. The Yucca Mountain repository could hold more than the legal limit of 70,000 MTU and has the physical capability for a larger inventory. Safe long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel is important, even if a permanent geologic repository is debated. MIT suggests planning for interim storage for about a century. Concerns about a permanent repository have led to increased attention on long-term storage options. After the failure of the salt dome waste repository program near Lyons, KS, the Atomic Energy Commission proposed a program for long-term retrievable surface storage in 1972. Amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1987 established the Monitored Retrievable Storage Commission and the position of the \"Nuclear Waste Negotiator.\" Congress attempted to establish a temporary consolidated storage site for commercial spent nuclear fuel near Yucca Mountain in the 1990s. Analysts suggest interim on-site storage using dry casks as a viable option for SNF. Interim on-site storage or SDNF using dry casks is a viable option for spent fuel, recommended for at least 100 years. Stored spent nuclear fuel (SNF) outside of a reactor requires durable protection due to its long-term radioactivity source term for risk analyses. While an operating reactor contains more radioactivity in terms of curie content, stored SNF includes more volatile constituents. Despite some releases of radioactivity from stored SNF, there is no evidence of consequent hazards. Significant concerns have been raised about potential releases from stored spent nuclear fuel (SNF), especially after the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident in Japan. Extended storage raises worries about long-term site safety, including risks from extreme weather and sea level rise. The NRC found that sea level rise is not a credible threat to existing and planned on-site nuclear waste storage for the next few decades. The federal government faces a growing liability to pay claims from commercial utilities for failure to accept nuclear waste. Claims have been ongoing since 2000, stemming from contracts signed in 1983. The federal government is facing increasing liability for failing to accept nuclear waste, with estimated annual storage costs of $500 million. Concerns about nuclear waste management have hindered investment in new nuclear power plants, leading to industry stagnation. The federal government's failure to address nuclear waste management is hindering the expansion of nuclear power plants. Public acceptance of nuclear energy relies on the availability of a geologic repository for nuclear waste. The current impasse in the U.S. nuclear waste program is seen as a barrier to future nuclear power development. The federal government's failure to address nuclear waste management is hindering the expansion of nuclear power plants, damaging prospects for maintaining an important energy supply option for the future, state-federal relations, and America's standing in the world. States have imposed their own controls on spent nuclear fuel management, with some prohibiting new nuclear power plant construction until the waste problem is solved. The report provides background on spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage, detailing the composition of fuel assemblies in commercial nuclear reactors. The differences in design between boiling water reactors (BWR) and pressurized water reactors (PWR) impact how SNF is stored. The production of electricity in light water reactors uses low-enriched uranium pellets undergoing nuclear fission to generate steam for electricity. Fuel rods last around 54 months, with refueling every 18 months replacing one-third of assemblies. Spent fuel is removed when no longer cost-effective for power generation. The accumulation of radionuclides from uranium fission reduces power output in nuclear reactors, requiring removal of spent fuel assemblies to maintain electricity generation. These assemblies operate for about 4\u00bd years before storage and disposal. Commercial reactors in the US produce around 2,000 MT of spent nuclear fuel annually, which requires careful management for thousands of years. The report focuses on commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from commercial nuclear power plants, contrasting it with smaller quantities of other types of SNF from DOE production reactors, research reactors, and naval propulsion reactors. The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has generated about 27 MTU of SNF stored at the Idaho National Laboratory, which is DOE-owned. The Idaho National Laboratory stores DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF), which makes up less than 4% of the commercial SNF in the US. These noncommercial SNF types have different designs but share the same radioactivity hazard. Technical issues related to long-term storage apply to both commercial and noncommercial SNF. The DOE-owned SNF inventory does not include liquid high-level waste or vitrified high-level waste. SNF in the US is stored in wet pools and dry casks, with wet storage pools being the most common method. The United States stores about 73% of commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) inventory, with the remaining 27% stored in dry casks. SNF is stored in spent fuel pools for initial cooling before being transferred to dry cask storage due to limited wet storage capacity. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates both wet fuel pools and dry cask installations for SNF storage. Wet storage pools have reinforced concrete walls with stainless steel liners and are filled with water to shield workers from radiation and cool the SNF assemblies. Currently, commercial nuclear reactors in the United States are light water reactors, with two basic designs: boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The designs of the pool storage basins vary significantly among different reactor designs, often unique to each plant. The cooling water chemistry is carefully controlled to minimize corrosion in the storage pools where fuel rods are stored vertically. The design of storage pools for GE Mark I BWR reactors, used in the United States and worldwide, has raised safety concerns. The SNF storage pool is located inside the secondary containment structure, above ground level, with a water capacity of 400,000 gallons. The SNF storage capacities at U.S. commercial power reactors range from 2,000 to 5,000 assemblies, with an average of 3,000 assemblies. Wet storage pools are typically filled up to three-quarters capacity to allow space for one full reactor core load of fuel. Fukushima Dai-ichi site has a separate wet storage pool building with 6,000 spent fuel assemblies, while U.S. facilities do not have an additional storage building for SNF consolidation. Dry casks are used for on-site SNF storage, unlike wet pools which require power for circulation to prevent boiling off of water. Dry casks consist of a steel canister storing SNF assemblies inside a concrete cask, stored vertically or horizontally outside. Each cask can weigh over 100 MT. Dry casks are used for on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in concrete bunkers. These casks can weigh over 100 MT and vary in size. Different types of dry casks can hold varying numbers of spent fuel assemblies, with storage capacity dependent on the fuel's burn-up and age. There are over 50 types of dry casks approved by the NRC for use in the United States, regulated under 10 C.F.R. 72. Dry storage units for spent nuclear fuel do not require power for cooling, relying on natural convection of air. In contrast, wet storage pool systems need power for water circulation. Dry cask storage proved robust during an earthquake in 2011 near a nuclear power plant. The NRC regulates dry storage of spent nuclear fuel, with general and site-specific licenses issued. Dry storage units do not need power for cooling and proved robust during an earthquake in 2011. The first commercial dry storage system in the US was established in 1986 at the North Anna nuclear power plant site. The use of dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel has increased rapidly since 1986. In 2010, 8,606 assemblies were transferred to dry cask storage, almost four times the average annual transfer rate since 1986. The amount of fuel stored in wet pools compared to dry systems decreased from 91% in 2002 to 73% in 2011. Wet pool storage increased by 10% annually, while dry system storage increased by 286% during the same period. The trend towards more dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel is likely to continue due to the need for storage and changing economic value. Storage in dry systems increased 24 times faster than in wet pools, reflecting an average annual increase of 1,579 MTU/year for total stored SNF and 1,124 MTU/year for dry system storage. Spent nuclear fuel is stored at 77 different sites in the United States, including licensed commercial nuclear power reactors, DOE-operated sites, former operating nuclear reactor sites, and the proposed reprocessing plant in Morris, IL. The storage sites for spent nuclear fuel in the United States include facilities at licensed operating nuclear power reactor locations, \"stranded\" commercial sites, and DOE-operated facilities. Nearly every site that has hosted a commercial nuclear reactor is currently a storage site for SNF. The NRC has proposed plans for SNF storage for up to 300 years. Approximately three-quarters of the 67,450 MTU of commercial SNF stored in the US is in wet pools at reactor sites. Of the 74 sites in the United States storing commercial spent fuel, 55 use dry cask storage and 27 have wet pool storage as the only technology. Some sites have stranded SNF where reactors have been shut down and decommissioned, with the fuel remaining on-site. The storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) involves moving it from shut down reactors to other sites for storage. Stranded sites with SNF from decommissioned reactors face higher storage costs due to lack of shared overhead expenses. This issue has garnered attention from industry stakeholders and regulators. The storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) involves moving it from shut down reactors to other sites for storage. SNF is stored at various sites, including those where reactors have ceased operating but others continue, as well as DOE-owned sites. Concerns arise when SNF is stored in dry cask storage without a wet storage pool, potentially complicating future repackaging needs. The Blue Ribbon Commission emphasized the urgency of developing safe, consolidated storage capacity to address stranded SNF. The majority of spent nuclear fuel storage in the United States is located in the Midwest and on the East Coast, with over 80% of SNF stored east of the Mississippi River. BWR fuel assemblies, which are lighter than PWR assemblies, contribute to a higher number of SNF assemblies stored in the East compared to the West. The East has a higher percentage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in wet pools compared to the national average, while the West has a disproportionate amount of SNF stored in dry casks. The number of assemblies stored in wet pools in the East is greater than in the West and the national distribution. The reason for the disproportionate share of SNF in dry cask storage at western sites is unclear. In the East, there is a higher percentage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in wet pools compared to the national average. The top five states with the largest amount of SNF stored by metric tons of heavy metal content are Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, New York, and North Carolina. The top five states with the largest amount of SNF in dry storage systems are South Carolina, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and California. The top five states with the largest amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored by metric tons of heavy metal content are Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and California. When measured by number of SNF assemblies, the top five states with the largest total amount of SNF stored are Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina. Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina are also the top five states with the largest amount of SNF stored in wet pools. Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina are the top five states with the largest amount of SNF in dry storage systems. The top states with the largest amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in dry storage systems are Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia. The total amount of SNF in storage increases by approximately 2,000 MTU per year in the United States. DOE accepted significant amounts of SNF from commercial nuclear power plants in the past, including from the Three Mile Island incident. DOE accepted significant amounts of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from commercial nuclear power plants in the past, including from the Three Mile Island incident. SNF was shipped to New York (West Valley) and Illinois (Morris) for reprocessing efforts. A small amount of commercial SNF was shipped to the West Valley site in New York in the 1970s. Decommissioning and environmental remediation at the West Valley site is estimated to continue until at least 2020, costing $3.7 billion. DOE sites in South Carolina and Idaho also accepted SNF from research reactors. This report does not estimate the storage capacity of existing facilities. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for storing spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at four sites: Fort St. Vrain (CO), Idaho National Laboratory (ID), Savannah River Site (SC), and Hanford Reservation (WA). The DOE inventory is different from commercial SNF and is not included in this report, which focuses on commercial SNF storage at commercial sites. DOE stores spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from research reactors, some of which has been reprocessed to extract nuclear materials like plutonium, generating liquid high-level waste. Solid SNF that hasn't been reprocessed is also stored. Savannah River Site has a variety of irradiated nuclear materials stored, including different types of nuclear fuel. The Department of Energy (DOE) stores various types of spent nuclear fuel (SNF), including \"higher actinide targets\" and non-aluminum based fuel referred to as \"assemblies/items.\" SNF at the Hanford site was surplus material from reactors used for nuclear warhead production, while the Idaho inventory includes SNF from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion program. This Navy SNF was reprocessed in Idaho from 1952 to 1992 to extract high-enriched uranium for weapons material production. Idaho also houses SNF debris from the Three Mile Island reactor meltdown in 1979. The Department of Energy (DOE) stores various types of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at its sites, including research reactor SNF and SNF from commercial power reactors like Three Mile Island. By the late 1980s, some SNF stored at DOE sites had deteriorated, prompting a \"Spent Fuels Vulnerabilities Assessment\" in 1993 to secure the material through packaging and processing. The DOE-owned spent fuel, including production reactor fuel, has thin cladding for reprocessing to recover nuclear materials. DOE has a long-term plan to stabilize the less robust DOE-owned SNF, totaling about 198 MT, stored in wet and dry storage configurations. All SNF at the Hanford and Fort St. Vrain sites has been transferred to dry casks. The DOE-owned spent fuel at various sites has been transferred to dry casks or stored in wet storage pools. DOE is also responsible for high-level waste resulting from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. Separate accounting of DOE site inventories is necessary for a meaningful assessment of total high-level waste in the United States. Hanford site's high-level waste is stored in underground tanks awaiting treatment, while West Valley site has largely processed its high-level waste from spent fuel reprocessing. At the West Valley site in upstate New York, high-level waste from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing has been vitrified into borosilicate glass and stored in stainless steel canisters for disposal. Similarly, some high-level waste at the SRS has been treated on a larger scale. At Idaho sites, high-level waste is stored in liquid and solid forms awaiting treatment for disposal. Details on storage, treatment facility construction, waste disposal, and costs are not covered in this report. DOE sites have varying inventories of spent nuclear fuel and irradiated materials. DOE may use the SRS reprocessing \"H-canyon\" to reprocess materials or stabilize them for safety reasons. DOE plans to use the H-canyon at the Savannah River Site to process plutonium non-pit scrap. The 29 MTU of spent nuclear fuel at the site make up 1.2% of DOE-owned SNF and 0.04% of total SNF in the US. After reprocessing, the SNF will be converted into fissile material and liquid radioactive waste, which will be stored in underground tanks and processed into borosilicate glass logs for disposal in a permanent geological repository. The report discusses the hazards and risks associated with spent nuclear fuel (SNF), emphasizing the distinction between \"hazard\" and \"risk\" in SNF management. The primary near-term hazard comes from radioactivity, while long-term hazards stem from plutonium and uranium. Proper evaluation of hazards and risks is crucial for decision-making in SNF regulation. The severity of an event depends on factors like containment and exposure. Regulation of spent nuclear fuel storage considers risk by assessing probability and consequence of threats. There are differing views on the level of protection needed, with some advocating for high protection levels and others for reasonable assurance. The NRC's mandate is to provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, of protection for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). SNF requires cooling and shielding during storage after reactor discharge, typically needing three to five years of wet pool storage before transfer to dry cask storage. Concerns have been raised about the safety of long-term SNF storage methods, although NRC and others have generally considered it relatively safe with reasonable precautions. The NRC and others have generally viewed SNF storage as safe with precautions, but various threats can lead to containment breaches and risks. These threats include loss of power, external threats like explosions or crashes, long-term degradation of SNF, and leakage of contaminated water. Fukushima Dai-ichi facility faced concerns after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The NRC chairman stated that after a hydrogen explosion at reactor #4 at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, there was an uncovering of fuel in the pool with no water. A report in November 2011 concluded that no significant fuel damage occurred, potentially caused by debris from building explosions. The NRC published a notice for reactor operators to review information for applicability to their facilities. The NRC issued a notice for reactor operators to review information and take appropriate actions to prevent similar problems. This notice highlighted low spent fuel pool water levels at Units 3 and 4. A study by MIT post-Fukushima recommended reevaluation of safety systems, regulatory oversight, and emergency response plans for U.S. reactors. Following the World Trade Center attacks, U.S. nuclear plants were hardened against accident scenarios and emergency response preparations were improved. The Government Accountability Office recommended assessing existing storage facilities for long-term storage requirements. NRC inspections after the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident found no significant vulnerabilities at most sites, with minimal impact predicted for sites with the oldest spent nuclear fuel due to radioactive decay. The Fukushima Dai-ichi incident raised concerns about risks to spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage, but initial results showed little damage to SNF despite power loss and cooling water loss. Analysts worry about zirconium cladding catching fire in wet storage pools. National Academies/National Research Council concluded that fuel melt is unlikely if the storage basin is drained. The National Academies/National Research Council found that a loss-of-pool-coolant event could lead to a zirconium cladding fire in spent fuel, but deemed it unlikely. The NRC has taken steps to address this issue, with some believing these actions provide adequate protection while others disagree, citing the risk of a significant release if the pools were drained. Many boiling water reactors in the US, like the GE Mark I, have the spent nuclear fuel storage pool inside the same containment structure as the reactor, raising safety concerns. In events like the Fukushima disaster, loss of power can affect both the reactor and the pool, hindering cooling and monitoring systems. The height of these pools, over 100 feet above ground level, adds to the risks. The height of spent nuclear fuel pools in many BWRs, over 100 feet above ground level, poses safety risks due to elevated access challenges and potential for coolant loss in a structural failure. After 9/11, concerns about terrorist attacks on these pools increased, as they are less protected than reactor cores and contain larger amounts of radioactive material. NRC issued orders to address these security risks. After 9/11, NRC issued confidential orders and conducted site-specific evaluations to improve SNF storage facilities. Incremental improvements were made, but there was no large-scale shift to dry cask storage or hardened facilities. In contrast, Germany mandates protection against external events and has built hardened storage buildings for SNF. Germany also established consolidated central SNF storage facilities after ceasing reprocessing in 2005. The potential threat to spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage safety includes degradation of cladding and fuel elements. SNF cladding degradation is a known issue, with careful water chemistry control in storage pools to prevent it. U.S. power reactor fuel has generally proven more durable than other fuel forms, despite concerns about long-term storage. The durability of U.S. power reactor fuel, particularly in spent nuclear fuel storage, has been supported by studies showing resistance to degradation. Long-term research projects are recommended to evaluate the integrity of stored SNF, with dry cask storage providing additional confidence in the long-term storage of SNF. Proper drying and inerting of the canister or cask, along with maintaining fuel temperature within NRC guidance limits, are key factors in preventing active degradation mechanisms. Monitoring of dryness is not conducted, but the dryness is ensured by following the correct drying procedure. The integrity of closure seals is actively monitored during the proper drying procedure for spent nuclear fuel storage. If compromised, remedial action is taken. Cladding integrity is under reevaluation for extended storage and transportation. Tritium-contaminated water releases to groundwater have been identified at various sites, including commercial and DOE facilities. The Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, Hanford in Washington State, and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina have groundwater contamination concerns from leaking spent fuel storage pools. Tritium contamination is difficult to remediate once released due to its radioactive nature. The NRC established a Tritium Contamination Task Force in March 2010 to address this issue. Despite documented releases of radioactivity from stored spent nuclear fuel, there is no evidence of significant public exposures or health impacts. Concerns about groundwater contamination from leaking storage pools were raised by petitioners challenging the NRC's Waste Confidence Rule. The NRC's \"Waste Confidence Rule\" was challenged by petitioners over concerns about groundwater contamination from leaking spent fuel storage pools. NRC has issued instructions to licensees and established releases to groundwater as a significant performance indicator. They argue that these issues pose no public health or environmental risks and are addressing them through regulatory guides, inspections, and industry initiatives. Litigation on this matter is ongoing. The NRC issued the Waste Confidence Decisions in response to a legal challenge, indicating that spent nuclear fuel could be safely stored for at least 60 years beyond the end of reactor operating life, without specifying a date for a permanent repository. The nuclear power industry is confident in the existing dry cask storage technology to sustain storage for at least 100 years. The NRC's waste confidence determination does not address the environmental impact of spent fuel storage beyond the licensed life of a reactor. The states of New York, Vermont, and Connecticut challenged NRC's rule on nuclear power reactor licensing in 2011. NRC plans to update the Waste Confidence Rule in 2019 after preparing an Environmental Impact Statement. Resources have been shifted to evaluate extended long-term storage of radioactive material. The NRC is working on safety measures for extended spent fuel storage after the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program. Chairman Greg Jaczko is confident in addressing policy issues, including regulatory improvements and long-term policy changes for safe storage and transportation. The question of permanent disposal is left to Congress or the courts. The NRC is addressing safety measures for extended spent fuel storage post-Yucca Mountain program termination. The Commission clarifies it does not endorse indefinite onsite storage. Efforts include a review of waste confidence rule, planning for extended storage, and a proposed time frame for SNF storage until 2250. Funding for Yucca Mountain repository operations was not included in the FY2012 budget. The Administration's FY2013 request does not include funding for Yucca Mountain activities. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed funding for NRC and DOE for Yucca Mountain activities. Recent budget shifts at DOE and NRC will be analyzed for years to come. The Fukushima Dai-ichi reactor incident has prompted a reexamination of SNF storage options. NRC has established a task force to examine and report on the events at Fukushima Dai-ichi reactors within 90 days. The NRC established a task force to examine and report on regulatory requirements and safety recommendations in light of the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident in Japan. The task force delivered 12 recommendations to the commission, focusing on SNF storage safety, backup power reliability, and monitoring capabilities. The NRC staff identified seven recommendations for near-term action, stating that no issues have been found to undermine the safety of U.S. plants. The task force is likely to recommend actions to enhance safety and preparedness for SNF storage. Options for SNF storage depend on how and where it is stored, as well as the management and oversight structure. The basis for determining reasonable storage options relies on assumptions and policy choices, particularly the timeline for a permanent geologic repository. Uncertainty about the availability of a disposal repository emphasizes the need for long-term SNF storage. The report emphasizes the need for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) due to uncertainty about a permanent disposal repository. Two main options for SNF storage are wet storage pools and dry cask storage, with dry casks generally considered safer. Factors like reactor license renewal, new reactor starts, climate change, and technical developments could impact SNF storage options. The report discusses the safety of wet storage pools and dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel. Wet storage pools offer radiological shielding and cooling for freshly discharged fuel, while dry casks provide shielding and cooling for fuel discharged at least one to five years ago. Dry cask storage also includes preparation for transportation to a repository or storage facility. The report discusses the challenges of managing spent nuclear fuel storage using dry casks, including uncertainty about transportation canister approval. Prior to the Yucca Mountain repository program termination, the DOE was developing \"Transportation, Aging and Disposal\" (TAD) SNF canisters for shipping fuel to a repository. The TAD program aimed to safely store spent fuel assemblies in sealed canisters at reactor sites for eventual disposal in a deep geologic repository. The NRC may need to review new fuels for extended storage safety. Concerns exist about the safety of wet pool storage of SNF, but utilities continue to use it due to perceived safety and cost considerations. Nuclear power plant operators aim to maximize existing storage capacity for spent nuclear fuel in wet pools before investing in new dry cask storage to avoid unnecessary costs. Moving fuel to dry casks only when necessary is the common practice. The decision to shift to dry cask storage should be based on whether it provides greater safety compared to wet storage pools. Some argue that transferring spent nuclear fuel (SNF) to dry cask storage is necessary due to potential risks from dense packing in wet pools. Concerns about the safety of wet storage pools were heightened after the Fukushima Dai-ichi disaster, which raised specific worries about simultaneous failure sequences. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) considers SNF storage to pose little risk if proper precautions are taken. The NRC believes both spent fuel pools and dry casks provide adequate protection for SNF storage. Some argue that dry casks offer safer storage than wet pools, with potential safety and security advantages. The NAS Committee on the Safety and Security of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage also supports the use of dry cask storage. The NAS report recommended moving spent fuel from pools to cask storage for better security against terrorist attacks. NRC focused on the adequacy of both wet pools and dry casks for ensuring public safety. The NRC believes both spent fuel pools and dry casks provide adequate protection for public health and safety. NRC Chairman Greg Jaczko compared the safety of the two storage options to buying one ticket versus ten in the Powerball lottery. Another NRC official stated that both storage methods have equal risk and are considered equally safe by federal policies. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board concluded in 2010 that both wet pool storage and dry casks are equally safe for storing spent fuel. Debate continues on the merits of each method, with some concerns about the risks of continued storage in wet pools. However, others argue that the risks are low for both methods and that the incremental safety improvement of moving fuel to dry casks may not outweigh the risks involved. Dry casks at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant remained unharmed. The dry casks at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant remained unharmed despite the earthquake and tsunami, while the wet storage pools inside the reactor buildings were damaged by hydrogen explosions and structural collapse. Critics argue for transferring spent nuclear fuel from wet storage pools to dry casks due to potential risks. The NRC has determined that transferring spent nuclear fuel from wet storage to dry storage is not necessary for safety, despite concerns raised after the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. Additional monitoring and safeguards have been ordered for wet storage, which could increase costs and accelerate the transfer to dry storage. The NRC has determined that transferring spent nuclear fuel from wet storage to dry storage is not necessary for safety, despite concerns raised after the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. A shift of all SNF older than five years from wet pools to dry storage would significantly increase the amount of SNF in dry cask storage, requiring over 2,700 new dry casks. The NRC currently provides technical requirements for both wet and dry cask storage, and may need to modify systems for a larger number of sites due to the increasing use of dry cask storage. The NRC Office of Inspector General reviewed NRC's process for inspecting dry cask storage safety and security. While no technical risks were found, NRC lacks a centralized system for inspections, staffing, and training. With dry cask storage becoming the primary method for SNF storage, NRC needs to enhance staffing, training, and procedural discipline for effective inspections. The OIG recommended adjustments in NRC management for better oversight and inspections. The NRC Office of Inspector General recommended adjustments in NRC management for better oversight and inspections of dry cask storage safety and security. NRC has begun implementing improvements in the dry cask inspection program, focusing on enhancing spent fuel pool makeup capability and addressing site blackout mitigation and preparedness. The Near-Term Task Force did not mandate a switch from wet to dry storage but recommended actions to ensure continued safe operation and licensing activities. The staff review recommended deferring action on task force recommendations related to SNF management, considering alternative storage locations to reduce costs and improve safety. Long-term interim storage is suggested to alleviate pressure on establishing a repository. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended centralized storage locations for stranded SNF to improve safety and reduce pressure on repository establishment. The current U.S. inventory of SNF is over 67,000 MTU and growing by 2,000 MTU per year, with future projections depending on reactor operations and new construction. The 1995 DOE study projected that SNF storage would reach 86,000 MTU by 2030 unless new reactors are constructed. Future inventory levels depend on reactor capacity factors and discharge rates. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham cited security concerns post-9/11 for relocating high-level waste to Nevada. Some spent fuel will remain at temporary storage locations until facilities operate. Storage of discharged spent fuel requires at-reactor storage for cooling before transfer to dry cask storage or transport. The BRC draft report recommended modifying the NWPA to allow for multiple storage facilities with adequate capacity to be sited, licensed, and constructed when needed, independent of the schedule for opening a repository. This is to address concerns that interim storage sites could become de facto permanent waste repositories, potentially reducing the perceived need for a permanent geological repository. The BRC draft report recommended centralized interim storage to reduce costs, improve safety, and increase confidence in nuclear power. This aligns with MIT's suggestion for long-term centralized storage sites. Harvard University also supported this approach, urging BRC to follow the advice of the National Commission on Energy Policy. The BRC draft report recommended centralized interim storage to reduce costs, improve safety, and increase confidence in nuclear power. Senators proposed legislation for up to two interim nuclear waste storage sites, with provisions to support DOE in paying local governments hosting these facilities. The idea of consolidated interim storage has been debated for years, with concerns including transportation and safety. Concerns about consolidated interim storage include potentially reducing pressure on decision makers to agree on a permanent repository, protracted delays in finding willing host communities, and higher risks from multiple moves of spent nuclear fuel. Common ground exists on the need to consolidate storage at \"stranded\" sites where reactors have been shut down. Facilities have been shut down, leading to \"stranded\" SNF sites. Consolidating these sites would reduce storage locations, overhead costs, and the need for spent fuel storage. Wet storage is temporarily needed before transferring to dry cask storage. Reactors that are still operating will continue to store SNF for cooling before transfer. Moving SNF from these sites to a consolidation site would decrease the number of storage sites. Moving \"stranded\" SNF sites to a consolidation site would reduce the number of sites needing security and safeguards, potentially lowering storage costs. There may be some additional risk in transporting the SNF, but the US has experience in safely transporting SNF. Comparing the risks and costs of storing SNF at reactor sites versus transferring to a consolidated site is necessary. The United States has considered various options for managing high-level nuclear waste, including the responsibilities of different federal agencies like DOE, EPA, and NRC. The Yucca Mountain repository program has been terminated, leading to a transfer of civilian SNF analysis from DOE. The Yucca Mountain repository program at DOE has been terminated, leading to the transfer of civilian SNF analysis to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. Various proposals have been made to manage nuclear waste, including establishing a government corporation with a bipartisan board of directors. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a new organization outside of DOE to handle the transportation, storage, and disposal of nuclear waste in the United States. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a new federal corporation dedicated to implementing the nation's waste management program for nuclear waste. Some critics felt this fell short of their goal for a market-based private management system. Suggestions have been made to use existing DOE nuclear weapons facilities for storage and research on new reprocessing technologies. The debate includes the idea of establishing a consolidated storage facility for commercial nuclear waste at a DOE facility. The debate about establishing consolidated storage sites for commercial spent nuclear fuel at DOE facilities is linked to using existing DOE sites and reprocessing buildings. Reprocessing as a solution for managing spent fuel has been a long-standing issue, with some arguing against its cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. Congressional consideration of alternative waste management structures may benefit from prior federal government experience in overseeing disposal and reprocessing efforts. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel has been shown to be not cost-effective and to pose environmental concerns. Studies suggest that reprocessing cannot be justified based on waste management or economic advantages, but support further research into more efficient technologies. Advocates recommend government-funded research for new reprocessing methods, with current preference for light water reactors using the once-through fuel cycle in the U.S. Deployment of reprocessing is not promoted in the near term. The conclusion that spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is not currently viable as a cost-effective alternative to storage and disposal is supported by studies. Advocates recommend government-funded research for new reprocessing technologies, as current developments do not fundamentally alter the waste management challenge. The U.S. halted reprocessing in the 1970s due to proliferation concerns, and there are currently no plans for commercial reprocessing due to lack of commercial viability. Proponents advocate for research on new spent nuclear fuel (SNF) processing technologies to address waste management challenges and proliferation risks. The Obama Administration has funded a policy consistent with recommendations for increased federal funding for new SNF processing technologies. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is recommended to receive increased federal funding to develop a regulatory framework for advanced nuclear energy systems, including reviewing the waste classification system. The industry believes NRC rulemaking is necessary to determine technology costs. NRC has started a rulemaking process for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing, despite some critics questioning the need due to lack of proposals. SNF is mainly stored at reactors using dry casks when storage pool capacity is full. Given the current prospects for repository capacity and growing waste inventories, long-term or extended storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is likely. While some express concerns about wet pool storage safety, regulatory controls and economic incentives are believed to ensure safe storage. The trend is towards increased use of dry cask systems for SNF storage due to cost advantages and a longer time horizon. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future has recommendations for changing the current storage situation of spent nuclear fuel (SNF), including the possibility of a centralized consolidated storage site and the creation of a new agency to manage SNF. The Senate Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2013 includes provisions to fund efforts to adopt these recommendations, such as a pilot program for consolidated interim storage facilities. The Senate panel directed DOE to use $2 million for a pilot program on consolidated storage facilities for SNF and high-level waste, with funding from the Nuclear Waste Fund. DOE must submit a Pilot Program Plan to Congress within 120 days and address potential cost savings. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is developing legislation based on BRC recommendations, while the House bill allocates $25 million for Yucca Mountain disposal activities in FY2013."
