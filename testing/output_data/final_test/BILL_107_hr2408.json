The \"Flood Control Act of 1944\" approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program for economic development, irrigation, flood protection, and other purposes. The impounded waters for the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects have flooded fertile bottom lands along the Missouri River. The Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects, part of the Pick-Sloan program, generate hydropower and impound water, but the Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe reservations remain undeveloped. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took Indian lands for the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects through condemnation proceedings, denying the Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe compensation for direct damages. The tribes also did not receive just compensation for the taking of productive agricultural lands. The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe were not fairly compensated for the taking of their lands for the Fort Randall Dam and Reservoir. The Yankton Sioux Tribe should receive $23,023,743 for 2,851.40 acres taken, and the Santee Sioux Tribe should receive $4,789,010 for 593.10 acres taken near the Santee village. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
