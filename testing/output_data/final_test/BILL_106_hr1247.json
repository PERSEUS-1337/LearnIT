    "content": "The Act is titled the \"World War II Memorial Completion Act\" and authorizes the American Battle Monuments Commission to raise funds for the completion of the World War II Memorial. The \"World War II Memorial Completion Act\" amends Chapter 21 of title 36, United States Code, to add a new section regarding the World War II memorial in the District of Columbia. It defines key terms and establishes a memorial fund for contributions. The World War II Memorial Completion Act establishes a fund in the Treasury for the World War II memorial, consisting of various sources of funding including contributions, interest, surcharges, and borrowed amounts. The Chairman of the Commission shall deposit contributions into the memorial fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will credit interest and proceeds from investments to the fund. Any excess funds will be invested in interest-bearing obligations. The memorial fund is available for use by the Commission. The memorial fund is available for the expenses of establishing the World War II memorial, including maintenance and preservation costs. It can also be used for other necessary expenses related to the memorial and to secure any copyrights or patents needed for construction. Additionally, there is special borrowing authority to ensure the timely completion of the memorial. The World War II memorial fund can borrow up to $65,000,000 from the Treasury of the United States for construction. The borrowed amounts will accrue interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The borrowing terms will be agreed upon by the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission can issue obligations for up to 20 years, redeemable before maturity, with amounts and prices approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury can purchase these obligations using proceeds from the sale of securities under chapter 31 of title 31. The Commission can borrow funds for the World War II memorial from the Treasury, with repayment from the memorial fund. The Secretary of the Interior will consider these borrowed funds as available for completing the memorial. The Commission is allowed to accept voluntary services from individuals. The Commission can accept voluntary services for fundraising activities related to the World War II memorial. Volunteers are considered Federal employees for compensation and tort claims purposes. Volunteers handling funds or federal functions must adhere to conflict of interest laws and administrative standards of conduct. The Commission may reimburse incidental expenses for volunteers working on the World War II memorial. Federal employees cannot be forced to work without pay or be replaced by volunteers. Contracts for the memorial's design or construction are not considered funding agreements. The legislative authorization for the memorial's construction can be extended despite the Commemorative Works Act. The legislative authorization for the construction of the World War II memorial can be extended until December 31, 2005. The World War II memorial in the District of Columbia is being amended, with sections 3, 4, and 5 of Public Law 103-32 being removed. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds to a new fund created by section 2113 of title 36, United States Code. The American Battle Monuments Commission is granted authority to solicit and receive contributions. The Commission is authorized to solicit and receive funds and gifts from various sources to support the World War II memorial. Funds received will be deposited in a separate account and disbursed upon approval by the Commission Chairman and a designated Federal official. Guidelines will be established to ensure acceptance of funds does not compromise the Commission's ability to fulfill its duties. The Commission must fulfill its responsibilities in a fair and objective manner without compromising the integrity of its programs or officials involved. SEC. 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RELATED ITEMS. Section 2103 of title 36, United States Code, is amended to allow the Commission to adopt, use, register, and license trademarks, copyrights, patents, and licenses. The Commission may grant exclusive and nonexclusive licenses for the use of these intellectual property items, except where it conflicts with existing contracts or licenses. The Commission is authorized to enforce trademarks, copyrights, and patents through legal action in district courts. The Attorney General and Secretary of Defense provide legal representation for the Commission as needed. Copyrights transferred to the Commission are exempt from Section 203 of title 17."
