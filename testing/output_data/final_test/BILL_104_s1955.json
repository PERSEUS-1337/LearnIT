    "content": "The Act titled \"National Center for Pain Research Act of 1996\" establishes the National Center for Pain Research under the Public Health Service Act. This new center is created with the purpose of conducting research on pain. The National Center for Pain Research (referred to as the 'Center') is established within the National Institutes of Health. It is headed by a Director appointed by the Director of NIH. The Center's general purpose is to improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from pain through research into causes and treatments. The National Center for Pain Research is established within the National Institutes of Health to support pain research in specific categories including acute pain, cancer and HIV-related pain, back pain, headache pain, facial pain, and other painful conditions. This includes research on the biology of pain, development of new treatments, delivery of pain treatment, and interdisciplinary pain management. The National Center for Pain Research supports pain research, training, education, and related activities with special priority determined by the Director and advisory council. It coordinates all pain research activities within the National Institutes of Health and promotes collaborative interdisciplinary research among various schools and universities. The National Pain Research Center Advisory Board is responsible for advising the Center on pain research and treatment. It includes representatives from various health and scientific disciplines involved in pain research. The National Pain Research Center Advisory Board includes representatives from various health and scientific disciplines involved in pain research, such as physicians, psychologists, physical medicine providers, nurses, dentists, and chiropractors. Ex officio members include directors from the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Dental Research, and National Institute of Child Health and Human. The National Pain Research Center Advisory Board includes ex officio members from various health institutes such as the National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research of the Department of Education. The advisory council advises the Director of the Center on matters related to research, training, education, and policy recommendations. Regional Pain Research Centers will be established to enhance activities, with at least six centers planned. The establishment of Regional Pain Research Centers is mandated, with a focus on specific categories of pain and distribution across six defined regions in the United States. The Pacific Northwest region, including Alaska, will have regional centers interconnected to the Center headquarters using technology for information exchange, research, training, and educational programs. Initial regional centers will be selected through a competitive process. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out these initiatives. For the purposes of this section, $20,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for fiscal years 1997-1999, with additional funds as needed for 2000. Each regional center established under subsection (d) will receive at least $1,000,000 from the appropriations for fiscal year 1998 onwards. The Director of the Center must submit a report to Congress by January 1 of each year detailing the funds spent on pain-related research."
