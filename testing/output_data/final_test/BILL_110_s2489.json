    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oglala Sioux Tribe Angostura Irrigation Project Modernization and Development Act\". Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program in 1944 to promote economic development, provide irrigation, and protect areas from floods. The Angostura Unit, a part of the program, irrigates 12,218 acres of farmland in South Dakota. The Angostura Unit in South Dakota provides productive farmland and significant recreation and wildlife benefits. The Commissioner of Reclamation has determined that irrigation at the unit yields $3,410,000 annually in national economic development benefits, while recreation at Angostura Reservoir generates $7,100,000 annually. The unit impounds the Cheyenne River upstream of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which faces high rates of unemployment and poverty, highlighting the need for economic development on the Reservation. The Angostura Unit in South Dakota provides economic benefits but does not extend to the Reservation. There are concerns about negative effects on water quality and vegetation. Modernizing irrigation facilities could enhance economic benefits and improve water efficiency. Establishing a trust fund for the Oglala Sioux Tribe could lead to economic development comparable to the benefits at the Angostura Unit. Establishing a trust fund for the Oglala Sioux Tribe could lead to economic development comparable to the benefits at the Angostura Unit and provide resources for the restoration of the Cheyenne River corridor on the Reservation. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Angostura Unit, Fund, Pick-Sloan program, Plan, Reservation, and Secretary. These terms clarify specific entities and programs referenced in the legislation. The Act defines key terms such as Secretary (referring to the Secretary of the Interior), Tribal Council (the governing body of the Tribe), and Tribe (specifically the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation). SEC. 4. MODERNIZATION. The Secretary will modernize and improve facilities at the Angostura Unit as described in the Improved Efficiencies Alternative. The cost will be nonreimbursable. Water saved will be delivered as an instream flow of the Cheyenne River for fish and wildlife purposes and environmental restoration on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Authorization of $4,660,000 for wildlife and environmental restoration on the Reservation. SEC. 5. DEVELOPMENT. The Oglala Sioux Tribal Development Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States with an initial deposit of $92,500,000 from the general fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest the fund to meet current withdrawals. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest the amounts deposited in interest-bearing obligations of the United States and deposit the resulting interest into the Fund. On October 1st of each year, the Secretary will transfer the aggregate amount of interest deposited into the Fund for the fiscal year to be used accordingly. The Secretary will transfer amounts without fiscal year limitation for payments to the Tribe as requested, following tribal resolution and plan adoption. The Tribal Council shall prepare a plan for the use of payments under this subparagraph to promote specific programs and projects within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of the Treasury is limited in transferring or withdrawing funds from the Fund, except as specified in paragraphs (3) and (4)(A). The Tribal Council must prepare a plan to use payments for economic, infrastructure, educational, health, recreational, and social welfare objectives of the Tribe and its members. The plan must be reviewed by the Tribal Council and updated regularly. The Tribal Council may revise the plan annually, allowing members of the Tribe to review and comment. The Council must consult with the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services when preparing or revising the plan. The activities of the plan are subject to audit. The Tribe's activities under the plan will be audited annually as part of a single-agency audit required by the Office of Management and Budget. Auditors will determine if funds received were used in accordance with the plan. The audit findings will be included in the Tribal Council proceedings, and no per capita payments are allowed under the Act. The Tribe's eligibility for certain programs and services is also addressed. The Act ensures that payments to the Tribe do not affect their eligibility for federal programs or services based on tribal or individual status. Appropriations are authorized for administrative expenses. The Act does not impact any rights or claims under specific treaties. The Fort Laramie Treaty of April 29, 1868 (15 Stat. 635) and the reserved water rights of the Tribe under the principles of Winters v. United States (207 U.S. 564 (1908)) are key legal provisions."
