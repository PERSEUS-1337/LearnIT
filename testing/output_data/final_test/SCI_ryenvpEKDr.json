    "content": "The generalization error of neural networks depends on model and dataset size, with the functional form of this dependency being elusive. This work presents a functional form that approximates the generalization error well in practice, utilizing insights from model scaling. The form fits observations across various model types and datasets, providing accurate predictions for small- to large-scale models and data. Despite the increasing use of neural networks for real-world tasks, questions remain about the amount of data and model size needed to achieve desired performance levels. Model scaling is a common approach to address these questions, where small-scale models are designed and compared to inform larger-scale models. This heuristic has been used with varying degrees of success, but the relationship between model performance in small and large-scale settings remains unclear. In this work, the relation between generalization error, model, and dataset sizes is explored by considering model scaling in a strict form. The study empirically investigates the behavior of generalization error across various datasets and models in vision and language tasks. The study explores the relationship between generalization error, model, and dataset sizes in vision and language tasks. It identifies key characteristics in the error landscape, including regions where power-law behavior approximates the error well. A function is proposed to approximate the error landscape, which shows high quality fit and extrapolation from small to large scale errors. The study provides a joint functional form of the generalization error landscape, specifying model configuration and error measurements accurately across different scales and datasets. The study explores model scaling effects on performance in image classification networks, considering depth, width, and input resolution. It aims to provide a practical tool for understanding network design and efficient computation. In this work, the focus is on determining a functional form for model performance given a specified performance level. Prior studies have shown that more data improves performance in computer vision and language processing tasks, with power-law relations between generalization error and training data size. Hestness et al. (2017) found a consistent power-law behavior in various tasks when exploring the effect of data size on generalization error. The study observed a consistent power-law behavior in various experiments but lacked tools for predicting performance or specifying model configurations efficiently. Unlike previous studies, the researchers in this work demonstrate a method to predict test performance and specify model configurations without the need for extensive search, based on performance at a smaller scale. Theoretical error bounds have been studied in deep neural networks, with recent research focusing on power-law dependencies in model and data size. The study leaves open the question of finding theoretical explanations for empirical behavior. Notation is used to denote a labeled dataset and a neural network's size. Dataset scaling involves uniformly subsampling classes to preserve distribution, with a limit to avoid eradicating any class. For language modeling, sentences are randomly sampled to maintain a certain fraction of the original dataset. Model scaling is crucial for moving across scales effectively. Model scaling is essential for moving across scales effectively. The method involves scaling the model architecture based on width, depth, or compound scaling. Hyper-parameter search at large scales is avoided to prevent tuning issues. In this study, hyper-parameters are kept fixed to analyze the error landscape across scales for vision and language tasks. Various models like ResNet and WRN are trained on benchmark datasets, exploring different architectures and optimizers for image classification. The relation between model size and parameters is discussed. The error landscape behavior when scaling model size while holding data size fixed is smooth, meeting specific criteria for expected performance levels. The error landscape behavior when scaling model size while holding data size fixed is smooth and meets specific criteria for expected performance levels. Scaling up the model or dataset will initially increase performance, which will then saturate. There exists an irreducible error intrinsic to the dataset, and the function must be smooth and monotonic non-increasing in terms of model and data size. The behavior of error when scaling model size while keeping data size fixed meets specific performance criteria. A consistent form satisfying certain criteria is derived, with parameters controlling error decrease rates and unit conversion. However, a transition model is needed to move from random-guess level to power-law region, proposed to be parameterized using a complex envelope function. The complex envelope function with a simple pole at \u03b7 controls the transition from random-guess level to final irreducible error as (m, n) increase. The transition model is parameterized using a rational envelope, with a known random-guess error determined by dataset statistics. The forms in equations 3 and 4 are well motivated, but the modeling approach for transitions is a convenience. Further investigation of the transition nature is left for future work. The study aims to estimate the quality of a proposed functional parameterization for fitting the true error landscape. A parametric function family is used to approximate the error landscape, and a least squares regression model is fitted to find the best parameters. The fit is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation across all model/data configurations, and the quality is assessed by the mean and standard deviation of the relative difference between estimated and true error. Experimental details can be found in Appendix B.1. The study evaluates the proposed function for modeling the error landscape, showing high correlation between estimated and actual test accuracy. Results extend to depth scaling, with comparable fit errors for both width and depth scaling. Compound scaling is expected to follow the same functional form. In this section, the study verifies that compound scaling adheres to the same functional form when varying the optimizer and/or architecture on the same task of image classification on CIFAR100. Different architectures (VGG and DenseNet) trained with both SGD and Adam optimizers show consistent fit values with minimal divergence. The study evaluates the ability of functional approximation to predict errors in larger model/data configurations using least squares regression. Parameters are estimated for smaller configurations and used to predict errors in larger unseen configurations, measuring the divergence between estimated and actual errors. The study demonstrates accurate extrapolation of errors in larger model/data configurations using functional approximation. Results show mean divergence of 4.5% on ImageNet and 0.5% on WikiText-103, with consistent results across different subsets of configurations. In this work, insights gained from examining generalization error dependencies on model and data size lead to criteria for functions consistent with error scaling policies. A function is identified that accurately predicts generalization error behavior, enabling extrapolation from small to large scale configurations. Several practical implications of this functional form are discussed. The functional form identified in this work accurately predicts generalization error behavior, allowing for consistent scaling rank comparisons between models at small scales. It also explains the limitations of small-scale searches and enables the use of differentiable methods for NAS. The form allows direct usage of differentiable methods for NAS, providing answers to design questions about error levels, data requirements, and model sizes. Constraints can be easily imposed, such as determining the maximal model size needed for a given dataset size. Model scaling becomes negligible when data size is limited. The maximal useful amount of data for a limited sized model contributes marginally to error reduction. Design trade-offs can be optimized for efficient computation, with a trade-off cost function that minimizes costs. The optimal-computational-efficiency ratio of model to data size can be determined by scaling dataset and models with optimal resource efficiency. The limitations of the model-to-data size relationship include simplifying assumptions in the choice of approximating function and the challenge of scaling hyperparameters. The scaling framework aims to find the generalization error form and model specifications across scales, but only constant hyperparameters have been demonstrated so far. Scaling the models' width involves multiplying the number of channels in each convolutional layer and the width of hidden linear layers by a constant factor. This work aims to explore hyperparameter-scaling policies similar to model-scaling policies, with the hope of uncovering the functional form of generalization error in practical scaling scenarios. Additional experiments on width scaling are planned for future research. In section 6.2, width scaling experiments were conducted on VGG16bn and DenseNet architectures. The models were modified for width scaling with scaling factors of 4\u2212k, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 5. Training was done using SGD with specific parameters for CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. For VGG and DenseNet experiments on CIFAR100, training is done for 170 epochs for VGG and 300 epochs for DenseNet. Adam optimizer is used with default hyperparameters. When using SGD, standard stepped learning rate schedules are followed with specific parameters. Evaluation is done on various language modeling datasets including Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and WikiText-103. The PTB, WikiText-2, and WikiText-103 are language modeling datasets with varying sizes and vocabularies. Transformer-XL and AWD-LSTM are two models used for language modeling, with Transformer-XL incorporating transformer self-attention and achieving state-of-the-art results. The official PyTorch implementation achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks using a base configuration with specific layer, embedding, and inner dimension sizes. Scaling experiments involve adjusting the inner dimension. AWD-LSTM, a long short-term memory language model, is used with recommended configurations for different datasets, with scaling experiments involving the hidden state size. In a specific experiment, a least squares regression model is used to find the best parameters. The appendix provides error landscape measurements and estimations for all datasets using a least squares regression model to find the best parameters. The results are shown in 3D graphs with the z-axis representing the logarithm of the generalization error as a function of model size and data size in a log-log-log scale. The appendix presents error landscape measurements and estimations for datasets using a least squares regression model to determine the best parameters. The error landscape is shown in log-log-log scale, with subfigures illustrating the measured and estimated error landscapes. The surface is a linear interpolation between points projected on different planes, providing insights into the behavior of the surface when holding one dimension constant. Several interesting observations on the datasets are highlighted. The fits perform well across error ranges, providing a qualitative sense of fit adequacy. Error tends to remain saturated with increasing model size, but overfitting can occur in certain cases. A simplifying approach using random guess levels for small models or data seems effective. The simplifying approach of using random guess levels for small models or data works well, but may not hold for imbalanced datasets like in language modeling. A relaxation of this simplification is expected to be important conceptually and practically. Detailed extrapolation results are provided for all datasets, with each subplot showing estimated vs. actual error. The goal is to find error-landscape values for unseen, larger scales of both model and data. The curr_chunk discusses the estimation error vs. actual error when extrapolating to larger models and data sizes. It includes details on observed measurements of error from different fractions of the full dataset and model, with points colored in green for fitting the function and red for unseen points. The mean and standard deviation over all divergences at target points are provided, with experiments repeated 100 times for parameter fitting. The quality of extrapolation depends on the signal in the fitted points and the number of configurations used for estimating \u03b8. Proximity to the initial random guess level and the amount of data used for estimation play crucial roles in the stability of extrapolation. At least two measurements in each scaling dimension are necessary for stable extrapolation. For stable extrapolation, at least two measurements in each scaling dimension are needed, along with the number of parameters in total. The number of points and scale of configurations measured can be decoupled by taking closer spaced samples at small scale. It is sufficient to measure model/data configurations that are far-ranged from the ones being extrapolated to achieve divergences of no more than a few percent."
