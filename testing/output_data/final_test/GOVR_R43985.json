It covers salaries and expenses for the Attorney General's office, Inspector General's office, and programs to coordinate DOJ agencies' collaborative efforts efficiently. Funding also supports Justice Information Sharing Technology and previously funded the National Drug Intelligence Center and Law Enforcement Wireless Communications. The General Administration account within the DOJ's operations is funded through Congress appropriations for salaries and expenses. It covers coordination of DOJ agencies, Justice Information Sharing Technology, and previously funded programs like the National Drug Intelligence Center and Law Enforcement Wireless Communications. The Attorney General oversees immigration case reviews with the EOIR, while the OPA handles executive clemency petitions. The OIG detects waste, fraud, and abuse in DOJ programs, and the U.S. Parole Commission adjudicates parole requests for federal and District of Columbia prisoners. The Legal Activities account within the DOJ oversees felony sentences, conditions of release for offenders, and determines whether to return violators to prison. It includes subaccounts for various legal activities and funds the Solicitor General's supervision of proceedings before the Supreme Court. Congress also sets limits on spending from the Assets Forfeiture Fund. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) oversees various legal functions including criminal prosecution, civil representation, protection of the federal judicial process, national security and terrorism missions. The DOJ includes entities such as U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals Service, and National Security Division (NSD) to carry out these responsibilities. The National Security Division (NSD) of the U.S. Department of Justice consolidates intelligence resources to ensure sharing of criminal intelligence information. The Interagency Law Enforcement account reimburses agencies for participation in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program, which disrupts major narcotics trafficking organizations. The FBI leads investigations against foreign terrorist threats and enforces federal laws. Other agencies involved in OCDETF include DEA, ATF, USMS, and U.S. Attorneys, as well as state and local law enforcement agencies. Since 9/11, the FBI has focused on preventing terrorism. The DEA enforces drug laws to reduce drug availability and abuse, disrupting drug trafficking and money laundering organizations. Challenges include limiting the supply of illicit drugs and reducing trafficking from Mexico. The agency plays a key role in the Southwest Border Initiative. The DEA plays a key role in countering drug-related border violence and terrorism in the region. The ATF enforces federal laws related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives, working independently and through partnerships to reduce crime. The Bureau of Prisons was established in 1930 to house federal inmates. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to house federal inmates in safe and secure facilities. It operates 121 correctional facilities nationwide and contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs) to assist inmates nearing release with employment counseling and other programs. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) administers programs under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to improve criminal justice responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages various agencies and grant programs, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. The Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account funds operations related to justice statistics and research. The State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account provides funding for grant programs to improve criminal justice systems, including the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program, Drug Courts program, SCAAP, and DNA backlog reduction grants. The Juvenile Justice Programs account funds programs to reduce juvenile delinquency. The PSOB program offers benefits to public safety officers and their survivors for death, disability, and education to aid in recruitment and retention. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office awards grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring and training officers, purchasing crime-fighting technologies, and testing new policing strategies. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) provides funding for victim compensation and assistance programs, funded by criminal fines and penalties collected by U.S. authorities. The DOJ's budget for FY2016 was $29.090 billion, a 7.6% increase from FY2015 but 0.5% below the Administration's request. The report provides an overview of the Administration's proposals for DOJ, focusing on topics of perennial interest or national significance. The ATF is the lead federal law enforcement agency responsible for administering and enforcing federal laws related to firearms and explosives commerce, as well as investigating arson cases with a federal nexus and criminal cases involving the diversion of alcohol and tobacco. Congress appropriated $1.24 billion for ATF in FY2016, a 3.4% increase from FY2015 but $21.2 million less than the administration's request. The agency stated that it lacks resources to monitor the firearms industry and conduct routine firearms traces for other law enforcement agencies. The ATF struggles to meet its goal of inspecting every federal firearms license for compliance due to appropriations limitations, an increase in the number of licenses, and a surge in firearms-related commerce. The civilian gun stock has increased over the years, indicating the ATF's increasing responsibilities in monitoring the gun industry. The ATF's budget allocation heavily favors law enforcement operations, with only a small percentage going towards investigative support services. This emphasis on enforcement over administration may have been influenced by the ATF's transfer to the Department of Justice. The ATF's FY2016 budget justification highlighted incidents of murder and assault with firearms. Two-thirds of murders from 1968 to 2013 were committed with firearms, with half involving handguns. Overall homicides decreased from 2007 to 2013, with a lower rate per 100,000 population compared to 1968. The House-passed bill allocated $1.24 billion to ATF for FY2016 to meet staffing needs and improve processing of NFA applications. The ATF's FY2016 budget aims to enhance processing of NFA applications and expand NIBIN. The House considered gun control amendments but none were included in the final bill. The House rejected an amendment to remove two provisions from the bill related to ATF regulations on shotguns and rifle sales reports. Congress has long been concerned about cybercrime and the federal government's role in ensuring cybersecurity, with the Department of Justice playing a key role in countering cyber threats. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has a significant role in combating cybercrime, involving investigative, intelligence, prosecutorial, and technological components. The President's FY2016 budget included $26.8 million for cybersecurity, with an additional $4.1 million for IT Transformation and Cybersecurity Program. Congress has directed DOJ to enhance its counter-cybercrime efforts, but the exact amount allocated is unclear. The DOJ has allocated funds for cybersecurity and IT Transformation Program. The FBI leads cybercrime investigations and has various cyber teams to combat threats. The FBI is focusing on cyber investigations, hiring tech experts, and enhancing collaboration through the Next Generation Cyber Initiative. The President's FY2016 budget included $10.3 million for this initiative to improve cyber data analysis and combat cyber intrusions. The U.S. Attorneys and the Criminal Division at DOJ are centrally involved in prosecuting cybercrime. The Criminal Division has developed Strategic Initiatives to Address Cyber Threats, including training on cybercrime, enhancing digital forensics capacity, improving cyberthreat expertise, and expanding information sharing efforts. The Administration proposed expanding these initiatives by $6.1 million. The Administration proposed expanding cyberpolicy development initiatives by $6.1 million and 54 positions. U.S. Attorneys, including the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property attorneys and National Security Cyber Specialists Network, prosecute cyber threats. DOJ requested $6.1 million and 60 positions to enhance cybercrime prosecutions. The National Security Division is involved in U.S. cyber and cybersecurity efforts. The National Security Division (NSD) is involved in U.S. cyber and cybersecurity efforts, focusing on prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecutions of cyber threats. To address evolving challenges, NSD needs to recruit, hire, and train additional cyber specialists. The Administration requested an expansion of $1.7 million and 12 positions for FY2016 to strengthen support for the Intelligence Community in identifying and disrupting cyber threats. The violent crime rate in 2013 was the lowest since 1969, but over 2.2 million people were incarcerated in the US at the end of that year. Research shows that while incarceration helped lower crime rates in the 1990s, there are diminishing returns with increased incarceration levels. The US can no longer rely solely on incarceration for public safety as it strains budgets. The Justice Center at the Council of State Governments notes that state spending on corrections increased significantly from $12 billion in 1988 to $53 billion in 2012. Funding for the Bureau of Prisons accounted for 25% of the total FY2015 appropriation for DOJ. The social cost of increasing incarceration levels includes difficulties in finding work for black males with criminal histories, children growing up with incarcerated fathers, and urban neighborhoods dealing with a growing number of returning ex-offenders. The Administration requested $247 million for the \"Smart on Crime\" initiative, including funding for Prevention and Re-entry Coordinators in U.S. Attorneys offices. The Administration requested funding for Prevention and Re-entry Coordinators in U.S. Attorneys offices, as well as $146 million for the Bureau of Prisons to expand re-entry programs. Additionally, $2 million was requested for the Office of the Pardon Attorney to review clemency applications. An additional $52 million was requested for grants under the Second Chance Act for state, local, and tribal governments. The Second Chance Act grants provide funding for various services to reduce recidivism, with $68 million allocated in FY2016. The explanatory statement did not specify if increased funding for U.S. Attorneys or the BOP was for the Administration's proposals. Reprogramming requirements for OPA staffing augmentation were highlighted in the statement. The Attorney General oversees immigration cases in coordination with DHS. The EOIR conducts court proceedings and faces a backlog due to increased enforcement efforts. The workload is largely dictated by cases brought by DHS seeking removal of undocumented aliens. The Department of Justice (DOJ) notes a significant increase in immigration cases pending adjudication, rising from 262,681 at the end of FY2010 to 418,861 at the end of FY2014. This backlog is attributed to the spike in DHS enforcement efforts last summer, leading to a high volume of families and unaccompanied children identified at the Southwest border. The number of immigration judges has decreased, with only 237 judges as of January 2015. To address the backlog, the Administration requested a $124 million increase for the EOIR in FY2016, including funds for legal representation for children, immigration judge teams, and expanding the Legal Orientation Program. The FY2016 appropriation includes $60 million for immigration judge teams and $10 million to expand the Legal Orientation Program. It also provides funding for 55 new immigration judge teams, enhancements in technology, and support for immigration enforcement initiatives. The funding aims to have all new judges and support teams hired by November 2016. Policymakers are concerned about potential lone wolf terrorist attacks in the U.S. and the rise of the Islamic State. The Administration's priority is protecting U.S. citizens from domestic and foreign terrorism by requesting $15 million in funding for grants and training to counter violent extremism. This includes $6 million for a grant program supporting community-led models and $4 million for research and evaluation. The Administration requested $15 million in funding for grants and training to counter violent extremism. This includes $4 million for research to identify causes of violent extremism and $3 million for enhancing law enforcement partnerships with communities. Additionally, $2 million is set aside for training and technical assistance for state and local law enforcement in their CVE efforts. Policymakers lack transparency on DOJ's CVE expenditures, including U.S. Attorneys and FBI spending. Detailed budget insight could enhance program transparency and congressional oversight. Muslim community leaders are cautious of CVE due to DOJ's dual role in intelligence gathering. Greater budget transparency may alleviate concerns of co-opting communities into security efforts. Some policymakers believe state and local governments should fund police forces instead of the federal government. They argue against increasing law enforcement funding during decreasing crime rates and federal deficits. However, others suggest grants to state and local law enforcement agencies for the safety of U.S. citizens. Funding for DOJ agencies should not be scaled back to support these grants. Appropriations for DOJ's grant programs for state and local law enforcement have decreased in recent years. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) decreased from $539 million in FY2009 to $333 million in FY2015, with $347 million provided for FY2016. The COPS hiring program funding decreased from $298 million in FY2010 to $135 million in FY2015, with $137 million allocated for FY2016. Policymakers may consider grants to improve police-community relations and accountability in light of recent civilian deaths. The Administration requested $210 million for the COPS hiring program to help law enforcement agencies hire new officers for community policing. The President's budget also included requests for $5 million for diversity incentive grants, $20 million for the Collaborative Reform Initiative, $30 million for body-worn cameras, and $10 million for studying their effectiveness and developing best practices. For FY2016, Congress provided $10 million for COPS's Collaborative Reform Initiative and $70 million for a Community Trust Initiative, including funds for body-worn cameras, justice reinvestment, criminal justice innovation, and research on community trust in law enforcement. Over half of all states and the District of Columbia allow medical use of marijuana in various ways. Some states exempt qualified users of medical marijuana from prosecution, while others regulate it. California has a comprehensive law allowing medical marijuana use since 1996. Despite state legalization, medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which does not differentiate between medical and recreational use. Federal law enforcement has prosecuted individuals for medical marijuana offenses, regardless of state compliance. Federal law enforcement prioritizes investigating and prosecuting growers and dispensers of medical marijuana over individual users, despite state laws allowing its use. Congress passed language in the FY2016 Omnibus bill to prevent the Department of Justice (DOJ) from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. However, DOJ maintains the right to prosecute individuals who comply with state law but violate federal law. The House enacted language prohibiting DOJ from using funds to prevent states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws. The DEA faces obstacles in meeting performance objectives due to state allowances for marijuana use. The DEA's budget includes a program targeting marijuana enforcement. The DEA's Domestic Enforcement account, funded at $1.59 billion in FY2015, was directed by Congress to review the medical efficacy of marijuana and collaborate with other agencies to facilitate research. The Crime Victims Fund obligation cap was increased by 216.9% to $2.361 billion in FY2015. In FY2016, the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) obligation cap was set at $3.042 billion, with $379 million transferred to the Office on Violence Against Women and $10 million designated for oversight purposes. After deductions, the cap was $2.653 billion, a 12.4% increase from the previous year. The Administration had proposed using CVF funds for OVW programs but did not do so in FY2016. The Administration's FY2016 budget did not direct CVF money for grants to domestic trafficking victims, despite a proposal. Congress may consider using CVF receipts for non-VOCA grant programs, raising concerns about the fund's focus on victim assistance. With a balance of over $12 billion, CVF receipts exceeded the cap, prompting Congress to increase it in FY2015 and further in. Congress increased the cap on the Crime Victims Fund in FY2015 and FY2016. The fund could potentially fund DOJ grant programs while reducing discretionary appropriations, but there is uncertainty in consistent funding levels. Eliminating the cap altogether could have significant consequences for the DOJ budget. The capped amount and remaining balance in the CVF are part of the DOJ budget total. The Crime Victims Fund cap impacts the DOJ budget total and grant programs. Congress may need to offset the CVF amount if the cap is eliminated. This appendix breaks down funding for various DOJ grant programs."
