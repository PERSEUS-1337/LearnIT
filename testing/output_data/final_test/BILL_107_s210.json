The programs eligible for integration in a demonstration project under a plan submitted include Indian behavioral health care programs that receive funds through statutory formulas or grants, with consent from the appropriate agency.

SEC. 7. PLAN REVIEW. Upon receiving a plan from an Indian tribe, the Secretary must consult with the relevant Federal agencies and the tribe. The consultation process aims to identify any necessary waivers of statutory requirements or Federal agency regulations to facilitate the implementation of the tribal government's plan.

SEC. 12 addresses the administration of funds and overage.
