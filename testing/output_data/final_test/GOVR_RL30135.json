They occur at the start of the legislative day and can also be given after legislative business. This report examines House practices for one-minute speeches, their delivery, insertion in the Congressional Record, uses, and reform proposals. One-minute speeches in the House are a practice that has evolved as a unanimous consent practice. Members must seek unanimous consent to speak for one minute, following House rules, precedents, and Speaker's policies. House precedents limit individual Members to one one-minute speech per legislative day. Speaker's policies cover aspects of House procedure like decorum in debate and recognition for one-minute speeches. The Speaker's policies on recognition for one-minute speeches, established in 1984, give him the authority to decide when and how many one-minute speeches will be allowed.

However, regulations state that any extraneous material should be printed in the \"Extensions of Remarks\" section, though this rule is not always followed. The Joint Committee on Printing's regulations require one-minute speeches longer than 300 words to be printed in the Congressional Record following the business of the day.
