    "content": "The \"Employment Protection Act of 2011\" may impact employment and economic activity through EPA regulatory activity. Prior to issuing regulations, the Administrator must analyze the impact on employment and economic activity by State, utilizing the best available economic models. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit an annual report to Congress on this analysis by December 31st each year. The Administrator must analyze the economic impact of regulations on employment and economic activity using the best available models. The analysis should include estimated job losses and decreased economic activity due to permit denials or issuances. The information must be made available to the public on the EPA website and State Governors are requested to post it in their State Capitol if there is a significant negative impact. The Administrator must analyze the economic impact of regulations on employment and economic activity, including permit denials or issuances. If there is a significant negative impact, public hearings must be held in each State at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the regulation or permit decision. The Administrator must hold public hearings in States with significant job losses due to regulations. If a hearing is not held, residents can sue in a district court for compliance. The district court must enjoin the regulation or policy in question and may award attorneys fees. Upon appeal, the court of appeals must require briefs within 30 days, cannot stay the injunction before oral arguments, and must make a final decision within 90 days. The Administrator must notify the State's Congressional delegation, Governor, and Legislature if a regulation will have a significant negative impact on employment or economic activity. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the EPA, and \"de minimis negative impact\" means a minimal loss in employment levels. The EPA Administrator must notify relevant parties if a regulation will significantly impact employment or economic activity. Significant impact is defined as a loss of over 100 jobs or a decrease in economic activity of more than $1,000,000 in a calendar year, without considering offsetting gains from new technologies or government employment."
