    "content": "In December 2008, the NBER declared a recession that started in December 2007. Economic instability began in the housing sector, spreading to banking and financial services due to housing market declines. Automakers faced solvency issues from tight credit, rising unemployment, and high fuel costs. National unemployment reached 7.2% in December 2008. In response to the recession declared in December 2008, states faced tax revenue decreases, leading to cuts in Medicaid. Policymakers acted swiftly to prevent instability in housing and financial services from impacting the broader economy, amid forecasts of a prolonged global economic slowdown with widespread effects on living standards. Members of Congress are looking ahead to address these challenges. In response to the recession, policymakers sought ways to prevent economic instability. Congress and the Obama Administration considered various stimulus measures, including infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and unemployment benefits. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was approved by the House and Senate to provide a sustained economic boost and job growth. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was approved by the House and Senate to provide economic stimulus. The Senate version of ARRA was approved on February 10, 2009, and signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009 as P.L. 111-5. This report summarizes the Medicaid provisions in P.L. 111-5. The Medicaid provisions in P.L. 111-5 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) included eight provisions, with some provisions being aggregated from separate Senate or House Bills. For example, the Medicaid Indian protections provision in the Conference Agreement combined five provisions from earlier versions. Additionally, the nursing home prompt payment provision from the Senate bill was integrated into the Temporary Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) Increase provision in P.L. 111-5, with $5 million in funding added in the Conference. The ARRA included $5 million in funding for the FMAP provision in the Conference Agreement. There are eight Medicaid provisions in Title V of the Conference Agreement, with an additional provision for Medicaid Health Information Technology in Title IV. The CBO estimated that ARRA's Medicaid provisions would increase federal expenditures by $33.96 billion in FY2009 and $89.74 billion from FY2009 to FY2013, with a temporary FMAP increase accounting for $87.2 billion of the five-year increase. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) formula determines the federal share of Medicaid funding for states based on their per capita incomes. Exceptions exist for certain states and situations, such as the District of Columbia and territories. The FMAP was temporarily increased for all states under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. It is also used for other programs like foster care and adoption assistance, as well as the State Children's Health Insurance Program. During the recession adjustment period from FY2009 to FY2011, states under the State Children's Health Insurance Program were provided with an across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points in their FMAPs. Qualifying states also received an additional unemployment-related increase. Territories had the option to choose between a 6.2 percentage point FMAP increase with a 15% spending cap increase or their regular FMAP with a 30% spending cap increase. States were evaluated quarterly for the unemployment-related FMAP increase, which was a percentage reduction in the state share after the initial increases. The FMAP increase during the recession adjustment period was 6.2 percentage points, with an additional increase based on unemployment rate. The total FMAP increase could reach 8.78 points, with criteria based on comparing unemployment rates. During the recession adjustment period, the FMAP increase was 6.2 percentage points, with additional increases based on unemployment rates. States could qualify for reductions in state share based on specific unemployment rate increases, ranging from 5.5% to 11.5%. The temporary FMAP increase only applies to Medicaid, excluding certain payments and expenditures. The temporary FMAP increase applies to Medicaid for individuals eligible for Medicaid due to a state's income eligibility standards increase above July 1, 2008 levels. States must maintain Medicaid eligibility standards from July 1, 2008, comply with prompt payment requirements, report to HHS, and ensure local governments do not pay more than required for nonfederal Medicaid expenditures. The ARRA's FMAP provision increased federal spending by $87.2 billion over FY2009-2013. States must report how additional federal funds were used. Medicaid law mandates payment adjustments for hospitals serving low-income patients with special needs, including DSH payments with specific limits. The ARRA's FMAP provision increased federal spending by $87.2 billion over FY2009-2013. States must report how additional federal funds were used. Medicaid law mandates payment adjustments for hospitals serving low-income patients with special needs, including DSH payments with specific limits. States' DSH payments are capped at the costs incurred in providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured, less other Medicaid payments and payments by uninsured patients. States' FY2009 DSH allotments were increased by 2.5% above the FY2008 levels, with FY2010 allotments equal to FY2009 levels plus 2.5%. Allotments will return to 100% of current law determinations after FY2010. The temporary increase in DSH allotments under the ARRA led to higher federal expenditures, with estimates of $228 million in FY2009 and $456 million for FY2009-FY2013. Medicaid regulations issued in 2007 and 2008 sparked controversy, leading to moratoriums on six regulations until April 1, 2009. The extension of these moratoriums was projected to increase federal expenditures by $105 million in FY2009. The seven Medicaid regulations issued during the most recent Congress covered areas such as Graduate Medical Education and Cost Limit on Public Providers. The proposed rule would eliminate federal reimbursement for graduate medical education and change how Medicaid upper payment limits for hospital services are calculated. The proposed and final regulation on Medicaid spending by public providers was remanded back to CMS by a federal court. The regulation aims to clarify allowable types of IGTs for Medicaid costs, impose limits on reimbursement for government-owned hospitals, and require providers to retain Medicaid reimbursement. For more information on cost limits on public providers, refer to CRS Report RS22848, Medicaid Regulation of Governmental Providers. Rehabilitative services under Medicaid aim to reduce disability and restore beneficiaries to their best functional levels. There have been clarifications on what constitutes rehabilitative services, with the proposed rule defining the scope of this benefit. Case management services help beneficiaries access necessary medical services, with targeted case management focusing on specific groups or geographic areas. The case management regulation clarifies and narrows the definition of case management under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. It directs the Secretary of HHS to issue regulations for states to claim federal matching funds for case management. Public schools must provide special education services for children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Medicaid may cover health-related services required by IDEA. Medicaid may cover IDEA required health-related services for enrolled children as well as related administrative activities. To address improper Medicaid payments to schools, CMS issued a regulation restricting federal Medicaid payments for school-based administrative activities and certain transportation services. Provider-specific taxes are used by states to help finance their share of the Medicaid program. Provider taxes are collected by states to fund Medicaid payments, with federal matching funds used to raise payment rates or for other program purposes. CMS issued regulations to ensure compliance with federal laws. Outpatient hospital services are a mandatory Medicaid benefit, covering various medical services provided in hospitals under physician or dentist supervision. The regulation issued by CMS limits the definition and scope of Medicaid-covered outpatient hospital services. P.L. 111-5 extends moratoria on certain regulations until July 1, 2009, and prohibits the Secretary of HHS from taking any action until after June 30, 2009. The final regulation on outpatient hospital facility services was implemented on December 8, 2008. Moratoria are in place until April 1, 2009 for regulations on cost limits for public providers, graduate medical education, and rehabilitative services. The Secretary of HHS is advised not to finalize regulations for rehabilitative services, cost limits on public providers, or graduate medical education. States must continue Medicaid benefits for certain individuals. States must continue Medicaid benefits for certain low-income families through transitional medical assistance (TMA), which provides coverage for up to 12 months for those who lose eligibility due to changes in income or employment. Work-related TMA requirements have been extended through short-term funding extensions, most recently until June 30, 2009. The provision extends work-related TMA under Section 1925 through December 31, 2010. States can opt to waive certain requirements for eligibility under TMA and are required to report enrollment and participation rates to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Medicaid eligibility categories include individuals enrolled in CHIP and those eligible for Medicare under the MSP. QMBs, SLMBs, and QI-1s are eligible groups with specific income and asset criteria. Medicaid pays Medicare Part B premiums for eligible individuals. The QI-1 program extends Medicaid coverage for individuals with income between 120% and 135% of poverty level. Federal government covers 100% of expenditures up to state allocation levels. Total allocation amount for 2009 was $350 million. The total allocation amount for 2009 was $350 million. P.L. 111-5 combined provisions for Indians under Medicaid and CHIP, including premiums, eligibility determinations, estate recovery, managed care protections, and consultation with Indian health providers. CBO estimated that these protections would increase federal expenditures by $6 million in FY2009 and by $54 million from FY2009-FY2013. Premiums and Cost-Sharing Under Medicaid, most beneficiaries are not required to pay premiums or enrollment fees. Some nominal amounts may be imposed on certain groups, while service-related cost-sharing is prohibited for children, pregnant women, and certain benefits. States have the option to impose nominal cost-sharing amounts for other groups and services, with the possibility of exceeding nominal amounts for specific groups like workers with disabilities. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 added a Medicaid state option for alternative premiums. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171) introduced a Medicaid state option for alternative premiums and cost-sharing for specific subgroups. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and non-emergency services in hospital emergency rooms. P.L. 111-5 prohibits imposing premiums or cost-sharing on Indians receiving Medicaid services from Indian Health Service (IHS), Indian tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, or through referral. Medicaid payments to these providers for services to Medicaid-eligible Indians cannot be reduced by cost-sharing amounts. Indians receiving services through Indian entities are also exempt from paying premiums or cost-sharing under the DRA option. The DRA option exempts certain individuals from paying premiums or cost-sharing starting July 1, 2009. Medicaid has over 50 eligibility pathways with varying asset test requirements. States can define specific assets to be counted or disregarded for some pathways, while asset tests are mandatory for others, especially for those with disabilities or the elderly. States typically follow asset guidelines from the SSI Program. Medicaid also outlines rules for counting certain assets, including assets related to Indian lands held in trust by the U.S. The new law prohibits consideration of certain classes of Indian property in determining Medicaid eligibility, extending the same provision to CHIP as well. This includes properties held in trust, properties within reservation boundaries, ownership interests related to natural resources, and ownership interests with cultural significance. Effective July 1, 2009, these protections continue under Medicaid estate recovery. Indian Property from Medicaid Estate Recovery: States must recover property of deceased Medicaid beneficiaries for outstanding services, with exemptions for undue hardship. Certain income, resources, and property remain exempt from recovery under specified standards. The new law allows the Secretary to provide additional estate recovery exemptions for Indians under Medicaid, effective July 1, 2009. Rules under Medicaid and CHIP specify enrollment in managed care for Indians, with exceptions for certain entities like IHS or Indian Health Programs. The Indian Self-Determination Act allows Indian tribes or organizations to operate health centers under contracts with the IHS. Federally Qualified Health Centers are paid per visit under Medicaid, with rates adjusted annually. When FQHCs participate in Medicaid managed care, states must make supplemental payments to cover any rate differences. Under P.L. 111-5, Indians enrolled in non-Indian MCEs with an IHP or UIO as their primary care provider must be allowed to choose such providers if eligible. Contracts between states and MCEs must include this requirement for Medicaid payments. MCEs and PCCMs must ensure sufficient Indian health care providers for timely access to covered services to receive Medicaid payments. Under P.L. 111-5, managed care services for eligible Indian enrollees must ensure prompt payment to Indian health care providers at negotiated rates or not less than what would be paid to non-Indian providers. States are prohibited from waiving payment consistency requirements, and special payment provisions apply to Indian FQHCs providing covered Medicaid managed care services. Under P.L. 111-5, Indian FQHCs providing covered Medicaid managed care services must be paid at rates equal to non-Indian FQHCs. States must make up the difference if payments by MCEs are lower than the state plan rate. Indian Medicaid MCEs can restrict enrollment to Indians and specific tribes. P.L. 111-5 applies specific sections affecting Medicaid to the CHIP program, including enrollment restrictions for Indians in managed care. It also establishes a Tribal Technical Advisory Group within CMS for consultation on health care programs funded under the Social Security Act involving Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations. Effective date of these provisions is July 1, 2009. P.L. 111-5 establishes a Tribal Technical Advisory Group within CMS for consultation on health care programs involving Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations. The group includes a representative of a national urban Indian Health organization and the IHS. Certain states must seek advice from IHPs and UIOs before submitting Medicaid plan amendments or waiver requests that directly affect them. The new law establishes a Tribal Technical Advisory Group within CMS for consultation on health care programs involving Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations. States must seek advice from IHPs and UIOs before making changes to Medicaid or CHIP that affect them. The Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General will receive $31.25 million for oversight of federal Medicaid funds. The provision includes a $5 million appropriation for FY2009 to implement the temporary increased FMAP provision. The funding is available until the end of FY2011. CBO estimated that this would increase federal expenditures by $5 million in FY2009 and by $31 million in total. The provision under P.L. 111-5 includes a $5 million appropriation for FY2009 to implement the temporary increased FMAP provision. CBO estimated a $31 million increase in federal expenditures for FY2009 to monitor recession spending. The Comptroller General and GAO are tasked with studying economic recessions since 1974 and developing recommendations for addressing states' needs during such downturns. GAO is required to submit a report by April 1, 2011, with recommendations for modifying the national economic downturn assistance formula for temporary Medicaid FMAP. The report should address improvements needed for the countercyclical FMAP to better address states' needs during economic downturns, including adjusting the amount to account for state variations and actual Medicaid costs. It should also analyze the impact of recessions on states, such as declines in health insurance coverage, state revenues, and growth of caseloads under public health benefit programs. The report should address improvements needed for countercyclical FMAP to better address states' needs during economic downturns, including adjusting the amount to account for state variations and actual Medicaid costs. It should also analyze the impact of recessions on states, such as declines in health insurance coverage, state revenues, and growth of caseloads under public health benefit programs. Additionally, funded programs provide health benefits coverage to state residents, with recommendations for addressing the effects on states of specific economic indicators determined by GAO."
