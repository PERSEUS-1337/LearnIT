    "content": "In 1938, Congress passed the FD&C Act to protect public health by regulating products in interstate commerce. The FDA enforces the Act, which requires premarket approval for prescription drugs. Manufacturers must submit a new drug application (NDA) to FDA, including safety and effectiveness data, to market a new brand-name drug. FDA approves NDAs based on demonstrated safety and efficacy. The FD&C Act authorizes FDA to refuse NDA approval if labeling is false or misleading. Many drugs, including opioids, are reformulations of existing products approved through NDAs. FDA has postmarket authority to monitor drug safety and may require labeling changes. The FDA has broad authority under the FD&C Act to require postmarket drug labeling changes, conduct postapproval studies and clinical trials, implement risk evaluation mitigation strategies, and monitor safety data through a postmarket risk assessment system. The agency can also promulgate regulations and develop guidance documents to enforce the Act's mandates. The FDA has authority under the FD&C Act to regulate products with \"imminent danger to health\" or \"gross deception to the consumer.\" Ensuring the safety and efficacy of opioids is challenging due to their potential for abuse. Opioid pain medications were historically used in the US primarily for acute and cancer-related pain. The liberal prescribing of opioids in the US began in the 1980s, leading to the approval of OxyContin in 1995 by the FDA. This shift in views on opioids contributed to the current opioid epidemic, with an estimated 11.5 million Americans abusing prescription painkillers by 2016. The FDA faces legal and policy questions regarding its role in regulating painkillers amidst the opioid epidemic. Officials aim to balance combating misuse and addiction while ensuring patients with severe pain are protected. The agency's authority to consider drug misuse in regulatory actions is questioned, but it has discretion in decision-making under the FD&C Act provisions. FDA exercises discretion in regulatory decisions, focusing on combating prescription opioid abuse and addiction. The agency's multifaceted approach includes decreasing exposure, supporting treatment, developing new therapies, and improving enforcement. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb emphasizes reducing overall opioid drug exposure. The FDA is working to lower exposure to opioid drugs to reduce addiction cases. Inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to the epidemic, and the FDA is using its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to influence healthcare provider behavior. FDA approves drugs based on evidence of safety and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of a proper benefit-risk balance. The FDA can require additional safety controls for certain drugs through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure benefits outweigh risks. REMS is a mandatory risk management plan for drug manufacturers subject to FDA approval, which may include providing information to patients and healthcare providers or imposing distribution limitations. The FDA may require a REMS as a condition of a product's approval or impose it on an already approved product. Discussions have focused on opioid prescriber education, potentially mandating healthcare provider training on proper opioid prescribing. Questions arise about FDA's authority to compel training through a REMS, considering traditional state regulation of healthcare providers. REMS may include additional safety precautions. The FDA may require REMS with additional safety precautions, known as \"elements to assure safe use\" (ETASU), for drugs with inherent toxicity. ETASUs aim to mitigate serious adverse drug experiences by mandating specific training or certification for healthcare providers. The FDA may require REMS with additional safety precautions, known as \"elements to assure safe use\" (ETASU), for drugs with inherent toxicity. This may include mandating specific training or certification for healthcare providers at a reasonable cost. The responsible person must ensure that the requirements of the REMS are carried out and assess whether the goals of the strategy are being met. In 2012, FDA approved a REMS for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics. In 2012, FDA approved a REMS for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics, requiring voluntary training for healthcare providers. In September 2018, an expanded REMS was approved, including immediate-release opioids. Manufacturers must provide educational programs based on an FDA blueprint for opioid prescribers and other healthcare providers. The FDA is considering making educational training mandatory for healthcare providers prescribing opioids to address the opioid epidemic. Efforts also include promoting broader access to naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. The FD&C Act regulates the safety and efficacy of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. OTC drugs can be purchased by consumers without a prescription and are labeled to prevent misuse. There are over 300,000 OTC drug products available in various therapeutic categories. OTC drug products can fall into over 80 therapeutic categories. FDA can switch a drug to OTC status through rulemaking or by the drug sponsor submitting an NDA. The latter approach is the more common pathway for drugs to switch to OTC status. FDA officials support granting naloxone OTC status and are assisting manufacturers in the application process. FDA requires a consumer-friendly Drug Facts Label for OTC products to ensure safe and correct usage. States have taken action to make naloxone more accessible despite FDA not approving it for OTC use. Many states allow third-party prescriptions for naloxone, providing an exception to typical prescription laws. Some states permit naloxone prescriptions through standing orders, bypassing the need for a prescriber's examination. FDA is collaborating to develop abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, with 10 already approved. The FDA is working on abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, but generic opioids with FDA-approved abuse-deterrent labeling are not available. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for quicker approval of generic drugs that mimic brand-name drugs. The FDA issued guidance for generic drug applicants to demonstrate abuse deterrent properties in line with brand-name drugs. Additional draft guidance was also released to assist in bringing generic ADF opioid products to market. The FDA has enforcement mechanisms in place for marketing diverted opioids and unapproved drugs, including civil monetary penalties, injunctions, seizures, fines, and imprisonment. Warning letters are often issued for voluntary compliance before further enforcement action is taken. In a recent example, FDA issued warning letters to marketers and distributors of kratom products in May 2018. The FDA issued warning letters to marketers and distributors of kratom products for making unproven claims about treating opioid addiction. The products are considered unapproved new drugs and the FDA requested immediate corrective action. FDA can withdraw approval for certain opioid medications if benefits are outweighed by abuse potential. The FDA can withdraw approval of a drug if new evidence shows it is unsafe. Manufacturers are given notice and a hearing before approval is withdrawn. FDA may immediately suspend approval if the drug poses a public health hazard. FDA has withdrawn approval for around 600 drugs and is willing to do so for products with abuse potential. In 2017, FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals to recall Opana ER due to abuse potential. The product aimed to curb opioid abuse but led to a large HIV outbreak in Indiana. The company complied with FDA's request in July 2017. In October 2018, Congress passed the SUPPORT Act to address opioid misuse. The Act includes provisions to promote appropriate prescribing practices and empower FDA to compel a REMS for drugs with a risk of overdose or abuse. The FDA has the authority to monitor drugs on the market and may require postmarket labeling changes or postapproval studies. Limited data exists on the long-term efficacy and impacts of opioid analgesics for chronic pain, prompting the need for further research. The SUPPORT Act amends the FD&C Act to clarify FDA's authority for postmarket studies and trials on drugs with reduced effectiveness. It also allows FDA to compel labeling changes based on new information. The Act directs FDA to hold public meetings and issue guidance for nonaddictive therapies for chronic pain or opioid addiction. The SUPPORT Act amends the FD&C Act to provide the HHS Secretary with additional enforcement tools to address the opioid epidemic, including the ability to order immediate cessation of distribution of controlled substances if they pose serious health risks. The SUPPORT Act grants the HHS Secretary the authority to order the immediate cessation of distributing controlled substances that pose health risks. The FDA, in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, can inspect, detain, and refuse entry to imported drugs and products. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has highlighted challenges with diverted opioids. The SUPPORT Act aims to streamline the process of refusing entry to diverted or illegal drug products entering the United States through international mail facilities. It directs the FDA Commissioner to coordinate with the Secretary of Homeland Security on customs and border protection activities related to illegal controlled substances and drug imports. The U.S. Postal Service is required to upgrade import facilities where the FDA operates."
