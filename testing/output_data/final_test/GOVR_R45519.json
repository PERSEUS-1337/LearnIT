The M-2 is considered near the end of its useful life and unable to accommodate necessary upgrades for modern warfare. Congress may be concerned about the OMFV's impact on ground forces and its cost-effectiveness compared to the M-2. Past unsuccessful Army acquisition programs have increased congressional oversight. The Army's OMFV program will face high congressional oversight due to concerns about its impact on ground forces, cost-effectiveness, and use of Section 804 authority. The NGCV Program includes the OMFV as the M-2 Bradley IFV replacement and the AMPV as the M-113 replacement. The Army's NGCV Program includes the OMFV as the M-2 Bradley IFV replacement, AMPV as the M-113 replacement, MPF as a light tank for IBCTs, RCVs in three versions, and DLP as the M-1 Abrams tank replacement. AMPV and MPF programs are in LRIP and Prototype Development, overseen by PEO Ground Combat Systems. NGCV CFT will determine operational requirements and acquisition schedule. The focus of this report is on OMFV and RCVs. The report focuses on the OMFV and associated RCVs, with the Army's preliminary operational requirements for the OMFV including optional manned capability, transportability, dense urban terrain operations, protection, and growth. The OMFV should have sufficient size, weight, power, and cooling for automotive and electrical purposes, as well as provide immediate, precise, and lethal firepower in various conditions. It should also include embedded training systems, demonstrate breakthroughs in power generation for increased operational range and fuel efficiency, and improve part and component reliability. The M-2 Bradley is an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) used for transporting infantry and providing fire support. It has a crew of three and carries seven infantry soldiers. The first prototypes were delivered in December 1978, with upgrades continuing since then. The Army plans to upgrade to the M-2A5 version. The M-2 Bradley, an Infantry Fighting Vehicle, is set for an upgrade to the M-2A5 version in the mid-2020s. A notable limitation is that it can only accommodate seven out of nine infantry soldiers in a squad, posing challenges for command and control. Despite satisfactory performance in past operations, losses have been reported due to mines and IEDs. Reports of vehicle and crew losses from mines, IEDs, and anti-tank rockets have raised concerns about the survivability of the M-2 Bradley, which is reaching its technological limits for upgrades. Efforts to mount active protection systems on the Bradley are proving difficult, making it a candidate for replacement due to operational limitations and combat vulnerabilities. The Army has attempted to replace it twice before. The Army has twice attempted to replace the M-2 Bradley IFV, first with the Future Combat System (FCS) Program in 2009 and then with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) Program in 2014, both of which were cancelled. These cancellations have raised doubts about the Army's ability to develop and field ground combat systems. The FCS program, introduced in 1999, aimed to create a family of networked vehicles for the future battlefield but was cancelled due to various factors. The cancellation of the Future Combat System (FCS) program in 2009 was due to a variety of factors, including management issues, technological failures, and cost increases. After $21.4 billion spent, Secretary Gates restructured the program, leading to its effective cancellation. The Army was directed to develop a Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) in 2009, incorporating lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, a review of the GCV program was conducted to assess acquisition strategy and vehicle capabilities. The GCV program was reviewed in 2014 and found to rely on immature technologies, have too many performance requirements, and be unaffordable due to excessive capabilities. The Army recommended terminating the program and redirecting funds towards a next-generation platform, costing an estimated $1.5 billion. Following this, the Army initiated the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) effort in 2015, conducting industry studies before starting a new program. Army combat vehicle modernization efforts post-FCS have been cautious and deliberate. After the termination of the GCV program in 2014, the Army initiated the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) effort in 2015. Army combat vehicle modernization efforts post-FCS have focused on upgrading existing platforms due to budget restrictions and senior leadership reluctance. Congressional concerns led to the Army announcing a new modernization strategy in June 2018, with NGCVs designated as a top priority. The NGCV program, initially meant to replace the M-2 Bradley, is managed by the Program Executive Officer (PEO) Ground Combat Systems. The Army established a Modernization Task Force in November 2017 to create an Army Futures Command (AFC) for consolidating modernization efforts. AFC, headquartered in Austin, TX, achieved initial operating capability on July 1, 2018. It aims to unify modernization activities previously spread among various Army commands. Army Futures Command (AFC) achieved initial operating capability on July 1, 2018, with plans to reach full operating capacity in summer 2019. The headquarters will consist of approximately 500 personnel, including 100 uniformed and 400 Army civilians. Sub-organizations will transition to AFC, utilizing Cross-Functional Teams (CFT) for modernization efforts. CFTs aim to increase efficiency by leveraging industry and academia expertise, utilizing experimentation, prototyping, and demonstrations to improve requirements efficiency. No physical relocation of units or personnel from existing commands is planned at this time. The Army Futures Command (AFC) has established Cross-Functional Teams (CFTs) to enhance modernization efforts. The eight CFTs focus on various areas such as Long Range Precision Fires, Next Generation Combat Vehicle, and Soldier Lethality. AFC is responsible for setting requirements and supporting Program Executive Officers (PEOs). The NGCV Program Manager reports to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. The Army Futures Command (AFC) is responsible for requirements and supporting Program Executive Officers (PEOs). The NGCV Program Manager, under the control of ASA (ALT), is to be teamed with Cross-Functional Teams (CFTs) under AFC. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that AFC has not established clear policies and procedures for executing its mission. Coordination with existing Army acquisition organizations, such as ASA (ALT), remains unclear. The NGCV program under the Army Futures Command is facing uncertainty in its management. The original plan for the OMFV program included five years of Technology Development starting in FY2019, leading to a Milestone B decision in FY2024. If successful, the program would move into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase by FY2028, with the goal of equipping the first unit by FY2032. The Army plans to accelerate the OMFV timeline, aiming for an FY2026 fielding with a heavily modified off-the-shelf model. They are considering a 50 mm cannon on industry-proposed vehicles and will award up to two vendors EMD contracts in FY2020. The Army plans to move the OMFV program into the Production and Development phase in FY2023 and equip the first units by FY2026. They aim to award a production contract for up to 3,590 OMFVs to a single vendor, with five to seven vendors expected to compete for the EMD contract. BAE Systems is proposing the CV-90 with a 35 mm cannon and Israeli APS, while GDLS is proposing the Griffin III with a 50 mm cannon on a British Ajax chassis. The Army plans to develop three RCV variants: Light, Medium, and Heavy, as part of the revised NGCV Program. RCVs are envisioned to serve as \"scouts\" and \"escorts\" for manned OMFVs, deterring ambushes and guarding flanks. Improved technology may allow a single operator to control multiple RCVs. Raytheon/Rheinmetall proposes the Lynx vehicle, capable of mounting a 50 mm cannon, APS, and accommodating a nine-soldier infantry squad. The Army plans to develop three RCV variants: Light, Medium, and Heavy, as part of the revised NGCV Program. Technology and artificial intelligence will enable a single operator to control multiple RCVs. The RCV-L is under 10 tons, transportable by rotary wing assets, and can accommodate an ATGM or recoilless weapon. The RCV-M is 10-20 tons, transportable by a C-130 aircraft, and can carry multiple ATGMs or cannons. The RCV-H is 20-30 tons, transportable by a C-17 aircraft. All variants are expected to have robust sensor packages and integrate with UAVs. The RCV-H variant is expected to weigh between 20 to 30 tons and be transportable by a C-17 aircraft. It should have an onboard weapon system capable of destroying enemy IFVs and tanks, a robust sensor package, and integration with UAVs. The Army plans to experiment with human interface devices and reconnaissance and lethality technologies from FY2020 to FY2023. Prototype contracts are expected to be issued in November 2019, with a procurement decision anticipated in FY2023 under the authority of Section 804 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) utilizes \"804 Authority\" to quickly develop and deploy capabilities outside the traditional acquisition system. This allows for the delivery of a prototype capability in two to five years through Rapid Prototyping or Rapid Fielding pathways. By using 804 Authority, the services can bypass oversight bodies like the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the Joint Capabilities Integration Development Systems (JCIDS), which can slow down the acquisition process. The objectives of Rapid Prototyping include fielding a prototype for operational demonstration and providing residual operational capability within five years of an approved requirement. Rapid Fielding aims to start production within six months and complete fielding within five years of an approved requirement. The Army plans to utilize Rapid Prototyping for the OMFV program. The Army plans to use Rapid Prototyping under Section 804 for the OMFV program to enter the EMD Phase without a Technical Maturation Phase. Some in DOD support Section 804 for faster fielding, while critics argue it won't simplify technology development. Frank Kendall, from Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, emphasizes that the complexity and technical difficulty of a product drive its development schedule. Reducing requirements and simplifying designs can speed up prototype building, but it may not align with operator needs. Unrealistic schedules can lead to poor outcomes. Maintaining visibility of 804 prototyping is crucial for proper use, and developing data collection processes can provide insight into project management. The Army requested $378 million in RDT&E funding for the OMFV program and $109 million for the RCV in its FY2020 budget. Funding will be used for technological upgrades like APS, XM 913 50 mm cannon, and FLIR for the OMFV. RCV funding will be used for prototypes and manned-unmanned teaming evaluations. Congressional oversight is crucial for proper use of Section 804 authority. The Army's OMFV program aims to replace the M-2 Bradley IFV, following two failed attempts. Issues with immature technologies and changing performance requirements led to the cancellation of previous programs. The Army believes prototyping and the Army Futures Command may address these issues, but specific measures are needed to prevent past problems. Congress could require the Army to outline these measures for better program oversight. Congress may consider mandating the Army to clarify how it will address technological challenges and \"requirements creep\" in the OMFV program. Key questions include who will provide input, adjudicate inputs, and make final decisions on performance requirements. Understanding these standards can aid policymakers in ensuring program accountability, especially if requirements change. The failure of the FCS program was attributed to a complex program management approach, which involved multiple organizations and processes. Program management of the OMFV program should be carefully monitored to avoid similar issues. The program management of the OMFV and RCV programs is complex and ill-defined. Congress should examine the Army's proposed management structure to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. RCVs are envisioned to enhance OMFV survivability as scouts and escorts. The Army envisions RCVs as scouts and escorts for manned OMFVs, aiming to increase ABCTs' overall lethality. However, technological challenges may delay the planned FY2026 fielding date. The OMFV and RCV are seen as complementary systems, with the OMFV offering significant improvements over the Bradley. Operating alone without RCVs, the OMFV may offer limited benefits. The OMFV may offer little operational improvement over the M-2 Bradley without accompanying RCVs. Understanding the relationship between OMFV and RCVs is crucial in case of delays in RCV fielding. Questions for Congress include the role of Army Futures Command in integrating OMFV and RCV requirements. Section 804 authority shows promise in developing weapon systems quickly, but complexities in technology development remain. The potential benefits and risks of using Section 804 authority for the OMFV program, in replacing the M-2 Bradley, need to be carefully examined by policymakers."
