    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the use of M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels in Alaska has led to numerous health complaints, including headaches, sore throats, asthma, and skin rashes. Tests conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found methyl tertiary butyl ether in the blood of workers exposed to M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels. More studies are needed to determine the health effects of exposure to the substance, especially in cold climates with temperatures reaching 50 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The State epidemiologist of Alaska suspended the M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels program in Fairbanks due to health concerns. Similar illnesses may be caused by the program in Anchorage. Further studies on the health effects of M-T-B-E fuels are needed before the public is exposed to them. Ethanol blend oxygenated fuels may have drivability and safety issues in ultra-cold temperatures in Alaska. The M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels requirement is waived. Section 211(m)(3) of the Clean Air Act is amended to allow the Governor of Alaska to petition for a waiver of carbon monoxide requirements in nonattainment areas if compliance is not feasible for technological or economic reasons. The Administrator must grant or deny a waiver petition within 60 days. Additionally, a study must be conducted by the Administrator. The Administrator will conduct a study comparing health risks and costs of carbon monoxide nonattainment in Alaska with increased noncarbon monoxide emissions from M-T-B-E oxygenated fuels. The results must be reported to Congress within 1 year. The use of oxygenated fuels may be suspended during a waiver petition or until the health risk study is completed."
