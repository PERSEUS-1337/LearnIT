The Army and Marine Corps are working to equip Reserve and National Guard units with newer equipment to match the Active component. Efforts are also being made to re-equip pre-positioned stocks. The Army and Marine Corps are re-equipping pre-positioned stocks used in Afghanistan and Iraq. They are actively acquiring new equipment based on wartime experiences to address equipment shortages. Congress is concerned about equipping units due to the increasing sophistication and cost of weapons. Units have historically faced shortages and have resorted to \"cross leveling\" to redistribute equipment. Protracted conflicts like Afghanistan and Iraq help identify equipment needs and lead to the development of new equipment such as MRAP vehicles. These conflicts also increase equipment usage rates, reducing their useful life and increasing repair and replacement needs. Equipping Army and Marine Corps units involves various dimensions that are explored further. Equipping Army and Marine Corps units involves funding limitations, delays in fielding equipment, and efforts to bring units up to authorized levels before deployment. Options for acquiring equipment include requisitioning through supply chains, but practicality may vary. The Army and Marines are facing significant equipment demands as units are provided with additional equipment beyond peacetime levels. This is due to the wide geographical area of operations for brigade combat teams and the need for extensive equipment augmentation for light infantry units like the 10th Mountain Division and 101st Airborne. The Marine Corps is executing operational missions that require extensive equipment augmentation for light infantry units. They have revised the Equipment Density List to increase the quantity of equipment issued to Marine Units deploying into CENTCOM. The large distances between forward operating bases necessitate additional vehicles, communications capabilities, and crew-served weapons. The Marine Corps has increased equipment requirements for units deploying into CENTCOM, including additional vehicles, communications capabilities, and crew-served weapons. Cross-leveling is used to transfer equipment between units to meet these increased demands. Both the Army and Marines have utilized cross-leveling extensively during the Afghan and Iraq conflicts. The initiative Theater Provided Equipment (TPE) started in 2003 to leave equipment in theater for units deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq. This includes armored vehicles, body armor, and counter-IED equipment. The Marines also leave necessary equipment in theater for their operations. The Army and Marines have established equipment pools in theater to rapidly replace damaged or destroyed equipment. The Army's Theater Sustainment Stocks (TSS) include 400 types of vehicles and 174,000 pieces of equipment, while the Marines have Forward In-Stores for major equipment replacements. National Guard and Reserve units leave equipment in theater, which is added to the TPE and TSS pools. The Army and Marines have established equipment pools in theater for rapid replacement of damaged or destroyed equipment. National Guard and Reserve units leave equipment in theater, which is added to the Army's Theater Sustainment Stocks (TSS) and the Marines' Forward In-Stores. The National Guard reportedly has only 56% of its authorized equipment, and it is unclear if plans are in place to replace equipment left in Iraq. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 authorizes $6.68 billion for National Guard and Reserve Equipment, exceeding the President's budget request by $980 million. Additionally, both the Army and Marines utilize prepositioned stocks for equipment support. The Army and Marines have utilized prepositioned stocks extensively to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, depleting these stocks and assuming near-term operational risks. The Army used almost all of its prepositioned ship stocks and stocks ashore in Kuwait, Qatar, and Europe, including thousands of pieces of equipment. The Marines also drew equipment and supplies from their prepositioning programs. The Army and Marines are reconstituting their prepositioned stocks to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army is focusing on building brigade-sized equipment sets in Kuwait and battalion-sized sets in Qatar and Afghanistan, using equipment from various sources that require substantial repair. Reports indicate that prepositioned stocks were heavily drawn upon to support the Iraq \"surge,\" resulting in the lowest level of stocks in five years. Normally, the Army has five full brigades' worth of prepositioned equipment available. The Army has five full brigades' worth of prepositioned equipment available in Kuwait, Korea, Guam, and Diego Garcia. Equipment shortages limit the Army's ability to respond to military contingencies, requiring $2.2 billion to replace prepositioned equipment issued to support the surge in Afghanistan and Iraq. It will take two years to rebuild the prepositioned stocks, worrying military officials and Congress. The early years of the Afghan and Iraq wars highlighted equipment deficiencies in protective gear for troops and vehicles. Congressional involvement has led to improvements in addressing these force protection issues. Body armor and the reliability of the Army's M-16 weapons remain concerns, while the Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Proof (MRAP) vehicle initiative is receiving attention. The Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Proof (MRAP) vehicles are designed to provide protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and are used by the Army and Marines for route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are three categories of MRAPs being procured by the Department of Defense, with different weights and passenger capacities. Since 2003, MRAPs have been used for route clearance and EOD operations, offering superior protection against IEDs compared to uparmored HMMWVs. The Secretary of Defense has prioritized MRAP procurement, with varying Service requirements. The JROC endorsed replacing all HMMWVs with MRAPs, potentially exceeding 23,000 vehicles. The GAO reported that the Army and Marines meet theater ballistic requirements and body armor needs for personnel in theater. The Army and Marines are working on improving Interceptor body armor systems for personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army discontinued the use of Dragon Skin body armor due to it not being certified against small arms threats. There are conflicting claims about Dragon Skin's performance in tests conducted by the Army and private entities. The Army discontinued the use of Dragon Skin body armor after it allegedly failed tests. Senators requested a comprehensive assessment of body armor systems. The Air Force recommended prohibiting Pinnacle Armor from new contracts due to false claims. Army began fielding the M-4 in the mid-1990s. The Army replaced the M-4 carbines with Heckler & Koch 416 carbines in 2004. The Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) program aimed to replace the M-16 family of weapons, with the XM-8 assault rifle considered as a potential replacement for the M-16/M-4. The XM-8 assault rifle was considered as a replacement for the M-16/M-4, but the program was canceled in 2005 due to conflicts within the Army. The Army plans to continue procuring M-16s and M-4s, with calls for an open competition for a successor. Resetting equipment is a significant issue for the Army and Marine Corps. Reset is the process of restoring unit equipment to combat capability after returning from operations, including repairing or replacing equipment. Recapitalization upgrades systems to extend service life and improve reliability based on lessons learned. Army funding and efforts led to an increase in the reset rate in FY2007, with plans to reset 117,000 major items of equipment by the end of the year. In FY2008, the Army aims to reset 24 brigade combat teams with soldiers and equipment returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A $50 billion program combines reset and modernization efforts, with funds allocated for rest, supplemental funding, and procurement. The Army plans to streamline tank variants and equipment by 2011 to optimize resources. The Army plans to consolidate tank and Bradley fighting vehicle variants, upgrade missile systems, replace trucks with new vehicles, and enhance armor protection for vehicles. Analysts suggest this approach could save money, but concerns exist about tracking costs. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes significant funding for Army reset, exceeding the Administration's budget request. The Marines estimate a substantial cost for Marine Corps reset. The end of FY2006 saw a $13.7 billion estimate for depot expenses, with concerns about equipment availability for reserve forces, particularly the Army National Guard. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 authorizes $8.6 billion for Marine Corps reset, exceeding the Administration's budget request. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the strain on National Guard equipment due to overseas missions, impacting readiness for domestic responsibilities. Steven Blum, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, informed the House Subcommittee on Readiness that the Army National Guard lacks 40% of its required equipment, hindering training and domestic response capabilities. Reports indicate that soldiers training for deployment lack essential equipment, raising concerns about combat readiness. The Army has committed to investing $21 billion over four years to re-equip the National Guard. The Army has pledged $21 billion to re-equip the National Guard over the next four years. Concerns have been raised that this equipment may be diverted to support the \"Surge\" in Iraq instead of being used to re-equip depleted National Guard units for domestic missions and training. Congress may examine DOD's and the Army's plans to ensure National Guard units are adequately equipped for both domestic and overseas responsibilities. The goal is to increase equipment levels from 40% to 80% to meet the needs of Guard and Reserve units. Some in Congress are concerned about the extended time and lack of comprehensive plan for reconstituting prepositioned stocks. The House Armed Services Committee requires DOD to submit an annual report on the status of these stocks, including funding requirements and strategic risk mitigation plans. Congress may also consider how the Army and Marines will reconstitute stocks with specialized equipment like Armored Security Vehicles and MRAPs. The Marines reduced their MRAP requirement from 3,700 to approximately 2,300 vehicles due to decreased IED attacks and limitations of MRAPs in off-road and confined areas. Counterinsurgency focus requires dismounting and close interaction with local populace. The Marines reduced their MRAP requirement from 3,700 to 2,300 vehicles due to decreased combat losses, resulting in potential cost savings of $1.7 billion. The Army is also expected to cut MRAPs from its 10,000-vehicle requirement due to decreasing casualties and IED attacks. This reduction is seen as prudent management by the DOD, considering the improving tactical situation in Iraq and anticipation of troop level reductions. The DOD needs to establish a firm requirement for the total number of MRAPs to be procured. Allegations of bureaucratic conflicts leading to the cancellation of the XM-8 assault rifle may warrant congressional examination. The Army's commitment to upgrading the M-4 carbine, despite other more reliable options available, raises questions about their tendency to pursue incremental improvements rather than procuring more effective systems."
