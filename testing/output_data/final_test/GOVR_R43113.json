U.S. interests in Cambodia include social, economic, and political development, trade, regional security, civil society, and human rights. The Obama Administration has sought to strengthen ties with Cambodia in response to China's growing influence in the region. Balancing engagement with Cambodia while promoting human rights and democracy is a key challenge for U.S. policy. Some suggest restricting relations until Prime Minister Hun Sen improves conditions. The Obama Administration has taken steps to strengthen U.S. ties with Cambodia, despite concerns about the country's close relationship with China. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Phnom Penh in 2010, urging Cambodia to not rely too heavily on China. In 2012, Cambodian Foreign Minister met with Clinton in Washington to discuss bilateral and regional issues. In July 2012, Secretary Clinton participated in the U.S.-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Phnom Penh, discussing U.S. support for ASEAN, maritime disputes in the South China Sea, and strategic pillars of U.S. engagement in the region. President Obama also visited Phnom Penh in November 2012 for the U.S.-ASEAN Leaders Meeting and the East Asia Summit, becoming the first U.S. President to visit Cambodia. During a meeting at an EAS summit, President Obama urged Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to improve human rights by releasing political prisoners and allowing more opposition party freedom. The U.S. has engaged with the Cambodian military to maintain leverage in the region, including naval visits, military assistance, and joint exercises for peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Since roughly 2006, the US has engaged with the Cambodian military through joint exercises in peacekeeping, counterterrorism cooperation, and maritime security. This collaboration has included naval visits, training programs, and participation in multilateral exercises like Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT). In 2012, the USS Blue Ridge visited Cambodia, leading to discussions on joint exercises, coastal security, and exploration and rescue activities. In March 2013, the third annual Angkor Sentinel, a bilateral peacekeeping exercise, took place in Cambodia. Cambodia owes the United States roughly $450 million for agricultural commodities provided in the early 1970s. The U.S. has forgiven nearly $100 million of the debt and is willing to reschedule loan payments and provide aid, but demands a bilateral debt agreement from Cambodia first. Cambodia must first sign a bilateral debt agreement and begin making payments before debt negotiations. President Obama pledged to find a solution during a 2012 meeting. The country heavily relies on foreign aid from Japan, the US, Australia, and Europe. International organizations and financial institutions have been coordinating aid and reforms since 1996. Cambodia is a member of ASEAN and has chaired the organization in the past. Cambodia, a member of ASEAN, chaired the organization in 2012. Its trade relations are significant with Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States. Cambodia's deference to China during its chairmanship of ASEAN led to tensions and the first failure in issuing a joint communiqu\u00e9 in ASEAN's history. The standoff between China and the Philippines at Scarborough Shoal is opposed by Beijing. Cambodia and Thailand have a history of conflict despite cultural similarities and strong economic ties. Border tensions have erupted between the two countries, including clashes over the sovereignty of the Khmer Preah Vihear temple. Border clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops have resulted in deaths since 2008. Yingluck Shinawatra, Thailand's Prime Minister, has worked to improve relations with Cambodia. The International Court of Justice held hearings on the dispute in April 2013. The relationship between Cambodian communists (Khmer Rouge) and the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) has been marked by suspicion and conflict, leading to the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia from 1979-1989. Hun Sen, a key figure in Cambodian leadership, has maintained close ties with Vietnam, including defense cooperation agreements signed in April 2013. Many Cambodians view Vietnam with caution. Some Cambodians are wary of Vietnam due to historical control over parts of Cambodia. Opposition leaders criticize Hun Sen for cooperating with Vietnam on border issues. China is now a major economic benefactor in Cambodia, influencing its foreign policies. Hun Sen values relations with multiple foreign powers, with Chinese economic interests growing in Cambodia. China plays a significant role in Cambodia's development through development assistance, concessional loans, infrastructure projects, and investment packages. Premier Wen Jiabao and Premier Li Keqiang have strengthened economic ties with Cambodia, providing soft loans and grants. China has also supported the Cambodian Armed Forces with loans, military equipment, and training, signing defense cooperation agreements. Cambodia has made progress in areas of U.S. interest, including elections, civil society, labor rights, and public health. Hun Sen and the CPP have popular support, especially in rural areas. A survey found 79% felt the country was heading in the right direction, citing new infrastructure as reasons for optimism. Corruption and drug trade are major concerns. The political system has become less democratic in recent years. In recent years, Cambodia's political system has become less democratic, with civil liberties being encroached upon. Despite some opposition groups gaining parliamentary seats through voter discontent, Hun Sen's hold on power seems secure. Critics argue that Hun Sen has unfair campaign advantages due to his control over media and intimidation of opponents. The press can criticize the government, but its reach is limited. The print media in Cambodia has limited reach and the Prime Minister has silenced political opponents through defamation lawsuits. The penal code allows for charges of defamation and incitement for speech that affects the dignity of individuals or creates turmoil in society. Corruption is prevalent in governance, with suspicions of politically motivated killings involving the ruling party. Despite progress in democratic institutions, the ruling party's dominance limits transparency. The ruling Cambodian People's Party has limited transparency, stifled dissent, and suppressed free speech. In October 2012, Mam Sonando was sentenced to 20 years in prison for insurrection, a charge considered politically motivated. In March 2013, Sonando was released after international pressure. The space for civil society in Cambodia is shrinking, with the government pressuring lawyers and outlawing demonstrations in the capital. In the capital, demonstrations have been outlawed except in a designated \"freedom park.\" Government crackdowns on protestors have occurred, including detentions and firing upon them. In the 2008 national elections, opposition parties won a total of 29 seats. The ruling party, CPP, won local elections in 2012 by a wide margin. The Sam Rainsy Party and the Human Rights Party merged in 2012 to form the National Rescue Party. Many expect the July 2013 national elections to be contentious. Many experts fear that the 2013 elections in Cambodia may not be fair or credible, as Hun Sen's political power has increased since 2008. The ruling CPP is expected to maintain its majority, with the royalists no longer posing a challenge. Despite some irregularities in the 2008 elections, foreign monitors considered them largely honest. Concerns persist that Hun Sen may not ensure proper conduct of the upcoming elections. The 2013 elections in Cambodia are facing concerns about fairness and credibility. Major issues include the prohibition of opposition leader Sam Rainsy from running, expulsion of opposition lawmakers, inaccurate voter lists, and bias of the National Election Committee. Sam Rainsy, a prominent opposition voice, was in exile in France and faced politically motivated charges. The National Election Committee barred him from participating in the elections due to his criminal convictions. Following international pressure, King Norodom Sihamoni pardoned Sam Rainsy on July 15, 2013, allowing him to return to Cambodia just days before the July 28 elections. Despite the pardon, the National Election Committee still deemed Sam Rainsy ineligible to vote or run as a candidate. Additionally, on June 5, 2013, 29 lawmakers, including 27 opposition legislators, were expelled from Parliament for switching parties. The Permanent Committee's decision to expel lawmakers who switched parties, including joining the National Rescue Party, was criticized as unconstitutional by opposition members. The U.S. government expressed concern and urged full political participation, while the parliament's foreign affairs commission defended the decision. Analysts warn that incomplete voter lists could impact the legitimacy of national elections. The quality of voter lists in Cambodia has declined, with voter registration dropping from 88% in 2008 to 83% in 2013. Over 10% of voters were not registered, and the National Election Committee is criticized for its close ties to the ruling party. Tens of thousands of Cambodians have been displaced due to land confiscation for various development projects. Since 2003, over 400,000 Cambodians have been affected by forced evictions for various development projects. Many lack proper property deeds, leading to protests against resettlement and inadequate compensation. In 2012, Hun Sen promised land titles to farmers and a moratorium on land concessions, but critics argue the scheme is not comprehensive. The land titling scheme in Cambodia is criticized for not being comprehensive, excluding urban areas and indigenous collective property. The process lacks transparency and accountability, influenced by powerful interests, leading to disputes, arrests, and violence. Some view the announcement as a political move, with reports of warnings from Hun Sen to villagers. The titling program was suspended until after national elections in 2013. Despite efforts to combat trafficking, improvements in Cambodia have reportedly stalled according to the State Department. Cambodia has been placed in the \"Tier 2\" category by the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons for consecutive years, indicating that the government is not fully compliant with minimum standards under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. In 2013, Cambodia's status fell to \"Tier 2 Watch List\" due to a lack of progress. The country is a source, transit, and destination for human trafficking, with reports of corruption among government officials in Cambodia and Thailand. Cambodians have been victims of various forms of trafficking, including sex trafficking, domestic servitude, debt bondage, and forced labor. Despite some improvements, particularly in combating child sex trafficking, challenges persist. The Cambodian government has failed to make progress in holding trafficking offenders and child sex tourists accountable. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) began proceedings in 2006 to try Khmer Rouge leaders and others responsible for crimes against humanity, with Japan being the top foreign donor. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) has faced challenges including interference from the Cambodian government, corruption, resignations of international judges, and budget shortfalls. Japan has been a top donor, contributing $78.7 million since 2006. The United States initially withheld assistance due to doubts about the court's independence but later provided nearly $17 million between 2008 and 2012. The U.S. government has provided financial support to the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Five Khmer Rouge leaders have been charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes, including Kaing Guek Eav (Comrade Duch), Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, and Ieng Thirith. In 2010, Kaing Guek Eav was sentenced to 35 years in jail, later increased to life in prison in 2012. Of the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were in poor health, Ieng Thirith was declared unfit for trial, and Ieng Sary died before his trial was completed in 2013. Calls have been made to prosecute more Khmer Rouge officials, but Prime Minister Hun Sen opposes this for the sake of \"national reconciliation.\" Cambodian court officials have blocked the indictments of five additional suspects recommended by international members of the ECCC, arguing they were not senior leaders or most responsible during the Khmer Rouge period. Cambodia heavily relies on foreign aid, with Japan, the United States, Australia, Germany, and France being the largest providers. Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries provided an average of $640 million per year between 2009. Cambodia is the fourth-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid in Southeast Asia, receiving $76 million in FY2012 for various aid programs including democratic elections, civil society, agricultural productivity, and global health initiatives. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) to promote cooperation and capacity building in education, health, women's issues, regional infrastructure, and the environment in Southeast Asia. The initiative includes Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with the US providing $50 million over three years for LMI programs as part of its rebalancing policy in the Asia Pacific region. The LMI provides support to the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to address environmental effects of hydropower projects in the Pacific region. Cambodia is heavily affected by unexploded ordnance (UXO) from past conflicts, with an estimated 27,000 casualties since 1992. U.S. assistance includes UXO removal and related training. U.S. assistance to Cambodia includes support for removing UXO/ERW and related training, Leahy War Victims Fund programs, prostheses, physical rehabilitation, and support to NGOs. The casualty rate has decreased from 900 per year in 2005 to under 200 in 2012 with international aid. Congress prohibited direct assistance to Cambodia from 1998 to 2007 to pressure Prime Minister Hun Sen for democratic reforms, but lifted the ban in 2007 due to improvements. Assistance is mainly channeled through NGOs to build a vital civil society in Cambodia. Some policymakers suggest restricting foreign aid to Cambodia. Some foreign aid donors have criticized the Cambodian government's governance despite providing assistance. Japan and Australia have strong ties with Cambodia, while China is the largest provider of aid, focusing on loans and infrastructure development. The U.S. may restrict aid if the 2013 elections are deemed not credible. Cambodia receives aid from various countries, with China being the largest provider despite criticism for hindering progress in governance and corruption. The country has seen economic growth driven by agriculture, construction, garment sector, and tourism, but faces challenges such as income inequality, poor education, weak institutions, and corruption. The United States may consider restricting aid based on the credibility of the 2013 elections. The United States is a significant market for Cambodian goods, particularly in the garment sector. Bilateral trade between the two countries has fluctuated but has rebounded in recent years. In 2012, bilateral trade was valued at $2.9 billion, with the majority of U.S. imports being apparel. Cambodia and the United States have signed trade agreements, including a bilateral trade agreement in 1996 and a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 2006. Cambodia became a member of the WTO in 2004. Cambodia, a member of ASEAN since 1999, acceded to the WTO in October 2004. The Kingdom is committed to participating in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 2015 and is also part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam are principal foreign investors in Cambodia. China is the largest investor with $9 billion in cumulative investment, while the US invested $144 million in 2011. Tourism accounts for 12% of Cambodia's GDP and provides 350,000 jobs. Offshore oil production is a hopeful prospect for the country. Offshore oil production in Cambodia is anticipated to boost government revenues and the economy. Companies like Chevron are working in the Gulf of Thailand to develop oil reserves estimated at 500 million barrels. The start date for oil production has been delayed to 2017. Cambodian garment factories have a good reputation for labor practices due to a U.S.-Cambodia agreement in 1999 that incentivized progress in labor conditions for increased access to the U.S. market. The International Labor Organization monitors and promotes good labor practices in Cambodia under the Better Factories Cambodia program. Labor relations in Cambodia have shown strain in recent years, with workers having the right to form unions and strike. In 2013, 20,000 workers went on strike for better conditions. Some Cambodians appreciate China's role in development, while others criticize its negative impacts. China has become Cambodia's largest investor, focusing on garments, agriculture, and mining. Chinese companies are involved in infrastructure projects like building a rail line, sea port, and steel plant. They are also constructing dams for energy needs, raising concerns among environmentalists and locals who rely on the rivers. Chinese-backed dams in Cambodia are a source of concern for environmentalists and locals who depend on the waterways for their livelihood. These hydropower projects, financed and constructed by Chinese entities, operate under a \"build-operate-transfer\" arrangement. Critics argue that the terms are unfavorable to Cambodia, with little transparency or public input in the project's conception and environmental assessments. Experts warn that the dams pose risks to fish supplies, soil conditions, water sources, wildlife, and ecological balances. Similar issues have been reported with Chinese-built dams in Laos and Vietnam. Chinese-backed dams in Cambodia are a source of concern for environmentalists and locals. Proponents argue that China is filling a void left by the World Bank and other countries in hydropower projects. Cambodian economic development and Chinese demand for hardwood threaten forests. Stronger environmental policies in neighboring countries add pressure on the Cambodian timber market. In 2012, an environmental activist and journalist were killed under suspicious circumstances. In 2012, journalists exposing illegal logging in Cambodia were killed or arrested. The government suspended land grants to curb forced evictions and illegal logging."
