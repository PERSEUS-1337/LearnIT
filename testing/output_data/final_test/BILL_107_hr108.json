    "content": "The \"Seabed Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that oceans cover more than 2/3 of Earth's surface, contain a diverse range of life forms, and are essential for human population's income, nutrition, and natural services. The use of bottom trawling and other fishing gear on the seabed has significantly impacted an area twice the size of the contiguous United States each year. The use of bottom trawling and other fishing gear on the seabed has led to a loss of biological diversity, impacting both the ocean environment and industries dependent on it. Recovery from these effects is uncertain, with some areas potentially taking decades or centuries to fully recover. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. MORATORIUM.\" suggests a potential solution to the negative impacts of bottom trawling and other fishing gear on the seabed, by implementing a temporary halt on certain fishing activities. The text chunk proposes a moratorium on bottom trawling and mobile fishing gear in specific marine areas until a study is completed, impacts are deemed negligible, and fishery management plans are approved. The text chunk outlines regulations developed by fishery management councils to promote less destructive fishing gears and prohibit practices that threaten ecosystem sustainability in specific marine areas like Heceta Banks and Cordell Bank. The text chunk lists specific marine areas with coordinates where fishing regulations apply, including locations off the coast of California, Oregon, and Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. The text chunk provides specific marine areas with coordinates where fishing regulations apply, including locations in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the Gulf of Maine, and the central and southern Oregon coast. The Secretary of Commerce may further describe these areas for the purposes of the Act. The Secretary of Commerce may further describe specific marine areas where fishing regulations apply. The Secretary shall report annually on the recovery of these areas from bottom trawling effects. Subsection (a) does not apply if State laws or fishery management plans are equally effective in maintaining ecosystem sustainability. Definitions in this section clarify that \"negligible\" means not impacting fish stocks or marine life significantly, while \"sustainability of ecosystems\" refers to maintaining fish stock productivity and marine species abundance in specific areas. The curr_chunk states that certain areas are not affected by bottom trawling and other mobile fishing gear practices."
