    "content": "This paper challenges the prevailing belief in the deep learning community that recurrent networks are superior for sequence modeling. It introduces a temporal convolution network (TCN) that outperforms baseline RNN methods on various sequence modeling tasks. The advantage of RNNs in terms of \"infinite memory\" is shown to be largely overstated. The TCNs exhibit longer effective history sizes than RNNs, challenging the belief in RNN superiority for sequence modeling. It may be time to reconsider this notion. ConvNets and recurrent networks are key architectures for sequence modeling in deep learning. The default belief is that recurrent networks are best for sequential tasks, but there are exceptions. The paper aims to revisit this default thinking. In the early history of neural networks, convolutional models were proposed for sequence data, using 1-D filters to predict future elements. However, recurrent networks were favored for sequence modeling tasks, leading to the abandonment of convolutional models. Recurrent networks like LSTMs and GRUs have the advantage of infinite memory, allowing them to make predictions based on data from any point in a sequence. This capability overcomes the limitations of convolutional architectures in looking back in time. The paper argues that modern convolutional architectures, with the ability to train deep networks and increase receptive field size, typically outperform recurrent networks in sequence modeling. The paper introduces a generic temporal convolutional network (TCN) architecture for sequence prediction, emphasizing the use of modern convolutional design practices. It compares the TCN model extensively with alternative architectures. The paper introduces a generic temporal convolutional network (TCN) architecture for sequence prediction, comparing it extensively with alternative approaches on various sequence modeling tasks. The TCN model performs well on most problems with minimal tuning, challenging the assumption that RNNs are the default best method for sequence modeling tasks. Additionally, the paper empirically analyzes the myth of \"infinite memory\" in RNNs, showing that TCNs may demonstrate longer effective history sizes. In the history of recurrent and convolutional architectures for sequence prediction, RNNs have been the default method, but ConvNets are now being reconsidered. Recurrent networks maintain hidden activations over time to remember past sequences, but face challenges like the vanishing gradient problem. Solutions have been proposed to address this issue, with Long Short-Term Memory being introduced over twenty years ago. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was introduced over twenty years ago to address the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent networks. Other solutions and refinements include Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Clockwork RNN, MI-RNN, and Dilated RNN. Various regularization techniques like Zoneout and AWD-LSTM have been proposed to improve training of LSTMs, which have proven to be robust and difficult to surpass by other recurrent architectures. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was introduced to address the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent networks. While LSTM has proven difficult to surpass by other recurrent architectures, recent studies have explored the usage of convolutional architectures for time series data, such as time-delay networks (TDNNs) and CNNs, which have shown promise in sequence modeling. Recent studies have shown that convolutional models are being increasingly used for sequence modeling, with applications in audio signals, language modeling, machine translations, and more. Despite the success of convolutional models, there is still a general consensus in the deep learning community that RNNs, including LSTM and its variants, are better suited for sequence tasks. This paper reconsiders convolutional sequence modeling as an alternative to RNNs for sequence tasks. It introduces a general-purpose convolutional architecture that can replace RNNs and evaluates its performance on various tasks. The paper introduces a general-purpose convolutional architecture as an alternative to RNNs for sequence tasks. It aims to provide a simple, application-independent architecture for convolutional sequence prediction tasks, evaluating its performance across multiple domains. The paper proposes a generic architecture called Temporal Convolution Networks (TCNs) for convolutional sequence prediction tasks. The distinguishing features of TCNs include causal convolutions, the ability to map sequences of any length to an output sequence of the same length, and the use of deep networks with dilated convolutions to achieve long effective history sizes. The paper introduces Temporal Convolution Networks (TCNs) for convolutional sequence prediction tasks, emphasizing causal convolutions and the use of deep networks with dilated convolutions. The sequence modeling task involves predicting outputs y at each time based on previously observed inputs x, with the goal of finding a network f that minimizes expected loss between actual outputs and predictions. The TCN is a formalism for sequence prediction tasks, focusing on causal convolutions and deep networks with dilated convolutions. It uses a 1D fully-convolutional network architecture to ensure the output length matches the input length and prevents leakage from future to past. The TCN utilizes causal convolutions and deep networks with dilated convolutions in a 1D fully-convolutional network architecture. Zero padding is added to maintain equal layer lengths, and modern convolutional techniques are integrated to address limitations of the original architecture proposed 30 years ago. The TCN integrates modern convolutional techniques, such as dilated convolutions, to enable very deep networks and long effective history. Dilated convolutions allow for an exponentially large receptive field, addressing limitations of the original architecture proposed 30 years ago. Dilated convolutions in TCN use a dilation factor to increase the receptive field, allowing for deeper networks and longer effective history. By choosing larger filter sizes and increasing the dilation factor exponentially with network depth, the TCN can effectively expand its receptive field. The use of dilated convolutions in TCN allows for deeper networks and longer effective history by increasing the receptive field. Residual functions, proposed by BID19, are effective in training deep networks by allowing layers to learn modifications to the identity mapping. Stabilization of deeper and larger TCNs becomes important as the receptive field depends on network depth, filter size, and dilation factor. In designing a generic TCN model, a residual block with 2 layers of dilated causal convolution and non-linearity is used. Weight normalization is applied to the filters in the dilated convolution for normalization. An additional 1x1 convolution is added when the residual input and output have different dimensions. In a generic TCN model, a 2-D dropout BID46 layer is added after each dilated convolution for regularization. When input-output widths differ, an additional 1x1 convolution ensures tensors of the same shape for element-wise addition. Various optimizations like gating and skip connections can be incorporated into a TCN for specific needs. The TCN model offers advantages such as parallelism and flexible receptive field size, allowing for efficient processing of input sequences compared to RNNs. It can outperform LSTM on various tasks by a significant margin. The TCN model offers advantages such as parallelism, flexible receptive field size, and easy tuning for different domains. It ensures stable gradients by avoiding exploding/vanishing gradients, unlike RNNs. Additionally, TCN has low memory requirements for training, making it efficient for tasks with long input sequences. TCN offers advantages like parallelism, flexible receptive field size, and stable gradients. However, it may require more memory during evaluation compared to RNNs. Additionally, TCN may need parameter adjustments when transferring to different domains with varying history memorization needs. When transferring a model from a domain with little memory requirements to one with larger memory needs, TCN may struggle due to its limited receptive field. However, TCN outperforms RNNs in handling long temporal dependencies. Experiments comparing TCN and RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs were conducted across various tasks and datasets to assess sequence modeling capabilities. The experiments highlighted the effectiveness of TCN as a general-purpose architecture for sequence modeling, outperforming RNNs in handling long temporal dependencies. The experiments used the same TCN architecture with varying network depth and kernel size, utilizing an exponential dilation for layer n. Gradient clipping and hyperparameter tuning were also employed to improve training convergence. The experiments demonstrated TCN's superiority over RNNs in handling long temporal dependencies by optimizing hyperparameters like optimizer, recurrent dropout, learning rate, gradient clipping, and forget-gate bias. Additional experiments on filter size and residual function effects were conducted, with detailed results in appendices. The tasks considered included the adding problem, sequential MNIST, permuted MNIST, and the copy task.

Results show that TCN architecture often outperforms generic RNN approaches in sequence modeling tasks. Results show that TCN architecture outperforms RNNs in tasks like the Adding Problem, Sequential MNIST, and Permuted MNIST. TCNs quickly converge to near-perfect solutions with low MSE loss, while LSTMs and vanilla RNNs perform worse. GRUs also perform well but slightly slower than TCNs. The TCN architecture outperforms alternative architectures in tasks like the Copy Memory Task and real datasets in polyphonic music and language modeling. TCNs show quicker convergence to correct answers compared to LSTM and GRU, with a clear advantage for longer sequence lengths. In domains with practical interests, specialized RNNs like BID53, BID18, BID28, BID16, BID17, and BID36 have been developed. The TCN model outperforms other generic RNN architectures on Nottingham and JSB Chorales datasets, even beating improved recurrent models like HF-RNN BID5 and Diagonal RNN BID47. However, models like Deep Belief Net LSTM BID48 perform better on polyphonic music tasks due to small dataset sizes. In language modeling tasks, optimizing LSTM usage has been a focus, with weight tying in encoder and decoder layers to reduce parameters. Training involves using SGD optimizer with annealing learning rate. Results show LSTM outperforming TCN in perplexity on the Penn TreeBank dataset. TCN outperforms LSTM in perplexity on the Penn TreeBank dataset and Wikitext-103 corpus. It also achieves superior results on the LAMBADA test for predicting the last word based on a long context. Additionally, TCN shows better performance in character-level language modeling compared to regularized LSTM and GRU models. The generic TCN outperforms regularized LSTM and GRU in character-level language modeling. Using a filter size of k \u2264 4 is more effective than larger filter sizes. RNNs are preferred over CNNs for sequence modeling due to their theoretically infinite memory capacity. The study compares TCN and LSTM/GRU in the copy memory task and LAMBADA language modeling task to assess their memory capabilities. In comparison to regularized LSTM and GRU, the generic TCN performs better in character-level language modeling. TCNs consistently achieve 100% accuracy for all sequence lengths, while LSTM's accuracy drops below 20% for longer sequences, indicating limited memory capacity. Experiments on the LAMBADA dataset also support TCN's superior textual understanding in broader contexts. The TCN model outperforms LSTMs in perplexity on the LAMBADA dataset, indicating a longer effective history despite its finite history. This observation does not contradict the success of LSTM in language modeling.

The TCN model outperforms LSTM/GRU in sequence predictions and has better long-term memory capabilities. Despite being a generic architecture, TCN can still be beaten by specialized RNNs in specific problems. The TCN model can be beaten by specialized RNNs in specific problems, but it shows promise in studying time-series data. The Adding Problem involves summing two random values marked by 1 in a sequence. This task is commonly used to evaluate sequential models. Sequential models BID43 BID29 BID53 BID1 are tested on Sequential MNIST and P-MNIST tasks, where the model processes image sequences for digit classification. In a more challenging setting, the order of the sequence is permuted for the TCN model to classify (P-MNIST). The Copy Memory Task involves generating an output sequence based on a given input sequence with specific markers. The JSB Chorales dataset consists of 382 four-part harmonized chorales by J. S. Bach, with each input being a sequence of 88 dimensions representing piano keys. Nottingham dataset is larger than JSB Chorales and has been used in recurrent models' studies for polyphonic music. Performance is measured in terms of negative log-likelihood for both datasets. The TCN model was evaluated on the PennTreebank dataset for character-level and word-level language modeling tasks. The dataset contains a large number of characters and words for training, validation, and testing. Additionally, the model was also tested on the Wikitext-103 dataset, which is significantly larger than the PennTreebank dataset and contains a vast vocabulary size. The LAMBADA dataset, introduced by BID42, consists of 10K passages from novels with a challenging task of predicting the last word in a target sentence. It evaluates a model's textual understanding and ability to track information in broader discourse. The LAMBADA dataset, introduced by BID42, evaluates a model's ability to predict the last word in a target sentence using passages from novels. The dataset includes 10K passages and aims to assess textual understanding and information tracking in broader discourse. The dataset was evaluated in prior works such as BID16, with better results indicating a model's proficiency in capturing information from longer contexts. In a supplementary section, the authors report the hyperparameters used for the generic TCN model on various tasks/datasets. The key factor in parameter selection is ensuring a large receptive field for the TCN by choosing appropriate values for k and n. Gradient clipping was found to be beneficial for larger tasks, with values randomly chosen from [0.2, 1]. Parameter settings for LSTM are also provided, selected from hyperparameter search for LSTMs with up to 3 layers. The hyperparameters for LSTMs and GRUs were selected through a search process. TCN can be outperformed by optimized RNNs in some tasks, as shown in TAB3. Ablative analysis on TCN's filter size and residual block is briefly discussed in this section, with results shown in FIG7. In ablative analysis, experiments on different tasks confirm the importance of filter sizes and residuals in TCN's ability to model long dependencies. Larger filter sizes show faster convergence and better results in tasks like copy memory and permuted MNIST, while a filter size of 3 works best for word-level PTB language modeling. Control experiments on residual function are also conducted. Adding gated units to TCN has been found effective in language modeling tasks. By replacing ReLU with a gating mechanism in the residual block, faster convergence and better final results are achieved. This gating mechanism controls the flow of information in the network, leading to improved performance in language modeling. Adding gating components to TCN has shown significant improvements in language modeling tasks. However, these benefits are not observed in general on sequence prediction tasks or simpler benchmark tasks requiring long-term memories. For instance, on the copy memory task with T = 1000, the gating mechanism hinders the convergence of TCN, resulting in suboptimal performance only slightly better than random guessing."
