    "content": "Asynchronous distributed gradient descent algorithms for training deep neural networks aim to address the Gradient delay problem. A novel algorithm is proposed in this paper that focuses on averaging model updates to reduce worker idle time caused by communication overhead. The algorithm's theoretical analysis shows its regret bounds and emphasizes the importance of minimizing the maximal discrepancy between local parameter vectors of workers for high convergence rates. The algorithm proposed in the paper focuses on reducing worker idle time by averaging model updates in asynchronous distributed gradient descent. It shows a linear scaling on a 4-machine cluster for image classification without sacrificing test accuracy, while eliminating worker idle time. The discrepancy in convergence rate is bounded by the staleness parameter, independent of the number of workers, distinguishing it from other solutions like Elastic Asynchronous SGD or Downpour SGD. Our method reduces worker idle time by averaging model updates in asynchronous distributed gradient descent, using commodity communication switch for large scale distributed systems. Distributed training of deep learning models aims to reduce training time by using synchronous or asynchronous SGD methods. Synchronous methods like BID0 and BID7 require expensive communication switches, while asynchronous methods reduce communication overhead but may introduce gradient delay issues. In asynchronous approaches, workers compute gradients on a copy of the central model and merge them back. In asynchronous distributed training, workers compute gradients on a copy of the central model and merge them back. However, this process can lead to a gradient delay problem due to potential updates in the central model when gradients are merged. Algorithms suffering from this issue are referred to as gradient delay algorithms, impacting convergence rate. The maximal pairwise distance between local models of workers at any iteration controls the convergence rate of asynchronous algorithms, with gradient delay algorithms often struggling with scalability and convergence in large clusters. Elastic Averaging SGD introduces a penalty for workers whose models diverge, reducing pairwise distance between local models for better scalability and convergence. Analysis on staleness parameter controls maximal pair distance of asynchronous workers, improving convergence rate in gradient delay algorithms. The paper introduces a new asynchronous distributed SGD method that reduces idle time and eliminates the gradient delay problem. It shows that this method can achieve convergence rates comparable to sequential online learning. Experimental results demonstrate linear scalability on a cluster with up to 4 machines without compromising test accuracy. The approach aims to reduce gradient delay in distributed SGD by waiting for each worker to compute at least one gradient locally before merging updates. Model updates are then averaged to update the central model, eliminating idle time and achieving linear scalability on a cluster with up to 4 machines. The hybrid algorithm combines synchronous and asynchronous processes to reduce gradient delay in distributed SGD. Workers compute gradients asynchronously and merge updates by averaging them to update the central model, achieving linear scalability on a cluster with up to 4 machines. The hybrid algorithm combines synchronous and asynchronous processes to reduce gradient delay in distributed SGD. Workers compute gradients asynchronously and merge updates by averaging them to update the central model. Each worker starts with assigning values to variables and checks for staleness before initializing the model variables. The worker then updates the local model and notifies the Master of any non-zero model updates before advancing the iteration counter and staleness. The algorithm combines synchronous and asynchronous processes to reduce gradient delay in distributed SGD. Workers update the local model asynchronously and merge updates by averaging them. When the Master requests a model update, workers transfer the update to the central model and re-initialize the local model. Algorithm 1 describes an asynchronous SGD method without gradient delay. Workers synchronize with the central model at the end of each cycle to update the model. The worker computes the model update using locally computed gradients and advances the central model. After each cycle, workers synchronize with the central model to update it using locally computed gradients. The synchronization allows workers to perform additional iterations before hitting the staleness boundary. The master transfers model updates from workers to the central model, merging them to provide a new model to the workers. This process repeats at the end of each cycle, ensuring efficient communication between workers and the central model. The new PS model is merged with worker updates if communication is slow, reducing worker idle time. Algorithm 2 analysis shows convergence rate O(\u03c4 2 + \u221a T), with two phases: early iterations slow down due to asynchronous training. During early iterations, asynchronous training causes a slow-down represented by \u03c4 2. However, in later iterations, it becomes harmless. The convergence rate of Algorithm 2 is comparable to sequential online learning if T \u03c4. The standard deviation of gradient computation should be adjusted based on the maximal staleness \u03c4. Convex cost functions f i are minimized to find a sequence of x i with cumulative loss i f i (x i). The average empirical and expected loss are denoted by f * by redefining p(f) as uniform. The average risk DISPLAYFORM0 is calculated by redefining p(f) as the uniform distribution over F. Algorithm 2 involves workers computing updates to their local parameter vectors based on locally computed gradients, which are then averaged to update the global parameter vector. Each worker computes the gradient of function f on its own parameter vector and mini-batch. The global parameter vector at time t is defined for analysis. The global parameter vector at time t is defined as the average of per-worker parameter vectors. Each function f t is assumed to be convex, with bounded subdifferentials. The goal is to find a bound on the regret associated with a sequence of parameter vectors. This regret can be converted into bounds on expected loss. The distance function between parameter vectors is defined as D(x||x ). In Algorithm 2, workers compute updates based on locally computed gradients to update the global parameter vector. At the beginning of each cycle in Algorithm 2, workers receive a new PS parameter vector. Lemma 3.1 shows that this new parameter vector is the average of local parameter vectors from the previous iteration. When a worker receives the new parameter vector, it adds its latest model update to it, resetting all local parameter vectors computed in the last cycle. After receiving a new PS parameter vector at the beginning of each cycle, workers reset their local parameter vectors by moving them towards the average parameter vector. This process is invariant under the reset operation, as shown in Lemma 3.2. Additionally, Lemma 3.3 bounds the distance between parameter vectors for any pair of workers after the reset operation at iteration i\u03b2. After receiving a new PS parameter vector at the beginning of each cycle, workers reset their local parameter vectors by moving them towards the average parameter vector. This process is invariant under the reset operation, as shown in Lemma 3.2. Additionally, Lemma 3.3 bounds the distance between parameter vectors for any pair of workers after the reset operation at iteration i\u03b2. In the next \u03b2 iterations, each worker computes \u03b2 gradients locally to advance its local parameter vector. We rewrite expressions to define average gradients and adapt Lemma 1 from BID10 to prove regret bounds in Algorithm 2. After workers reset their local parameter vectors towards the average parameter vector, they compute gradients locally and transfer updates to the PS. The expansion in Lemma 3.4 shows the difference in computing average gradients in Algorithm 2. This analysis adapts to the unique aspects of the algorithm. The key to proving our bounds is to impose further smoothness constraints on the cost functions. We assume the gradient of the cost functions is Lipschitz-continuous, ensuring small changes in x do not lead to large changes in the gradient. Theorem 3.5 introduces a new expression and bound to adapt the analysis to Algorithm 2. Theorem 3.5 introduces bounds on gradients of cost functions and the change in gradients for Algorithm 2. The convergence rate is O(\u03c4 2 + \u221a \u03c4 T), indicating that parallel algorithms may not outperform sequential ones due to similarities in training instances. The results of Theorem 3.5 are used to prove the main result in Theorem 3.9. Theorem 3.9 discusses decorrelated gradient analysis, assuming independently drawn training samples at different workers. To enhance convergence rate, divergence of workers should be limited as they advance local parameter vectors asynchronously. Gradients' variance is modeled by additive Gaussian noise, denoted as \u2207f t,w (x) = g * (x) + e t,w , where e t,w \u223c N (0, C). Lemma 3.6 bounds the distance between parameter vectors at different workers after asynchronous steps. The variation of the gradient of the cost function is influenced by additive Gaussian noise. Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7 provide bounds on the distance between local parameter vectors of different workers during asynchronous iterations. The expected difference between parameter vectors is bounded, and updates are added to a common copy after a reset operation. The text discusses the addition of updates to a common copy of a PS model, resulting in a reduction of the right-hand side of a formula. Lemmas provide bounds on the distance between local parameter vectors of workers during iterations, with a focus on the expected regret of Algorithm 2. The text presents experimental support for Algorithm 2's effectiveness, showcasing discrepancies in local parameter vectors of asynchronous workers using two approaches: averaging model updates and gradient delay. The results of training a ResNet50 model on CIFAR-10 data are shown in FIG2, with different gradient average plots corresponding to varying staleness values. The text discusses how workers compute updates to their local parameter vectors asynchronously based on a common parameter vector. The average distance between the workers' parameter vectors and the average parameter vector is then computed and plotted in FIG2. Additionally, the worst-case scenario in gradient delay is simulated to produce points in the gradient delay plot. The workers read the central parameter vector sequentially, each advancing their local parameter vector based on a gradient. The average distance between the most up-to-date model and local models is computed, showing the effectiveness of staleness in reducing discrepancies. The algorithm's scalability is supported by experimental results on a cluster with 4 machines, each equipped with a Nvidia GeForce GTX TITAN X GPU card.

Theorem 3.9 is proven by following a similar approach. The proof of Theorem 3.9 involves developing an alternative bound on ||x t,w \u2212 x t || by splitting the sum into two ranges of t. For t < 2t 0, a bound is shown using (48), while for t \u2265 2t 0, a bound is derived using (24). The final result is obtained by combining various bounds and assumptions."
