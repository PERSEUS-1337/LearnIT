The strategic plan includes assisting small- and medium-sized manufacturers in developing new products and processes, considering analysis conducted, soliciting public input, and collaborating with federal departments and agencies. Federal departments and agencies will analyze factors impacting US manufacturing competitiveness and growth, including research, development, innovation, technology transfer, national security industrial base, workforce capabilities, export opportunities, and trade policies. The Committee will analyze trade enforcement policies, financing, investment, taxation policies, emerging technologies, manufacturing promotion efforts of competing nations, and may appoint an advisory panel for input.

It will have no more than 15 members, including representatives from manufacturing businesses, labor, academia, and groups affected by manufacturing activities. The Federal Advisory Committee Act will apply to the panel. Updates on the panel's progress will be provided by the President every 4 years starting from May 1, 2018. The President must update the strategic plan every 4 years and include budget consistency information."
