    "content": "This report provides background information on multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) for Congress. These special contracting mechanisms can reduce weapon procurement costs. Congress faces decisions on whether to use MYP and BBC more frequently, create a permanent statute for BBC, and involve the Coast Guard in MYP and BBC. These decisions could impact defense acquisition practices, funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. The Air Force's contract for Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Launch Services is not a block buy as discussed in the report. Funding approaches and contracting mechanisms are often confused in DOD acquisition discussions, leading to confusion. Funding approaches involve how Congress appropriates funds for weapon procurement programs. Funding approaches and contracting mechanisms in DOD acquisition are essential for procuring weapons systems. Examples of funding approaches include full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations, which may utilize advance procurement funding. Contracting mechanisms, such as annual contracting, MYP, and BBC, can significantly impact the total procurement cost of a ship. The choice of funding approach does not determine the contracting mechanism used, allowing for flexibility in implementing defense acquisition programs. The report focuses on the contracting approaches of MYP and BBC in DOD weapon acquisition programs. MYP, also known as multiyear contracting, is an alternative to annual contracting, where DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's procurement. Three Navy shipbuilding programs have used BBC as their contracting approach. Under MYP, DOD uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given item, requiring congressional approval for each use. In contrast, annual contracting involves issuing contracts for each year's procurement. Under MYP, DOD consolidates procurement into a single contract for multiple years, requiring congressional approval. This approach can result in savings of up to 15% compared to annual contracting. Under MYP, DOD consolidates procurement into a single contract for multiple years, requiring congressional approval. Estimates suggest savings of 5% to 10%, but actual savings are hard to verify due to cost growth. CAPE assessed savings for various programs ranging from 2% to 8%. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that DOD lacks a formal tracking mechanism for multiyear procurement results and does not validate actual savings. DOD's lack of historical information on multiyear contracts makes it difficult to assess results and compare costs. Multiyear procurement (MYP) can potentially save money by reducing weapon costs through contractor optimization of workforce and production facilities. Multiyear procurement (MYP) contracts provide confidence to contractors for a steady stream of business, allowing investments in workforce and production facilities. This can include retaining or training workers, and modernizing production facilities. MYP contracts also allow for Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) purchases of long-leadtime components. The DOD can use Multiyear Procurement (MYP) contracts to purchase key components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract, reducing procurement costs by taking advantage of production economies of scale. This provides contractors with confidence that the multiyear stream of business will materialize, ensuring the contract will not be terminated prematurely. The DOD can use Multiyear Procurement (MYP) contracts to purchase key components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract, reducing procurement costs by taking advantage of production economies of scale. MYP contracts include a cancellation penalty to reimburse contractors for costs incurred in anticipation of the work covered under the contract, acting as a disincentive for the government to cancel the contract. The permanent statute governing MYP contracting is 10 U.S.C. 2306b. The permanent statute governing Multiyear Procurement (MYP) contracting is 10 U.S.C. 2306b, which was created in 1981 and revised in 1994. To qualify for MYP, a program must meet criteria including significant savings and realistic cost estimates. The MYP contract requires realistic cost estimates, stable need and design for items, and adherence to statutory requirements. The Secretary of Defense must certify these criteria before awarding an MYP contract. The requirement for DOD MYP contracts to be fixed-price type contracts has changed from \"substantial savings\" to \"significant savings\" under Section 811 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act. This amendment eliminates the need for the head of an agency to determine substantial savings before entering into a multiyear contract. The Senate recedes with an amendment requiring significant savings before entering into a multiyear contract. The conferees emphasize maximizing savings in multiyear procurement, even if it doesn't reach a 10% minimum savings over annual contracts. Requests for multiyear contract authority must include cost savings estimates, minimum quantity needed, stable design, and rationale. 10 U.S.C. 2306b outlines conditions for authorizing multiyear contracts for specific procurement programs. The President may request relief from specified cost savings required for multiyear contracts if significant savings can still be achieved. The request must include details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions. \"Stable design\" refers to the design for the items to be procured. If Congress does not provide the annual funding requested by DOD for the implementation of a multiyear contract, DOD may need to renegotiate, suspend, or terminate the contract, potentially incurring a cancellation penalty. Using MYP contracts can limit flexibility for making changes in procurement programs, especially reductions, without incurring penalties. The more DOD's procurement account is executed under MYP contracts, the less flexibility there is for future adjustments in response to changing circumstances. This could lead to imbalances in the DOD's procurement efforts if spending reductions are necessary in the future. Congress approves the use of Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) contracts on a case-by-case basis in response to DOD requests. Approval for MYP contracts over $500 million must be included in annual DOD appropriations acts and other defense authorization acts. This process ensures proper oversight and authorization for MYP contracting on defense acquisition programs. The use of Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) contracts for defense acquisition programs is approved by Congress on a case-by-case basis. MYP is used for a limited number of DOD programs, with annual appropriations acts typically approving zero to a few programs each year. The Pentagon's active multiyear procurement contracts are decreasing from $10.7 billion in FY17 to $1.2 billion by FY19, with potential new block-buy deals in progress. The Pentagon comptroller informs lawmakers about potential new block-buy deals, including large Navy contracts. Seven major defense programs are being purchased through multiyear procurement contracts, obligating the government to spend $16 billion over five years. Stability in contracts allows the industrial base to plan, invest, and predict performance. The Department of the Navy has more multiyear programs than the rest of the Department of Defense combined, leading to significant savings that have helped solve budget problems. A briefing by the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office shows stable DOD MYP contracts totaling $7 billion to $13 billion per year from FY2000 to FY2012, allowing savings to be reinvested into other programs. The portion of DOD's procurement budget from programs using MYP contracts has decreased from 17% in FY2000 to less than 8% in FY2012. The Navy utilizes MYP contracts more than the Army or Air Force, with the Air Force using them minimally in FY2010-FY2012. Since the 1980s, DOD has been authorized to procure major weapon systems on a multiyear basis, with Congress approving multiyear procurement for around 140 acquisition programs over the past 25 years. The BBC procurement method allows DOD to use a single contract for multiple years of procurement without needing to exercise a contract option each year. Unlike MYP, BBC does not have a permanent statute governing its use or specific criteria for program qualification. BBC contracts can cover more than five years of planned procurements. BBC contracts for Navy procurement of Littoral Combat Ships can span up to seven years, but EOQ authority is not automatically included. Explicit provisions may be needed to grant EOQ authority in BBC contracts. Unlike MYP, BBC contracts are less likely to have cancellation penalties and are considered a less formal alternative. The invention of BBC dates back to Section 121(b) of the FY1998. The BBC was invented by Section 121(b) of the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act to allow the Navy to use a single contract for the procurement of the first four Virginia-class attack submarines. This contracting authority, later known as block buy contracting, aimed to reduce the combined procurement cost of the submarines. The term block buy contracting was introduced by Section 121(b) of the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act to allow the Navy to use a single contract for the procurement of multiple Virginia-class attack submarines. This term can be confused with the term \"block buy\" used in defense procurement to refer to funding the procurement of more than one item in a single year. The term \"block buy\" in defense procurement refers to funding the procurement of multiple items in a single year, such as aircraft carriers in FY1983 and FY1988. This term can cause confusion as it also refers to block buy contracting, used for procuring multiple Virginia-class submarines. The use of block buy contracts can lead to cost savings in ship procurement. The use of block buy contracts (BBC) in defense procurement can reduce unit procurement costs of ships if authority for making economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases is included. Potential savings under BBC may be less if the contract does not include a cancellation penalty or if contractor confidence is lower. The frequency of BBC usage is also a factor to consider. The Navy has rarely used block buy contracts (BBC) since the start of the Virginia-class program. Examples include contracts for LCSs and the John Lewis class oiler program. The Air Force's KC-46 tanker program also utilizes a similar contract approach. The Navy has rarely used block buy contracts (BBC) since the start of the Virginia-class program. BBC might be suitable as an alternative to MYP in cases where using a multiyear contract can reduce costs, but the program in question cannot meet all the statutory criteria needed to qualify for MYP. The difference between an MYP or block buy contract and a contract with options is that the military services sometimes use contracts with options to procure multiple copies of an item over several years. The Navy rarely uses block buy contracts for the Virginia-class program. A contract with options allows for procurement of multiple items over several years without obligation to exercise all options. In contrast, an MYP or block buy contract requires continued implementation unless terminated for government convenience. The contractor can seek payment from the government for costs incurred under a termination for convenience clause, even without a cancellation penalty. Unlike multiyear contracts, contracts with options operate more like annual contracts and do not achieve the same savings as MYP and BBC. Congress may consider using MYP and BBC more or less frequently in the future. Supporters argue that using MYP and BBC more frequently can help DOD save on procurement costs, especially if the budget remains flat or decreases. The risks of using MYP have been reduced by legislation, strengthening the process for program approval. 10 U.S.C. 2306b strengthens the process for ensuring MYP programs meet criteria. MYP contracts accounted for less than 8% of DOD's procurement budget in FY2012, down from 17% in FY2000. Using MYP more frequently could be feasible without exceeding past budgetary levels. Critics argue that increased use of MYP and BBC could limit flexibility for future changes in DOD procurement programs. In the current strategic environment, efforts to reduce federal budget deficits may lead to a reassessment of U.S. defense strategy and DOD acquisition programs. It is unclear if the financial benefits of using MYP or BBC more frequently would outweigh the reduction in flexibility for making changes in procurement programs in response to changing circumstances. Supporters argue for creating a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC to encourage greater savings in DOD procurement programs. Creating a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC in DOD procurement programs could increase savings by giving BBC contracting legal standing and providing a clear assessment process for program managers. This could include granting EOQ authority to programs using BBC and establishing qualifying criteria to reduce risks. Opponents argue that the flexibility of not having a permanent statute allows for determining when and how to use BBC for programs that may not qualify for MYP. A permanent statute governing the use of block buy contracting in DOD procurement programs could lead to substantial savings and encourage program managers to choose block buy contracting over multiyear procurement. This could potentially reduce discipline in DOD contracting if the qualifying criteria for block buy contracting are less stringent than those for multiyear procurement. The Coast Guard, as a military service under the Department of Homeland Security, has the authority to use multiyear procurement and block buy contracting. The Coast Guard has the authority to use block buy contracting with EOQ purchases of components in its major acquisition programs, codified at 14 U.S.C. 1137. Unlike the Navy, the Coast Guard has not utilized MYP or BBC in its ship or aircraft acquisition programs, opting for contracts with options instead. This approach limits potential cost savings compared to MYP and BBC. CRS has suggested the possibility of using BBC or MYP in Coast Guard ship acquisition programs. The Coast Guard has the authority to use block buy contracting with EOQ purchases of components in its major acquisition programs. CRS suggests using BBC or MYP in Coast Guard ship acquisition programs, which could result in significant cost savings. Using multiyear contracting for the OPC program could reduce costs by $1 billion, while using BBC for the polar icebreaker program could save upwards of $150 million. The Coast Guard is considering these options for its acquisition programs. The Department of Defense is proposing continued funding for implementing several MYP contracts initiated in fiscal years prior to FY2020, but has not highlighted any requests for authority for new MYP or block buy contracts for major acquisition programs starting in FY2020. The text of 10 U.S.C. 2306b allows agencies to enter into multiyear contracts for property purchases if significant cost savings are anticipated. The Department of Defense is proposing continued funding for implementing several MYP contracts initiated in fiscal years prior to FY2020. Agencies can enter into multiyear contracts for property purchases if significant cost savings are anticipated, subject to certain conditions such as stable design, realistic cost estimates, and promotion of national security. The Department of Defense is proposing continued funding for implementing several multiyear contracts initiated in previous fiscal years. Officials are required to prescribe acquisition regulations to promote the efficient use of multiyear contracting, with specific regulations applicable to the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard. The Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will prescribe regulations for their respective agencies. The regulations may include cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts for the best interests of the United States. Additionally, subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers will be encouraged to participate in multiyear contracting to broaden the defense industrial base. The regulations for multiyear contracts will encourage subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers to participate and ensure prompt payment delivery. Existing agency authority will not be restricted, allowing for competition and termination of deficient contracts. The regulations for multiyear contracts allow for cancellation or termination if funds are insufficient. Costs of cancellation can be paid from various appropriations. Contracts exceeding $100,000,000 require notification to congressional defense committees before award. The regulations for multiyear contracts allow for cancellation if funds are insufficient. Contracts exceeding $100,000,000 require notification to congressional defense committees before award. If the budget does not include funding for contract cancellation costs, the agency head must notify the committees. The regulations for multiyear contracts allow for cancellation if funds are insufficient. Contracts exceeding $100,000,000 require notification to congressional defense committees before award. The authority under subsection (a) includes entering into multiyear contracts for weapon systems, advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary for manufacturing, and contracts specifically authorized by law for the Department of Defense. A contract over $500,000,000 cannot be entered into under this section without specific authorization by law. The Secretary of Defense must include a report with preliminary findings and a cost analysis when requesting authorization for a defense acquisition program. Multiyear contracts for defense programs must have specific authorization by law. The Secretary of Defense must certify in writing before entering into a multiyear contract program authorized by law, ensuring that requirements are met, cost analysis supports the determination, and there has been no cost growth exceeding the threshold in the past 5 years. The Secretary of Defense must certify requirements, cost analysis, and cost growth for a multiyear contract program. The contract must meet specific conditions such as delivery of end items, realistic unit costs, available funds, and a fixed price type contract. Production rates should be at minimum economic levels. The President may request relief from specified cost savings required for a multiyear contract if significant savings can still be achieved. The request must include details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions. The Secretary may obligate funds for procurement of an end item under a multiyear contract for the purchase of property only for a complete and usable end item. Funds may be obligated for advance procurement of long-lead items necessary to meet a planned delivery schedule for major end items. The Secretary may make a certification for a multiyear contract even if all conditions are not met, in exceptional circumstances. The Secretary may determine that proceeding with a multiyear contract is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and provide a certification for such determination. The authority to make the certification cannot be delegated below the level of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The Secretary of Defense may include priced options for varying quantities of end items in a multiyear contract. A multiyear contract is defined as a contract for the purchase of property for more than one, but not more than five, program years. A multiyear contract for the purchase of property for up to five program years may include cancellation provisions if funds are not appropriated. Congressional defense committees must be notified 30 days before awarding contracts exceeding $20,000,000 with economic order quantity procurement or unfunded contingent liabilities. The head of an agency must ensure that multiyear contracts are funded to cover liabilities exceeding $20,000,000. Contracts exceeding $500,000,000 require specific authority from an appropriations Act. Reports on contracts must include total obligational authority and percentage of the applicable procurement account. The report must include the total obligational authority and percentage of the applicable procurement account for all multiyear procurements, including those under Department of Defense contracts. The head of an agency must submit a report to Congress before entering into a multiyear contract exceeding $500,000,000. Termination of a multiyear procurement contract requires 10 days notice to congressional defense committees. Multiyear contracting authority necessitates a present value analysis. The execution of multiyear contracting authority requires a present value analysis to determine the lowest cost compared to an annual procurement. This subsection does not apply to NASA or the Coast Guard. Terms such as \"applicable procurement account\" and \"agency procurement total\" are defined in this subsection. Increased funding requests for major systems under a multiyear contract must be accompanied by an explanation of how it affects the Secretary's determinations. The appendix presents programs approved for multiyear procurement in annual DOD appropriations acts since FY1990, divided into two tables covering different time periods."
