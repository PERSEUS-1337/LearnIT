The \"Motor Vehicle Owners Right to Repair Act of 2007\" states that consumers have the right to diagnose, service, maintain, and repair their own vehicles or choose a service provider. They are also entitled to all safety information and promoting competition in vehicle services will benefit consumers. Regular maintenance and repair of vehicles is essential for safe and efficient operation. Motor vehicles, equipment, and systems like pollution control, transmission, brakes, and steering are crucial for fuel economy, environmental protection, and safety. Better fuel economy reduces dependence on foreign oil and helps the environment. Proper maintenance can significantly improve gas mileage, with fixes like tuning improving mileage by 4% and replacing air filters by 10%. Serious maintenance issues like faulty oxygen sensors can boost mileage by up to 40%. Manufacturers use on-board computer technology to control vehicle systems, limiting access to authorized technicians for diagnosis and repair. Consumers are restricted from accessing necessary information and tools for servicing vehicles with computer systems. Independent service providers face challenges in accessing information, tools, and equipment needed to repair consumers' motor vehicles. A survey found that 14 percent of consumers were turned away from independent repair shops in 2006 because they lacked the necessary resources. Of those turned away, 62 percent were inconvenienced, and 25 percent said they may not return due to the inconvenience. This results in independent service providers losing business on average. Consumers prefer independent repair shops for convenience and price reasons. Independent service providers lose productivity due to lack of information and tools, resulting in a significant annual revenue loss. If consumers and service providers cannot access necessary resources, they may be forced to turn to authorized dealers, leading to time and money loss. Consumers in the United States benefit from a wide choice of service providers for their motor vehicles, which also contributes to the economy through aftermarket tools and parts supply. Vehicle owners should have the right to access all information necessary for diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair of their vehicles. Consumers should have the right to access information, tools, and replacement equipment to diagnose, maintain, and repair their vehicles. Discrimination between authorized dealers and independent service providers limits who can work on vehicles and what tools can be used. The Act aims to protect consumers' rights to choose service providers for vehicle repair, promote safety and energy efficiency by requiring manufacturers to provide necessary information, parts, and tools. This ensures access for all service providers without infringing on manufacturers' trade secrets. The Act ensures consumers have access to a wide choice of service providers for vehicle diagnosis, maintenance, and repair to promote competition in price and quality. The Act mandates manufacturer requirements for vehicle diagnosis, maintenance, and repair to promote competition in price and quality. The manufacturer of a motor vehicle in the US must provide all necessary information for diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair to the owner and service providers. This includes safety alerts, recalls, service bulletins, energy efficiency adjustments, access to replacement equipment, and other relevant information. The manufacturer of a motor vehicle in the US must offer tools and information for diagnosis, service, maintenance, and repair to consumers and service providers on reasonable terms. They must also provide access to replacement equipment. States must offer equipment for sale to consumers and service providers for diagnosing, servicing, maintaining, or repairing motor vehicles. Manufacturers are not required to disclose information that would reveal trade secrets, but they cannot withhold information from authorized dealers or service providers claiming it as a trade secret. The Federal Trade Commission has the authority as stated in Section 4. The Federal Trade Commission may enforce compliance with the Act using its authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Violations of specific sections constitute unfair methods of competition or deceptive acts. The Commission can create rules to implement the Act and collaborate with the Department of Transportation to publish technical bulletins. The Federal Trade Commission collaborates with the Department of Transportation to publish technical service bulletins on a Federal Internet Website, with limitations on rules that may interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency's authority under the Clean Air Act regarding motor vehicle emissions control diagnostics systems. SEC. 5. ACTION BY STATES. Whenever an attorney general of any State believes that the residents' interests are threatened by a violation of the Act or FTC rules, the State can bring a civil action to seek injunctions, damages, or other relief on behalf of its residents. The State must provide prior notice to the FTC before taking legal action, unless it is not feasible to do so. The Federal Trade Commission has the right to intervene, be heard, and file petitions in civil actions. State attorney generals can also conduct investigations and take legal action independently. State officials can take legal action in State court for violations of State laws, even during Federal Trade Commission actions. Authorized officers can also bring actions under this Act, in addition to State attorney generals. Consumers and service providers have the right to take legal action to stop violations of the Act and seek damages, including court costs and attorney fees. This action can be taken in any court with jurisdiction.
