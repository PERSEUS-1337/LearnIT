    "content": "The \"Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition Act\" establishes additional Native corporations in Southeast Alaska, allowing Native residents of specific villages to organize as Urban or Group Corporations. This does not affect any entitlement to land of existing Native Corporations. Section 8 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to enroll individual Natives to Urban or Group Corporations in specific areas of Alaska. Those enrolled before March 30, 1973, will receive 100 shares of Settlement Common Stock in the respective Corporation. Individual Natives inheriting shares from a decedent Native in specific areas of Alaska will receive the same number of shares in the Urban or Group Corporation as inherited. This does not affect entitlement to land from Regional Corporations. SEC. 4. DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. Amendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ensure that Native members of specific communities in Alaska who become shareholders in Urban or Group Corporations can still receive distributions from Sealaska Corporation. The Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition Act will not impact revenue distribution ratios among Native Corporations as outlined in the Act and the 1982 Section 7(i) Settlement Agreement. SEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with relevant parties, must submit a report to Congress by December 31, 1998, recommending lands and compensation for Urban and Group Corporations, including areas of cultural importance to Alaska Natives. The Secretary of the Interior must recommend limitations on land use and additional compensation for Urban and Group Corporations by December 31, 1998. SEC. 6. MISCELLANEOUS. Planning Grants authorized for Native Corporations in specific communities for planning, development, and other purposes under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. No entitlement to Federal lands for Urban or Group Corporations without an Act of Congress."
