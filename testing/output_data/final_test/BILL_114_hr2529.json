    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reducing food-based Inorganic Compounds Exposure Act of 2015\" or the \"RICE Act.\" The Congress finds that arsenic, a natural component of the Earth's crust, is widely distributed in the environment and used in herbicides and poultry feed. In its inorganic form, arsenic is highly toxic and a known carcinogen. Long-term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic can lead to various health issues. Young children are estimated to have higher exposure to inorganic arsenic in their diet compared to adults. According to the European Food Safety Authority and the Food and Drug Administration, diet is the main source of arsenic exposure for most individuals. Arsenic is present in many foods, including grains, fruits, and vegetables, with rice being a significant source due to its ability to absorb inorganic arsenic from soil and water. This is concerning as rice is a staple food in the diet of many individuals in the United States, including infants who are often fed rice-based products containing inorganic arsenic. The Food and Drug Administration found inorganic arsenic in rice products, including snack bars and children's breakfast cereals. The average levels of inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products range from 0.1 to 7.2 micrograms per serving. The Environmental Protection Agency limits arsenic concentrations in drinking water to 10 parts per billion, while the FDA has set a limit of 10 parts per billion in bottled water and apple juice. However, there are no Federal limits for arsenic in most foods. There are no Federal limits for arsenic in most foods, including rice for adults and children or baby foods. Establishment of limitation on inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products. Regulation Required: The Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish a regulation within 2 years to determine the minimum quantity of inorganic arsenic in rice or rice products that would deem them adulterated. This regulation applies regardless of how the arsenic is present. The regulation under subsection (a) includes establishing tolerances for inorganic arsenic in rice or rice products to reduce health risks, especially for children, considering various health effects of arsenic exposure. The regulation aims to establish tolerances for inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products to reduce health risks, particularly for children. It also considers differences in arsenic metabolization between children and adults, as well as the longer life span of children. Separate standards will be set for rice milk and other commonly consumed rice-based foods, especially those consumed by infants and children. Definitions for terms like \"food,\" \"inorganic arsenic,\" \"rice,\" and \"rice product\" are provided in the Act. The Act aims to establish tolerances for inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products to reduce health risks, especially for children. Separate standards will be set for rice milk and other commonly consumed rice-based foods. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress on reducing inorganic arsenic in rice within a year of this Act's enactment. The report will analyze agronomy practices, breeding techniques, technology improvements, and federal efforts to reduce arsenic. Recommendations for federal actions to decrease arsenic in rice will also be included. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within a year on reducing inorganic arsenic in rice, including recommendations for federal actions and additional research on the estimated cost."
