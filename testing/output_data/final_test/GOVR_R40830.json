    "content": "The federal government has historically supported programs to help vulnerable young people find employment and succeed academically, including summer youth employment opportunities. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 required local areas funded under its Youth Activities program to provide summer employment opportunities for low-income youth. The economic downturn starting in 2007 increased focus on these programs. In 2007, there was an increased focus on summer employment for youth due to record-low summer job opportunities. President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, allocating $1.2 billion for the Youth program to preserve and create jobs. The law emphasized spending on summer youth employment and year-round activities for older youth. This report discusses efforts to employ youth during summer, especially under the Recovery Act, and related issues. Appendices provide terms for the WIA Youth program and evaluations of past federally funded summer youth programs. Since 1964, federally funded summer youth programs have aimed to provide job training and employment opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth with barriers to securing employment or completing their education. Prior to the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) in 1998, funding was specifically allocated for summer employment programs, but WIA required all local areas to include summer employment opportunities as part of their youth programs. During economic downturns, federal and state governments support workers at risk of layoffs. Youth face challenges in finding and keeping jobs. Labor force participation reflects interest in working, but it's not always accurate. For example, participation may decrease if individuals lose hope in job prospects. The declining rate of teen and young adult employment is attributed to rising joblessness, not a lack of interest in working. This trend may lead to reduced future employment, earnings, and labor productivity, impacting the economy. In July 2012, only 26.8% of teens were employed, the third lowest rate since World War II. Similarly, the employment rate for males aged 20-24 decreased by 17% to 61.2% in the same period. The Youth Activities program, funded by WIA, provides job training and summer employment opportunities for low-income youth aged 14-21 with various barriers. At least 30% of funds are allocated for out-of-school youth or those with basic skills deficiencies. The Youth Activities program aims to assist low-income youth aged 14-21 with job training and employment opportunities. The Department of Labor distributes formula grants to state workforce investment boards based on youth unemployment and poverty rates. State WIBs then create five-year plans to address employment and training needs, with funds being distributed to local WIBs for oversight. Each local board must establish a youth council to assist in awarding resources. The WIA program includes a \"youth council\" that helps award grants to entities like schools, colleges, and community organizations for youth workforce activities. Local WIBs must provide 10 program elements to youth, including summer employment, educational achievement, and follow-up services for 12 months. Additional elements can be added based on local needs and goals. The WIA program includes a \"youth council\" that helps award grants for youth workforce activities. Local WIBs must provide 10 program elements to youth, including summer employment and educational achievement. A one-stop system is established by a local WIB to coordinate employment and training services for adult job seekers, dislocated workers, and youth, with approximately 20 federal programs providing services through the system. Funding for Youth Activities has been appropriated by Congress since FY2000. Funding for Youth Activities has been consistently appropriated by Congress since FY2000, with amounts ranging from $824.4 million to $1.1 billion annually. In FY2009, a total of $2.1 billion was allocated, including funds from the Recovery Act. The funds were designated for summer youth employment and expanding year-round job opportunities for youth up to age 24. For FY2013, funding is provided through the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, with a slight increase over the previous year. The Department of Labor submitted the operating plan for FY2013 programs as required by law. The Department of Labor submitted an operating plan to Congress for funding FY2013 programs through March 27, 2013. Funding for Youth Activities was not calculated as funds from FY2012 cover operations until March 30, 2013. $1.182 billion was allocated for youth programming, with $12 million for administrative purposes. All funds have been expended, with 40% used for summer youth employment according to a DOL Inspector General audit. Approximately 40% of ARRA funds were spent on summer employment opportunities through September 30, 2010. The WIA Youth program funds were available until June 30, 2011. The intent was to use the majority of ARRA funds within the first year. Unlike previous legislation, WIA aimed to provide year-round job training and employment for youth. Local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) must offer summer employment opportunities linked to academic and occupational learning for youth. The summer youth element should be integrated into an overall strategy meeting the youth's employment and training needs, with a minimum of 12 months follow-up. WIBs can decide how much of the youth funds will be allocated to summer and year-round activities. In 2000, the Department of Labor issued guidance on implementing summer youth programs. The Department of Labor issued guidance on implementing summer youth programs, advising local areas on different approaches for providing summer employment opportunities. Participants could transition into year-round services for positive academic and employment outcomes, with follow-up activities for those not continuing year-round. Activities could include job shadowing, career exploration, job fairs, mentoring, and tutoring to help youth become proficient in basic skills. Collaboration between local workforce areas and schools is recommended. The Department of Labor advised collaboration between local workforce areas and schools for summer programming to help youth become proficient in basic skills. Local WIBs were encouraged to leverage resources, including the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, to support summer employment opportunities for youth with barriers to employment. Several local areas revamped their summer programs by linking summer and year-round activities, supplementing WIA summer opportunities with non-WIA funding. Data on WIA participation are based on program \"exiters,\" with the most recent data for youth participants from April 1, 2010, through March 31, 2011, showing nearly 130,000 participants. Nearly 130,000 youth ages 14-21 exited the program from April 1, 2010, through March 31, 2011. 27.4% participated in summer employment opportunities in 2010, with a higher percentage of females (55.5%). The majority identified as Hispanic (36.5%) or African American (35.4%), with the most common barrier being deficient basic skills (53.9%). 87.8% of youth in WIA Youth program activities funded by ARRA participated in summer employment opportunities. Congress allocated funds under ARRA for summer youth employment and year-round activities for older youth. The law emphasized creating summer jobs for youth and extending eligibility for youth services up to age 24. The work readiness performance indicator was highlighted for evaluating performance in these activities. The work readiness indicator measures the number of work readiness skills goals attained by youth divided by the number of work readiness skills goals set overall. DOL guidance for implementing the summer youth employment component funded by ARRA was discussed, along with efforts to monitor program implementation and performance by DOL and the Government Accountability Office. ETA issued a TEGL on WIA funds under ARRA, providing specific instructions on the WIA Youth program, emphasizing targeting funds to summer employment opportunities in 2009. The TEGL provided guidance to local WIBs on implementing summer youth employment models, including examples of \"green\" jobs, registered apprenticeship programs, and work-based learning opportunities. Local boards were advised to ensure that summer youth employment opportunities included \"work experience\" as defined in regulation. The TEGL provided guidance on work experience for summer youth employment programs, emphasizing the importance of structured learning experiences at worksites to develop communication, interpersonal, decision-making, and learning skills. Work experience should introduce youth to the rigors and rewards of holding a job. The TEGL emphasized the importance of work experience for summer youth employment programs, encouraging both public and private sector opportunities. Local areas had flexibility in follow-up requirements and individual service strategies for youth served with ARRA funds during the summer months. Local programs using Recovery Act funds for summer youth employment could assess and develop Individual Service Strategies (ISS) without the full objective assessment required by WIA. They could also decide if academic learning should be directly linked to these activities. State plans under WIA describe workforce development activities, including strategies for serving youth. The TEGL required states to modify their state plans by June 30, 2009, due to changes in WIA from the Recovery Act and the economic downturn's impact on states. The state plan addressed specific questions on youth services with ARRA funds, including program design for younger and older youth, use of funds for summer activities in 2009 and 2010, and summer employment. The state must describe how it plans to deliver summer employment opportunities using the funds. Waivers can be granted for statutory or regulatory requirements, except for wage and labor standards. DOL has issued waivers for youth-related matters in the past. The March 2009 TEGL on ARRA advised states about waivers for expedited and emergency procurement procedures. States were authorized to seek waivers for procurement requirements for youth summer employment providers under ARRA funding in 2009. Waivers allowed for expedited selection of service providers or using work readiness as the only performance indicator for older youth participating in work experience beyond the summer months. The waiver allowed states to use work readiness as the sole indicator for older youth in work programs beyond summer, applicable for six months. ARRA created a $5 billion Emergency Contingency Fund within TANF to aid families during the economic downturn, encouraging states to leverage resources from TANF and WIA Youth programs for low-income youth. The letter in 2010 discussed using WIA Youth funds for training and employment services, along with TANF Emergency funds for subsidized youth employment. Co-enrollment in both programs was emphasized. TANF agencies can use Emergency Contingency funding for subsidized employment programs for low-income youth. State and local agencies have partnered to support youth employment with TANF funds. Co-enrollment in TANF and WIA programs is encouraged for maximum benefit. The Department of Labor (DOL) provided guidance to state workforce boards regarding waivers for youth co-enrolled in TANF and WIA programs for summer youth employment in 2010. Waivers could allow local programs to use the work readiness indicator as the only performance measure for co-enrolled youth and modify program design elements. WIA sets performance measures for youth ages 14 through 18 to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities. The Department of Labor (DOL) provided guidance on performance measures for youth in workforce investment activities. Measures differ for youth ages 14-18 and 19-21, focusing on basic skills, high school attainment, employment, earnings, and retention. ARRA directed DOL to measure local programs' performance in summer employment through work readiness indicators. States were advised to establish a methodology for assessing work readiness skills at the beginning and end of the summer experience. The Department of Labor provided guidance on assessing work readiness skills for youth in workforce investment activities, including using assessment tools like worksite supervisor evaluations and portfolio assessments. Additional guidance was issued in response to concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office about measuring gains made by youth in the program funded under ARRA. DOL advised that employers were in the best position to assess the quality of a youth's performance. The Department of Labor recommended using a worksite evaluation tool to assess workplace proficiency in youth workforce programs. The tool should measure desired skills like work habits, professionalism, and communication, with clear grading criteria. DOL oversaw ARRA Youth funds by collecting participant data, researching summer employment challenges, and conducting internal audits. 79% of youth in summer employment met the work readiness indicator. The Department of Labor collected data on youth participation in summer employment programs funded by the Recovery Act. States submitted monthly reports on participant demographics, outcomes, and services received. The reports aimed to help DOL analyze program participation and activities. The Department of Labor collected data on youth participation in summer employment programs funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients of ARRA dollars had to report detailed information on fund usage, including jobs created and retained. DOL contracted with two organizations to study youth engagement in the program. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. studied how 20 communities implemented ARRA-funded summer employment activities in 2009. They found the initiative was successful, with efforts made to recruit youth and employers, prepare youth for the workplace, but faced challenges in determining eligibility, recruiting older youth, private sector employers, understanding \"green\" jobs, and matching. The Department of Labor (DOL) contracted with Brandeis University to research ARRA-funded summer employment initiatives in Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Phoenix. The communities used the funding to connect youth with jobs, establish partnerships, and provide meaningful work opportunities. Challenges included verifying WIA eligibility, matching youth with suitable jobs, managing data entry, and ensuring job interest alignment. In November and December 2009, DOL organized national summits to share lessons from local summer employment programs funded by ARRA. The focus was on transitioning youth to future programming, including green jobs and emerging industries like healthcare. Discussions also covered employer-desired skills, youth training, readiness assessment, and case management. ARRA mandated agency Inspector General oversight. The DOL Inspector General audited the ARRA WIA Youth program in March 2011 to review how funds were spent, services provided to youth, and participant outcomes. Local areas spent most of their ARRA funds on summer employment opportunities, part-time and full-time work experiences, and other program elements. They projected to spend an additional 1% on summer employment by June 30, 2011. Participants in the WIA Youth program exceeded 463,000, with 76% under age 20. The largest share were African American (47%), followed by white (27%) and Hispanic youth (16%). Youth faced barriers to employment such as basic skills deficiency (42%), pregnancy or parenting (19%), and being an offender (9%). 26% were engaged in summer employment opportunities. Local areas measured program performance through the work readiness indicator, with 76% of youth demonstrating work readiness. The WIA Youth program had 76% of participants demonstrating work readiness skills. The GAO conducted bimonthly reviews on ARRA funding use in selected states and the District of Columbia, focusing on accountability and impact evaluation. The GAO reports focused on evaluating the impact of ARRA funds, including the WIA Youth Activities program. States successfully increased youth participation in summer activities, with worksites including public, private, and nonprofit organizations. For example, in Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry enrolled youth as peer mentors. In Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry enrolled youth as peer educators who facilitated children's science activities at various sites in the city. Some youth also received academic and occupational skills training, such as academic projects overseen by certified teachers, GED training courses, and a summer learning program with visual arts classes and workshops. Local areas used different payment methods for youth, such as direct deposit, prepaid debit cards, or paper checks. In Detroit, youth experienced long wait times to receive their paychecks. On average, 82% of youth in 16 states completed their summer work experience without dropping out before the scheduled end date. According to GAO, challenges in implementing summer youth employment opportunities included tight time frames, lack of staffing capacity, difficulty in determining youth eligibility, recruiting youth, defining \"green\" jobs, and implementing work readiness indicators. States and local areas had limited time to start summer employment activities, leading to difficulties for some with little experience in operating such programs. Officials in various states and local areas faced challenges in quickly expanding summer employment programs under WIA due to reduced funding, staffing constraints, and difficulties in determining youth eligibility. Some areas reported issues with youth providing required documents and income eligibility requirements potentially excluding needy youth. Officials in Philadelphia and seven states faced challenges with youth eligibility for summer employment programs under WIA. Some youth applicants were deemed ineligible due to income criteria based on pre-job loss earnings. Documentation challenges were also reported, especially for youth aged 18-24 lacking basic documents. Recruiting youth was difficult, prompting local officials to use various advertising methods and increased wages to attract participants. Some officials faced challenges with defining green jobs for youth, with varying methods across states. GAO recommended DOL provide guidance on preparing youth for green industries. DOL responded by seeking public input on a proposed definition for measuring green jobs. The DOL sought public input on a proposed definition for measuring green jobs to inform state and local workforce development efforts. GAO raised concerns about the work readiness indicator, noting that states had different strategies for measuring work readiness, posing challenges for national evaluation. Only Illinois had a uniform approach, while other states used varied measurements. For example, Columbus, OH, used a work readiness assessment tool focusing on workplace collaboration, problem solving, and leadership qualities. The GAO recommended that the DOL provide additional guidance on measuring work readiness of youth to improve comparability and rigor. States planned to monitor summer youth employment opportunities through procedures like financial auditing and site visits. The jurisdictions reported challenges with implementing larger programs, holding periodic meetings with local directors, and reviewing files for eligibility and contracts. They were able to track ARRA-funded expenditures for WIA Youth Activities separately. States and local areas increased staff to monitor expanded summer youth activities. DOL issued formal guidance for summer youth employment under ARRA, different from previous WIA guidance. The DOL issued new guidance for summer youth employment under ARRA, emphasizing opportunities for older out-of-school youth. Policymakers may need to consider placing more emphasis on summer employment in WIA reauthorization efforts. Congress may want to review whether certain program elements in WIA should have been modified for ARRA implementation. The TEGL provided guidance on carrying out ARRA-funded activities differently, allowing for optional follow-up for youth in summer employment programs and giving local areas flexibility in determining assessment types for summer youth participants using Recovery Act funds. Local programs using Recovery Act funds for summer youth employment could decide if academic learning should be directly linked to these opportunities, a distinction from WIA requirements. The changes introduced by DOL may have aimed to create new jobs quickly and provide flexibility for focusing on summer employment rather than other activities. These modifications were likely part of state plans and oversight by DOL, with elements possibly being optional for jurisdictions. The DOL may have considered making elements optional for jurisdictions seeking a waiver to monitor deviations from current law under ARRA. There is ongoing debate about whether the WIA program should prioritize out-of-school youth over in-school youth. WIA mandates that 30% of Youth Activities funds be used for out-of-school youth, but ARRA introduces complexity by emphasizing both summer employment for younger, in-school youth and year-round activities for older youth. The TEGL addressed directives from Congress regarding summer employment for older youth, emphasizing targeting funds for summer youth employment in 2009. It advised states to develop strategies for serving youth beyond the summer months, including work experiences, training opportunities, and reconnecting to academic options. ETA suggested services like subsidized work experience and adult training for out-of-school youth. States could seek waivers as part of their state plan. The TEGL advised states to target funds for summer youth employment in 2009 and suggested strategies for serving older youth beyond the summer months. A small percentage of participants in the WIA Youth program were older, with 14% ages 20 and 21 and 10% ages 22 through 24. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for WIA programs through annual laws, and policymakers may consider placing greater emphasis on summer employment in any reauthorization efforts. The federal government should focus more on summer employment for young people, as previous legislation did. WIA in 1998 marked the end of stand-alone summer employment programs for vulnerable youth, but local areas must still provide summer employment opportunities as part of their WIA Youth programs. Predecessor laws provided funding specifically for summer youth employment activities. The Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) established summer employment programs for low-income youth to enhance future employability. The Youth Employment and Demonstrations Project Act (YEDPA) extended funding for these programs and introduced new employment and training initiatives for youth. Summer employment was a component of one of the demonstration programs under YEDPA. The Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Program (YIEPP) provided summer employment for youth ages 16 to 19 in 17 pilot sites. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) replaced CETA and included the Summer Youth Employment and Training Program (SYETP) for disadvantaged youth ages 14 to 21. Another program under JTPA, the Summer Training and Employment Program (STEP), offered work experience and skills training for youth ages 14 and 15. CRS reviewed social science literature on summer jobs programs established by four laws to understand their operation and effectiveness. The studies showed mixed results on program implementation and effectiveness, with some programs being carried out unevenly at certain sites. GAO found issues with the NYC program in the District of Columbia and surrounding areas. Appendix B provides a detailed summary of findings. The GAO found issues with the NYC program in the District of Columbia and surrounding areas, as it did not enroll the most at-risk youth as intended. However, it provided useful work experience and supervision. Some SPEDY worksites did not offer meaningful work tasks and training for future employability. DOL was criticized for inadequate program monitoring. Most programs met some goals related to education and employment, but results were mixed and short-lived. NYC's youth programs showed varied outcomes based on random assignment evaluations. NYC's youth programs, including SPEDY and YIEPP, showed inconsistent results in reducing dropout rates and improving employment outcomes. While certain groups like black males and Indian youth saw positive effects, challenges with program implementation and random design hindered overall success. The YIEPP study showed positive effects on employment and wages for black youth but did not improve success in school. The STEP program had short-term benefits in mitigating learning losses during summer months but did not have long-term effects. These studies are not enough to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of summer jobs due to differences in program implementation and evaluation methods. Some summer job programs had varying implementation methods and evaluation criteria, leading to differences in outcomes. Evaluations raised questions about meeting additional goals beyond employment opportunities for at-risk youth. The NYC program faced challenges in providing meaningful work opportunities at some sites. Tens of thousands to 1 million youth participated in summer job programs, with two-thirds of youth in communities with YIEPP grants participating. The programs provided opportunities for cultural events and soft skills development. The WIA Youth program under ARRA had more oversight compared to previous programs. ETA, DOL IG's Office, and GAO monitored the program closely. The Youth Activities program, including summer employment, allocated all funding and provided expanded job opportunities for nearly 375,000 youth in various sectors. Challenges included verifying eligibility, finding \"green jobs,\" and timely payment. Despite difficulties, the program helped create jobs during the economic downturn. The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 authorized DOL to provide part-time employment and training for low-income youth and adults. The Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) program focused on job training, work experience, and support services for participants. The Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) program provided job training, work experience, and support services for low-income youth and adults. From FY1970 to FY1971, DOL allocated $471.3 million for the summer youth component, with approximately 1 million youth participating. An evaluation found that while the program did not significantly impact overall high school graduation rates, it did improve the likelihood of graduation for black males and Indian youth compared to the control group. The Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) program provided job training, work experience, and support services for low-income youth and adults. A study found that male participants who graduated from high school were more likely to pursue post-secondary education. Participation in the program resulted in additional monetary benefits for those entering the labor market, especially for black youth. However, the program had no significant effect on whether low-income youth continued in school. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) attributed this lack of effectiveness to the program's simplistic approach. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) program did not effectively evaluate the dropout risk of participants. Despite efforts to assess potential dropouts, many enrollees did not exhibit characteristics of at-risk youth. The program did not significantly impact the dropout rates of low-income youth, lacked integration of remedial education, and had limited effectiveness in preventing dropouts. The Summer Program for Economically Disadvantaged Youth (SPEDY) under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) provided work experiences to economically disadvantaged youth aged 14 to 21 in the District of Columbia and surrounding areas. The program aimed to enhance future employability for school dropouts, potential dropouts, and in-school youth with barriers to work. Operated by the Department of Labor (DOL) until 1983, SPEDY served approximately 774,000 youth in FY1981. Evaluation of the program was conducted by GAO and a research organization. The GAO and a research organization evaluated the Summer Program for Economically Disadvantaged Youth (SPEDY) under CETA. Reports highlighted problems with youth not receiving enough work, being paid late or incorrectly, and lacking meaningful work opportunities. DOL was criticized for inadequate monitoring of the program. GAO's 1979 report confirmed these issues, noting a lack of meaningful work tasks and training for youth. About half of the visited sites met GAO's criteria for providing meaningful work experiences. The GAO identified problems with the Summer Program for Economically Disadvantaged Youth (SPEDY) under CETA, including lack of equipment, failure of planned programs, and inadequate supervision. DOL's poor oversight and lack of effective monitoring led to these issues. Few grantees evaluated and monitored activities as required, resulting in a lack of meaningful work experiences for youth. The Department of Labor (DOL) did not ensure that program requirements were met or allocate funds based on need or past performance. Grantees did not make strong efforts to recruit at-risk youth, including school dropouts. An evaluation of the Summer Program for Economically Disadvantaged Youth (SPEDY) found no significant difference in full-time employment rates between participants and the control group, but a significant difference in part-time employment. The program did not have a significant impact on contact with the criminal justice system. The Youth Employment Demonstration Program Act (YEDPA) extended funding for SPEDY and established new employment, training, and demonstration programs for youth, including the Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Program (YIEPP) targeting low-income youth ages 16 to 19. Participants were guaranteed part-time jobs during the school year and full-time jobs in the summer, without receiving skills training or job search assistance. The evaluation had difficulty randomly assigning youth to treatment and control groups, cautioning the interpretation of findings. The Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Program (YIEPP) provided job opportunities for low-income youth aged 16 to 19 from 1978 to 1981. Participants had to enroll in school or an alternative education program to continue in the program. An evaluation showed positive effects on black youth, as they were not randomly assigned but matched with comparable sites for comparison. The evaluation of the Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Program (YIEPP) showed that it significantly reduced the unemployment rate for black youth, bringing it closer to that of whites in the communities. Participants experienced higher earnings due to increased employment rates, with two-thirds of eligible youth taking part in the program. Earnings in the follow-up semester were estimated to be 39% higher than without the program, but it did not improve school enrollment or success. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) authorized the Summer Youth Employment and Training Program (SYETP) for low-income youth ages 14-21 to strengthen educational skills, provide work exposure, and enhance citizenship skills. In 1997, about 530,000 youth participated in the program. A separate program, STEP, provided summer jobs, academic education, and sex education to at-risk youth ages 14-15. Youth were paid for their participation in work and education. The SYTEP program successfully increased summer job opportunities for disadvantaged minority youth, with two youth employed for every three jobs provided. A process evaluation by GAO suggested that efforts to provide remedial education may have reduced the number of youth served. An additional study involved youth assigned to SYETP as control group participants for the STEP program, which found positive outcomes through random assignment at five sites. The STEP program significantly increased short-term benefits in education and contraception knowledge for low-income youth. Participants outscored the control group in reading and math, and were more likely to use contraception if sexually active. However, long-term impacts were limited, with no significant differences in dropout rates or standardized test performance two years after the program ended. The evaluation of the program showed that dropout rates were similar between treatment and control groups, with no significant differences in standardized test performance. Mixed results were found in outcomes related to fertility, indicating success in some groups and locations, but no impact on sexual behavior."
