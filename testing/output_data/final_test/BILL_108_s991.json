    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Registered Nurse Safe Staffing Act of 2003\". The findings of Congress highlight the critical shortage of registered nurses in the United States, leading to unsafe staffing levels in hospitals. This shortage adversely affects patient safety, creating a public health crisis. Registered nurses are being required to work under conditions that do not support quality healthcare or a healthy work environment. The Federal Government has a compelling interest in promoting the safety of individuals entitled to Medicare benefits by requiring hospitals to establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses. Establishment of minimum staffing ratios by Medicare participating hospitals is required under a new section of the Social Security Act. This aims to ensure hospitals meet staffing requirements for Medicare patients. Each participating hospital must establish a staffing system ensuring appropriate levels of registered nurses on each shift and unit based on patient care needs and input from direct care-giving staff and chief nurse executive. The staffing system in hospitals must consider factors like admissions, discharges, transfers, contextual issues, preparation and experience of care providers, staffing effectiveness, and recommendations from specialty nursing organizations. The staffing system in hospitals should establish adjustable nurse-to-patient ratios based on patient acuity, ensure nurses are competent in assigned units, and use reliable methods. The system cannot have nurse levels below legal requirements or use minimum ratios set by regulations. The hospital must post daily staffing information for each shift, including the number of licensed and unlicensed nursing staff responsible for patient care, with a specific count of registered nurses. Upon request, this information must be made available to the public. The hospital must provide detailed nursing staff information to the Secretary quarterly through electronic data submission. The Secretary will make this information publicly available and audit it. The participating hospital must maintain records for at least 3 years to determine compliance with staffing system requirements. The Secretary will collect data on outcomes linked to the staffing system. The participating hospital must maintain records for at least 3 years to determine compliance with staffing system requirements. The link between the staffing system and patient acuity, nursing-sensitive patient outcomes, operational outcomes, and patient complaints related to staffing levels must be evaluated by each participating hospital. Each participating hospital must annually evaluate its staffing system and establish minimum registered nurse staffing ratios. The evaluation is conducted by a joint management-staff committee with at least 50% registered nurses. The Secretary enforces the requirements and procedures for receiving and investigating complaints about violations. The Secretary enforces requirements for hospitals to establish staffing ratios and investigate complaints of violations. If a hospital violates these requirements, the Secretary can require a corrective action plan and impose civil money penalties up to $10,000 per violation. The Secretary can impose civil money penalties exceeding $10,000 for hospitals with a pattern of violations. The penalties follow procedures similar to those in section 1128A, and violations must be publicly disclosed on the internet site. The Secretary can impose civil money penalties on participating hospitals for violations, which will be published on the Department of Health and Human Services website. Penalties imposed on hospitals under previous ownership will no longer be published after a 1-year period. Whistleblower protections are also included. Whistleblower protections prohibit discrimination or retaliation against patients or employees who report grievances or complaints related to hospital staffing. Employees who face retaliation can seek reinstatement and reimbursement through judicial action. Employees who report grievances related to hospital staffing are protected from discrimination or retaliation. They can seek reinstatement, lost wages, and benefits through judicial action. Patients who experience discrimination or retaliation can also take legal action and may be entitled to $5,000 in liquidated damages. Employees who report grievances related to hospital staffing are protected from discrimination or retaliation. No action may be brought more than 2 years after the discrimination or retaliation. Adverse employment actions are treated as retaliation or discrimination, including failure to promote or adverse evaluations. Employees reporting grievances related to hospital staffing are protected from adverse actions such as failure to promote or adverse evaluations. The Secretary will implement regulations for this section, and state laws still apply. A participating hospital is defined as one that has a provider agreement. A registered nurse is an individual licensed to practice in at least one state. A unit in a hospital refers to a specific department or area. A shift is a scheduled set of hours. The term 'shift' refers to a scheduled set of hours at a hospital, and 'person' includes individuals, associations, corporations, organizations, or labor unions. The effective date for these amendments is January 1, 2004."
