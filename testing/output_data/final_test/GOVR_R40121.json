Critics have labeled it as a \"backdoor draft\" or \"involuntary servitude\". The Army has consistently used Stop Loss during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, with nearly 8,000 soldiers affected currently. Some sympathize with those in Stop Loss status, while others argue that all servicemembers were aware of the possibility when enlisting or reenlisting. Stop Loss is a force management program that extends active duty for enlisted servicemembers beyond their separation date. It also applies to reserve component personnel called to active duty in support of OIF or OEF. Officers can be affected if they have an approved retirement or resignation, which can be denied or postponed. There are two variations of Stop Loss: Skill-based and Unit-based. Unit-based Stop Loss is used to maintain unit strength, enhance unit integrity, and retain personnel for deployments to OIF/OEF. If a servicemember's term of service ends during deployment or 90 days prior, their active duty can be extended up to 90 days after deployment. Stop Movement complements Stop Loss by preventing personnel loss from deploying units due to reassignment orders. The Stop Movement policy rescinds reassignment orders for deploying units, with exceptions for certain personnel like those going to Drill Sergeant or Recruiter duty, Officer Candidate School, Special Operations courses, and Army Medical Department schools. Unit-based Stop Loss has been primarily used by the Army to address personnel shortfalls and sustain readiness. Individuals enlisting in the armed forces are contractually obligated to an eight-year service. Armed forces, active and reserve component, have an eight-year service requirement called the Military Service Obligation (MSO). Enlistees commit to a two to six year active duty obligation, followed by service in the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). Reserve component personnel, including those in the IRR, can be called to active duty and have supported combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reenlistment or extension beyond initial enlistment also applies. Servicemembers who reenlist or extend beyond their initial enlistment have a separation date ranging from two to six years. Officers have an eight-year Military Service Obligation with a three to five-year active duty obligation. Stop Loss may retain personnel who decide to separate. Officers may serve the remainder of their MSO in the Selected Reserve or IRR if they choose to separate. The term \"Stop Loss\" is derived from 10 U.S.C. 12305, allowing the President to suspend certain laws related to promotion, retirement, or separation for essential national security reasons. Added in 1984, this provision was created to address concerns about the President's authority during times of war or national emergency. The President can extend enlistment or appointment of essential personnel during a crisis, authorized under Section 12305. President Bush delegated this authority to the Secretary of Defense in 1990, allowing suspension of laws regarding promotion, retirement, and separation. This delegation remains in effect today. In response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush declared a national emergency and issued Executive Order 13223, ordering the Ready Reserve to active duty for up to 24 months. This proclamation, still in effect today, allows the Secretary of Defense to implement programs like Stop Loss. Despite the absence of specific Department of Defense policy guidance, courts have upheld Stop Loss as a valid exercise of Presidential power authorized by 10 U.S.C. 12305 and compliant with the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause. During the OIF/OEF conflicts, Stop Loss was extensively used by the Army across all components, impacting tens of thousands of servicemembers and their families. The program was officially suspended by the Secretary of Defense after being the only service to continue its use. During the OIF/OEF conflicts, the Army extensively used Stop Loss authority until officially suspended by the Secretary of Defense. A skill-based program was initially used for critical skills, later modified to limit Stop Loss to 12 months for all soldiers. The Army National Guard and Army Reserve had a unit-based program, while all Army components adopted a unit-based program for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Army's unit-based Stop Loss program was briefly terminated in 2003 but reinstated later that year. Currently, all Army components have the same unit-based Stop Loss program to ensure trained and cohesive units for OIF and OEF. Stop Loss applies to both deployable and non-deployable personnel in deploying units for a period of 90 days post-redeployment for transition activities. The Army's Stop Loss program applies to both deployable and non-deployable personnel in deploying units. Non-deployable personnel are usually assigned to the unit's rear detachment. Soldiers with temporary non-deployable medical conditions are still subject to Stop Loss if the unit is alerted for deployment. The Navy had a skill-based Stop Loss program during the first year of OEF, targeting critical skills like special operations, security, and medical personnel. Initially, over 10,000 officers and enlisted personnel were identified with these skills. The program was rescinded in 2001 but reinstated with a more targeted approach six months later. The Navy's Stop Loss program was rescinded in 2001 but reinstated with a more targeted approach six months later. Approximately 2,600 personnel were initially identified, but the program only lasted for one month and affected fewer than 100 sailors. The Navy voluntarily halted its Stop Loss program in August 2002 and did not reinstate it for OIF. The Air Force's Stop Loss occurred during the initial stages of OIF from March through June 2003, targeting high-demand career fields and impacting thousands of active duty officers and enlisted personnel. The Marine Corps Stop Loss program affected over 10,000 Marines in early 2002, lasting for five months. It was followed by a selective program impacting approximately 560 Marines assigned to an anti-terrorism brigade and C-130 aircrew positions. Individual exemptions were granted by the Marine Corps, with the program ending in May 2003. In 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates directed the services to reduce the use of Stop Loss for active and reserve forces. The Army was the only branch still utilizing Stop Loss, citing its necessity for deploying trained units to Iraq and Afghanistan. Secretary Gates announced the phased suspension of the program in 2009. Stop Loss affected soldiers 90 days before deployment or mobilization, during deployment (typically 12 months), and up to 90 days post-redeployment for transition. The Stop Loss program affected soldiers by involuntarily retaining them in the unit for extended periods, potentially adding up to 18 months to their active duty commitment. Factors such as deployment length influenced the number of soldiers subject to Stop Loss. The Army increased deployments for OIF during the surge in Iraq, affecting more soldiers with Stop Loss. Factors like the number of units deployed, distribution of separation dates, and out-of-cycle deployments also impacted the program. The relationship between deployed Brigade Combat Teams and deployment length was modeled by DOD to show the impact on individual soldiers. The Army's use of Stop Loss is influenced by the deployment of Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and rotation cycles. Increasing the number of deployed BCTs and extending rotation cycles results in soldiers being retained longer. The Army's rotation methodology for OIF/OEF prioritizes unit rotation over individual rotation, impacting the need for Stop Loss. Balancing unit cohesion with individual career development has been a long-standing challenge for the Army. Stabilizing personnel in units is believed to enhance readiness and teamwork effectiveness. During WWII, individual replacements were used to compensate for casualties in combat units, leading to a constant turnover of personnel. These replacements, lacking unit affiliation and combat experience, struggled to integrate into existing units and often became casualties themselves. Once separated from their unit, soldiers had little chance of rejoining the same group. During WWII and Korea, wounded or separated soldiers were often reassigned to different units based on their skills. Some soldiers concealed their injuries to stay with their comrades. In Korea, a rotation program based on combat exposure was introduced to send individuals back stateside after a set time, increasing personnel turnover. The rotation policy in Vietnam led to high personnel turnover and lack of unit cohesion. The Individual Replacement System caused turbulence and hindered the formation of cohesive units, especially in combat arms. The Army has tried various unit replacement systems post-Vietnam to improve combat readiness by keeping soldiers and leaders together longer. Since 2004, the Army has pursued unit stabilization through the Unit Manning System focused on Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) to ensure trained and ready units for deployment. This system categorizes units based on deployment preparedness, but still relies on Stop Loss to minimize personnel turbulence. Despite concerns about the program's unpopularity affecting recruiting, the Army has maintained readiness since the beginning of OEF/OIF. Since the beginning of OEF/OIF, there has been no definitive survey data showing a shortfall in recruiting directly attributable to the Stop Loss program. The Army missed its recruiting goal in FY2005 but met it in subsequent years by increasing recruiters, advertising budget, and enlistment bonuses. The military's attractiveness and financial security may overshadow concerns about Stop Loss during the recent economic downturn. The Army successfully met its recruiting goals from FY2006 to FY2009 despite challenges. Analysts were concerned about declining recruit quality, but the Army had a successful year in 2009. Retention goals were consistently met, and the Army Reserve and National Guard also had successful recruiting years in 2009. The Army has achieved its recruiting goals from FY2006 to FY2009, with concerns about the impact of Stop Loss on \"Influencers\" improving as 59% now support joining the military. Stop Loss affects about 1% of the Total Army, with approximately 12,000 soldiers in Stop Loss status. Terminating Stop Loss may have a negligible impact on readiness. The potential impact of Stop Loss on personnel readiness is significant, as those in Stop Loss status represent nearly 10% of the deployed force. Approximately 45% of the Stop Loss cohort are noncommissioned officers who are crucial for unit leadership and tactical success. Deploying without these key NCOs could have a detrimental impact on unit readiness. The Army's deployment criteria for Brigade Combat Teams require achieving specific enlisted and officer strength percentages prior to deployment. Without Stop Loss, units may struggle to meet these criteria, impacting readiness. The active duty end strength during the early years of OIF/OEF was debated by Congress and defense observers, but was supported by DOD and Army leadership. The Secretary of Defense sought approval to increase the end strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Congress approved an increase for the active Army from 482,400 to 547,400 by the end of FY2012, achieving it by FY2009. The Stop Loss program may artificially inflate the actual end strength, with around 7,500 soldiers retained beyond their initial obligation. The Army completed the mandated increase in end strength earlier than required by Congress through recruiting and retention efforts. Despite suggestions to divert the increase to eliminate the need for Stop Loss, the Army is focused on growing its force structure and will continue to use Stop Loss to reduce unit shortages. Another option could be to continue the Stop Loss program for NCOs. The Army is considering options to reduce unit shortages, including continuing the Stop Loss program for NCOs but eliminating it for junior enlisted personnel. The FY2002 NDAA included provisions for extending servicemembers on active duty and addressing special or incentive pay issues. The FY2006 NDAA addressed the issue of special or incentive pay for servicemembers, allowing for the continuation of these pays during involuntary retention due to Stop Loss. The DOD was required to inform potential recruits about Stop Loss and the possibility of being recalled from the IRR. Enlistment contracts were revised to explain Stop Loss, and briefings were provided before signing. The FY2006 NDAA revised enlistment contracts to explicitly state the possibility of Stop Loss extensions for Reserve component members serving on active duty. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to establish special pay for servicemembers affected by Stop Loss. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to establish special pay for servicemembers affected by Stop Loss. The FY2009 NDAA did not include additional compensation for those in Stop Loss status, but the FY2009 omnibus appropriations act authorized a maximum Stop Loss Special Pay of $500 per month. This provision was not retroactive to September 11, 2001 and initially expired on September 30, 2009. The Stop Loss special pay was initially authorized by the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, providing $500 per month. It was extended to June 30, 2011, by the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. Retroactive payments were made to soldiers in Stop Loss status between October 1, 2008, and April 1, 2009. Stop Loss payments will continue until approximately June 30, 2011, to allow for the redeployment of units. The transition period for servicemembers is now 60 days, down from 90 days, to process for separation, retirement, or reassignment. Secretary of Defense Gates announced the phased suspension of the Army's Stop Loss program on March 18, 2009. The services can still suspend separations, but any renewed use of Stop Loss would require an emergency situation based on critically short skills. The Army has announced incentive programs to encourage voluntary extension of eligible soldiers whose separation date is close to their unit's deployment. The Deployment Extension Incentive Pay (DEIP) program offers $500 per month for each full month of extension during a three-month window before deployment. Soldiers who delay extension decisions will receive reduced payments. Those with six months or more to serve upon deployment must either extend or reenlist to receive DEIP. Soldiers with less than six months left and who do not opt for DEIP will not deploy and must separate on or before their contracted separation date. Army Reserve's incentive program differs from Active Army and Army National Guard. The Army Reserve's incentive program, known as the Designated Unit Stabilization Program (DUSP), offers additional payments to soldiers before deployment. Those with separation or retirement dates during deployment must extend or reenlist to qualify. Soldiers who do not extend or reenlist will not deploy and may be reassigned. Army Reserve soldiers do not receive extra pay during deployment. Acceptance rates of voluntary incentive programs vary among components. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act authorized Stop Loss payments of $500 per month for soldiers in Stop Loss status during FY2009, extended to June 30, 2011 by the FY2010 NDAA. Retroactive Stop Loss special pay was provided for 185,000 former servicemembers from September 11, 2001, to September 30, 2008, with $534.4M from the FY2009 Defense Supplemental. The legislation authorized retroactive Stop Loss special pay of $500 per month for former servicemembers from September 11, 2001, to September 30, 2008. The pay is tax-free for months served in a combat zone, with a one-year window for submitting claims. The DOD must provide reports on claims filed, approved, denied, and funding status every six months until all funds are expended. Servicemembers have a one-year window to submit claims for retroactive Stop Loss special pay, starting from October 21, 2009. Payments beyond the one-year period ending on October 21, 2010 are not allowed. Each service is responsible for marketing the program and processing claims, with most services offering electronic submission options. The Stop Loss Retroactive Pay program allows former servicemembers to submit claims for payment, with claims needing additional documentation referred to a case manager. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service processes validated claims for payment. By December 2009, only a small percentage of anticipated claims had been received, with many initial Army claims having issues and requiring resolution by a case manager. Processing of applications was suspended in late December 2009. The processing of Retroactive Stop Loss claims was suspended in late December 2009 after Congress clarified eligibility for the program. Servicemembers who voluntarily reenlisted or extended while in Stop Loss status and received a bonus are no longer eligible for retroactive pay. 18,234 claims had been received by January 14, 2010, with 3,663 certified, 268 unsubstantiated, and 1,774 paid. Processing time averages around 50 days. Former servicemembers can apply for payments through the appropriate service liaison office. The Retroactive Stop Loss Program requires servicemembers to provide proof of being Stop Lossed along with their claim. Family members of deceased servicemembers should contact the appropriate military service for assistance. All applications must be submitted by October 21, 2010, as applications received after that date will not be processed. Contact information for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force is provided for more details."
