    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Golan v. Holder on October 5, 2011, to determine if Congress had the authority to grant copyright protection to works in the public domain. In 1994, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act restored copyright to certain foreign works to comply with the Berne Convention. In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the URAA, arguing that it interfered with First Amendment rights. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected these arguments, stating that the URAA was a valid exercise of Congress's power and did not violate free speech rights. The U.S. Supreme Court granted the plaintiffs' petition to consider if Congress can remove works from the public domain and if Section 514 of the URAA violates the First Amendment. The source of federal copyright law is the Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Copyright Clause in the U.S. Constitution allows Congress to promote the progress of science by granting authors exclusive rights for limited times. Once the copyright expires, the work enters the public domain for anyone to use. The primary goal of copyright is to promote science and arts, not just reward authors. The Copyright Act provides legal protection for original works like books, movies, art, and music. The Copyright Act grants authors exclusive rights to their creative works such as books, movies, art, and music. Copyright protection only covers the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Copyright holders have the exclusive rights of reproduction, distribution, public performance, and public display of their work, allowing them to control its use by third parties. Licensing agreements are often used to grant permission for third parties to exercise copyright rights, typically through a written contract with terms that may include limitations and royalty fees. The Copyright Act includes statutory limitations like the \"first sale doctrine\" which allows owners to sell copies without permission, as well as provisions for reproductions by libraries, educational performances, and non-profit activities. The doctrine of \"fair use\" in copyright law allows for reasonable use of copyrighted material without permission under specific circumstances. Fair use can apply to purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Determining fair use requires a case-by-case analysis by a federal court, considering various statutory factors. Unauthorized use that infringes on a copyright holder's exclusive rights can lead to a lawsuit. The Copyright Act provides civil remedies for infringement, including injunctive relief, damages, and attorney fees. Copyright protection lasts the author's life plus 70 years, after which the work enters the public domain. Materials in the public domain can be used without permission. The United States copyright law historically required creators to fulfill formalities to secure copyright protection, such as providing notice on the work, depositing copies with the Copyright Office, and filing a registration form. Failure to meet these formalities could result in loss of copyright. The United States eliminated formalities in the Copyright Act to comply with the Berne Convention, ensuring copyright protection without conditions. The Berne Convention Implementation Act (BCIA) of 1988 did not extend copyrights to foreign works in the U.S. public domain. In 1994, the United States and other countries signed agreements in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The Uruguay Round agreements, including the TRIPS Agreement, set minimum standards for intellectual property protection among WTO members. TRIPS requires compliance with the Berne Convention and allows for dispute resolution through the WTO, potentially leading to trade sanctions for non-compliance. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) was enacted by Congress in 1994 to implement agreements signed in the Uruguay Round. Section 514 of URAA grants copyright protection to foreign works that were previously in the U.S. public domain, but it does not restore copyrights for works that entered the public domain due to expiration. This provision removed millions of foreign works from the public domain. The URAA removed millions of foreign works from the public domain. The CTEA extended copyright terms by 20 years to align with the EU, allowing authors to have copyright protection for life plus 70 years. Plaintiffs sued the U.S. Attorney General, claiming the CTEA violated the \"limited Times\" requirement of the Copyright Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision in favor of the Attorney General regarding the constitutionality of the CTEA. Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in Eldred v. Ashcroft, upholding the CTEA by a 7-2 vote. She argued that historical congressional practice supported granting authors term extensions. The Court found that the longstanding practice of adjusting copyright terms for both existing and future works was almost conclusive. The Eldred Court left open the possibility of a future First Amendment challenge against Congress altering copyright protection. Copyright's free speech safeguards are generally sufficient, and further scrutiny is unnecessary when traditional copyright boundaries are maintained. The plaintiffs in Golan v. Holder, like those in Eldred, include orchestra conductors, educators, performers, and publishers. In Golan v. Holder, plaintiffs including orchestra conductors, educators, performers, and publishers challenged the constitutionality of the URAA, which restored copyright protection to foreign works previously in the public domain. This prevented them from using these works without paying costly licensing fees. The plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the URAA and the Copyright Term Extension Act, arguing that they exceeded Congress's powers under the Copyright Clause and violated the First Amendment. The U.S. District Court dismissed the challenge to the CTEA and ruled in favor of the government on the URAA claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the CTEA claims and upheld Congress's power to enact \u00a7 514 of the URAA under the Copyright Clause. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiffs have free expression interests in works removed from the public domain, requiring First Amendment scrutiny of \u00a7 514. The court found that \u00a7 514 alters traditional copyright principles and remanded the case for a First Amendment review of the CTEA. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, ruling that Section 514 is unconstitutional as it suppresses the right of reliance parties to use works from the public domain. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed this decision, stating that Section 514 does not violate the First Amendment and advances an important governmental interest. The federal appellate court identified the important governmental interest in protecting American copyright holders' interests abroad by restoring foreign copyrights. The court ruled that Section 514 of the URAA is narrowly tailored to further this legitimate government interest. The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Golan v. Holder on October 5, 2011, with Justice Kagan recusing herself from the case. In Golan v. Holder on October 5, 2011, Justice Kagan recused herself, leaving only eight justices to consider the case. This raises the possibility of a 4-4 tie vote, which would uphold the Tenth Circuit's rulings on the constitutionality of \u00a7 514. The petitioners argue that copyright legislation traditionally kept works in the public domain, but the Berne Convention Implementation Act changed this. The URAA, according to petitioners, violated U.S. copyright law traditions by removing works from the public domain and infringing on the \"limited Times\" restriction of the Copyright Clause. They argue that it also violates the First Amendment by placing burdens on speech rights without sufficient government interest justification. The U.S. Solicitor General defended the constitutionality of \u00a7 514 of the URAA. The government defends the constitutionality of \u00a7 514 of the URAA, arguing that Congress has the power to restore copyright protection to certain foreign works in the public domain without violating the First Amendment. They claim that the term of protection for restored copyrights is limited and historically, Congress has granted copyright protection to pre-existing works. The government also argues that \u00a7 514 is consistent with the First Amendment and should be reviewed under a deferential rational-basis. The government defends the constitutionality of \u00a7 514 of the URAA, arguing that it is consistent with the First Amendment and should be reviewed under a deferential rational-basis standard. They refute the Tenth Circuit's holding that the statute alters the \"traditional contours of copyright protection\" and thus deserves heightened First Amendment scrutiny. The government argues that Section 514 of the URAA is constitutional under the First Amendment, citing three important governmental interests it serves. The Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on Golan v. Holder by the end of its October 2011 term."
