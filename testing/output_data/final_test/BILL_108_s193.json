    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Radiation Detection for Dirty Bomb Material in Containers and Bulk Cargo Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the threat of a terrorist group using a dirty bomb is a major national security concern. It is easy to transport dirty bomb materials into the US, posing a significant risk. Due to limitations in current radiation detection systems, the Secretary of Energy should implement a large-scale radiation detection program using advanced scanning technologies to inspect sea freight containers and bulk cargo at seaports and entry points. The Secretary should prioritize effective radiation detection technologies for demonstration, capable of quickly detecting radioactive sources in sea freight containers and bulk material cargo. The selected system should screen cargo without hindering commerce, operate at a level to detect shielded radioactive sources, and be implemented at seaports and entry points by land. The Act requires the use of radiation detection technologies to identify radioactive sources in sea freight containers and bulk material cargo. Information obtained during scanning should be stored centrally for tracking and analysis by relevant agencies. Pilot projects for monitoring cargo are also mandated under the Act. The Act mandates the use of radiation detection technologies for sea freight containers and bulk material cargo. Procedures should incorporate information from national and international projects. The Secretary must develop protocols addressing scanning situations and provide guidance to seaport and land authorities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"program\" refers to the radiation detection system demonstration program under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The term \"system\" refers to a radiation detection system. The Secretary will implement a program to maintain and expand radiation detection projects at seaports and land entry points, evaluate systems for use in the United States, and select systems for demonstration. The evaluation will focus on state-of-the-art systems for detecting radioactive sources in sea freight containers and land cargo. The Secretary will emphasize rapid development of technology for border security systems. The selected system for demonstration may include hardware components and integration, reporting procedures, and decision-making coordination. Proximity to material is a critical factor in system selection. The Secretary will select a system for demonstration that is located close to the material to be scanned and has proven field operational time. The demonstration phase will incorporate knowledge gained from previous studies and expand on it to include material shipped in containers. During the demonstration phase of the program, lasting up to 2 years, the Secretary will identify future research needs for emerging systems and inform relevant agencies. All data detected by the system must be collected, displayed, and archived, and the system must be durable enough to withstand severe impacts and rough conditions. The system for detecting radiation in containers must withstand severe impacts and rough handling. It should be able to detect gammas and neutrons emitted by isotopes that could be used for a dirty bomb. The system must operate automatically, detect radiation quickly without hindering commerce, and be sensitive to background fluctuations. The Secretary will develop procedures and protocols for detection and reporting of data from radiation collection systems to synchronize technical approaches and coordinate efforts among agencies. Additionally, a national technical assistance program will be established to share experiences and solicit input from stakeholders for the development of a national program of radiation detection systems. The Secretary will provide student internships focusing on radiation detection and health physics at universities in States with seaports. A report on the program's results will be submitted to Congress. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 to carry out this Act."
