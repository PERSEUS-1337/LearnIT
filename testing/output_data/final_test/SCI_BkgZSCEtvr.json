    "content": "Continuous Graph Flow is a generative method for modeling complex distributions of graph-structured data. It uses an ordinary differential equation system with shared functions for continuous message passing over time. The model offers advantages such as flexible representation, ability to model dependencies, reversibility, and efficient computation of data likelihood. It has been effective in tasks like graph generation, image puzzle generation, and layout. Our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in graph generation, image puzzle generation, and layout generation from scene graphs. Graph generative models have applications in various scientific fields like building knowledge graphs, inventing new molecular structures, and generating diverse images. Traditional graph generative methods lack the capability to learn from observed data, while modern deep learning frameworks like variational autoencoders have shown promise in this area. Modern deep learning frameworks like variational autoencoders offer promise in learning distributions from data. Efforts have focused on bestowing VAE based generative models with the ability to learn structured latent space models. Autoregressive graph generative models construct graph nodes sequentially and have been proven to be successful. However, the generation process suffers from its sequential nature. Existing methods for graph generation struggle to maintain long-term dependencies in larger graphs, limiting their generative power. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown effectiveness in learning generalizable representations over variable input data dimensions through iterative neural message passing. Continuous Graph Flow (CGF) is a new class of models that generalizes the message passing mechanism in GNNs to continuous time using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). It leverages normalizing flows to transform distributions over time, allowing for modeling continuous time dynamics of graph variables. The Continuous Graph Flow (CGF) model utilizes a neural ODE formulation for flexibility in handling variable data dimensions and modeling complex data distributions. It is reversible, memory efficient, and relies on continuous message passing. In contrast to Graph Normalizing Flows (GNF), CGF does not require a fixed number of transformations or partitioning of data dimensions. Our CGF model has unconstrained Jacobians, allowing for more expressive transformations compared to other models like GraphNVP. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in tasks such as graph generation, image puzzle generation, and layout generation based on scene graphs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art models in these tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in handling diverse tasks. The model uses a restricted form of GNNs where node embeddings are updated in-place, allowing for use in flow-based models. Flow-based models construct complex distributions from simple ones through invertible mappings. Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) model continuous-time dynamics using a chain of invertible functions, extending the change of variables rule to a continuous version. The log-likelihood of a random variable is defined by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes the change in the state of the variable over time. Continuous Graph Flow (CGF) is introduced as a method to model continuous time dynamics over graph-structured data by efficiently computing the log likelihood of variables using trace computation instead of Jacobian computation. The goal is to learn the joint distribution of a set of random variables X, where each variable x_i follows an ordinary differential equation system with interactions defined by a function f_i. The variables evolve over time following a base distribution, such as Gaussian distributions. The function f_i defines variable interactions. Transformation of individual graph variables is defined as the value of variable x_i from time t0 to t1. A neural message passing process updates variables based on graph structure, starting at time t0 with local information and gathering information from neighboring variables at time t. The function f_i is defined as f_ij(\u00b7) for passing messages. The function f_i in Eq. 8 defines variable interactions using reusable message functions f_ij(\u00b7) to pass information between variables. It involves pairwise message functions that can be generalized to higher-order interactions. The continuous process eliminates the need for a predetermined number of message passing steps, updating variables through an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Solving the ODE system is equivalent to performing message passing to derive final states. The continuous message passing process involves solving an initial value problem for an ODE system to compute final states of variables. It transforms variables from simple base distributions to complex data distributions, allowing the learning of a model capturing the distribution from which data were sampled. The continuous message passing process involves transforming variables using density transformations for message passing. It includes generic message transformations with neural network functions and multi-scale message transformations at different information scales. The likelihood is defined using a neural network for message functions and a noise vector. The multi-scale message passing model involves stacking blocks for message passing based on generic transformations. Each block factors out a portion of the output to feed into the next block. The likelihood is defined using a neural network for message functions and a noise vector. The Continuous Graph Flow (CGF) model is evaluated on tasks such as graph generation, image puzzle generation, and layout generation based on scene graphs. These tasks involve learning complex distributions and correlations in data. The model is tested on benchmark datasets EGO-SMALL and COMMUNITY-SMALL. The Continuous Graph Flow (CGF) model is evaluated on graph generation tasks using benchmark datasets EGO-SMALL and COMMUNITY-SMALL. The evaluation includes comparing the model against VAE-based method, GraphRNN, DeepGMG, and Graph normalizing flows. The evaluation involves using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measures to assess the generated graphs' quality. The CGF model outperforms baselines and GNF in graph generation tasks by employing free-flow functions, capturing dataset characteristics, and generating diverse unseen graphs. Visualizations in Fig. 2 showcase the model's capabilities, with additional comparisons available in Appendix A. Task description involves designing image puzzles to test the model's ability on complex node distributions in graphs. The model designs image puzzles with non-overlapping patches to represent nodes in graphs. It samples adjacent patches for training and testing, capturing dataset characteristics and generating diverse graphs. The patch size is 16, with a choice of 2, 3, or 4 patches sampled. Edge functions are defined for each direction within a node's neighborhood. The study compares their model with six state-of-the-art VAE based models on three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA. The CelebA dataset is split into a training set of 27,000 images and a test set of 3,000 images. The study compares their model with six VAE based models on three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA. Results show that CGF outperforms the baselines in terms of negative log likelihood. Additionally, they conduct sampling and generation experiments for unconditional and conditional generation tasks. Conditional generation is considered easier than unconditional generation due to the presence of more relevant information in the input during flow-based transformations. In unconditional generation, samples from a base distribution are transformed into a learned data distribution using the CGF model. In conditional generation, input data is mapped to points in the base distribution to obtain z, which is then concatenated with samples from a Gaussian distribution to match dimensions. Qualitative results for image puzzle generation show samples generated for 2x2 MNIST and 3x3 CelebA-HQ puzzles in both unconditional and conditional settings. In the conditional setting, generated patches are conditioned on the remaining patches from ground truth. The model uses scene graphs as inputs, where nodes represent objects and edges show relationships. Object layouts are described by bounding box annotations. An edge function is defined for each relationship type to output object bounding boxes. The model evaluates scene layout generation using bounding boxes and negative log likelihood. Two datasets, Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff, are used for evaluation. The CGF model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of negative log likelihood. Our model demonstrates the ability to learn correct relations in scene graphs for layout generation, including one-to-many mappings and diverse layouts. Quantitative results show superior performance in negative log-likelihood compared to other methods. The model's generalizability to variable graph sizes is tested on an image puzzle task. The model's generalizability to variable graph sizes is tested on an image puzzle task, evaluating its performance in different training and testing scenarios. The NLL of the models in various settings is reported in Table 4, showing their ability to learn disentangled functions without explicitly seeing them during training. In this paper, a continuous graph flow model is introduced as a generative model that extends neural message passing in graphs to continuous time. The model is formulated as a neural ordinary differential equation system with shared and reusable functions operating over the graph structure. Evaluation across various generation tasks shows significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Future work will focus on large-scale graph generation tasks, leveraging the model's reversibility and memory efficiency. In this section, the implementation details of the continuous graph flow (CGF) model are described. The model is used for graph generation, image puzzle generation, and layout generation tasks. The CGF model configuration used in experiments is specified, including the process of generating line graphs and node values. The ODE solver provided by NeuralODE is utilized for solving the ODE formulation in the CGF model. The continuous graph flow model is used for tasks like graph generation and image puzzle generation. It involves dequantization of binary values and uses a multi-scale architecture with convolutional layers for node embeddings. The continuous graph flow model involves two levels of downscaling with convolutional message passing blocks. For scene graph layout generation, the model uses graph flow units with linear message passing blocks. The message passing function in the model uses 64 hidden dimensions and embeddings for node and edge labels. Image puzzles and layout generation results are shown for different datasets. The text discusses image puzzle generation and layout generation from scene graphs for the Visual Genome dataset. Results show diverse layouts for a single scene graph in both unconditional and conditional generation settings. Additionally, qualitative results for graph generation are presented in figures 11 and 12. The generated graphs for EGO-SMALL and COMMUNITY-SMALL show different layouts for each scene graph. The number of function evaluations does not increase linearly with the number of graph nodes."
