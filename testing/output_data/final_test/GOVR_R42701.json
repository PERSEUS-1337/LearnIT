    "content": "The debate over drone use in domestic surveillance operations in the US has sparked controversy. Opponents argue that it violates privacy rights and could be used to surveil American citizens. Proponents highlight benefits such as enhancing public safety and enforcing laws. The tension between security and privacy has been exacerbated by advancements in surveillance technology. The use of drones for domestic surveillance in the US raises concerns about privacy rights and government intrusion. While the public supports drone usage in certain situations, there is hesitation about their routine use in law enforcement. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but applying it to modern technology poses challenges. The Supreme Court interprets constitutional safeguards, but Congress and the President can impose stricter restrictions on government actions. The report examines the potential uses of drones in domestic surveillance by government entities and current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. It also discusses legislative measures introduced in Congress to address legal and policy issues related to drones, as well as alternative approaches to constrain drone surveillance. Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are aircraft that operate without a human pilot and can be controlled remotely or autonomously. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are drones that can fly autonomously or under remote control. They vary in size from nano drones to traditional jets and have various uses, including military missions and commercial activities. Congress has pushed for faster integration of drones into U.S. airspace, with predictions of 30,000 drones flying in less than 20 years. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated the FAA to develop a plan for integrating civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace by September 2015. Drones are used domestically by various government agencies, including DHS, for border security and law enforcement purposes. Several government agencies, including DHS, use drones domestically for various purposes such as border security and law enforcement. Local police departments, state colleges, and small cities have also received FAA Certificates of Authorization to fly unmanned aircraft. Drones are equipped with high-tech capabilities like cameras, thermal imaging devices, and license plate readers. Law enforcement may consider adding facial recognition or biometric recognition technology to drones in the future. The use of drones for domestic surveillance by government agencies, including DHS, raises concerns about privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. Drones equipped with advanced technology like facial recognition and biometric recognition may impact court decisions on their legality under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment's application to evolving technology is a key issue, with rules and exceptions shaping its regulation of domestic drone use. The Fourth Amendment regulates government searches and seizures, protecting against unreasonable intrusion. Courts determine if government monitoring constitutes a Fourth Amendment \"search\" requiring a warrant. In Olmstead v. United States, wiretaps were not considered a search as there was no physical trespass. The Court's shift from focusing on property to privacy interests was evident in Katz v. United States in 1967. The case established that even in a public area, individuals have a constitutionally protected right to privacy. This modern interpretation of the Fourth Amendment considers whether a person has a subjective expectation of privacy in the area being monitored. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals based on their subjective expectation of privacy in a searched area, as determined by society's reasonableness. The location of a search dictates the level of protection, with technology influencing society's privacy expectations. When analyzing domestic drone use under the Fourth Amendment, a reviewing court may consider cases related to privacy in the home, public spaces, location tracking, aerial surveillance, national borders, and warrantless searches. The home is given the highest level of Fourth Amendment protection, ensuring security against unreasonable search and seizure. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld this safeguard, allowing warrantless arrests in public but requiring warrants for searches inside a person's home. The Fourth Amendment protects the home as a realm of guaranteed privacy, prohibiting warrantless searches inside unless under recognized exceptions. In Kyllo v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that using technology to gather information about the inside of a home constitutes a search, requiring a warrant. However, the home does not provide absolute protection against government surveillance. Justice Harlan emphasized in Katz that a man's home is a place of privacy, but objects exposed to plain view are not protected. Police can conduct warrantless searches inside a home under the \"plain view\" doctrine if they have a lawful vantage point and the incriminating nature of evidence is apparent. Once outside the home, different Fourth Amendment considerations apply, with areas like curtilage receiving similar protections as the inside of the home. The curtilage, an area granted similar protections as the inside of the home, is determined by factors like proximity to the home, enclosure within a fence, usage, and protection from observation. However, it does not have unconditional constitutional protection, as noted in an aerial surveillance case. The Fourth Amendment does not require law enforcement to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public roads, and observations from a public vantage point are permissible. The area outside the curtilage is considered \"open.\" The curtilage, an area with similar protections as the home, is determined by factors like proximity, enclosure, and usage. The area outside the curtilage is considered \"open fields\" and does not have the same Fourth Amendment protections. Differentiating between the two can be challenging, as seen in court cases. The Supreme Court has allowed searches in both open fields and curtilage, blurring the constitutional difference. In cases similar to UAVs, the Court addressed the use of manned aircraft for domestic surveillance over residential areas. In California v. Ciraolo, police used a fixed-wing aircraft to conduct surveillance over a backyard where marijuana was being grown. The Supreme Court ruled that the fly-over was not a Fourth Amendment violation as the area was visible to the public. The defendant's expectation of privacy was deemed unreasonable as anything exposed to the public is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. In Florida v. Riley, police flew a helicopter over a suspect's backyard at 400 feet and spotted marijuana plants in a greenhouse. The Court ruled this was not a search requiring a warrant as the helicopter was in navigable airspace. In Dow Chemical v. United States, the Court addressed whether aerial surveillance over a commercial plant constituted a search. The EPA hired a photographer to take photos after Dow Chemical refused access. The Court determined that aerial photography from navigable airspace was not a search, similar to cases involving government tracking of individuals in public places. The Court has ruled on government tracking cases, such as United States v. Knotts and United States v. Karo, where tracking on public streets is allowed but not in private residences. The Fourth Amendment may not permit pervasive tracking. In Knotts, tracking on public roads was deemed legal as there is no expectation of privacy in public spaces. However, in Karo, tracking in private residences was considered a violation of privacy. The Court declared that indiscriminate monitoring of property withdrawn from public view poses a serious threat to privacy interests in the home and requires Fourth Amendment oversight. In the case of United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court ruled that attaching and tracking a GPS device on a vehicle constituted a Fourth Amendment search due to trespass. This decision was based on a property-based approach to defining a \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court's focus on whether attaching a tracking device constitutes a trespass triggering Fourth Amendment protections may not directly apply to drone surveillance. However, alternative frameworks proposed by Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor, in separate concurring opinions, suggest broader implications for domestic UAV use. Justice Alito argued that long-term GPS monitoring for most offenses violates privacy expectations, while Justice Sotomayor highlighted concerns about secret monitoring of individuals' movements. The Supreme Court's focus on tracking individuals for extended periods to gather detailed information about them may determine if surveillance constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. Law enforcement near American borders has more leeway for surveillance due to the government's interest in border protection from illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and potential threats. Federal law enforcement agencies have significant search powers at the border to prevent illegal entry of aliens and goods into the United States. Immigration officers can conduct warrantless searches of vessels near the border, while customs officers can search vehicles and persons suspected of carrying unlawful goods. The Supreme Court recognizes the government's interest in border protection from threats and illegal activities. The government has significant search powers at the international border to prevent illegal entry. Routine searches do not require reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or a warrant, and can include pat downs, drug sniffing dogs, and luggage inspections. Non-routine searches, such as strip searches, require reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. The Fourth Amendment balance of reasonableness is different at the border compared to other locations. The Court has shown reticence in granting law enforcement unfettered discretion to conduct searches near the border. In Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, a suspicionless search conducted 25 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border was deemed impermissible by the Court. The baseline rule in Fourth Amendment cases is that police must obtain a warrant for searches, except in limited instances. The Supreme Court has loosened the warrant requirement for searches in cases where individualized suspicion would hinder addressing health and safety concerns. This allows law enforcement to conduct suspicionless general searches in certain instances. The Supreme Court has allowed suspicionless searches in specific locations or activities based on a generalized government interest. These searches have been conducted at national borders, private businesses, and police roadblocks. The Court has balanced government interest against individual privacy to determine the legality of these searches, such as sobriety checkpoints for drunk driving. However, drug interdiction checkpoints have been deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled that suspicionless searches, like drug interdiction checkpoints, violate the Fourth Amendment. Justice O'Connor warned against allowing such intrusions to become routine in American life. The constitutionality of domestic drone surveillance depends on factors like location, technology sophistication, and surveillance duration, which will determine if it constitutes an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. Surveillance of individuals in their homes using advanced technology may violate the Fourth Amendment, as seen in the case of Kyllo. The use of high-tech equipment like UAVs with powerful cameras and thermal imaging by law enforcement could be considered a search under the Fourth Amendment. However, simple cameras or less sophisticated technology may not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. The Fourth Amendment may not protect individuals from surveillance in their homes if illegal activity is in plain view. It is uncertain if the area surrounding a home, like a backyard or porch, would have similar protections from aerial surveillance. Cases like Riley and Ciraolo suggest that aerial surveillance near a home may not always be protected under the Fourth Amendment. Based on aerial surveillance cases like Riley and Ciraolo, drone surveillance of public places may not require a warrant or suspicion. The Supreme Court has stated that police aerial surveillance at certain altitudes does not violate the Fourth Amendment. However, the rarity of drone flights may distinguish them from piloted aircraft surveillance. The rarity of drone flights in U.S. airspace, with only around 300 licenses issued by the FAA, may impact individuals' expectation of privacy from drone surveillance in public places. This rarity could be a factor in determining the legitimacy of privacy concerns in court. The federal government's authority to use unmanned aircraft near U.S. borders is at its maximum to protect citizens from external harm. The Supreme Court is likely to show deference to the use of UAVs for border security, as drone surveillance is considered more passive and less likely to violate Fourth Amendment requirements compared to active searches. Drone surveillance does not involve physical manipulation or seizure of individuals. The Supreme Court has shown reticence in giving law enforcement unlimited search power at the border, as seen in cases like Almeida-Sanchez v. United States and United States v. Brignoni-Ponce. It is uncertain if this reticence would apply to drone surveillance along the border if it becomes more widespread. Courts may consider the technology used by UAVs in determining individuals' privacy expectations. Technological advancements make it easier to gather personal information without consent. As surveillance technology advances, people's privacy may be affected. Justices Scalia and Alito have commented on how technology can impact privacy rights, questioning the limits of technology's power to shrink guaranteed privacy. The Katz test assumes a stable set of privacy expectations, but technology can change them. New technology may offer convenience or security at the cost of privacy, leading to shifts in public attitudes. The key question is whether drones can be more invasive than traditional surveillance methods. Some have questioned the difference between using digital platforms on drones compared to traditional aircraft or lampposts for surveillance, such as tracking license plates with automatic readers. While federal courts have ruled that there is no expectation of privacy in license plate numbers, the constitutionality of using these readers on drones has not been addressed. The use of ALPRs on drones raises questions about their constitutionality due to the unique privacy threats posed by drone technology. Drones, like Lockheed Martin's Stalker, can fly longer and track targets continuously for extended periods, potentially compromising privacy rights. Drones' ability to closely monitor individuals for extended periods raises significant constitutional concerns, especially compared to traditional surveillance technologies. The sophistication of drone technology, such as facial recognition capabilities, may present new challenges in terms of privacy rights and warrant requirements. The sophistication of surveillance technology in drones, like facial recognition and laser radar, raises questions about Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Drones can bypass practical privacy safeguards that limited police presence in the past. This is similar to the concerns raised about GPS technology in United States v. Jones. The use of drones in surveillance technology allows for cheaper and more surreptitious monitoring, evading traditional constraints on law enforcement practices. This inexpensive technology may reduce budgetary concerns and increase the duration and pervasiveness of surveillance, potentially impacting Fourth Amendment analysis. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. Cuevas-Sanchez that video surveillance by law enforcement at a suspect's home was considered a search under the Fourth Amendment. The surveillance led to the arrest of the defendant for drug trafficking after drugs were observed being removed from cars in his yard. The defendant tried to suppress the evidence, arguing the warrant was defective. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. Cuevas-Sanchez that video surveillance at a suspect's home was a search under the Fourth Amendment. Drones, with their ability to conduct prolonged surveillance, may impact the legality of warrantless drone surveillance. The key question is whether the drone surveillance constitutes a search, considering factors like the area searched, technology used, and societal expectations of privacy. The Supreme Court may uphold drone surveillance without individualized suspicion for purposes other than strict law enforcement, as they are hesitant to interfere with the executive's function in protecting public health and safety. If drone surveillance is deemed a search, a court would consider the need for a warrant, exceptions, and level of suspicion required. The Supreme Court may defer to law enforcement officials in the use of drones for purposes beyond strict law enforcement, such as firefighting, search and rescue, traffic safety, and environmental protection. The Court recognizes the unique understanding and responsibility of governmental officials in utilizing limited public resources for the safety and well-being of the American population. In the 113th Congress, several bills were introduced to restrict domestic drone use and impose greater constraints than the Fourth Amendment requires, prompted by concerns over potential privacy intrusions by law enforcement and executive agencies. Congress and the President have the authority to regulate drones more than the Constitution mandates, addressing government surveillance of various private information. In the 113th Congress, Representative Austin Scott introduced the Preserving Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act of 2013 (H.R. 972) to regulate drone surveillance by federal agencies. The bill requires a warrant based on probable cause, with exceptions for specific circumstances like preventing illegal entry or imminent danger. H.R. 637, introduced by Representative Ted Poe, aims to restrict the domestic use of drones by creating a general prohibition on collecting or disclosing covered information without a warrant. Exceptions include obtaining a court-issued warrant and serving a copy on the target within 10 days of surveillance. Law enforcement obtains a court-issued order based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity for surveillance in a public area for up to 48 hours, renewable for 30 days. Notice must be given to the target within 10 days or through public notification. Border searches are allowed within 25 miles of the national border, with consent from the targeted individual or in emergencies. The targeted individual must provide written consent for border searches. In emergencies involving danger of death or serious injury, or conspiratorial activities threatening national security, law enforcement can conduct operations without a warrant, but must obtain one within 48 hours. Evidence obtained in violation of this act is inadmissible in court. H.R. 637 also requires governmental entities operating UAS to file a data collection statement with the Attorney General, detailing the purpose, data collection capabilities, retention period, citizen feedback contact, and specific unit of the entity. Under H.R. 637, the Attorney General may request the revocation of a license or certificate for failure to file a data collection statement. The bill also allows for administrative discipline against an officer who intentionally violates the act. Representative Ed Markey introduced the Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 1262), amending FAA regulations. The Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 1262) amends FAA regulations to regulate government actors' use of drones, including data collection requirements and enforcement mechanisms. It requires a study on privacy threats posed by drones, prohibits FAA from issuing licenses without a data collection statement, and lists requirements for the statement. The Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 1262) amends FAA regulations to regulate government actors' use of drones, including data collection requirements and enforcement mechanisms. It requires a data collection statement for drone licenses, detailing the use of personal information, data minimization procedures, storage duration, and privacy impact mitigation steps. The statement must also include the drone operator's contact information, a process for determining collected information about individuals, and a procedure for challenging data accuracy. The FAA would require a data minimization statement from law enforcement agencies operating drones, detailing policies to minimize data collection, destroy irrelevant data, and establish oversight procedures. Enforcement mechanisms include license revocation for non-compliance. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorney Generals have authority to enforce data collection requirements for drones. H.R. 1262 also allows for civil suits and private right of action for privacy violations. The introduction of drones raises legal and policy questions regarding government security measures and privacy expectations in the digital age. The integration of drones for domestic surveillance raises legal and policy questions about government security measures and privacy expectations in the digital age. The sophistication of drone technology may challenge traditional Fourth Amendment laws, prompting discussions on the role of Congress and the President in regulating drones in the United States."
