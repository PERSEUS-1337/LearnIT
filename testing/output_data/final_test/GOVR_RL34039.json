    "content": "The seven-year term of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer was set to end on May 16, 2007, requiring parliament to elect a successor. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lacked the two-thirds majority needed to elect a president in the first and second rounds of voting. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan named Abdullah Gul as the AKP's candidate for president on April 25, 2007. Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, AKP's candidate for president, caused a political crisis by being nominated hastily. Gul, respected for his diplomatic skills, pledged to uphold secularist principles if elected. However, his past ties to banned Islamist parties and his wife's wearing of a headscarf made him controversial among secularists. President Sezer interpreted the headscarf as a violation of the ban on wearing it in public institutions. President Sezer interpreted the headscarf as a symbol of Islamism and retrogression to pre-Ataturk reforms. The choice of President became a fight for the state's identity, with concerns about AKP's dominance in government branches due to Erdogan's influence. The President has the power to appoint key positions in the government, including the Chief of Staff of the armed forces and Constitutional Court judges, maintaining secularism. President Sezer used his veto powers to prevent the AKP from gaining more control over state power and delaying their reform and religion-favoring agendas. There was a debate on whether the opposition could restore the balance of power through parliamentary elections instead of provoking a crisis over the election of a president. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is seen as representing the historic secular elite, while the AKP is viewed as a party of the lower, new middle, and upper classes. CHP criticized Erdogan for not consulting before nominating Gul for president but did not suggest a consensus candidate themselves. Before Erdogan's nomination of Gul for the presidency, CHP leader Deniz Baykal urged other parties to boycott the first round of the vote to prevent the AKP from electing its candidate and to push for early national elections. Secularist groups organized protests against AKP dominance, leading to large demonstrations in major cities. Parliament convened for the first round of voting to elect a president on April 27, requiring two-thirds of votes in the first two rounds and a majority in subsequent rounds. The AKP held 353 seats, and Gul received 357 votes with 361 deputies present. CHP argued that a quorum of 367 attendees was required for the first round to be valid and boycotted the vote. The Turkish military, which founded the modern Turkish Republic, views itself as the protector of secular principles and has been involved in ousting civilian governments. The military oversaw the drafting of the current constitution after a 1980 coup, but the AKP government has passed reforms to reduce its influence. The Turkish military, a highly respected institution, sees separatism and Islamic fundamentalism as major threats to the state. There were concerns that the military would intervene in the election process due to the AKP's Islamist origins. General Yasar Buyukanit warned the AKP to choose a president committed to secularism, and the military emphasized its role as defenders of secularism after the first round of the presidential election. The Turkish military, defenders of secularism, issued a warning against fundamentalist events challenging the state. The government criticized the military's statement as inappropriate and an attempt to influence the Constitutional Court. Concerns arose about potential military intervention following the warning. The military's intervention following a warning against fundamentalist events raised concerns about potential coup. The Constitutional Court annulled the presidential election's first round, leading to political controversy. Erdogan criticized the ruling as a threat to democracy, likening it to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the 2000 presidential race. After failing to attain the required quorum in parliament for a replay of the presidential vote, Prime Minister Erdogan called for early national elections and proposed constitutional amendments for direct presidential elections in two rounds, a five-year term with the possibility of reelection, a reduction in parliament's term to four years, and other changes. Parliament approved the amendments, but President Sezer vetoed them, citing concerns about the regime. After President Sezer vetoed the constitutional amendments, they were passed again by parliament on June 1. Sezer referred the amendments for a national referendum to be held on October 21, while also petitioning the Constitutional Court to invalidate the package. The Court rejected the appeal on July 5, paving the way for the referendum. AKP, in power since 2002, focused on economic reforms and infrastructure development rather than an Islamist agenda. The AKP government focused on economic reforms, infrastructure development, and provided good governance with few corruption scandals. Prime Minister Erdogan was a charismatic leader. Opposition parties tried to unite before the election but the agreement was short-lived. The Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Social Democratic Party (DSP) formed an electoral coalition, with DSP securing 30 slots on CHP's electoral list. This allowed DSP to regain representation in parliament. The Nationalist Action Party (MHP) was also expected to pass the electoral threshold due to its history of representation and rising ultra-nationalism. Other smaller parties also competed in the election. The Young Party (GP) and the Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) and the Islamist/nationalist Grand Unity Party (BPP) opted not to run party lists, but fielded independent candidates to avoid the 10% threshold. Both main parties moved towards the center in their electoral lists to attract voters. Erdogan excluded 154 AKP Members of Parliament from his party's lists, mainly targeting intraparty dissidents or adherents of the fundamentalist Milli Gorus philosophy. Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of earlier banned Islamist parties, gave slots to defectors from CHP and center-right, minority figures, and intellectuals. Baykal eliminated half of CHP's deputies and placed former ANAVATAN and DYP centrists high on his lists. AKP's political machine is strong, controlling government ministries and local governments, providing social services. Non-AKP parties lacked resources but saw a more hopeful political climate post-presidential election crisis. AKP campaigned on economic performance since taking office in 2002. The AKP campaigned on its economic performance, highlighting achievements such as high growth rates, reduced inflation, increased income, exports, and foreign investment. They portrayed themselves as victims in the presidential election process due to their candidate's religious background. The party also dismissed fears of Shariah law, emphasizing their record in office. Prime Minister Erdogan criticized previous coalition governments for their ineptitude compared to AKP's single-party rule. The AKP emphasized their capable single-party rule compared to earlier coalition governments. Despite facing accusations of ineffectiveness against PKK terrorism, they stressed national unity as the best way to fight terrorism. Prime Minister Erdogan opposed an immediate incursion into northern Iraq, preferring to target terrorists at home first. The electoral crisis coincided with a spike in PKK-related violence, making terrorism the most discussed issue in the campaign. Opposition parties tried to use this to their advantage, with CHP leader Baykal criticizing Erdogan for hindering Turkey's fight against terrorism. CHP, under Baykal's leadership, failed to present alternative visions or programs during its time in opposition. The party opposed AKP initiatives, polarized the political climate, and fueled xenophobic nationalism. Despite being a self-described \"leftist\" party, CHP did not propose any programs to serve the lower classes. In the 2002 campaign, CHP seemed to campaign against religion, limiting its electoral successes geographically. The 2007 campaign for CHP focused on defending secularism and criticizing AKP's handling of terrorism. DP struggled to attract voters lost to AKP in 2002 due to issues with filling out electoral lists. DP leader Mehmet Agar's involvement in past scandals and inclusion of discredited politicians harmed the party's image. The campaign's emphasis on terrorism benefited nationalist parties more than DP. The electoral contest was complex, involving Islamists, secularists, AKP, and the military. Turkey's democratization and human rights improvements were noted. While Turkey has been democratizing and improving its human rights record, some question the democratic credentials of major contenders. AKP won 34% of the vote in 2002 but governed as if it had a majority, passing revolutionary reforms for EU membership criteria. PM Erdogan promised more democracy for Kurdish issues but adopted a hardline stance instead, facing resistance from the military and nationalists. The AKP faced resistance from the military and nationalists in launching innovative policies. They did not revise Penal Code Article 301, leading to judicial prosecutions and possibly the murder of journalist Hrant Dink. The AKP also did not attempt to lower the 10% vote threshold for entering parliament, which deprived many voters of representation. This decision was opposed by the military and nationalists, as it would allow Kurdish group DTP to enter parliament. Prime Minister Erdogan's autocratic tendencies are criticized for his lack of understanding of freedom of expression and his rush to amend the Constitution without proper consultation. The proposed amendment to lower the quorum for legislative matters and elections is seen as potentially undemocratic and controversial. The AKP's record on the role of religion in the state has raised concerns among secularists and observers. The party is suspected of infiltrating followers into various sectors and favoring Sunni believers over others. The Directorate for Religious Affairs appointed a large number of new imams without much justification. The AKP appointed 25,000 new imams without clear justification and pushed for legislation to give graduates of religious schools equal opportunities in universities. Prime Minister Erdogan faced criticism for wanting to criminalize adultery and questioning the European Court of Human Rights. The CHP, while advocating for secularism, showed limited support for democratic principles during military interference in elections. The CHP is criticized for its lack of tolerance towards Kurds and non-Muslim religious minorities, reluctance to address the headscarf issue, and failure to promote greater political participation by lowering the vote threshold. Some argue that the party exaggerates the threat of a shariah state for political gain, exacerbating divisions in the country. Deniz Baykal is noted for sharing similarities with Erdogan in their political tendencies. The AKP's historic victory in the election with 84.16% voter turnout is a significant achievement, winning by a 12% margin, the largest since 1954. Prime Minister Erdogan's leadership played a crucial role in this success, reflecting nationwide appeal and endorsement of the party's economic performance. The DP and GP failed to enter parliament due to not meeting the 10% threshold. The AKP even gained votes in traditional strongholds, showing support from various regions, including from the Kurds. The AKP's victory in the election was significant, with support from various regions, including Kurds in eastern and southeastern strongholds. Kurds appreciated AKP's public services and reforms, believing AKP would avoid military action harming their kin in northern Iraq. AKP attracted voters from all social classes, with 85.2% citing economic reasons for support. CHP mainly represented Thrace and the Aegean regions, upper classes, and university-educated. AKP is now the sole party in the center of the political spectrum in parliament. AKP's victory in the election highlighted Turkish people's preference for democracy, rejecting CHP's tactics and military intervention. Mehmet Agar resigned as DP leader, while Deniz Baykal faced calls for resignation. DSP split from CHP, independents from DTP formed a parliamentary group, and Abdullah Gul announced his candidacy for president. Abdullah Gul announced his candidacy for president, emphasizing his commitment to secularism. Despite opposition from CHP, Gul won the presidency in the third round with 330 votes on August 28. The referendum on constitutional amendments, including direct election of the president, is scheduled for October 21. On July 30, 2007, Chief of the General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit reaffirmed the Turkish Armed Forces' stance from April 12. He emphasized the military's commitment to guarding the Republic of Turkey against threats to its unity, secularism, and democracy. The Turkish Armed Forces have always maintained a resolute stance in protecting the democratic, secular, and social state of law in Turkey. Despite the absence of commanders at Gul's inauguration, relations between the President and military are showing signs of improvement. The military has a history of subtle interventions rather than direct takeovers, and views itself as the army of the people. The low profile of Mrs. Gul post-election may be aiding in this process. Turkish people voted for AKP, hoping to avoid destabilizing the economy with any intervention in the polity. Observers believe the era of coups is over, but the military is watching President Gul to ensure he upholds democratic principles. Gul's inclusive definition of secularism may influence his appointments and legislation review. The military may only act if public support for the government wanes. Prime Minister Erdogan presented his 24-member cabinet to President Gul, who approved it. The new government aims to promulgate a new constitution that conforms to European standards. Erdogan appointed Ali Babacan to replace Gul at the foreign ministry and elevated three close associates to deputy prime minister posts. State Minister Nimet Cubukcu remains the only woman in the cabinet, responsible for women, children, family, and elderly issues. Prime Minister Erdogan aims to promulgate a new constitution that conforms to European standards. He promises to keep the first four articles unchanged, including Article 2 which declares the Republic as democratic, secular, and loyal to Ataturk's nationalism. Erdogan's economic goals include raising Turks' per capita income to $10,000 by 2013 through structural reforms and job creation. He plans to implement social security reforms, privatization initiatives, and decide on relations with the IMF by May 2008. The government also plans to launch projects in the Kurdish southeast as part of its anti-terrorism policy. In foreign policy, Erdogan aims to improve relations with Iraq, including cooperating with the Baghdad government and addressing PKK terrorism. A memorandum of understanding was signed with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki, pending approval by the Iraqi parliament and cooperation from Kurdish leaders. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and KRG President Massoud Barzani support the MOU, but have not been involved in Ankara's diplomatic efforts. Turkey may consider military options if political approaches fail. Barzani vows to resist any Turkish incursion in the Qandil Mountains, where the PKK operates. Erdogan plans to push for EU membership despite challenges, focusing on domestic reforms in the short term and convincing EU skeptics in the long term. The country faces societal polarization following recent elections. Erdogan faces the challenge of promoting unity in Turkey amidst societal polarization. The AKP has been leading Turkey towards EU membership, viewing it as a way to advance democracy and limit military interference. Critics suggest the AKP's pursuit of EU membership is to restrict the role of armed forces. EU membership for Turkey is being pursued to limit military interference, with accession talks starting in 2004 under unique conditions. Despite issues like Cyprus, negotiations have continued, with Turkey not expected to join before 2014. Support for EU membership in Turkey has declined significantly in recent years. Turkish military commanders are dismissive of EU threats regarding Armenian genocide recognition and other concessions. EU demands for Kurdish and minority rights are seen as a conspiracy to divide Turkey. The EU's insistence on civilian control over the military is viewed as a threat to military prerogatives. Turkey's chances of EU membership have decreased, with growing opposition within the EU, especially for cultural and religious reasons. EU leaders oppose Turkey's membership for cultural reasons. Merkel prefers a \"privileged partnership\" but has not defined it clearly. Sarkozy made opposition to Turkey's membership a campaign issue and French people are expected to vote against it. Turkish officials reject the idea of a Mediterranean Union as a substitute for EU membership. Sarkozy has agreed to allow EU negotiations with Turkey to proceed. Sarkozy has agreed to let EU negotiations with Turkey continue if a committee defines future borders by year-end, maintaining his stance against Turkey's EU membership. European opposition to Turkey's membership is strong, with Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, and the Netherlands against it. EU criticism of Turkey during an election crisis was met with defiance, and the Turkish military's involvement was cautioned against by EU officials. The European Union emphasizes the importance of independence, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law for countries seeking membership. The EU welcomed Turkey's early election for political stability and democratic progress. German Foreign Minister expressed concerns about the military's involvement in politics and stressed the need for democratic secularism in Turkey. In his first speech after the AKP election victory, Prime Minister Erdogan vowed to relaunch EU reforms that have slowed since 2005. The Bush Administration values relations with Turkey as a critical ally for resupplying forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Turkey's role in various international security missions is also highlighted. Turkey's significance as a critical transportation and energy corridor linking the Caucasus and Central Asia to Europe, independent of Russia, is highlighted. Despite AKP's criticism of U.S. policies in Iraq and warm relations with Syria and Iran, the U.S. assessment of Turkey's importance remains unchanged. The anti-Americanism fueled by CHP and MHP, along with the U.S. government's stance on the Turkish election crisis, has led to a conclusion that stability is the priority. After the Turkish military intervention, U.S. officials expressed confidence in Turkey's democracy and constitutional processes. They emphasized the importance of resolving political issues in a manner consistent with Turkey's secular democracy. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated full support for Turkish democracy and its electoral processes. The U.S. officials supported Turkish democracy and its constitutional processes, emphasizing the importance of upholding the election results and constitutional process. The State Department warned against military interference in the constitutional process. Despite low public opinion of the U.S. in Turkey, the State Department congratulated Prime Minister Erdogan and President Bush called President Gul to affirm U.S. support. Bush called President Gul to congratulate him on his victory and affirm the U.S. commitment to a strong relationship. U.S. officials were concerned about the spillover of Turkey's domestic political crisis into its policy toward Iraq, particularly regarding the PKK. Turkish officials expressed disappointment in the lack of action against the PKK by U.S. and Iraqi forces, leading to Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq and operations in southeast Turkey. There were reports of Turkish troops massed along the border, prompting U.S. officials to call for restraint due to concerns about destabilizing effects on Iraq. Secretary of Defense Gates warned against military action, and Prime Minister Erdogan stated that parliamentary approval for an operation was not currently being considered. However, if a major terrorist attack occurs, Turkish authorities may not continue to show restraint. The United States expressed confidence in Turkey's democratic process during the presidential election. President Bush congratulated Prime Minister Erdogan on his victory and invited him to the White House. U.S. officials likely support Erdogan's diplomatic approach over military options and remain concerned about Turkish-Iranian relations. Turkey and Iran have been cooperating since 2004, targeting common opponents like the PKK and PJAK. Trade between the two countries reached $6 billion in 2006 and was expected to increase to $10 billion in 2007. The US may be concerned about a 2007 Iran-Turkey memorandum on natural gas, which could lead to a deal allowing Turkey to transport gas from Iran and Turkmenistan through the Nabucco pipeline to Austria. The Bush Administration is worried about Turkish Petroleum Corporation developing gas fields in Iran, as they aim to limit international investment in Iran's oil sector to pressure them on their nuclear program. Turkey's investment in Iran's oil sector exceeding $20 million could violate the U.S. Iran Sanctions Act. Turkish companies involved in the Turkey-Iran gas pipeline project may face sanctions. Turkey supports Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy but is concerned about a nuclear-armed Iran's regional impact. The possible House passage of H.Res. 106 on the Armenian genocide issue complicates bilateral relations. The Armenian genocide issue complicates bilateral relations between Turkey and the US, with the AKP's reaction dependent on public opinion and the need to prevent further strain in ties with Washington."
