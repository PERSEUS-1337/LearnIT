    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act\". The international law of armed conflict prohibits the use of civilians as human shields to protect lawful targets from attack. This also extends to prisoners of war, detainees, and the wounded and sick, who should not be used in an attempt to shield targets from attack. Since the 2007 takeover of Gaza by Hamas, the organization has engaged in summary executions, torture, and put civilians at constant risk. Hamas forces have repeatedly fired rockets into Israel, targeting civilian areas indiscriminately. These attacks are launched from positions within dense civilian populations, such as schools, mosques, and hospitals. Hamas tactics include using Palestinian civilians as human shields near schools, mosques, or hospitals, endangering both Israeli and Palestinian civilians. The Israel Defense Force has taken precautions to minimize civilian casualties in response to these violations. Hamas has also enlisted children to work in tunnel networks since 2010. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency discovered Hamas tunnels under schools in Gaza, posing risks to students and staff. Hamas, designated as a foreign terrorist organization, along with other armed groups, use civilians as human shields. The United States condemns Hamas for violating international law by using human shields to protect military targets. Effective action will be taken against those involved in these violations. The United States condemns Hamas for using human shields to protect military targets and calls for multilateral sanctions and measures to prevent and report the use of human shields in conflicts monitored by the United Nations.
