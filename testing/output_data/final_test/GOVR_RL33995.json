    "content": "Surface transportation congestion has increased over the past few decades, with demand expected to continue growing. Highway congestion in urban areas has significantly worsened, leading to delays for travelers. Major transit systems are facing overcrowding issues, and conflicts between freight and passenger rail trains are a concern. Average speeds in the freight rail industry have decreased, except for a brief period in the late 1990s. Ports and border crossings are also experiencing challenges due to the rise in foreign trade. Despite dramatic increases in foreign trade, concerns have arisen about congestion at ports and border crossings affecting the flow of commerce. The question remains whether congestion is a national problem and should be a focus of national transportation policy. While congestion has intensified in major metropolitan areas and trade gateways, many states and localities do not directly suffer from transportation congestion. Some argue that the extra time spent in traffic provides a break from work and family pressures. Some experts believe freeway delays are minor in the overall trip, suggesting congestion is a sign of success. Environmental organizations argue for a focus on urban sprawl and pollution rather than traffic congestion. However, many experts see transportation congestion as a major national problem that will worsen over the next 25 years. Experts highlight that congestion, while localized, has national economic effects due to the interconnected nature of the transportation network. Freight movement relies on a national network, where bottlenecks in one area can impact businesses and consumers across the country. As supply chains lengthen, national network effects become more crucial. Passenger transportation, though local, can also be affected by congestion on roads leading to airports, impacting intercity travel efficiency and business productivity. Local congestion hubs are national issues due to their significance in the national network. The economic impact of congestion is significant on a national scale, with major metropolitan areas experiencing high levels of delay accounting for a large portion of the country's income. Efficient transportation is crucial for businesses, as it affects the movement of people for work and commerce. The costs of congestion at a local level can have substantial implications for the national economy. The increasing congestion in transportation is expected to impact more people and businesses in the future, especially in smaller urban areas. Population growth and economic expansion are contributing to the rise in road traffic congestion. The Federal Highway Administration predicts a significant increase in freight movements by 2035. Despite these trends, the federal surface transportation program views congestion as a state and local issue rather than a national problem. Since the 1980s, there has been controversy over state payments to and from the Highway Trust Fund, known as the \"donor-donee\" debate. Congress tends to view congestion as a state and local issue rather than a national problem, leaving it to the discretion of states to prioritize congestion mitigation. Federal law has aimed to equalize state payments to and receipts from the Highway Trust Fund over the years. Federal law has aimed to equalize state payments to and receipts from the Highway Trust Fund over the years, with new federal programs addressing congestion being relatively modest in dollar terms. Congress may choose to continue allowing states and localities flexibility in funding transportation projects, or opt for a more aggressive approach to congestion mitigation. The overall level of transportation spending, prioritization of spending, and congestion pricing are key elements Congress may consider for congestion mitigation. Observers argue that America is underinvesting in transportation infrastructure, leading to deteriorating conditions and growing congestion. One solution proposed is to increase infrastructure investment to address the backlog of projects and future needs. The U.S. Department of Transportation assessment suggests that current government spending on highway and transit maintenance is insufficient, leading to potential decline in system conditions and increasing congestion. If total government spending is not increased, congestion, especially on highways, will continue to worsen. Alternative views suggest that government transportation spending has not been significantly deficient. The U.S. Department of Transportation assessment indicates that current government spending on highway and transit maintenance may not be adequate, leading to deteriorating performance and conditions in some areas. Despite historic spending patterns keeping pace with usage since the 1980s, the federal share has declined. Capital spending on highways per vehicle mile has remained constant, with the federal share decreasing from close to 60% to about 44% in 2004. Total government spending on transit systems also needs attention according to USDOT analysis. Total government spending on capital and operations for the nation's transit systems increased by 80% between 1980 and 2004, outpacing the growth in passenger trips. The federal share of total spending decreased from 42% to 25% during this period, with the federal government funding $36 billion of highway and transit capital expenditure in 2004. Highway conditions have generally improved over the past decade, especially in rural areas, while bridge conditions have improved more in rural areas than in urban areas. Investment in the freight rail industry has fallen behind demand, leading to congestion and higher prices for shippers. Freight rail relies on investment from profits or borrowed money, with differing views on whether future demand can be adequately met. Investment in rail infrastructure faces challenges due to risks and shareholder demands, leading to potential government financial assistance to prevent rail congestion. The private sector, including recent privatization efforts, is seen as a key source of investment in transportation. There is a call for increased investment in transportation, with suggestions for leveraging private investment through public-private partnerships. Some argue for leveraging private investment through public-private partnerships in transportation infrastructure to address congestion. Prioritizing federal investments and projects by location and type, as well as mode-neutrality, are key considerations for Congress. Continued federal transportation funding is crucial for maintaining and operating the transportation system, meeting national goals, and mitigating congestion in major metropolitan areas, intercity trade routes, and foreign trade gateways. Prioritizing federal resources in congested areas can enhance national mobility and economic productivity. An argument for targeting federal resources towards congested areas is that congestion mitigation project costs are local, but benefits are regional or national. Transportation bottlenecks are often too expensive for a single locality or state to handle. Prioritizing federal funding for congestion mitigation involves project planning and funding decisions by state DOTs and MPOs. Some argue that highway funding tends to favor rural areas over urban and suburban areas, leading to inequities in funding distribution. This is due to limitations on state gas taxes for highway projects, equal apportionments to counties regardless of needs, and local officials prioritizing their share of funding over solving congestion issues. MPOs are often more concerned about funding distribution than solving regional problems like transportation congestion. Voting power in MPOs is often not weighted by population size, leading to domination by suburban areas over center cities. Other factors influencing transportation investment decisions include stakeholder involvement requirements and local voter approval. Freight interests argue that these requirements prioritize passenger projects over freight projects. State and local officials tend to prioritize system preservation, maintenance, and operations projects over capacity expansion projects due to ease of implementation and consensus-building. Urban areas face challenges with limited space for new infrastructure and expanding old infrastructure. Choosing cost-effective congestion reduction strategies varies by location, requiring local solutions. Congress may mandate project alternatives to be selected locally. The prioritization of transportation projects can be influenced by Congress, with a focus on congestion mitigation and economic efficiency. Studies show that projects aimed at relieving congestion offer high returns, even after factoring in environmental costs. A performance-based assessment approach allows for flexibility in meeting federal goals, promoting mode neutrality in funding decisions. The difficulty in funding projects outside traditional transportation modes like freight rail or multi-modal projects has led to debates on the effectiveness of program changes. Concerns include the challenges of assessing public benefits and costs when private infrastructure providers are involved, potential substitution of public investment for private investment, and mode neutrality in congestion mitigation funding. Some argue that simply building more highways does not solve congestion issues. Some argue that building more highway capacity does not alleviate congestion as it induces more travel, leading to the same or higher levels of congestion. They suggest alternatives like public transit and land use measures to reduce congestion. However, others believe that investing in transit may not significantly reduce highway congestion due to low usage. The theory of induced demand is a key element in debates about road traffic congestion. Some argue that building more highway capacity may not alleviate congestion as it induces more travel, potentially leading to the same or higher levels of congestion. Studies show that while induced demand is real, it takes time for new capacity to be absorbed, suggesting a reduction in congestion in the medium term. However, the long-term impact is uncertain due to factors like population growth and development. Many experts argue that adding new transportation capacity may initially reduce congestion but can lead to increased travel demand in the long term. Economists suggest that congestion is a result of how transportation services are rationed, with peak-period roadway space being in high demand due to the need for face-to-face interactions. It is believed that road traffic congestion could be alleviated by implementing different strategies. Road traffic congestion can be reduced by using various rationing methods such as limiting roadway space to certain vehicles or implementing congestion pricing. Supporters of congestion pricing argue that it not only solves congestion but also promotes efficient use of highway infrastructure. Detractors believe that road pricing may favor higher-income drivers, cause mobility issues where alternatives are limited, and lead to more sprawl and congestion in urban areas. Congestion pricing aims to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas by charging drivers for road usage. Critics argue that drivers already pay for infrastructure through taxes, making congestion pricing a form of double taxation. Transit demand in cities is concentrated, leading to overcrowding and slower speeds. Despite this, most transit agencies do not differentiate fares based on peak/off-peak service. Peak/off-peak service fares are not differentiated by most transit agencies, leading to overcrowding. Higher peak-period fares could help cover costs and reduce demand, but concerns exist about pushing users to drive instead. Freight rail transportation already uses rates to manage supply and demand. Rates in freight rail transportation are used to manage supply and demand, with strong demand leading to increased rates. Improved productivity and strong demand have significantly improved the financial health of the railroad industry since deregulation, allowing for investments in expanding capacity. However, there are concerns about the industry's ability to meet future demands. The railroad industry has concerns about its ability to invest in new capacity to meet increasing demand. They face challenges in acquiring land for expansion in congested urban areas and argue that they bear more financial burdens compared to other transportation modes. The railroad industry argues that they pay more in taxes and fees compared to other modes of transportation, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. They also face industry-specific laws that increase their costs. Despite financial improvements, they struggle to earn enough to cover capital costs, limiting their ability to compete for financing. Public policy alternatives include imposing higher taxes on truck and barge companies to level the playing field or providing government assistance to railroads. The debate revolves around providing government assistance to railroads to increase investment and accelerate pace, while some argue for railroads to contribute more to solving issues like highway congestion. Railroads' contributions to grade crossing improvements are minimal, and there are concerns about the costs of compliance with regulations. Some argue that complying with regulations has increased project costs since the 1960s, including direct compliance costs and project delays. While these laws serve a purpose, many want to reduce unnecessary duplication of effort and coordination problems. Congestion in the early 20th century referred to overcrowded trolley lines and downtown streets filled with pedestrians and horse-drawn vehicles. During the early 20th century, transportation congestion was mainly due to road traffic congestion caused by the rapid increase in motor vehicle ownership. Efforts to address this issue included significant road-building projects by governments. However, road traffic congestion was temporarily alleviated during the Great Depression and World War II when automobile use was discouraged, leading to a boom in public transit ridership. After the war, car ownership and motor vehicle travel increased, reigniting concerns about road traffic congestion. After World War II, motor vehicle travel increased rapidly, leading to concerns about road traffic congestion. President Eisenhower pushed for the Interstate Highway Program to address congestion, creating urban interstates despite his preference for bypasses. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 and the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 expanded road capacity and established the Highway Trust Fund. By the end of 1974, 36,000 miles of the 42,500 mile system were complete. Road capacity and motor vehicle travel grew together from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s. In the 1970s, highway transportation issues shifted to energy, air quality, and safety. However, road capacity growth slowed as the interstate system neared completion and maintenance costs increased. Motor vehicle travel continued to rise steadily despite these challenges. In the 1980s, road traffic congestion increased due to new environmental laws, making building new capacity more expensive and time-consuming. Public transportation ridership declined significantly after World War II, with transit trips dropping from 23.4 billion to 6.5 billion by the early 1970s. Many streetcar systems were replaced by diesel buses, and public authorities took over privately owned transit systems. However, public transportation has seen a resurgence in recent years. Public transportation has undergone a resurgence since the mid-1970s with the building of new rail systems, including light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail. Transit ridership increased modestly to about 10 billion trips in 2005, but the proportion of trips made on transit declined by half between 1969 and 2001. Peak-period transit overcrowding has become an issue in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Boston, leading to proposals for higher fares at busy times and stations. Public transportation has seen a resurgence since the mid-1970s with the construction of new rail systems. Transit ridership increased modestly to about 10 billion trips in 2005, but the proportion of trips made on transit declined by half between 1969 and 2001. Peak-period transit overcrowding has become a problem in major cities, leading to proposals for higher fares at busy times and stations. Congestion on roads also affects bus riders, as most transit buses do not run on roads with controlled access. Freight transportation faced issues due to antiquated federal regulations until deregulation in the late 1970s sparked a major reorganization across modes. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated the railroad industry, allowing major railroads to abandon lines or sell them to non-Class I railroads. This led to a significant drop in track mileage owned by Class I railroads from 271,000 in 1980 to 162,000 in 2006. Non-Class I railroad mileage has grown modestly since then. Railroads have seen growth in non-Class I railroad mileage since 2006, allowing them to move more freight efficiently with technological advancements. Deregulation in the trucking industry, such as the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, has led to increased competition, lower prices, and higher-quality service. \"Deregulation facilitated the shift towards coordinated logistics by integrating distinct activities and removing barriers between carriers. Industry consolidation and improved productivity allowed for the introduction of new technologies and innovative services, such as trailer-on-flatcar networks. This has enabled cheaper and more timely deliveries, leading to cost savings for shippers through longer and more complex supply chains and reduced inventories.\" The importance of transportation in coordinated logistics has increased due to the growth in foreign trade, with waterborne merchandise trade nearly tripling between 1970 and 2006. This growth has led to pressure on transportation networks serving gateways in urban centers with high levels of road traffic. The efficiency gains from deregulation in transportation have plateaued, leading to increasing logistics costs for U.S. businesses. Rail lines and terminals are operating at full capacity, causing congestion and delays, especially in urban areas with high freight and passenger traffic. The focus of federal surface transportation policy in the 20th century was on road connectivity and capacity, especially in urban areas with high freight and passenger traffic. This included addressing road congestion, truck driver availability, and fuel costs. Federal transit funding in the 1960s aimed to alleviate road traffic congestion, while a reassessment of surface transportation policy occurred in the 1980s as road congestion continued to increase. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was a result of a reassessment of surface transportation policy due to growing congestion. Some policymakers viewed road capacity building as ineffective in addressing urban road traffic congestion. Senator Daniel Moynihan highlighted that adding to highway capacity did not alleviate traffic congestion. Adding to highway capacity is no longer seen as a solution for increased highway efficiency due to concerns about air pollution and the need to prioritize maintaining and improving the current highway system. Congressional leaders are focusing on enhancing the efficiency of the existing transportation system through measures such as highway system maintenance, increased transit funding, funding flexibility, intermodalism, state and metropolitan planning, and advanced technologies. The new surface transportation bill, known as ISTEA, focused on improving operations with advanced technologies, safety, energy efficiency, and pollution control. It also required the designation of a National Highway System to prioritize federal help for heavily traveled routes. The development of ISTEA emphasized flexibility for states and localities to address local transportation problems. The House Public Works and Transportation Committee report highlighted the need to relieve congestion in urban and suburban America while addressing the mobility and access needs of Rural America through the new surface transportation system. The Surface Transportation Program (STP) allowed flexibility in funding allocation for highway capital projects or transit based on specific conditions. Flexibility was also provided for switching funds between different parts of the highway system to cater to the needs of congested urban areas or rural areas experiencing economic growth. ISTEA authorized a substantial increase in federal transit funding, including funds from the Surface Transportation Program (STP) and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program (CMAQ). The funding aimed to reduce pollutants by decreasing motor vehicle travel, particularly single-occupant vehicle travel, in congested areas. The CMAQ program funded transit and traffic flow improvement projects to reduce pollution and congestion. Traditional congestion relief projects like new road capacity were prohibited due to Clean Air Act requirements. About 44% of CMAQ funds went to transit projects and 33% to traffic flow improvements. ISTEA introduced intermodalism and other congestion-related federal program innovations. ISTEA introduced intermodalism, emphasizing planning and financing projects to enhance transportation links between modes. It required considering transportation systems as a whole, involving all stakeholders, and funding highway operations, including the Intelligent Transportation Systems Program. ISTEA authorized $660 million over six years, enhanced metropolitan coordination for transportation development, funded up to five projects in the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, and designated the National Highway System (NHS) in consultations between USDOT and states. The NHS Act included provisions for new financing mechanisms like the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) pilot program and GARVEE bonds, which allowed for bond financing of intermodal projects. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) maintained these programs with increased funding. TEA-21 increased funding by 40% from ISTEA, allocating $177 billion for highways and $41 billion for transit. Programs like CMAQ and ITS were retained and expanded, with new programs like CVISN established to improve commercial vehicle operations. The CVISN program targeted safety information exchange, credentials administration, and electronic screening. The Value Pricing Pilot Program received increased funding under TEA-21, along with the creation of new programs like TIFIA and RRIF for innovative financing. TIFIA provided credit assistance for large projects, while RRIF offered loan guarantees for railroads. Additionally, new infrastructure grant programs were established. Two new infrastructure grant programs, the National Corridor Planning and Development Program and the Coordinated Border and Infrastructure Program, were created and jointly funded at $140 million per year for FY1999 through FY2003. The first aimed at economic development and the second at alleviating congestion at borders. The legislative proposal from the House of Representatives in the 108th Congress included innovative provisions for congestion relief, such as the Motor Vehicle Congestion Relief Program. The House of Representatives in the 108th Congress proposed innovative provisions for congestion relief, including the Motor Vehicle Congestion Relief Program and increased funding for ITS technologies. H.R. 3550 would have authorized $4 billion for ITS technologies during FY2004-FY2009, with $3 billion for expedited deployment. Additionally, a new $6.6 billion program called Projects of National and Regional Significance was proposed to fund high-cost facilities. The House proposed a bill called Projects of National and Regional Significance to fund high-cost facilities, including freight rail projects. It also included a Freight Intermodal Connectors program and a Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program to improve intermodal freight transportation and infrastructure at inland ports. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act\u2014A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA) was signed into law in the 109th Congress, providing a 31% increase in transportation funding totaling $286.4 billion over six years. It largely retains the structure of surface transportation programs from ISTEA, with a focus on core highway programs. SAFETEA, signed into law in the 109th Congress, increased transportation funding by 31% to $286.4 billion over six years. It focuses on core highway programs, with the new Real-Time System Management Information Program aimed at reducing congestion. ITS funding is integrated into core programs, while CMAQ funding is increased for projects impacting congestion. SAFETEA, signed into law in the 109th Congress, increased transportation funding by 31% to $286.4 billion over six years. It provides states with more flexibility in using tolls to reduce congestion. The Value Pricing Pilot Program was reauthorized at a higher level, and provisions were made for pilot projects testing tolling on existing facilities. The Projects of National or Regional Significance program was created with funding set at $1.779 billion for FY2005 through FY2009. The Freight Intermodal Connectors program was dropped before final approval. The SAFETEA legislation increased transportation funding by 31% to $286.4 billion over six years. It allowed for more flexibility in using tolls to reduce congestion and reauthorized the Value Pricing Pilot Program. The Freight Intermodal Connectors program was dropped, but the Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Program remained with $30 million authorized through FY2009. The Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program was reauthorized as a new apportioned program with $833 million in funding from FY2005 to FY2009. Various innovative funding provisions were extended and modified, including reducing the minimum project size for TIFIA projects and broadening the use of SIBs and Private Activity bonds. The RRIF was expanded to $35 billion in loans, with $7 billion reserved for non-Class I railroads. The SAFETEA legislation increased transportation funding by 31% to $286.4 billion over six years, allowing for more flexibility in toll usage to reduce congestion. It also added priorities for using loans to enhance rail infrastructure capacity and alleviate bottlenecks. A new federal grant program was introduced for relocating rail tracks that interfere with motor vehicle traffic, addressing transportation congestion caused by excess demand exceeding capacity. This can lead to decreased service quality, higher costs, and increased stress for drivers. Congestion in public transit can lead to vehicle overcrowding, slower speeds, and higher fares. Intermodal connections are crucial for service quality, and inefficiencies can cause delays and disruptions. Transportation congestion should be carefully defined to address issues like delayed transfers and peak-period traffic. Transportation congestion is best measured by how excess demand affects passenger trips or freight shipments. While express carriers like UPS and FedEx can monitor movements for business purposes, public policy typically focuses on service problems within a mode. Measures of congestion often concentrate on specific transportation facilities, especially in highway transportation. Highway engineers focus on speed and level of service on road segments, which are aggregated to measure systemwide congestion. However, facility-specific congestion measures may not accurately reflect capacity problems across the entire transportation system. Some experts argue that the emphasis on facility congestion overlooks the impact on passenger and freight trips. For example, freeway congestion may seem less severe when considering the entire commute trip, including parking and walking to the office. Similarly, freight bottlenecks may not have as significant an impact as perceived. The impact of freight bottlenecks may not be as severe as believed when considering the entire supply chain. Transportation congestion measures often overlook the land-use context and focus on mobility rather than accessibility. Despite being congested, places like Manhattan offer access to numerous opportunities. For example, a study in Minneapolis showed that while traffic congestion increased, access to opportunities by car also improved. In the 1990s, access to job opportunities by car increased despite congestion data suggesting otherwise. National data lacks the ability to analyze congestion's impact on accessibility and intermodal connections. Current congestion measures are limited and do not fully capture capacity utilization in freight rail and public transit. Efforts to define and measure road traffic congestion have increased over the past few decades, but it remains difficult to measure at the national level due to the size and diversity of the highway system. The Urban Mobility Program at the Texas Transportation Institute defines traffic congestion as an excess of demand in relation to supply, leading to slower travel speeds. The Texas Transportation Institute defines traffic congestion as an excess of demand in relation to supply, resulting in slower travel speeds. TTI calculates travel speeds based on roadway capacity and vehicle numbers, using data from FHWA's Highway Performance Monitoring System. Travel delay is measured as the extra time taken for a trip, with the travel time index indicating the ratio of peak period travel time to free-flow conditions. TTI is also working on measures of travel time reliability to assess variability in travel times. Travel time reliability is crucial for travelers and shippers, measured by the Buffer Time Index (BTI) to account for variability in travel times. A BTI of 43% means adding 43% extra time to ensure on-time arrival for 95% of trips. Reliability is often prioritized over average delay, as most commuters prefer a daily 5-minute buffer over a weekly unexpected delay of 50 minutes causing issues with punctuality. Travel time reliability is essential for travelers and shippers, prioritizing predictability over speed. The Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) aggregates road segment estimates in urban areas to measure delay and reliability. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) uses similar measures to examine congestion on major travel corridors like Interstate routes. In this research program, FHWA is using GPS data from trucks to measure urban road traffic congestion. TTI's previous methods did not directly measure congestion, leading to criticisms about the accuracy of their estimates. TTI has since started including variables like operational improvements and public transit in their models, but concerns remain about the indirect nature of their congestion estimates. Estimation of congestion by comparing traffic speeds to free-flow conditions is problematic due to the inability to fully account for induced traffic. Eliminating congestion for all peak-period travelers is unrealistic due to overwhelming costs. Using free-flow speed in congestion calculations can lead to unrealistic results, such as increased congestion after road improvements. A small change in average conditions can also impact congestion levels. A small change in average conditions, like a decrease in speed, can significantly impact congestion for many drivers. Research shows that maximum vehicle throughput occurs at speeds below free-flow, around 50 mph. As traffic volume increases on a freeway, throughput rises to 1,800 vehicles per lane per hour, while average speeds drop by 10 to 15 mph. This leads to capacity being overwhelmed and further congestion. The volume of vehicles on the road increases, causing speeds to decline and congestion to worsen. Critics argue that estimating congestion based on free-flow conditions overstates its impact. Despite criticisms, TTI's estimates of urban road traffic congestion are widely used for monitoring changes over time. However, figures quantifying time lost and monetary value should be viewed skeptically. Roadway demand plays a significant role in congestion. Roadway demand and capacity are subject to short-term and long-term variations. Demand varies by day, time, and season, as well as in response to special events. Road traffic congestion is highest on weekday mornings and evenings due to trips for work and school. Roadway capacity is defined by facility type, condition, and events that may reduce capacity temporarily. Urban road traffic congestion is mainly caused by capacity problems and poor signal timing. Temporary capacity loss accounts for 55% of congestion. Urban road traffic congestion is mainly caused by capacity problems and poor signal timing. Temporary capacity loss, incidents, weather, work zones, and other events contribute to congestion. Total travel delay has increased five-fold from 1982 to 2005, with delay per peak-period traveler nearly tripling. Delay increases with city size, but small urban areas have experienced faster growth in delay. Morning and evening rush periods have lengthened, and a greater share of roadways are congested. In the Louisville metropolitan area, road congestion has increased from 35% in 1982 to 52% in 2005, with rush hours rising from 4.2 to 7.2 hours per day. The top 10 urban areas account for half of total delay, with Los Angeles experiencing the most delay in 2005. Urban road traffic congestion has grown due to rapid motor vehicle travel outpacing road capacity improvements. Motor vehicle travel has rapidly increased in urban areas, outstripping road capacity improvements. Between 1982 and 2005, daily vehicle miles traveled on freeways grew by 128% and by 77% on arterials, while lane-miles only increased by 41% and 37% respectively. This growth is attributed to factors such as population, job, and vehicle availability increases, especially in suburban areas. The increase in motor vehicle travel in urban areas has led to congestion on roads, especially in low-density suburban areas where public transit is limited. Suburb-to-suburb commutes are now the most common, with 77% of people driving alone to work in 2005. The number of personal vehicles per driver has surpassed 1.0, with an average of 1.16 vehicles per driver in 2005. The availability of motor vehicles, low gasoline prices, and lack of public transit options have contributed to the reliance on cars for transportation. The pump price of gasoline was below $2.00 per gallon for about 20 years starting in the mid-1980s, leading to increased demand for commercial truck transportation. Truck traffic has grown faster than passenger traffic since 1980, with half of truck mileage in urban areas causing congestion near industrial facilities, ports, and border crossings. Population growth is expected to reach 364 million by 2030, contributing to continued growth in vehicle travel and congestion. The CBO projects a 70% increase in GDP by 2030, with significant population growth and new road traffic expected in seven states. VMT growth is estimated to be 1.92% annually, with rural areas growing faster than urban areas. Freight tonnage by truck is projected to double by 2035. Counter trends like the aging workforce may slow VMT growth and peak-period travel. Baby boomers retiring may slow worker growth. Some suggest they may prefer denser neighborhoods with transit, reducing VMT growth. Flexible schedules like telecommuting could also decrease work travel. FHWA study shows urban areas experience most traffic congestion. Rural travel has grown faster than urban travel in the past 25 years. Estimates by FHWA in 2002 and a projection to 2035 show a widespread congestion problem on the National Highway System. By 2035, congestion is expected to intensify in urban areas and spread to intercity corridors. Studies have identified 233 major highway bottlenecks in 2002, a 40% increase from 1999. In 2004, there were 233 major bottlenecks, with 24 causing over 10 million hours of delay. Freeway interchanges contribute most to bottleneck delays. Truck-related bottlenecks led to 243 million hours of delay. A study ranked the top 25 destinations for traffic delays in 2005. Foreign trade gateways face pressure due to rapid growth in international trade. International merchandise trade increased by 160% between 1980 and 2005. The growth in international merchandise trade increased by 160% between 1980 and 2005, with rapid growth on the Mexican and Canadian borders and the Pacific Coast. The FHWA expects foreign trade tonnage to double between 2002 and 2035. Studies have found delays at heavily used crossings, with average wait times ranging from 7.3 to 25 minutes in 2004. Delays at land border crossings and water ports are caused by various factors such as inadequate infrastructure, import processing, and security requirements. Institutional and staff issues, like inspection staffing levels, also contribute to delays. Balancing passenger and freight mobility with heightened security post-9/11 is a major challenge at international gateways. The main public transit modes in the United States\u2014bus, commuter rail, heavy rail, and light rail\u2014have different characteristics that influence congestion. Transit buses are affected by road traffic congestion, light rail systems may have conflicts with road traffic, commuter rail shares lines with freight and intercity trains, and heavy rail systems have their own rights of way. Subway systems have their own rights of way and are not subject to conflicts with other modes, but congestion can occur at peak periods. Transit ridership grew significantly between 1980 and 2005, with bus ridership remaining unchanged, while commuter rail and heavy rail saw increases. Light rail ridership nearly tripled due to the construction of new systems, with transit usage concentrated in large urban areas. Only 34 metropolitan areas have major forms of rail transit. In 2004, 10 metropolitan areas, including New York, accounted for 75% of all urban transit trips in the United States. There are indirect measures of public transportation congestion like average vehicle utilization and operating speeds. Only 34 metropolitan areas have major forms of rail transit. The USDOT notes that changes in capacity utilization of rail vehicles affect operating speeds. Urban transit systems show highest passenger volumes on rail, especially commuter rail due to longer trip lengths. Utilization rates have declined since 2000/2001. Average speed has shown little change for non-rail modes, mainly buses. The average speed of non-rail modes, mainly buses, slightly increased from 13.7 to 14.0 mph between 1995 and 2004, while rail speeds declined from 26.6 to 25.0 mph. Anecdotal evidence suggests overcrowding issues on some rail transit systems like Washington's Metro and Boston's T, indicating that national average data may not fully capture congestion in certain cities at certain times. The rail network consists of mainlines, spurs, yards, and intermodal terminals, with added complexity from tunnels, bridges, and grade crossings. The railroad infrastructure, primarily owned by private companies, includes different clearances, grade crossings, and track miles. Freight trains share space with passenger trains in some areas. Capacity issues on railroads are controlled by individual companies, leading to different congestion measures compared to highways. Government does not collect detailed congestion data for the private rail system. In the rail industry, congestion indicators include freight rates, which can be affected by various factors like competition and regulation. Capacity problems can lead to service quality deterioration or even denial of access to the network for some shipments. In some cases, shipments may be denied access to the rail system, leading to increased delay and unreliability as the system nears maximum capacity. The complexity of coordinating trains with different dimensions and commodities, along with unforeseen incidents like accidents and bad weather, can disrupt tight schedules. Passenger trains, which have priority by federal law, can also interfere with freight trains. Publicly available measures track freight rail congestion. Publicly available measures of freight rail congestion include traffic density, speed, and freight rates. These measures are influenced by factors like efficiency gains from technology improvements. Traffic density indicates the utilization efficiency of the railroad track infrastructure, with higher figures potentially signaling congestion risk. Speed can be measured by average train speed or freight speed, with slower speeds possibly indicating congestion. Average cost is measured by freight revenue per ton-mile, which has been declining due to productivity growth. Since rail deregulation in 1980, Class I rail freight ton-miles have increased 93%, from 919 billion to 1,772 billion, while miles of track have decreased 40%. Traffic density, average freight speed, and freight rates all suggest a growing congestion problem in the industry, supported by anecdotal evidence of trip times and bottlenecks. The average speed of freight moved by rail has declined since the 1980s, with trip times increasing by 25%-50% over the past decade. Average freight rates have decreased substantially since deregulation but have shown a recent increase, with rates in 2006 being 14% higher than in 2003. It is unclear if this indicates a new upward trend in rates or how it relates to capacity. Freight rail congestion is limited to key locations, with 3% of the network at or above capacity and 9% near capacity. Major bottlenecks include Chicago, Kansas City, Atlanta, and Memphis, as well as rail corridors from San Francisco to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to Tucson. In Chicago, congestion is worsened by lack of connectivity between different railroads. Intercity passenger train travel faces similar congestion issues. Amtrak's intercity passenger trains operate on rail lines owned by freight railroads, leading to conflicts between freight and passenger trains. Issues include speed restrictions, train breakdowns, and congestion affecting on-time performance, delays, and ticket availability. Amtrak faces challenges with ticket availability, prices, and train overcrowding, especially on certain routes like the NEC during holidays. While systemwide issues are not common, data shows increasing rail congestion but not train overcrowding. Amtrak delays have been rising since FY2001, mainly due to freight operations. Amtrak delays have been increasing due to freight operations, with on-time performance decreasing from 74.1% in FY2003 to 67.8% in FY2006. Load factors are low, indicating little train overcrowding. Transportation congestion has economic and environmental impacts, causing stress and environmental damage. The available evidence does not clearly show if the damage from slowing or stopped vehicles outweighs the reduction in crash severity due to lower speeds. The main effects include increased direct user costs, economic distortions that decrease productivity, and limited information on costs associated with rail, transit, and intermodal congestion. Existing estimates focusing only on road traffic congestion underestimate the total cost of transportation congestion to the national economy. Time is a crucial variable in transportation evaluation studies. The direct user costs of road traffic congestion are the extra time and fuel expended to complete a trip. TTI estimates that drivers lost 4.2 billion hours to congestion, wasting 2.9 billion gallons of fuel, costing $78.2 billion. Per traveler, the annual cost is $710 or approximately $3 per work day. The cost of congestion has risen from $14.9 billion in 1982. Additional economic costs include logistics costs. The economic costs of congestion include logistics costs, market scale and accessibility costs, and business costs of worker commuting. These costs result from slower transportation, reduced demand, higher unit costs, and worker compensation for longer commutes. Other modes of transportation also experience increased costs due to rising rates and a shift towards more lucrative intermodal shipments. The shift towards more lucrative intermodal shipments is causing problems for bulk shippers who rely on rail transportation. Congestion on the rail system may lead to more freight moving by truck. Moving freight by rail has public benefits like reducing air pollution compared to trucking. Congestion in passenger and public transportation may divert travelers to other modes, leading to more road congestion in urban areas. Congested intercity rail transportation may shift some travelers to other modes like buses or airplanes. The cost of congestion is often quantified in terms of GDP share, but this approach has limitations. Estimates based on \"free-flowing traffic\" exaggerate congestion levels, leading to inflated cost figures. Eliminating congestion would only save travelers a few minutes on peak trips, not a significant windfall as suggested. Experts question the accuracy of total cost calculations. Experts question the accuracy of total cost calculations for congestion and suggest focusing on the change in cost brought about by specific projects or policies. Three strategies for reducing congestion include adding new capacity, operating existing capacity more efficiently, and managing demand. Institutional issues affecting congestion remedies are also discussed, along with rail congestion remedies and intermodalism in freight transportation. Adding new road capacity is one approach to reducing congestion, with proponents arguing that it has lagged behind motor vehicle travel growth. TTI's analysis shows that increasing road capacity can slow travel delay growth, ranging from new freeways to bottleneck reduction projects. However, there is debate on whether new road capacity alone can solve congestion issues without tolling pricing. Highway travel has outpaced capacity growth in recent decades, leading to disagreements on the effectiveness of new road projects. Adding new road capacity can help reduce congestion, but there are concerns about induced demand, costs, and time needed for planning and construction. Some experts argue that once congestion develops, it is difficult to build new capacity quickly enough. Others suggest that improving public transportation is a key solution to urban road traffic issues. Public transportation is a major solution to urban road traffic congestion. If public transit service disappeared, delay in urban areas would increase by 541 million hours, with 80% of the extra delay occurring in very large urban areas. Currently, only about 5% of workers commute by transit, but in New York and Chicago, more than 10% of commuters use transit. Transit is more popular for certain types of commutes, especially from suburb to central city. Transit options can help reduce road traffic congestion, especially in large urban areas. Dedicated bus lanes or non-highway modes of transit are effective solutions. However, transit may not reduce congestion in smaller urban areas or suburbs due to large areas to cover and low residential and job densities. New transit systems have improved travel options but have not significantly reduced congestion, especially in fast-growing regions where demand overwhelms capacity. Some argue that peak-period congestion persists because not enough people switch to transit. Peak-period road traffic congestion may not be reduced by switching from road to rail due to induced car travel at convenient times and many rail riders being former bus riders. Transit capacity, like new highway capacity, is costly but can offer social and environmental benefits. New rail systems are expensive, with light rail being a cheaper alternative. Commuter rail capacity costs depend on existing infrastructure. The cost of new commuter rail capacity depends on the availability of the existing freight rail network. Proponents of expanded transit capacity suggest bus rapid transit (BRT) as a more viable alternative due to high start-up costs. State and local DOTs focus on operational improvements to address congestion, including strategies like transportation management centers, incident management, ramp metering, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies. Operational strategies for reducing congestion rely on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies and transportation management centers. These strategies are quicker to implement and low-cost compared to major construction projects. Evaluations show that the benefits of these centers outweigh the costs, with minimal disruptions. However, they require a greater ongoing commitment from local and state DOTs. Demand management strategies, such as congestion pricing and HOV lanes, aim to reduce congestion by removing a few cars to make a big difference. For example, London's congestion charge reduced traffic by 15% and congestion by 30%. Congestion pricing is a method to charge drivers for traveling on congested roads. Economists believe it is the most effective way to reduce highway congestion. There are four main forms of road congestion pricing: variably priced lanes, variable tolls on entire roadways, cordon charges, and variable areawide charge pricing. Cordon pricing, like in London, charges a fee for entering an area at certain times. Facility-based pricing charges a fee to use a specific facility based on time and traffic levels. Variable areawide pricing tracks vehicle usage to charge for travel and facility types. Congestion pricing uses tracking technology to charge for travel and facility usage in a specific area. It helps manage demand, reduces delays, and can lead to positive effects like lower air pollution. It also provides revenue for transportation facilities. However, congestion pricing schemes are often criticized for discriminating against low-income drivers, even though research shows that the toll burden is higher for them. Congestion pricing can be controversial as it may disproportionately affect low-income drivers. Critics argue that tolls should only be for new capacity to prevent sprawl and traffic diversion. Some see it as double taxation since users already fund roads through gas taxes. Some suggest reducing road congestion by promoting different land use development strategies, such as increasing housing and employment density and improving the jobs/housing balance. These approaches aim to reduce reliance on single-occupant vehicles and make transit, walking, and cycling more attractive options. Experts highlight the benefits of living closer to work in reducing the need for driving. Experts point out that increasing land-use densities may not reduce congestion but can increase accessibility. However, this strategy may raise the costs of developing housing and offices. Land-use decision making is fragmented, leading to potential \"leapfrog\" development and more congestion. Improving the jobs/housing balance is unlikely to reduce congestion due to various reasons. The problem of transportation congestion is exacerbated by fragmented planning and operation of the transportation system in urban areas, involving multiple local governments and agencies. Interstate corridors like I-95 suffer from jurisdictional fragmentation, with various agencies responsible for different aspects of the system. This fragmentation also extends to public versus private ownership in the rail system, making it challenging to implement new initiatives. The rail system is mostly privately owned and operated, leading to challenges in implementing new passenger rail services. Efforts to address congestion require coordination across different agencies and jurisdictions. Some suggest giving regional authorities more power in planning transportation improvements to combat congestion. Expanding freight rail capacity is seen as a solution to transportation challenges. Building new capacity in freight rail is crucial for addressing congestion issues. Freight railroads, although in good financial health, are facing challenges in keeping up with demand due to the high cost and fixed nature of railroad track. This industry is one of the most capital-intensive in America, with investments representing a significant wager on future freight movement patterns. Similar risks are present in other freight industries like trucking, air, and waterborne transportation. Building new capacity in freight rail is crucial for addressing congestion issues in the trucking, air, and waterborne freight industries. Railroads may not be a solution to road traffic congestion if there is insufficient rail capacity, and public involvement for building rail capacity should not solely be based on relieving road congestion. Many industrial facilities are no longer served by rail spurs, and trucks make up a small part of urban traffic in most places, making it unlikely for rail to reduce road congestion significantly. Many support public funding for expanding rail capacity to improve freight system efficiency and reduce urban road congestion. Moving freight by rail offers public benefits like less road wear, lower air pollutant emissions, and reduced conflicts between freight and passenger trains. Improved rail system capacity can enhance the speed and efficiency of both systems. Many solutions for intermodal freight transportation problems focus on connections to truck and rail transportation at water ports. Ports, located in congested urban areas, have limited space for expansion and impact the environment with pollution and noise. Improvements proposed include extended truck gate hours, congestion pricing, truck appointment systems, on-dock rail connections, and truck-only lanes. Transportation congestion is a complex issue with interconnected problems and constraints. It is often referred to as a \"wicked problem\" due to the challenges in finding effective solutions. Key strategies include facilities, truck appointment systems, on-dock rail connections, truck-only lanes, and the development of inland ports connected by fast rail shuttles. When addressing transportation congestion, experts advise that traditional linear approaches may not be effective. Solving these \"wicked problems\" requires an ongoing, complex, and chaotic struggle that incorporates multiple viewpoints and approaches. Policy makers must be creative and opportunity-driven, as new dimensions of the problem often emerge during the solution process. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for transportation congestion. When addressing transportation congestion, experts advise that traditional linear approaches may not be effective. Solving these \"wicked problems\" requires ongoing, complex, and chaotic struggle that incorporates multiple viewpoints and approaches. Policy makers must be creative and opportunity-driven, as new dimensions of the problem often emerge during the solution process. Multiple, iterative strategies will be needed, including supply-side and demand-side approaches, focusing on passenger systems, freight, highways, and transit. Ultimately, the goal may not be to reduce or eliminate congestion entirely. Policy makers and planners should focus on improving passenger and freight mobility and accessibility, rather than solely reducing transportation congestion."
