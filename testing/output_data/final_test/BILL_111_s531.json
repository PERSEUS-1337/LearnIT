    "content": "The Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009\". This Act includes a study on the energy-water nexus. The Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 mandates an in-depth analysis by the National Academy of Sciences on the impact of energy development on U.S. water resources, including a lifecycle assessment of water usage in transportation fuel production. The Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 requires a detailed analysis by the National Academy of Sciences on the impact of energy development on U.S. water resources, including assessing water usage in transportation fuel production. This assessment evaluates the ratio of water withdrawn and consumed in producing transportation fuels or electricity to the total distance that can be traveled as a result of this consumption. The assessment required by the Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 includes analyzing the impact of energy development on U.S. water resources, specifically in transportation fuel production. It involves evaluating the efficiency of transportation fuel consumption, including domestically produced crude oil and its derivatives. The assessment required by the Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 includes analyzing the impact of energy development on U.S. water resources, specifically in transportation fuel production. It involves evaluating the efficiency of transportation fuel consumption, including domestically produced crude oil, imported crude oil, domestically produced natural gas, imported natural gas, oil shale, tar sands, domestically produced corn-based ethanol, imported corn-based ethanol, and advanced biofuels. The Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 requires an assessment of transportation fuel production, including advanced biofuels, coal to liquids, electricity for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, hydrogen, and any combination of transportation fuel sources. The study mandated by the Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 includes a lifecycle assessment of water usage in electricity production, evaluating the ratio of water consumed to electricity produced. The assessment covers energy feedstock exploration, extraction, growing, and processing. The assessment mandated by the Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 includes evaluating electricity generation facilities with different plant designs and cooling technologies based on fuel types such as coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear energy, solar energy, and wind energy. The study mandated by the Energy and Water Integration Act of 2009 will assess impacts associated with various fuel sources, including solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, biomass, waste heat utilization, and combinations of these fuels. Additionally, it will identify and analyze unique water impacts related to specific fuel sources, such as extraction or mining practices. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study on the impacts of fuel sources, including extraction, transportation, and location limitations. A report will be submitted to the Secretary within 18 months, and the results will be made public upon completion of the study. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study on fuel sources and their impacts. Results will be made public, and funds will be allocated for the study. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study on fuel sources and their impacts, with funds allocated for the study. Additionally, there will be a focus on power plant water and energy efficiency. The Secretary will conduct a study to maximize water and energy efficiency in electricity production, including evaluation of coal, oil, and natural gas facilities. The study aims to identify technologies for efficient generation. The Secretary will evaluate technologies to minimize carbon dioxide releases in oil and natural gas facilities, upgrade hydropower turbines, explore thermal solar facilities, and assess nuclear facilities. A report to Congress will be submitted within 18 months, with authorized appropriations for implementation. The Secretary will conduct a study on water conservation and energy savings. The Secretary, through the Bureau of Reclamation, will conduct a study to evaluate energy use in water distribution systems of major Reclamation projects. The Secretary will conduct a study to assess energy consumption in major Reclamation projects, identifying the projects with the highest energy usage and opportunities for reduction. The Secretary will identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption and costs in major Reclamation projects through various means such as reduced groundwater pumping, improved reservoir operations, infrastructure rehabilitation, water reuse, and integrating renewable energy generation. A report to Congress will be submitted within 18 months, detailing the study results. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary is authorized to receive necessary funds to carry out the section, with the funds remaining available until expended. SEC. 5. BRACKISH GROUNDWATER NATIONAL DESALINATION RESEARCH FACILITY. The Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility, located in Otero County, New Mexico, is operated by the Secretary of the Interior to conduct research, development, and demonstration activities for brackish groundwater desalination technologies. The facility aims to create new water and energy technologies and increase usable water supplies. The Secretary operates the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in New Mexico to develop new water and energy technologies for various purposes. This includes prioritizing renewable energy integration with desalination to reduce costs, minimize environmental impacts, and increase public acceptance. Research is also conducted on improving desalination processes. The Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in New Mexico focuses on developing new water and energy technologies, including improvements in osmosis technologies, reducing desalination waste volume and cost, creating partnerships for research activities, and educating the public on desalination and renewable energy technologies. The Secretary has the authority to enter contracts or agreements and provide grants for water efficiency research. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. SEC. 6. ENHANCED INFORMATION ON WATER-RELATED ENERGY CONSUMPTION. Section 205 of the Department of Energy Organization Act is amended to include a requirement for the Administrator to conduct an assessment every 3 years on energy consumption related to water use in various sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and municipalities. The Administrator must assess energy consumption related to water use for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and domestic purposes every 3 years. This does not affect the Administrator's data collection authority under another Act. The Secretary is required to develop an \"Energy-Water Research and Development Roadmap\" within 90 days of the Act's enactment to address water-related challenges in energy generation. A report on the document must be submitted to Congress within 120 days."
