    "content": "The \"Worker Right to Know Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Act includes findings related to worker rights. The Congress recognizes that employees under a union security agreement cannot be compelled to contribute to union-supported political, social, or charitable causes they disagree with, as stated in Communications Workers of America v. Beck. The National Labor Relations Board has not taken sufficient action to protect employees' rights regarding the use of their union dues for non-bargaining purposes. The National Labor Relations Board recently issued its first ruling implementing the Beck decision, which allows employees to object to the use of their union dues for non-bargaining purposes. However, the evolution of this right has diminished its meaningfulness as employees are forced to forego critical workplace rights in order to challenge the union's use of their dues. Employees lack access to clear financial records detailing how union dues are spent. The Act aims to provide workers with transparency on how union dues are used and to allow them to object to funds being used for purposes they disagree with. It also seeks to remove barriers for workers to exercise their right to object to the use of their dues for non-essential activities. SEC. 4. WORKER CHOICE. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers to object to paying dues or fees to a labor organization for certain purposes. SEC. 5. WORKER CONSENT. Amendment to the National Labor Relations Act allows employees to object to paying dues or fees not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment unless agreed upon in a signed written agreement renewed annually. Amendment to the Labor Management Relations Act requires written authorization for dues deductions unrelated to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment. SEC. 6. WORKER NOTICE: Employers must post a notice informing employees of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act, clarifying that dues or fees to a labor organization can only be required for specific purposes. A copy of the notice must be provided to each employee within 10 days of employment. SEC. 7. WORKER ECONOMIC RIGHTS: Amends the National Labor Relations Act to ensure that employees who pay dues or fees to a labor organization have the same rights as members. \n\nSEC. 8. DISCLOSURE TO WORKERS. Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to require labor organizations to report expenses in detail for members to determine their relevance to collective bargaining or other purposes. Additionally, it expands disclosure requirements to include employees paying dues or fees to the organization. The Secretary of Labor will establish regulations within 120 days to implement amendments requiring labor organizations to report expenses for members and employees paying dues or fees. The Act will take effect on the date of enactment, with specific requirements from sections 5 and 6 becoming effective 60 days after enactment."
