    "content": "ARPA-E, modeled after DARPA, was established in FY2008 by the America COMPETES Act. It received $15 million in regular appropriations and $400 million in ARRA funding in FY2009. The agency's statutory authority was amended and reauthorized in 2010, with appropriations authorized through FY2013. Despite being relatively young, ARPA-E's awardees have made significant scientific and technological advancements, such as developing a 1 megawatt silicon carbide transistor the size of a fingernail. ARPA-E has invested approximately $1.1 billion across more than 400 projects through 23 focused programs and two open funding solicitations. At least 30 ARPA-E project teams have formed new companies to advance their technologies, with more than 37 projects partnering with other government agencies for further development. Additionally, 34 projects have attracted over $850 million in private-sector follow-on funding after ARPA-E's initial investment of $135 million. Several technologies have already been incorporated into products being sold in the market. ARPA-E has invested over $1.1 billion in 400 projects through various programs and funding solicitations. The agency has cancelled 21 projects as part of its high-risk, high-reward research approach. Congressional measures are being introduced to reauthorize appropriations to ARPA-E, with funding levels outlined in Table 1 of CRS Report R43880. The Obama Administration has requested $325 million for ARPA-E in FY2016, a $45 million increase over the FY2015 enacted level. ARPA-E plans to use its appropriations for 7 to 10 funding opportunities focusing on transportation and stationary power systems. Project categories include transportation fuels, energy materials, dispatchable energy, and sensors. The annual ARPA-E budget justification includes funding for program direction, salaries, benefits, travel, and support services. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 would provide $280 million to ARPA-E in FY2016, $45 million less than the request. The White House OMB has indicated a potential veto due to insufficient funding for ARPA-E. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported that H.R. 2028 would allocate $291 million to ARPA-E in FY2016, $11 million more than previous levels. Since 2012, Congress has typically funded ARPA-E around $280 million annually, except for FY2013 when funding was reduced due to sequestration. ARPA-E is a relatively new addition to federal R&D, and its impact may take years to fully realize. Some early concerns about ARPA-E include differences from DARPA model, such as lack of built-in customer like the U.S. military. Analysts worry about energy sector characteristics hindering disruptive innovations. It remains unclear if these concerns pose actual challenges for ARPA-E or if adjustments have been made. Success factors for DARPA may not be as crucial for ARPA-E. The success factors for DARPA may not be as important for ARPA-E. Early congressional concerns focused on potential competition with other DOE research units and whether ARPA-E would focus too much on late-stage technology development best left to the private sector. A 2012 Government Accountability Office report found that ARPA-E had taken steps to avoid duplication and that most projects could not have been funded solely by the private sector."
