    "content": "Hurricane Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005 led to significant changes in federal policy and the organization of responsible federal entities, particularly within the Department of Homeland Security. The Post-Katrina Act established new leadership positions and requirements within FEMA, expanded its missions, and enhanced emergency management capabilities. The Post-Katrina Act brought new missions into FEMA, enhanced the agency's authority, and enacted provisions that set out new laws and amendments to existing acts. Congress also enacted five other statutes with long-term implications for federal emergency policies. The 109th Congress enacted legislation in response to Hurricane Katrina, based on findings from various investigations. The legislation included emergency management modifications to address shortcomings and calls for policy changes. The 109th Congress enacted legislation in response to Hurricane Katrina, focusing on federal emergency management authorities. The legislation aimed at far-reaching and potentially permanent changes in emergency management approaches, excluding specific disaster-related legislation. The report does not cover emergency communications provisions in the Post-Katrina Act or bioterrorism legislation. The Bush Administration also made revisions to practices and policies post-Katrina. The federal government has taken steps to revise practices and policies since Hurricane Katrina, including reviewing the National Response Plan. Preparation for other hazards like a pandemic influenza outbreak continues. Officials have been reconsidered and replaced or reassigned. This report summarizes selected provisions of legislation enacted during the 109th and 110th Congresses, providing background information on relevant policy areas. It includes sections on FEMA's location and status, leadership positions, and modifications to statutory provisions. Since its establishment in 1979, FEMA has been tasked with implementing emergency management policies, including changes in national preparedness system components, new education and training requirements, amendments to the Stafford Act for additional assistance authority, federal contracting and procurement procedures, oversight to reduce fraud and waste, and reporting requirements. FEMA has funded and coordinated emergency preparedness activities, provided federal response to save lives and property, funded reconstruction of damaged homes and infrastructure, and supported hazard mitigation activities. These elements constitute the comprehensive emergency management system. FEMA was an independent agency from 1979 to 2000, responsible for implementing the CEM concept. In 2001, agency officials began organizing the agency based on these concepts. The Bush Administration reorganized FEMA in 2001 to focus on civil defense and counterterrorism. After the 9/11 attacks, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred terrorism-related emergency preparedness functions from FEMA to the Border and Transportation Security Directorate. Organizational changes continued in 2005, including the Second Stage Review initiated by Secretary Chertoff. After the 9/11 attacks, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred terrorism-related emergency preparedness functions from FEMA to the Border and Transportation Security Directorate. In 2005, Secretary Chertoff initiated the Second Stage Review, dividing CEM functions between FEMA and the new Preparedness Directorate (PD). FEMA oversaw Response, Mitigation, and Recovery, while PD focused on emergency preparedness functions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred terrorism-related emergency preparedness functions from FEMA to the Border and Transportation Security Directorate. In 2005, Secretary Chertoff initiated the Second Stage Review, dividing CEM functions between FEMA and the new Preparedness Directorate (PD). The PD portfolio includes various offices such as the Chief Medical Officer of DHS, U.S. Fire Administration, and Office of Cyber and Telecommunications. FEMA has a limited role in coordinating federal agencies for contingency plans post-catastrophes, as seen in the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 shifted terrorism-related emergency preparedness functions from FEMA to other DHS units, leading to a deterioration of FEMA's capabilities. This resulted in congressional revisions to FEMA's structure and mission in the Post-Katrina Act, reorganizing DHS with a reconfigured FEMA with enhanced autonomy and consolidated emergency management functions. The Post-Katrina Act reorganized DHS, creating a new FEMA with enhanced autonomy and consolidated emergency management functions. This includes the Preparedness Directorate and all existing FEMA functions, with 10 regional offices and specific responsibilities. Some entities from the Preparedness Directorate are not transferred to the new FEMA. The Post-Katrina Act reorganized DHS, creating a new FEMA with enhanced autonomy and consolidated emergency management functions. It includes 10 regional offices with specified responsibilities, a National Integration Center, and new positions like a Disability Coordinator and a Small State and Rural Advocate. Regional Advisory Councils, Strike Teams, and Emergency Communications Coordination Working Groups are also established. FEMA has more organizational autonomy under the act. The Post-Katrina Act grants FEMA increased autonomy within DHS, classifying it as a separate entity. The act allows the FEMA Administrator to provide emergency management recommendations directly to Congress. It restores FEMA's responsibility to lead efforts in reducing loss of life and property, focusing on expanded components. The Post-Katrina Act grants FEMA increased autonomy within DHS, classifying it as a separate entity. It transfers all functions previously administered by FEMA to the new FEMA, including emergency alert systems and continuity of operations. The legislation exempts certain functions from the transfer and includes activities and responsibilities for FEMA beyond those in the HSA. It explicitly prohibits substantial reductions in FEMA's authorities, responsibilities, or functions. The Post-Katrina Act grants FEMA increased autonomy within DHS, classifying it as a separate entity and prohibiting transfers of FEMA assets. Specific activities given to FEMA include leading the nation's emergency management efforts, partnering with non-federal entities, and developing federal response capabilities. The Post-Katrina Act grants FEMA increased autonomy within DHS, adding 13 responsibilities including first responder effectiveness, grants supervision, and maintaining response coordination center. The Act aims to build common capabilities for all hazards and unique capabilities for high-risk events. The Post-Katrina Act grants FEMA new authorities to address administrative problems identified in the response to Hurricane Katrina, including developing a logistics system to track goods and services, establishing pre-positioned equipment programs, updating information technology systems, and disclosing information to law enforcement agencies for public safety concerns. The Post-Katrina Act grants FEMA new authorities to facilitate disaster response operations, including credentialing personnel and resources. It also bolsters response teams, authorizes Urban Search and Rescue teams, and provides funding for the system. The Post-Katrina Act authorizes funding for the Metropolitan Medical Response Grant Program and focuses on family reunification after disasters through the National Emergency Family Registry and Locator System. FEMA, in collaboration with other agencies, will establish a voluntary system accessible online and by phone to help reunite families. The Post-Katrina Act mandates the creation of a recovery strategy within 90 days, involving federal and non-governmental entities to assess existing programs for post-disaster use. It also authorizes the establishment of recovery offices in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas to aid in rebuilding efforts. The Post-Katrina Act mandates the establishment of recovery offices in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas to facilitate timely assistance delivery. Performance measures include completion rates and reimbursement times. A separate \"Housing Strategy\" will be developed, involving advocates for the disabled and a review of housing resources for disaster victims. The Post-Katrina Act mandates recovery offices in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas for timely assistance. A \"Housing Strategy\" will be developed for disaster victims, including special needs populations and rental housing repair. P.L. 109-295 transfers COOP and COG authorities of FEMA to a new agency, with mandates for continuity of plans responsibilities. The new agency established by P.L. 109-295 will integrate emergency preparedness responsibilities to address natural disasters, terrorism, and man-made disasters. A Disability Coordinator will interact with federal agencies on the needs of individuals with disabilities in emergency planning. The National Integration Center within FEMA will manage the National Incident Management System and other emergency preparedness capabilities. The National Integration Center (NIC) manages NIMS and NRP, coordinates volunteer activity, revises Catastrophic Incident Annex, and oversees regional offices within FEMA for disaster response coordination. The FEMA Administrator oversees regional strike teams for disaster response, develops regional plans, fosters mutual aid agreements, identifies gaps in special needs response, and maintains a Regional Response Coordination Center. Each Regional Administrator establishes a Regional Advisory Council to address emergency management issues and report to Congress on needed statutory authorities. Area offices are established for the Pacific, Caribbean, and Alaska jurisdictions. The FEMA Administrator establishes area offices for the Pacific, Caribbean, and Alaska jurisdictions. A Disability Coordinator is selected to assess emergency management policies for individuals with disabilities, including training, accessibility, transportation, and evacuation planning. The Director is responsible for establishing a Remedial Action Management Program (RAMP) in coordination with the National Council on Disability and the National Advisory Council. The RAMP program is used to analyze programs and generate after-action reports for participants in exercises and real-world events. It tracks remedial actions and trends, and the Coordinator works with FEMA on guidelines for individuals with disabilities in emergency response. The Post-Katrina Act reorganizes DHS, transferring the Preparedness Directorate to FEMA except for certain offices. The Post-Katrina Act reorganizes DHS by establishing new offices such as the Office of Infrastructure Protection, National Communications System, National Cybersecurity Division, and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer. It is unclear if these units will form a new organizational unit, become stand-alone offices, or be absorbed by another entity. The Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications office, created in 2005, includes entities like the National Communications System and National Cybersecurity Division. The Act also creates the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications office without specifying the inclusion of the National Communications System and National Cybersecurity Division. The Post-Katrina Act establishes new offices within DHS, including the Office of Emergency Communications and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer. The Act also transfers the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center to the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. The Post-Katrina Act establishes NISAC within DHS, expands its authority, and mandates formal relationships with federal entities. The National Operations Center is designated as the principal operations center for the Department, but its organizational location within DHS is not specified. The Act also provides for the establishment of a National Exercise Simulation by the President. The Post-Katrina Act establishes a National Exercise Simulation Center within DHS, an Emergency Communications Preparedness Center, and two emergency locator and reunification services. These developments became effective as of March 31, 2007. The Post-Katrina Act, enacted on October 4, 2006, brought several changes including increased autonomy for FEMA, establishment of various centers and positions such as a National Integration Center, Disability Coordinator, Chief Medical Officer, and Small State and Rural Advocate. The act also potentially eliminated the position of Under Secretary for Preparedness. Multiple political appointees and senior executives lead the Preparedness Directorate and FEMA. The Post-Katrina Act, enacted on October 4, 2006, abolished certain statutory positions and established new ones, including the FEMA Administrator. The qualifications for top leadership positions were also revised. The act potentially eliminated the position of Under Secretary for Preparedness. The Post-Katrina Act, enacted on October 4, 2006, abolished the Under Secretary for Preparedness position, which evolved from the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) through reorganizations in the Department of Homeland Security. However, conflicting provisions in HSA and other acts raise questions about Congress's intention to eliminate this position. The Under Secretary for IAIP position was established as an advice and consent position by provisions of HSA, which may still exist despite conflicting laws. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for 2007 also suggests a continuation of the office. The Post-Katrina Act charges the Under Secretary of Preparedness with implementing FEMA reorganization, indicating the position may still be in place. The Post-Katrina Act elevates the Administrator position within FEMA, giving it greater status within DHS. The Administrator will now report directly to the Secretary and serve as the principal advisor on emergency management matters. Compensation for the Administrator will be at Level II, higher than the previous under secretaries. The Post-Katrina Act elevates the Administrator position within FEMA, giving it greater status within DHS.

The Administrator is directed to prepare a plan for a Surge Capacity Force to be deployed to disaster sites, with individuals trained and deployed under Stafford Act authority. If existing authorities are inadequate, a report to Congress on additional authorities will be made. The Surge Capacity Force will include DHS employees and personnel from other federal agencies designated by the Secretary. Members must be capable of rapid deployment to disasters and receive continuous training on FEMA's programs. They are not counted against FEMA's personnel ceiling and may receive travel expenses for training. The Administrator will develop procedures for designating DHS employees to the Force. The Surge Capacity Force, established to enhance emergency preparedness, includes DHS employees and non-DHS federal employees designated by the Secretary. Responsibilities include building a national incident management system and consolidating federal emergency response plans. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 mandated the development of a National Response Plan. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5) mandated the development of a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and a National Response Plan (NRP). HSPD-8 was issued as a companion to HSPD-5, directing the development of a national preparedness goal (NPG) for all-hazards catastrophes, including terrorism. The NPG included readiness metrics and support components to assess preparedness efforts for major events. The requirements for documents, plans, and components were established to guide the construction of a national preparedness system (NPS). In 2004 and 2005, DHS released various components such as the National Response Plan, National Preparedness Goal, Planning Scenarios, Universal Task List, and Target Capabilities List to provide specific directions for the NPS. The federal mandates, plans, and directives like the National Response Plan, National Preparedness Goal, Task List, and Target Capabilities List are essential for emergency preparedness. State governments and non-governmental groups also work towards improving preparedness capabilities. DHS and other federal entities provide financial and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal governments through grants like the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative. The Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and Urban Area Security Initiative aim to enhance the nation's preparedness for emergency response to various disasters. The Post-Katrina Act mandates the establishment of a national preparedness goal and system to prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate disasters, including terrorism. The President, through FEMA, is tasked with creating a National Preparedness System with target capabilities, priorities, standards, and training.

The FEMA Administrator is responsible for establishing the NPS and implementing an assessment system to evaluate the nation's preparedness capabilities. Performance metrics and outcome measures are essential components of the NPS elements. The President has the authority to include planning scenarios in the NPS to address all-hazards risks and develop target capabilities accordingly. The Post-Katrina Act mandates FEMA to develop specific, flexible, and measurable guidelines for target capabilities to address representative hazards. DHS conducts terrorism risk assessments considering threat, vulnerability, and consequences, including population density, critical infrastructure, and borders. Preparedness priorities balance all-hazard risks with available resources at federal, state, local, and tribal levels. The Post-Katrina Act requires FEMA to develop guidelines for target capabilities to address hazards, coordinate with DOD for resources, and base emergency preparedness grants on plans that include a catastrophic incident annex. The state plan annexes must be consistent with the NPG, NIMS, and other plans and strategies, developed in consultation with local officials. States receiving DHS preparedness assistance must report on preparedness levels annually. The SAFE Ports Act authorizes risk assessment tools for Maritime Security Plans and directs grants based on risk. New eligible activities for grants include training for terrorist attacks, establishing threat information sharing mechanisms, and purchasing equipment for managing classified information. The DHS Secretary ensures grants supplement Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans, based on national concerns from risk assessments. Entities under these plans can apply for new port security grants. The Post-Katrina Act mandates federal agencies to have capabilities for national preparedness goals. The National Response Plan (NRP) mandates federal agencies to fulfill operational responsibilities to meet national preparedness goals, including personnel retention, organizational structures alignment with NRP missions, resource availability, and command and control communications.

Homeland security education and training programs are provided by various federal agencies and departments, including Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. These programs target federal, state, and local government personnel, emergency responders, and critical infrastructure personnel to prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks. Some training programs are tailored for personnel in critical infrastructure sectors or those responding to terrorist attacks. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a key role in providing homeland security education and training to federal, state, and local emergency responders. DHS collaborates with various agencies and partners to offer training at facilities like the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) for a wide range of personnel. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), National Fire Academy (NFA), and Emergency Management Institute (EMI) provide training for federal law enforcement agencies, fire and emergency response personnel, and emergency management practices. The Office of Grants and Training (G&T) within DHS prepares for potential terrorist attacks and offers terrorism and WMD training through various institutions and partners. The Post-Katrina Act transfers the Noble Training Center to the Center for Domestic Preparedness, part of NDPC, for training emergency managers and public health professionals to respond to mass casualty events.
