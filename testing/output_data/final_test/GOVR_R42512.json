    "content": "Pressure is increasing for passenger train use of freight railroad rights of way, with federal funding allocated for new high-speed and intercity rail services. State and local governments are also interested in expanding commuter routes. Amtrak has eminent domain power over freight railroad facilities, but other passenger rail operators must negotiate agreements with freight railroads for access to tracks. Passenger rail operators, other than Amtrak, face challenges negotiating access to freight railroad tracks due to lack of statutory leverage. The tension between commuter and freight use of tracks was highlighted during the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The provision for binding arbitration in case of access disputes was controversial. The tension between passenger rail operators and freight railroads over access to tracks continues, with disagreements on how to resolve disputes. The Senate-passed legislation calls for the evaluation of enhancing intercity passenger service and resolving access issues. There are suggestions to grant passenger interests more bargaining power and to give states or commuter authorities similar access rights as Amtrak. Some Members of Congress advocate for greater involvement of private companies in passenger rail services. Amtrak faces challenges in expanding intercity rail services due to private companies lacking the statutory right to use freight railroads' tracks. Disputes have arisen, such as Union Pacific's refusal to accommodate proposed passenger trains. This highlights the difficulties in negotiations between freight and potential passenger rail operators. In upstate New York, a project for higher speed intercity service between Albany and Buffalo has been delayed by disagreement with the host freight railroad over track space and speed limits for passenger trains. Denver considered a light rail line on city streets due to safety concerns from a freight railroad. Boston officials have faced frustrations over rail service due to unexpected costs. City of Boston officials have been frustrated over negotiations with a freight railroad to purchase tracks for commuter rail service. Orlando recently reached an agreement with a freight railroad for new commuter rail tracks. Mandating passenger-train access to freight rights of way raises arguments about privately owned railroads. The conflict between private and public interests in railroading is highlighted, with railroads being restricted from leaving the business solely for profit maximization. While railroad rights of way are private property, they are infused with a public interest component. The historical context of this conflict informs the present policy debate, with the first railroads in the US built for moving cargo and receiving revenue from passenger travel. Commuter service on railroads was initially seen as a way to generate additional revenue during rush hour. Railroads offered reduced fares for commuters, leading to the operation of dedicated commuter trains in major cities. Despite operating at a loss due to short trips and concentrated business hours, railroads benefited from suburban development. The economic return for commuter trains came from land controlled by the railroads, rather than commuter fares. The 1911 survey revealed that some railroads had not raised fares for decades, highlighting the minimal impact of commuter fares on railroad investments. Railroads were chartered by states, with requirements for passenger service often included. Unlike other businesses, railroads were obligated to serve the public as \"common carriers,\" unable to cease operations without government approval. Railroads, as \"common carriers,\" had government approval and eminent domain power in their charters. A 1837 New York court ruling upheld a railroad's eminent domain authority, emphasizing the public nature of railroads despite being privately owned for profit. The court upheld the public nature of railroad rights of way, stating that the company's ability to recoup construction costs from travelers did not make it a private entity. The court also affirmed the government's power to regulate railroad prices and prosecute them for refusing service without cause. States began to address monopoly concerns during the railroads' golden age before World War I, leading to legal battles over state authority versus railroad ownership. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of public control over privately owned railroad rights of way, establishing three key principles: the public has a right to some control, primarily vested in the federal government, and this control does not include the right to confiscate. In Munn v. Illinois (1876), the Court upheld a state's authority to regulate businesses with a public interest. In Munn v. Illinois (1876), the Supreme Court ruled that when a private property owner devotes it to a use in which the public has an interest, they must submit to public control for the common good. Common carriers are seen as having public duties to perform. Dissenting judges argued that regulating prices could be seen as a taking of private property without due process. In Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company v. Illinois (1886), the Supreme Court ruled that state regulation of railroad rates for shipments between states was unconstitutional as it interfered with interstate commerce, leading to the creation of the Interstate Commerce Act by Congress. In response to the Wabash ruling, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887, modeling it after state railroad commissions. The ICC Act impressed the common carrier concept upon both freight and passenger railroad service, ensuring reasonable and equal facilities for transportation. In 1890, the Supreme Court limited governments' power to regulate railroad rates, ensuring rates were not unreasonably low to deprive companies of profit. The ICC was granted additional powers under the Hepburn Act in 1906 to regulate railroad rates and prevent unreasonably low rates that would deprive companies of profit. This strengthened the ICC's authority over interstate commerce and limited state governments' ability to set unremunerative rates. Some railroad companies even closed down operations to avoid financial losses. The Hepburn Act of 1906 granted the ICC additional powers to regulate railroad activities, including express and sleeping car services. It mandated carriers to provide transportation upon reasonable request and emphasized the importance of traffic density for profitable railroad operation. Access to railroad rights of way by smaller communities and shippers has been a longstanding issue, with legal principles of \"fairness\" used to gain access to the network. The Supreme Court ruled on laws regulating passenger train stops, striking down some that hindered interstate commerce but upholding others that distinguished between local and interstate trains. For example, a Minnesota law requiring stops at county seats for intrastate trains was upheld because it exempted interstate through trains. The Supreme Court upheld an Ohio law in 1899 requiring railroads to provide local passenger service to communities with more than 3,000 inhabitants, stating it was not an unreasonable burden on interstate trains. This decision was based on the state's \"police power\" to regulate intrastate trains and provide for public convenience. The Supreme Court upheld an Ohio law in 1899 requiring railroads to provide local passenger service to communities with more than 3,000 inhabitants, stating it was not an unreasonable burden on interstate trains. The debate about the extent of local control over railroad operations revolves around the issue of police power and the balance between the interests of stockholders and the general public. The debate over local control of railroad operations has been ongoing for a century, with Congress limiting state and local government authority. The question of granting states access to railroad rights of way raises concerns about balancing freight and passenger interests. While passenger interests may be favored due to voting power, cities understand the importance of rail connections for commerce. Freight railroads have been relocating urban intermodal yards to suburbs for space and efficiency. In cities like Boston and Chicago, there are efforts to balance passenger and freight rail interests by improving infrastructure to accommodate both. This includes selling rights of way for commuter trains and building overpasses to reduce conflicts between freight trains and urban areas. The relocation of intermodal yards to suburbs is also seen as a way to free up track for passenger use. Different states and cities may balance passenger and shipper interests differently. In a 1899 Ohio case, Supreme Court Justices debated whether local governments could effectively manage the needs of both parties. The majority believed local authorities could handle rights of way better than a distant federal entity, while the minority feared neglect of national commerce. A precedent from an 1882 Chicago case, where a barge carrier challenged a city ordinance restricting drawbridge openings, was cited to support the majority opinion. The Supreme Court upheld the ordinance as \"just and reasonable.\" The Supreme Court upheld a Chicago ordinance as \"just and reasonable,\" but also stated that the city's control over bridges was not absolute. Illinois has a significant interest in the bridges over the Chicago River, and if the state's power obstructs navigation, Congress can intervene. The four dissenting Justices in the Ohio stoppage law case argued that the Ohio law favored local interests over national interests, citing the need for national regulation of commerce. They contended that the legislation was not in the public interest as it discriminated in favor of local interests and hindered interstate commerce. The Supreme Court removed control of interstate commerce from state legislatures due to their tendency to prioritize local interests over national interests. In a case involving Magnolia, MS, the Court struck down a local stoppage law that hindered competition among railroads on intercity routes. The competition between trunk lines for transportation between states can be fierce, with obstacles potentially hindering interstate roads from competing effectively. The ruling in the Mississippi case is still relevant today, as large cities often have multiple trunk line railroads in direct competition. Local station stoppage laws from the turn of the century highlight the conflict between interstate and local users of a rapidly expanding national railroad network. Between 1890 and World War I, over 18,000 miles of interurban electric railroads were built, primarily for local travelers. By 1933, half of this network had been abandoned due to competition from automobiles and buses. The question arises whether the current North American railroad network can effectively serve both local and long-distance users, with even shortline freight railroads facing challenges accessing the transcontinental network. Freight railroads can maximize efficiency by moving entire train loads of cargo from one origin to one destination, rather than making stops for single-carload shipments. Local use of their track may disrupt their business strategies. Eminent domain power allows railroads to provide a public good, but cases have shown that passenger operators can also condemn portions of railroad rights of way. Many freight railroads are not utilizing their full rights of way, opting for single-track operations due to technological advancements. Outside the Northeast Corridor, 70% of Amtrak's freight-owned mileage is single tracked. 6 out of 12 shorter-distance corridor routes operate on at least 70% single tracked rights of way. Legal standards for unused land within railroad rights of way for passenger service may differ from demands for existing track use. Precedents set by cases involving telegraph lines along railroad rights of way show symbiotic relationship between technologies. Railroads used telegraph for communication and allowed telegraph companies to erect poles in exchange for free service, leading to disputes when multiple companies wanted to use the same right of way. The Supreme Court ruled against a telegraph company's claim to occupy a railroad's right of way under an 1866 statute, stating that a railroad's right of way is property for public use. This decision came after a contract agreement between the railroad and the telegraph company expired, leading to the railroad contracting with a competing telegraph firm and ejecting the incumbent company from the right of way. The Supreme Court ruled that a railroad's right of way is considered private property entitled to protection under the Constitution, subject to state and Federal control. Another precedent involved a case where a railroad could not prevent a telegraph company from using its right of way if it did not interfere with the railroad's operations. During the railroad construction boom, the North Carolina Supreme Court allowed a competing railroad to condemn portions of another railroad's unused right of way in Charlotte. A similar ruling was made in Danbury, CT, where a railroad had graded a wide right of way but only laid one track. The court permitted another railroad to condemn the unused land, emphasizing the public interest in efficient land use. The court in Washington State allowed a railroad to condemn part of another railroad's right of way for shared use, emphasizing efficient land use and cost-sharing benefits. The state's property law authorized condemnation of both roadbed and track, potentially requiring two rail carriers to operate trains over the same track. The Surface Transportation Board's role as an arbitrator for passenger access to freight facilities raises questions about balancing competing interests and measuring the public's need for passenger service. After World War I, passenger rail service declined due to competition from buses and cars. The Great Depression worsened the situation, leading to many railroads going bankrupt. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Surface Transportation Board have addressed the issue of balancing public service obligations with demands for additional services. The Great Depression exacerbated the decline in passenger rail service, leading to many major railroads entering bankruptcy. Congress showed increasing concern for the financial health of the carriers, leading to the Transportation Act of 1920 aimed at consolidating the nation's railroads and allowing them to petition the ICC to abandon unprofitable lines. States had previously hindered abandonment efforts by requiring railroads to continue providing local services. The ICC evaluated abandonments based on \"public convenience and necessity\" and the railroad's financial health. Between 1920 and 1963, nearly 50,000 miles of railroad were abandoned. The Transportation Act of 1920 only addressed total abandonment, not discontinuing passenger trains while continuing freight service. The Wisconsin Public Service Commission refused a railroad's request to cancel passenger train service on a 27-mile line only during winter due to light traffic. The railroad then filed an abandonment petition with the ICC, which allowed the discontinuance of freight and summer passenger service. Congress later granted the ICC authority to allow railroads to discontinue passenger service while continuing freight service. The ICC had the authority to decide on passenger train discontinuance cases, with a four-month period to make a decision. In a 1964 case, the Southern Railway wanted to discontinue passenger trains between Greensboro and Goldsboro, NC. The ICC approved the discontinuance due to high costs and low demand, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court. The ICC had the authority to decide on passenger train discontinuance cases, with a four-month period to make a decision. In a 1964 case, the Southern Railway wanted to discontinue passenger trains between Greensboro and Goldsboro, NC. The ICC approved the discontinuance due to high costs and low demand, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court. The demands of public convenience and necessity were considered in determining the burden on interstate commerce, with the majority giving little weight to the carrier's overall prosperity. The dissenting Justices argued against allowing railroads to terminate service based solely on the availability of alternate transportation modes and a \"net loss\" on the service. The dissenters referenced a 1958 Supreme Court case involving a railroad being required to provide commuter services at a loss. The Supreme Court ruled against the ICC, emphasizing the importance of considering the overall profitability of the railroad's operations. This suggests that profitable railroads could be obligated to provide passenger services if deemed vital. In some cases, a profitable railroad may be required to provide passenger services even at a loss. This raises questions about passenger access to freight tracks today. The ICC has considered balancing public convenience and necessity with the burden on interstate commerce when railroads request to discontinue services. The ICC has defined public interest to include both passenger and shipping customers of the railroad. The ICC allowed railroads to discontinue passenger services to preserve freight operations, especially as the industry faced financial challenges in the 1960s. Requests to end passenger trains were common, such as the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad's attempt to discontinue 278 interstate passenger trains in 1966. Despite the importance of passenger service, the ICC only approved the discontinuance of a few trains. In 1970, Penn Central sought to discontinue 34 passenger trains, sparking further debate on the balance between passenger and freight services. Penn Central petitioned the ICC to discontinue 34 passenger trains, including all east-west intercity passenger service west of Buffalo, NY, and Harrisburg, PA. This led to legislation creating a national passenger railroad corporation. The discontinuance of privately provided commuter train service resulted in public ownership of these services, with the Long Island Railroad being the first commuter line to fall into public ownership in 1966. Federal assistance for commuter operations began in the early 1960s. Federal assistance for transit began in the early 1960s, with funding only granted to public entities under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. This led to the public takeover of privately owned commuter services, such as the formation of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1964 and the creation of New Jersey Transit in 1982. The city of Philadelphia and surrounding counties also collaborated to consolidate governance of commuter operations in the 1960s. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 was passed after the Penn Central Railroad discontinued intercity passenger service, leading to the creation of Amtrak. Amtrak was established as a mixed corporation with common stock owned by U.S. taxpayers and preferred stock by participating railroads. It took over intercity passenger service from railroads willing to transfer it. Congress later amended the act in 1973 to strengthen Amtrak's bargaining power. In 1973, Congress amended the 1970 act to enhance Amtrak's bargaining power with freight railroads. This included giving preference to Amtrak trains on their tracks, allowing Amtrak to buy rights of way and stations, setting compensation at incremental costs, and permitting appeals to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Freight railroads argue that they subsidize Amtrak because Amtrak only covers additional costs, not fixed and overhead costs. Some freight railroads view carrying Amtrak trains as a subsidized obligation due to covering fixed and overhead costs. The rail network shrinkage in the 1970s and 1980s created opportunities to use abandoned freight lines for passenger service, facilitated by regulatory changes. The ICC simplified the abandonment process in 1972, leading to the abandonment of 15,000 miles of railroads between 1970 and 1976. The Staggers Act in 1980 prevented abandonment if a responsible party offered to buy or subsidize the line. The ICC's \"forced-sale\" provision allowed commuter agencies to acquire abandoned rail lines at a fair price, reducing freight railroads' leverage. This was exemplified in 1981 when a Chicago commuter agency purchased a 17-mile track at a price set by the ICC, closer to their offer than the railroad's. This legal power is favored by commuter operators to negotiate access to freight railroads. The ICC's \"forced-sale\" provision allowed commuter agencies to acquire abandoned rail lines at a fair price, reducing freight railroads' leverage. Another important ICC case established the precedent of \"adverse abandonment,\" allowing entities to appeal to the ICC to force abandonment of dormant rail lines. This was exemplified by a Kansas City-area transit authority seeking to use a fallow rail corridor. The ICC issued an abandonment certificate over the owning railroad's objection due to lack of rail service and maintenance. Congress passed amendments in 1983 to preserve railroad rights of way for recreational trail use or telecommunication facilities, allowing reactivation if needed. This was in line with the intent expressed in the 1976 4-R Act. In 1987, Amtrak discontinued service to Montreal due to poorly maintained tracks. Amtrak tried to acquire the track through eminent domain but eventually sold it to a competitor for maintenance. In 1987, Amtrak discontinued service to Montreal due to poorly maintained tracks. Amtrak sold the track to a competitor for maintenance, which was approved by the ICC. The ICC chairman dissented, leading to a legal battle that ended with Congress amending the statute to authorize such condemnations. Amtrak's use of eminent domain power was reversed by the Supreme Court, the only case where it resorted to such action with a freight railroad. Cooperation between passenger and freight railroads is crucial for daily operations. Federal intervention by the Surface Transportation Board could harm the relationship between Amtrak and host railroads, hindering service. Amtrak also faced resistance from a railroad parent company when trying to increase speeds on a track section for its \"Downeaster\" service. Some commuter authorities avoid government intervention in disputes to prevent complications. The Staggers Act of 1980 deregulated the rail industry but maintained railroads' common carrier obligation. It allowed confidential contracts between railroads and shippers, but not at the expense of meeting common carrier obligations. Railroads now have more freedom to make decisions based on economic interests, including considering opportunity costs. This shift towards acting like any other business may impact the balance between private and public interests in railroads. The ICC amended its balancing test in 1980 to allow railroads to abandon lines based on opportunity costs, potentially creating economic hurdles for passenger train operators. This could lead to freight railroads prioritizing higher returns over public service obligations, especially if there is no spare capacity since deregulation in 1980. Since railroad deregulation in 1980, the supply and demand for freight railroad facilities have reached equilibrium. The Transportation Act of 1920's goal of consolidation and shedding excess capacity has been mostly achieved. Railroads are investing in increasing capacity, including restoring double tracks. The decline of passenger service led to the disappearance of excess capacity, as infrastructure supporting passenger trains generated additional capacity. The decline of passenger service led to the disappearance of excess capacity in railroads. This raised questions about railroads' public obligations in providing service. A Supreme Court case highlighted the carrier's responsibility to treat customers fairly when capacity is limited. Passenger trains operate at higher speeds than freight trains, leading to conflicts over track usage. Public authorities can acquire abandoned railroad rights of way, removing jurisdiction from the STB. The ICC ruling in 1991 allowed public rail authorities to acquire active freight lines without being deemed a \"rail carrier\" or having the \"common carrier obligation.\" This facilitated the takeover of lines for passenger use, as seen in the case of Maine acquiring a rail segment for new passenger rail service. The transaction in Maine allowed for new passenger rail service while the freight railroad retained an exclusive easement for freight operations. This precedent has been used in over 60 cases, enabling state or local governments to provide passenger service without becoming common carriers. The STB has facilitated passenger use of the right of way while protecting the common carrier obligation, allowing for operating agreements between freight and passenger operators. The STB has disapproved of transactions giving passenger operators too much control over freight lines. There is a question about forcibly acquiring a passenger easement on a freight line for passenger service without interfering with freight operations. This partial condemnation may not be seen as interference by the courts/STB. The Transportation Act of 1920 allows the ICC to require railroads to share terminal facilities, including main-line tracks, with other carriers if deemed practicable and in the public interest. This provision, now codified at 49 U.S.C. 11102(a), has remained unchanged. Rail carriers are responsible for establishing conditions and compensation for use of facilities. If they cannot agree, the Board may intervene. This provision has been a focus of competitive access disputes between railroads and customers. In 1991, a commuter rail authority appealed to the ICC over an impasse with a freight railroad. The provision allowing access to freight tracks by passenger operators has been used in disputes between commuter authorities and freight railroads. The legality of this provision has not been tested in court. Congress replaced the ICC with the STB in 1995, maintaining the deregulatory framework of the Staggers Act. One modification in the ICCTA has impacted a state's or municipality's ability to gain access to freight tracks. The ICCTA has shifted jurisdiction over railroad regulation to the STB, preempting state economic regulation of railroads. This change has affected a state's or municipality's ability to access freight tracks on terms acceptable to freight railroads. The ICCTA has limited state and local government's ability to condemn railroad property for public use, as it is now considered a form of rail regulation preempted by the federal government. This has been seen in court cases where cities were unable to condemn railroad rights-of-way for public safety reasons. The STB sided with a railroad in a case where NE sought to condemn a strip of railroad right of way for a pedestrian and bike trail, citing safety concerns. In another case, St. Paul, MN, faced ICCTA preemption when trying to condemn a strip of railroad right of way for a bike trail. These cases highlight the limitations imposed by the ICCTA on condemning railroad property for public use. The ICCTA provision blocks attempts by passenger carriers to access freight rights of way at a lower price through condemnation. In 2006, the Chicago Transit Authority tried to condemn a right of way it leased from Union Pacific but was preempted by ICCTA. The court found that ICCTA preempted a condemnation proceeding by a commuter rail authority, as it was considered a form of local regulation prohibited by the law. Freight railroads expect compensation for revenue foregone due to passenger service using their capacity, leading to disputes over access to limited track networks. Passenger rail proponents argue for increased federal investment in rail infrastructure. The lack of federal investment in rail networks has led to conflicts between freight and passenger use of tracks. Double tracking is an expensive option to alleviate this issue. Freight railroads are adding parallel tracks on busy routes to accommodate shorter-haul cargoes. UPS has expressed frustration with slow investment and technology adoption by railroads. There is potential for freight and higher-speed passenger operators to share interest in express tracks. One proposed solution to enhance rail infrastructure is the creation of a federal rail trust fund, financed by taxes on system users. UPS's rail service needs raise the question of whether the same rail network can meet the needs of both shippers and passengers. Congress may need to consider alternatives for managing urban rail corridors to accommodate increasing demands. A \"rail port authority\" model could help manage urban rail corridors by purchasing key rail corridors to improve the city's rail network for both passenger and freight use. Publicly owned freight rail facilities could receive federal funding to amass capital that private railroads cannot provide, with railroads using the facility paying fees. The Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority in Southern California purchased and modernized a freight rail line, increasing train speeds and capacity. Freight railroads pay fees to run trains on the corridor, which could help maintain competitive balance between carriers. The discussion revolves around the price of gaining access to railroad property for passenger rail authorities. The question is whether negotiations should be between freight railroads and passenger rail authorities or involve a governmental third party like the STB. While some rights of way have been purchased through market negotiations, the unique aspects of these transactions, such as having only one buyer and seller, make them different from typical property sales. Public authorities are not seeking access for non-rail public purposes. The discussion revolves around the price of gaining access to railroad property for passenger rail authorities. Public authorities are not seeking access for non-rail public purposes but for their intended use. The question arises whether freight railroads have the right to solely set the price for passenger access or if the public's convenience and necessity should be considered. Congress might limit the right to Amtrak or extend it to state and local transit authorities. Creating track access rights for potential private operators of rail service is also being considered. Creating track access rights for potential private operators of rail service is a complex issue as Congress aims to promote private investment in intercity passenger rail service. Private competitors may expect the same access privileges to freight tracks as Amtrak."
