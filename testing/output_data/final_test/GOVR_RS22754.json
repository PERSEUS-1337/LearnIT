    "content": "President William J. Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 62 (PDD 62) on May 22, 1998, establishing a framework for federal counter-terrorism programs. PDD 62 addressed terrorist apprehension, transportation security, emergency response, and cyber security. The U.S. Secret Service was designated as the lead agency for operational security during events of national significance. Other lead agencies included FEMA, DoD, and HHS. The Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 authorized the Secret Service to plan security for National Special Security Events (NSSEs), such as presidential inaugurations and major international summits. The DHS Secretary now designates NSSEs based on factors like attendance and event significance. The Secret Service plans security for National Special Security Events (NSSEs) designated by the DHS Secretary based on attendance and event significance. The USSS becomes the lead federal agency for NSSEs, developing and implementing security operations to create a safe environment. The Major Events Division coordinates NSSE planning, including venue security, training, communications, and credentialing. The Secret Service plans security for National Special Security Events (NSSEs) designated by the DHS Secretary. NSSE security is coordinated with federal, state, and local agencies, utilizing physical infrastructure security and other technologies to ensure safety. The DHS coordinates various teams for consequence management during NSSEs, including Domestic Emergency Support Teams, Urban Search and Rescue Teams, and Nuclear Incident Response Teams. USSS sponsors training seminars for law enforcement officials on security management at major events and strategies to reduce terrorism vulnerabilities. Congress has funded a general NSSE fund since FY2006. Since FY2006, Congress has only appropriated funding for specific NSSEs, including the 2004 Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions in Boston, MA, and New York City, NY, and the 2008 Democratic and Republican nominating conventions in Denver, CO, and Minneapolis - St. Paul, MN. The 108th Congress allocated $100 million for security at these events, administered through the DOJ's Byrne programs. The funding reimbursed state and local law enforcement for overtime costs as USSS lacked a mechanism for NSSE security reimbursement. The most recent NSSE funding was $15 million. In FY2008, Congress appropriated $1 million for NSSE costs within the Secret Service. Federal funding for National Special Security Events (NSSE) costs incurred by federal, state, and local entities is an issue Congress may address. The most recent NSSE funding was $15 million for emergency planning and security costs in the District of Columbia. Former President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for the District, authorizing federal reimbursement for emergency preparedness activities. In FY2008, Congress appropriated $1 million for NSSE costs within the Secret Service, which may not be sufficient for recent events like the presidential inauguration. The Secret Service cannot reimburse state and local law enforcement for NSSE overtime costs, so additional funding sources may be needed. Congress could establish a program within the Secret Service to address these funding challenges. Congress may consider establishing a program within the Secret Service to provide additional funds for unexpected NSSE security costs and authorize reimbursement to state and local law enforcement entities. Currently, state and local jurisdictions rely on DHS grants like SHSGP and UASI for NSSE security, but the grant approval process is not flexible, limiting their application to NSSEs. This poses challenges for planning security costs for unexpected NSSEs, such as the sudden death of a President or a change in location of a planned NSSE. States and localities are unable to use SHSGP or UASI funds in advance for security costs in these situations. States and localities face challenges in using SHSGP and UASI funds for unexpected NSSE security costs. DHS allows reprogramming of funds with approval, but this may impact funding for other homeland security activities."
