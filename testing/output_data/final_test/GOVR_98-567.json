    "content": "The U.S. government's role in overseas investment financing predates the formal establishment of OPIC. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorized investment guarantees to support economic development overseas. OPIC was established in 1969 and began operations in 1971 to assume the investment guaranty and promotion functions previously conducted by USAID. President Nixon recommended the creation of OPIC for businesslike management of overseas investments. OPIC was created in 1969 to provide businesslike management of investment incentives for developing nations, complementing official U.S. foreign assistance programs. Private investment was seen as a way to multiply the benefits of both private and government aid. OPIC was part of a larger overhaul of the U.S. aid program in 1973. In 1973, the U.S. aid program underwent a significant overhaul, shifting focus to humanitarian aid over infrastructure projects. OPIC operates under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with its authority extended periodically by Congress. The OPIC Amendments Act of 2003 extended OPIC's authority until September 30, 2007. Since 2007, OPIC has operated under extensions of its authority in appropriations law, known as authorization \"waivers.\" These extensions have been granted through consolidated appropriations acts and continuing resolutions. For example, the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act extended OPIC's authority until September 30, 2016. Subsequent CRs extended OPIC's authority through April 28, 2017. OPIC's operations are divided into three main programs\u2014insurance, finance, and investment funds\u2014to promote U.S. interests. OPIC operates three main programs\u2014insurance, finance, and investment funds\u2014to promote U.S. private investment in less developed countries by mitigating risks. Its authority is backed by the U.S. government's full faith and credit. OPIC aims to support economic development in low-income countries and mobilize private investment in countries with viable project environments but low credit ratings. OPIC provides political risk insurance to safeguard investments in developing countries against currency inconvertibility and expropriation risks. This helps attract private investment in countries with viable project environments but low credit ratings. Political risk insurance provided by OPIC protects investors from losses due to political violence, income loss, and damage to tangible assets caused by various forms of violence. This coverage excludes losses from lawful regulatory actions or actions instigated by the investor or foreign firm. OPIC offers political risk insurance to protect U.S. banks and investors from political violence in developing countries. The insurance covers up to $250 million per project for 20 years, with premium rates guaranteed for the contract's duration. Investors must bear at least 10% of the risk, and coverage is available to U.S. citizens and firms majority owned by U.S. citizens. OPIC provides investment financing to U.S. citizens, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms, and other foreign entities owned by U.S. entities or citizens. The financing program operates like an investment bank, offering customized packages for projects in countries where traditional financing is not readily available. Financing options include direct loans and loan guarantees of up to $50 million for 20 years, with specific programs for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Most financing is used for capital costs in industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation. OPIC provides financing for projects with U.S. involvement, requiring at least 25% equity from U.S.-owned entities or individuals. The financing amount varies based on financial risks and benefits, with options including direct loans and loan guarantees up to $50 million for 20 years. OPIC provides financing for projects with U.S. involvement, requiring at least 25% equity from U.S.-owned entities or individuals. The financing amount varies based on financial risks and benefits, with options including direct loans and loan guarantees up to $50 million for 20 years. OPIC limits its support to 50% of the total investment, but may provide up to 75% in certain circumstances. Rates and conditions on loans and guarantees depend on financial market conditions and risks. Investment funds are privately owned sources of capital that make direct equity investments in companies in developing markets, with OPIC supporting these funds through financing. OPIC supports investment funds through a competitive \"Call for Proposals\" process, selecting fund managers with private equity experience. These funds cover various sectors like financial services, renewable energy, and information technology. The program began in 1987 and has undergone restructuring, including the incorporation of the competitive selection process in 2002. OPIC conducts outreach to raise awareness of its programs and services for U.S. investors, offering workshops and seminars through its Expanding Horizons program. Congress sets statutory requirements for OPIC in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. OPIC investment support is not bound by the international rules of the OECD Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits. The OECD Arrangement sets guidelines for export credit agencies like the Ex-Im Bank, limiting terms and conditions. OPIC's activities are outside the Arrangement but still contribute to U.S. exports. OPIC's total contingent liability is $29 billion, with a portfolio exposure of nearly $20 billion in FY2015. OPIC's total exposure was nearly $20 billion in FY2015, with a shift towards investment financing over political risk insurance. In FY2015, OPIC made $4.4 billion in new commitments for investment projects, estimating $14.2 billion in new investment and 20,000 permanent jobs in developing or emerging markets. OPIC made $4.4 billion in new commitments for investment projects in 38 developing or emerging markets, aiming to create 20,000 permanent jobs over the next five years. The focus is on supporting U.S. jobs and foreign policy objectives, with sub-Saharan Africa receiving the largest share of commitments in FY2015. In FY2015, OPIC made new commitments for projects in low-income (33%), middle-income (46%), and high-income countries (21%). Between FY2008 and FY2014, about 34% of commitments were in low per capita income countries. The share of commitments to the poorest countries has trended downward from 2000-2014. In FY2015, OPIC increased commitments to higher-income countries in the OECD for renewable energy projects. The decline in support for the poorest countries is due to economic development trends and the prevalence of small, fragile states. OPIC's projects in FY2015 were mainly in the financial services sector (49%) and energy sector (19%), with a focus on supporting SMEs and microfinance. OPIC committed close to $1.1 billion for renewable energy projects in FY2015 across various sectors like manufacturing, infrastructure, services, agriculture, and education. OPIC is involved in various sectors including manufacturing, infrastructure, services, agriculture, education, information technology, and health. It aims to expand U.S. SME involvement in overseas investment, with nearly 75% of projects in FY2015 supported by U.S. SMEs. OPIC focuses on expanding financing for SMEs in developing countries and emerging markets. Its budget is funded from offsetting collections derived from premiums, interest, and fees generated from insurance and finance services. OPIC's budget is funded through premiums, interest, and fees from its insurance and finance services. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 governs OPIC's noncredit political risk insurance program and credit direct and guaranteed loans. Congress and the President set maximum spending levels for OPIC's administrative and program expenses. In FY2016, OPIC received $62.8 million for administrative expenses and transferred $20 million from its noncredit account for credit program costs. OPIC had 289 full-time staff equivalents in FY2016. OPIC's budget is funded through premiums, interest, and fees from its insurance and finance services. The agency has a net negative budget authority, generating $434 million in \"deficit reduction\" for the U.S. government in FY2015. OPIC's loan disbursements are financed through collections and borrowings from the Treasury. Investment guarantees are financed by issuing certificates of participation in U.S. debt capital markets. OPIC uses nonbudgetary \"financing accounts\" to manage credit program cash flow. Subsidy expenses for loans are estimated at disbursement and reestimated periodically based on updated information. OPIC reestimates subsidy costs periodically and has permanent authority to fund increases after loan disbursal. It promotes private sector investment in developing economies, managing risks through credit assessments and recoveries. Congress directs OPIC to conduct insurance operations with risk management principles in mind. OPIC budgets and accounts for risk in its credit portfolio through FCRA. OPIC budgets for risk in its credit portfolio through FCRA and offsets potential losses with reserves. It has expended more cash than collected in two fiscal years but considers significant credit events unlikely. External financial flows to developing countries come from official development assistance and private capital flows. Private capital flows from foreign companies, including foreign direct investment (FDI), have grown relative to official development assistance (ODA) in developing countries. Emerging markets and developing countries are also becoming significant sources of FDI. Bilateral and multilateral development financing institutions (DFIs) are playing a more active role in the changing international investment landscape by providing government-backed support for private sector investment in less developed countries. It is challenging to find centralized sources of information on DFI activities. The OECD Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits does not cover officially backed investment financing activities. Countries vary in transparency regarding their DFI activities. Private sector commitments to developing countries by international financial institutions increased from $10 billion in 2002 to $40 billion in 2010, and possibly $68 billion in 2013 according to estimates. Political risk insurance also plays a significant role in DFI support. The Berne Union provides statistics on political risk insurance for FDI, with members underwriting $97 billion in investment insurance transactions in 2015. Emerging economies like China, Brazil, and India are now significant players in development finance, increasing competition for U.S. businesses. Emerging economies like China, Brazil, and India pose competition for U.S. businesses seeking OPIC assistance to counter officially backed investment support from their competitors. The role of government-backed financing in markets is debated, with differences in ownership and organizational structure among DFIs like OPIC, CDC, DEG, FMO, Proparco, EBRD, and IFC. The United States houses investment and export financing functions separately in OPIC and Ex-Im Bank. OPIC focuses on foreign policy and development goals, while Ex-Im Bank is geared toward commercial goals. In contrast, some countries like Japan's JBIC conduct both investment and export financing operations in the same entity. International rules regulate investment financing activities of DFIs outside of officially supported export credits. The OECD Arrangement governs export credit activities, including payment terms, interest rates, and country risk classifications. OPIC provides investment support through loans, guarantees, and insurance, but lacks the ability to participate in private equity funds like other DFIs. At the end of 2015, EDFI and some DFIs focused on equity or quasi-equity support. DFIs also offer technical assistance. OPIC has a limited role in providing technical support. Portfolio sizes vary, with OPIC's portfolio at nearly $20 billion in FY2015 and EDFI members collectively at $39 billion. China has a significant presence in international development finance, with two policy banks providing $684 billion in loans to overseas borrowers in 2014. In 2015, China provided $49 billion in new investment support, surpassing other ECAs. DFIs support projects in various sectors, with the financial sector being the largest at 30%, followed by power (18%) and industry/manufacturing (16%). Chinese development finance mainly targets infrastructure projects. Chinese development finance focuses on infrastructure projects such as roads, rail, hospitals, schools, housing, and water and energy infrastructure, involving Chinese firms, including state-owned enterprises. Different development finance institutions have varying policy requirements for projects to receive support, with OPIC being recognized for its extensive environmental and social policies. EDFI emphasizes the importance of respecting human rights and environmental sustainability in financing projects. In terms of China's development finance regime, some projects have had negative impacts on the environment, labor, and local livelihoods due to corruption or differing standards. Congress may debate reauthorizing OPIC, examining its product offerings, policy requirements, activity composition, and structure. Congressional views vary on the justification for and against OPIC, including the length and terms of its reauthorization. Supporters argue that OPIC fills gaps in private sector political risk insurance and financing for investment, leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses. Critics claim OPIC distorts capital flow, crowding out private sector alternatives. Proponents believe OPIC is crucial for projects in developing countries and during financial crises, while opponents question its necessity as most U.S. overseas investments occur without OPIC support. Critics question the necessity of OPIC as most U.S. overseas investments occur without its support. They argue that OPIC is a form of government intervention and \"corporate welfare,\" benefiting larger companies primarily. Critics express concern about the potential risks posed to U.S. taxpayers by OPIC's activities. Some argue that OPIC supports companies with overseas investments that may lead to job outsourcing, while others believe it advances U.S. development and national security interests. There are calls for multi-year authorizations to boost confidence in OPIC's effectiveness, but shorter extensions could allow for more congressional oversight. During a lapse in authority in 2008, OPIC was unable to sign contracts for new projects, leading to a backlog of about $2 billion. Congress may consider adjusting OPIC's product offerings and debating its equity authority. OPIC is debating whether to have equity authority to make investments in private equity funds, in addition to its current debt financing. Proponents argue that this would allow OPIC to have more influence in strategic goals, attract more foreign partners, and potentially generate higher returns to support more projects. OPIC is considering whether to expand its investment authority to include equity investments, in addition to its current debt financing. Supporters believe this would enable OPIC to have more influence in strategic goals, attract more foreign partners, and potentially generate higher returns to support more projects. Critics raise concerns about the U.S. government taking an ownership stake in private enterprises, the resources required for equity investments, and the risks involved. Another point of debate is whether OPIC should have the ability to provide grants for technical assistance, with proponents arguing it would enhance effectiveness while critics worry about duplication of roles with other development agencies. OPIC's environmental policies, including GHG emission reductions, have been a subject of debate in Congress and among stakeholders. Some argue it aligns with U.S. environmental goals, while others believe it hinders U.S. businesses' competitiveness in international projects. Some stakeholders question whether OPIC's portfolio aligns with its development objectives, expressing concerns about a shift away from poverty reduction sectors towards less clear development benefits in sectors like finance and hotels. Environmental policies may be driving this trend, potentially limiting support for large-scale infrastructure projects. Environmental policies and financial risks have influenced support for large-scale infrastructure projects at OPIC. Congressional concerns have been raised about projects like a shopping mall in Jordan and hotels in Armenia and Georgia. Some argue that OPIC conducts development impact assessments and monitors project impacts. There is interest in enhancing support for specific geographical areas or sectors aligned with U.S. policy priorities. The Electrify Africa Act of 2015 directs OPIC to prioritize power projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Greater resources may increase investment capacity, but funds may not be fully utilized if U.S. firms lack commercial interest. OPIC's promotion of development finance opportunities could encourage more U.S. company engagement. Congressional considerations include OPIC's organizational structure and the proposal to consolidate trade-related agencies under the \"American Desk\" by President-elect Trump. President-elect Trump proposed consolidating trade-related agencies into the \"American Desk\" under the Department of Commerce, similar to President Obama's reorganization plan. However, Congress had concerns about its impact on the U.S. Trade Representative. Other stakeholders suggested merging agencies focused on international development or creating a \"development finance agency,\" sparking debates on cost reduction. Debates arise over reorganizing trade agencies to reduce costs and improve effectiveness. Options include privatizing or terminating OPIC, with arguments for and against its self-sustaining nature and potential risks to taxpayers. Supporters of OPIC highlight the federal government's unique role in addressing market failures. The debate over reorganizing trade agencies includes discussions on the unique role of the federal government in addressing market failures. Internal oversight of OPIC is also a point of interest, with suggestions for an OPIC-specific Inspector General. The debate over reorganizing trade agencies includes discussions on the unique role of the federal government in addressing market failures. Some suggest creating an OPIC-specific Inspector General for internal oversight, while others propose utilizing Ex-Im Bank's Inspector General for OPIC oversight. OPIC operates under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with its authorization periodically extended by Congress. The sunset date for OPIC's authority, extended by the OPIC Amendments Act of 2003, is September 30, 2007. OPIC has continued operating through extensions in appropriations law, referred to as authorization \"waivers,\" with exceptions such as a lapse in authority in 2008. Extensions have been granted through consolidated appropriations acts and continuing resolutions. For example, the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act extended OPIC's authority until September 30, 2016. The authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was extended through various legislation from 1961 to 2007, with the most recent extension being until April 28, 2017. Efforts were made to ensure the comprehensiveness of the list of legislation extending OPIC's authority, although gaps may exist. Congress extended OPIC's authority on a multi-year basis during this period. During 1961-2007, Congress extended OPIC's authority multiple times, typically for two to four years. Extensions took various forms, including specific legislation and authorization waivers in appropriations acts. These extensions allowed OPIC to continue operating without amending its sunset date in the Foreign Assistance Act. During 1961-2007, Congress extended OPIC's authority multiple times, typically for two to four years without amending its sunset date in the Foreign Assistance Act. Possible gaps in legislation extending OPIC's sunset date in 1981, 1985, and 1992 were for a few weeks to a few months, unlike the gap in 2008. It is unclear if these gaps affected OPIC's authority to conduct its functions."
