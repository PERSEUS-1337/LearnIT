    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) relies on state and local law enforcement agencies to assist in locating removable aliens. Debates over immigration enforcement have intensified, especially regarding cooperation from some agencies in notifying ICE of aliens in custody. Publicity surrounding crimes committed by unauthorized aliens has fueled these concerns. The slaying of a woman by an unauthorized alien in San Francisco, due to the failure of law enforcement to honor an ICE request to detain the criminal alien, has brought attention to sanctuary jurisdictions. These jurisdictions have varying policies that limit cooperation with ICE in enforcing immigration law, leading to debates and concerns over public safety. This report examines the relationship between the federal government (ICE) and state and local jurisdictions in enforcing immigration law, focusing on noncitizens convicted of crimes. It discusses the resources available to law enforcement agencies that cooperate with ICE, addressing the need for sanctuary jurisdictions due to resource constraints and community policing concerns. The report discusses the evolution of cooperation between federal and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, current administrative efforts, resources dedicated to these efforts, select issues, and possible policy approaches for Congress. The debate on interior immigration enforcement traditionally focused on economic and labor market issues, shifting post-9/11 to the adequacy of immigration enforcement. After the 9/11 attacks, attention turned to the adequacy of interior immigration enforcement, particularly the lack of federal resources. ICE has limited agents compared to local law enforcement agencies. ICE operates programs like the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) to target criminal aliens through cooperation with state and local agencies. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) guides CAP's efforts. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) is guided by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and includes various systems for identifying and removing incarcerated criminal aliens. ICE's \u00a7287(g) program delegates immigration enforcement functions to state and local law enforcement officers, while the National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) targets known criminal and fugitive aliens outside of controlled settings. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP) focuses on identifying and removing incarcerated criminal aliens to prevent their release from jails and prisons. CAP jail enforcement officers screen individuals for potential removal, utilizing biometric and biographic databases to prioritize removable aliens. This program aims to secure final removal orders before the end of criminal sentences and take custody of aliens upon completion of their sentences. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP) utilizes biometric and biographic databases to identify potentially removable aliens in jails and prisons. CAP officers also conduct interviews with arrestees and prisoners to gather information. Additionally, CAP collaborates with state and local correctional departments to compare inmate roster data with immigration databases. The program also manages the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC), which provides database checks on the identity and immigration status of arrestees. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) sets enforcement priorities and utilizes interoperability for biometric information sharing. ICE's Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) uses interoperability for biometric information sharing to screen potentially removable aliens. Individuals prioritized for removal must be threats to national security, border security, and public safety (Priority 1), misdemeanants and new immigration violators (Priority 2), or aliens with final removal orders on or after January 1, 2014 (Priority 3). The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) checks fingerprints against DHS's database when law enforcement agencies book an arrestee. ICE's Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) is used to match fingerprints of potential removable aliens. Matches are confirmed by ICE agents at the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) for immigration violations and criminal histories. If deemed removable, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field offices are notified for further action based on criminal convictions and enforcement priorities. Requests for removal proceedings are typically made within 48 hours of the individual's scheduled release from custody. ICE may request state and local law enforcement agencies to detain individuals flagged for removal for 48 hours after their scheduled release. ICE also uses a Request for Voluntary Transfer for cases outside of priority categorization. Priority noncriminal subcategories for transfer include aliens apprehended while attempting to illegally enter the country, unlawfully present aliens not continuously residing in the US since January 1, 2014, aliens who significantly abused visa programs, and aliens with final removal orders on or after January 1, 2014. Section 287(g) of the INA allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to delegate immigration enforcement functions to state and local agencies. In 2002, the Attorney General proposed Section 287(g) agreements with jurisdictions to assist ICE in enforcing immigration law post-9/11. These agreements allowed state and local officers to be trained for this purpose. Initially encompassing task force and jail enforcement agreements, the program now only includes jail enforcement agreements. Specially trained officers in corrections facilities can identify criminal aliens under these agreements. Local corrections facilities are authorized to identify criminal aliens by screening their biographic information against DHS databases. LEAs use ICE's database and ENFORCE to enter information about aliens in custody. ICE had Section 287(g) agreements with 32 law enforcement agencies in 16 states as of July 1, 2016. Funding for CAP and Secure Communities/Interoperability rose from $6 million. The funding for CAP and Secure Communities/Interoperability for criminal aliens increased significantly from $6 million in FY2004 to $392.5 million in FY2010, before decreasing to $317.2 million in FY2016. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for these programs was $371.5 million. The Section 287(g) program funding peaked at $68 million from FY2010 to FY2013, but has since declined to $24 million in recent years. ICE prioritizes the removal of certain criminal aliens, and incarceration data at federal, state, and local levels is examined as a measure of criminality. At the end of CY2014, noncitizens accounted for 11.2% of individuals incarcerated in federal prisons and 3.5% in state prisons. Overall, noncitizens represented 4.6% of the incarcerated population in CY2014, compared to 7.0% of the total U.S. population in 2014. Noncitizens made up 11.2% of federal prisoners and 3.5% of state prisoners in 2014. Drug offenders accounted for 50% of federal inmates, with noncitizens slightly lower at 46%. Immigration offenders comprised 12% of federal inmates, but 43% of noncitizen offenders. Drug and immigration offenses made up 90% of noncitizen federal offenses in 2013. Sanctuary jurisdictions began limiting their policies in 2011. Sanctuary jurisdictions started to define their roles regarding immigration enforcement by limiting cooperation with ICE, restricting information sharing, and using local funds for enforcement. This was in response to increased removals of unauthorized aliens with minor criminal records and court decisions on ICE detainers violating the Fourth Amendment. The Obama Administration replaced Secure Communities with the Priority Enforcement Program in November 2014 due to concerns that holding an alien based solely on an ICE detainer could violate the Fourth Amendment. This change led to increased cooperation from sanctuary jurisdictions with ICE enforcement measures, allowing for custom-tailored immigration enforcement mechanisms that comply with local ordinances and preferences. ICE also amended its detainer forms to specify the basis for determining an individual alien's removal eligibility. ICE implemented the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) to improve cooperation with sanctuary jurisdictions in enforcing immigration laws. PEP has led to over 275 jurisdictions honoring ICE detainer requests. However, there have been challenges, with state and local agencies declining 16,495 immigration detainers between January 2014 and June 2015. This has resulted in convicted criminals being released back into communities, requiring more ICE agents to locate and arrest them. Since the 9/11 attacks, there has been a focus on enforcing immigration laws, leading to debates on the role of state and local law enforcement in this enforcement. Critics argue that requiring law enforcement agencies to notify ICE when an alien is in custody could harm the relationship with immigrant communities. This debate also extends to the challenges faced by ICE agents in locating and arresting criminal aliens released back into communities. Critics argue that requiring law enforcement agencies to notify ICE when an alien is in custody could harm the relationship with immigrant communities. Proponents believe that state and local law enforcement agents can enhance ICE's enforcement efforts by facilitating the removal of potential criminals who are illegally present in the country. The issue of resources is a perennial concern for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. ICE has 7,300 personnel in its Enforcement and Removal Operations program to identify, apprehend, detain, and remove aliens. Under PEP, ICE issues requests for notification to state and local jails to be notified of release dates. However, some jurisdictions are restricting LEAs from notifying ICE, hampering their ability to carry out duties and increasing the need for personnel and personal risk for ICE agents. State and local law enforcement agencies, totaling over 605,000 personnel, are seen as a \"force multiplier\" for ICE in apprehending criminal aliens in communities. Critics argue that using local resources for federal immigration enforcement could deplete funding for other law enforcement purposes, potentially harming communities. Congress could provide additional funding to support state and local agencies in enforcing immigration laws. Congress could limit funding to states and localities that refuse to cooperate with ICE on immigration enforcement. Grant programs from DOJ and DHS could incentivize cooperation from state and local law enforcement. The 114th Congress proposed legislation to restrict federal grants for jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE. The House passed H.R. 3009 on July 23, 2015, penalizing states and localities that restrict cooperation with ICE by withholding funding for DOJ grant programs. Amendments in other bills also aimed to prohibit federal funds to jurisdictions limiting law enforcement agents. The Senate failed to pass a bill on October 20, 2015, that would have made sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for certain federal grants and sought to ensure states and localities had the authority to carry out detainers. Other measures considered would have restricted federal funding to cities that decline to honor detainers and increased penalties for migrants who illegally reenter the country. S. 3100 and S. 2193 aimed to restrict federal grants for sanctuary jurisdictions and increase penalties for unauthorized aliens reentering the country. The Senate did not pass a cloture motion to consider either bill."
