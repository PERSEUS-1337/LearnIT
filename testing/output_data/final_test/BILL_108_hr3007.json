    "content": "The \"Universal Prekindergarten Act\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds that high-quality prekindergarten programs lead to academic success, reduce juvenile delinquency rates, and there is a shortage of affordable early education programs for working families. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all children aged 3, 4, and 5 have access to high-quality full-day, full-calendar-year prekindergarten programs through grants to States. Research shows investing in prekindergarten programs leads to savings in reduced remedial education, crime rates, school dropout rates, and welfare dependence. The Act authorizes grants for high-quality universal prekindergarten programs for children aged 3, 4, and 5. Each state's designated agency will receive funding for this purpose. State Matching Funds: Federal funds allocated to a State agency must be matched with at least 20% State funds. State agencies must submit an application detailing coordination with other agencies for prekindergarten programs and a plan for a statewide program.

SEC. 7. REPORTING. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit an annual report to Congress on the universal prekindergarten program's implementation and effectiveness. Designated State agencies providing grants must also submit annual reports to the Secretary. Grant recipients must submit annual reports to the State agency detailing program implementation. The grant program requires detailed information including the type of program, number and ages of children served, staff qualifications, funding sources, curriculum used, and any additional information requested by the State agency. Federal funds provided under this Act must not replace other Federal, State, local, or private funds that would otherwise support the program. The Act defines terms like \"eligible prekindergarten program provider\" as schools, Head Start programs, or child care providers, and \"prekindergarten program\" as serving children aged 3-5 to prepare them for kindergarten. It also clarifies the meaning of \"local educational agency\" and \"prekindergarten teacher.\" The term \"prekindergarten teacher\" refers to an individual with a bachelor of arts degree in early childhood education.
