    "content": "Green procurement encompasses various practices and criteria, with terms like \"environmentally preferable,\" \"sustainable,\" and \"socially responsible\" used interchangeably. It involves purchasing products with specific attributes like energy efficiency or recycled materials. The report develops a conceptual framework for green procurement policy issues, drawing from public and private sector initiatives. It discusses examples from federal programs and states, aiming to address uncertainties and confusion in the concept of green procurement. Green products and services have a smaller environmental footprint than the industry average. Green procurement involves acquiring these products and services, as well as implementing practices to reduce environmental impact. The industry average is not considered green in this context. The threshold for something to be considered green changes as products and practices become standard within an industry. Most products acquired through procurement are subject to environmental constraints. Practices with lower impact than the current standard may not be sustainable in the long term. Green procurement practices aim to have a small environmental footprint that does not hinder future human activity or ecosystem functioning. This includes striving for zero net environmental impact, as seen in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007's goal of zero net energy use by 2030 for new federal buildings. In some cases, products or services may even have a positive environmental impact, such as buildings that generate more energy than they consume. However, the evolving nature of green procurement can pose challenges for implementation. The evolving nature of green procurement poses challenges for implementation, making it a moving target with industry averages. However, incorporating a fixed target like zero impact is possible, aligning with the practice of continual improvement. Consensus standards are regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to evolving technology and requirements, encouraged by federal laws and sometimes referenced by states in building codes and procurement requirements. The use of green as a relative concept in green procurement allows for broad application of practices and standards to different products and services, adaptation to specific conditions, use of performance standards over design standards, gradual reduction in environmental impact, and avoidance of defining green in a fixed or absolute sense. Issues may arise when applying a relative approach to green procurement, as it can lead to difficulties in setting specific goals, assessing green practices, and measuring progress. For example, determining what constitutes a green percentage of recycled content in paper products can vary depending on the average content in the market. This can make it challenging for manufacturers and buyers to conform to green standards and evaluate products effectively. Setting specific green goals can be challenging, especially when determining what constitutes a green percentage of recycled content in paper products. To address objections, documentary standards and green labels can be used to indicate conformance. Green practices involve integrating multiple factors across a product's life cycle, allowing for continuous improvement even after reaching maximum levels in one area. The term green in this report captures various meanings from stakeholders clearly and consistently. Green procurement is broader than environmentally preferable procurement (EPP) and includes zero-impact initiatives. EPP refers to specific programs, while green procurement encompasses a variety of approaches. Green procurement is multidimensional, involving an integrated evaluation of criteria such as cost, performance, and impact of a product or service with respect to green factors over the entire life cycle. The stages of the product or service life cycle include research and design, raw materials acquisition, manufacturing, distribution, operation or use, and disposal. The relative importance of these stages varies depending on the product or service. The acquisition of services may indirectly involve green practices, such as using environmentally friendly products. This can have direct consequences for the service recipient, such as health effects from chemicals in non-green products. All products and services undergo a design stage before production, which may include research and development. The design stage of product development involves significant research and development efforts, with potential environmental impacts. Green characteristics are more effective when integrated into the design rather than added later. This stage is often overlooked in discussions of green procurement, but institutional programs can influence custom-designed acquisitions. Assessment of ready-made products and services can determine their level of environmental design. Green procurement involves selecting products that are specifically designed to reduce environmental impacts throughout their life cycle and facilitate recycling. The materials used in manufacturing a product can greatly affect its environmental footprint, with practices such as mining and logging varying in impact. Green guidelines aim to reduce these impacts by changing sourcing processes, increasing the use of recycled and renewable resources, and implementing programs to reduce pollution and promote sustainability. The impacts of manufacturing processes vary in efficiency, waste generation, and environmental effects. Manufacturers can reduce these impacts through improvements in energy use and lean manufacturing techniques. The distribution stage involves packaging, marketing, transportation, storage, and sales of products or services. During the distribution stage, buyers can assess costs and impacts of potential acquisitions for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and services. Various government and private entities offer aids to help buyers identify green COTS products, such as databases provided by the EPA and information on green products from the GSA. The USDA also has an online catalogue of biobased products. The USDA has an online catalogue of biobased products under its BioPreferred program. States like California, Pennsylvania, and Washington, as well as organizations like NACO and Green Seal, provide guides for buyers to identify green products. Private-sector organizations like the Green Electronics Council also offer lists of products. Large institutions have greater capability to ensure green practices in the life cycle of custom products. The federal government, large states, and major corporations have the buying power to leverage green goals. Various impacts may occur, such as energy and water use, off-gassing of harmful chemicals, and inefficient practices like wasteful printing and vehicle maintenance. Product lifespan also varies, with some being disposable like cellular phones. Product lifespan varies, with some designed for short use like disposable cellular phones, while others like modular computers are meant for repair and upgrades. The fate of products after use includes being discarded, refurbished, or recycled, each with varying environmental impacts. Reuse and recycling are generally preferred, but the processes can differ significantly in their impact. The impact of disposal processes varies significantly. E-waste, such as computers and electronics, may be recycled or exported, posing health risks to workers and the environment. Product takeback programs, like automobile trade-ins, aim to reduce environmental footprint by recycling or reusing disposed items. Green factors influencing environmental impact include inputs and effects. Inputs discussed in this report include energy, materials, and water, while environmental effects include those on ecosystems, health, and waste production. Energy is a key green factor due to its economic importance and environmental impacts. The operation stage is where energy input can be measured and controlled, with most product ratings focusing on energy use. Energy conservation programs like Energy Star focus on use energy, with ratings like AFUE for furnaces and SEER for air conditioning. Embedded energy refers to energy used during other life cycle stages, while embodied energy may encompass all energy used throughout the life cycle. The Department of Energy defines embodied energy as all energy used, including use energy. Embedded energy is the energy used during life cycle stages other than use and operation. It may be substantial, such as in the case of concrete exterior walls with high embedded energy compared to wood. There is no widely accepted methodology for applying embedded energy to purchasing decisions, and some argue for integrated life cycle assessments to capture the total energy footprint. The nature of energy sources used complicates measuring embedded energy. The choice of energy sources used complicates measuring embedded energy in products. Materials used can significantly impact a product's environmental footprint, affecting resource depletion, pollution, embodied energy, and health. Green materials may have recycled content, be made from renewable resources, or use processes with low energy and pollutant outputs. Embedded impacts of products may be of greater importance than use impacts, especially for materials like paper. Water is a critical resource with varying importance depending on the product or service. For example, the water impact of producing leather shoes is much higher than that of paper or microchips. Water is a critical resource with varying importance depending on the product or service. Embedded impacts are difficult to assess accurately for individual products due to regional variations in water supply and contamination levels. Green-procurement focuses on the use stage, with standards and labeling programs promoting water-efficient plumbing fixtures. Rebate incentives for water efficiency have also been established. Attempts have been made to develop measures of embodied water, such as the \"water footprint,\" to assess the impacts of products and services on ecosystems for green procurement. Humans rely on ecosystem services for freshwater, food, and other products, making it challenging to assess direct and indirect effects across all life cycle stages. Several factors can influence the health impacts of products and services, including materials used like heavy metals, VOCs, asbestos, and radiation. The quality of lighting, climate control equipment, and ergonomic furniture design also play a role. Health impacts can occur at various stages, such as during manufacturing and disposal. Raw material acquisition and processing can pose health risks. Waste reduction is essential. Waste reduction is a key aspect of green purchasing programs as wastes can have toxic, flammable, or corrosive properties. In 2007, over 46 million tons of hazardous wastes were generated in the United States. Even nonhazardous wastes can be harmful due to energy consumption for disposal, impacts on ecosystems, and resource depletion. The chemical manufacturing industry was responsible for producing more than two-thirds of U.S. hazardous waste in 2007. Impacts from wastes can occur at various stages of a product or service's life cycle, not just during disposal. An integrated assessment is necessary for informed decisions on acquiring products or services, considering cost, performance, and environmental impact. Criteria like availability and reversibility of impacts must be considered. Individual impacts across all life cycle stages need to be integrated for an overall characterization of impact. Some toxins persist longer in the environment and accumulate in organisms, while others are quickly metabolized. Depletion of nonrenewable resources is irreversible. Green purchasing evaluations consider total life cycle costs, including hidden and indirect costs like disposal and medical expenses. Price alone may be misleading in decision-making. The company rejected a new, environmentally superior cleaning fluid due to a higher cost per gallon without considering potential savings. Externalities like erosion from agroforestry practices can have broader costs not reflected in product prices. Performance must be balanced with environmental impact for cost-effectiveness in green purchasing decisions. Green procurement may lead to the acquisition of superior products and services in performance compared to standard ones. Evaluating options in green procurement involves integrating criteria across green factors and life cycle stages, including a life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyze environmental impacts from creation to disposal. Life cycle assessment (LCA) involves evaluating environmental impacts from creation to disposal. International standards like ISO 14040 and 14044 exist for such assessments, with a U.S. standard (SCS-002) in development. LCA includes defining goals, inventorying inputs and effects, assessing impacts, and evaluating results. Tools like BEES from NIST aid in making assessments, applicable beyond green building projects. Life cycle analysis, such as the cradle-to-cradle approach, aims to connect the end and beginning of product cycles. It helps evaluate interactions and trade-offs among factors and stages, like the impact of energy-efficient products on indoor air quality in buildings. Another example is the comparison between incandescent and fluorescent lightbulbs. The comparison between incandescent and fluorescent lightbulbs focuses on the energy efficiency and environmental impact, particularly regarding the presence of mercury in fluorescent bulbs. Life cycle analyses show that despite the energy efficiency of fluorescent bulbs, more mercury is released into the environment over the life cycle of incandescent bulbs, especially in areas where electricity is generated from coal. Trade-offs between concrete and wood in building materials also highlight the importance of considering factors like durability and environmental impacts. The conceptual model depicts relationships among green factors, life cycle stages, and evaluation criteria. A complex assessment would need to be done for each candidate in an acquisition, comparing results to make a decision. The model may be limited in practical usefulness for customers making purchase decisions, but it illustrates central features of green procurement and the difficulties involved. The discussion above highlights the challenges in accurately assessing green procurement, including limited information availability and difficulty in comparing alternative products. Trusted third parties can use such analyses to determine if products meet green certification criteria. Standard models and techniques can facilitate assessments for green procurement policy considerations. The term green procurement encompasses various approaches to acquiring products and services with a reduced environmental impact. Assessing a product or service involves evaluating multiple factors throughout its life cycle, considering interactions and trade-offs among different green factors. Assessing green procurement involves evaluating multiple factors throughout a product or service's life cycle, considering interactions and trade-offs among different green factors. This process can be complex due to difficulties in accurately assessing information for elements involved. Green procurement initiatives often prioritize attributes like recycled content, energy efficiency, water use, waste reduction, and reduction in hazardous chemicals. Green procurement initiatives prioritize attributes like recycled content, energy efficiency, water use, waste reduction, and reduction in hazardous chemicals. Implementation of green procurement can be complicated by factors such as legal requirements and commitments. Various approaches, including third-party labeling and certification programs like Energy Star and EPEAT, have been developed by government and private-sector organizations. Several third-party labeling and certification programs, such as EPEAT, Green Seal, and Cradle to Cradle, have been developed to promote green products and services. These programs aim to recognize environmentally friendly producers and encourage sustainable practices. Over 80 labels for green products are used in North America, with over 300 worldwide, indicating a growing trend in the use of eco-friendly certifications. The quality and emphasis of these labels may vary, with some based on technical standards recognized by organizations like ANSI or the International Organization for Standardization. Labels and certifications, such as ANSI or ISO, are developed through a consensus process and may be based on internal criteria. Quality control is crucial to ensure accurate environmental performance representation. Some labels focus on specific factors like energy or water use, with evaluations typically during the operations stage. This simplicity aids user understanding but may hide trade-offs. Green products and services may cost more than standard equivalents, but higher acquisition costs can be offset by other savings. The federal government and many organizations use third-party labels and standards for green procurement decisions instead of conducting assessments themselves. Broad, integrative standards like EPEAT and Cradle-to-Cradle may be difficult to develop and maintain, leading to their limited applicability and potential obsolescence. Some organizations use price premiums to address higher acquisition costs of green products. This approach allows purchasers to pay a slightly higher price for products meeting green criteria, overcoming the challenge of economies of scale keeping prices high in a small market. However, this may reduce price-competitive incentives among providers. Green price premiums range from 3%-15% in state and municipal programs but are not used in federal green procurement. This approach is declining in use. Some organizations are using life cycle cost analyses to determine if savings at other stages compensate for higher acquisition costs of green products. State and local governments are shifting towards a \"best-value\" approach in procurement decisions, considering factors beyond price like performance and environmental impact. Implementation methods include setting broad policy goals, training programs, and forming cross-functional \"green teams.\" The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of cross-functional \"green teams\" and modifying specifications to include green attributes in procurement. Tools have been developed to estimate the effects of green procurement, focusing on planning rather than performance assessment. The challenge lies in determining the success of green procurement programs in reducing environmental impacts while maintaining cost-effectiveness and performance. The success of green procurement programs in reducing environmental impacts is challenging to measure. Little information is available on the impacts of these programs, with only 20% of organizations quantifying their effects. The Green Electronics Council is improving assessments by requiring EPEAT subscribers to report sales of labeled products to estimate reductions in toxic materials, solid waste, and energy use. In 2001, a survey found that only a small percentage of federal agencies had green procurement initiatives, with obstacles including lack of awareness and conflicting priorities. A 2009 survey showed that only 20% of organizations had established goals for green procurement. In 2009, a survey showed a significant increase in green procurement initiatives, but with no clear improvement in performance. The city of Portland conducted case studies on the costs and benefits of green purchasing practices, finding environmental benefits and cost savings in various product categories. Several barriers exist to the broader adoption of green procurement practices by organizations and consumers, including information barriers related to lack of knowledge and incorrect information. Training, education, regulations, and guidelines can help address these barriers. The lack of widely accepted assessment and implementation standards for green procurement practices can create controversy and confusion, hindering adoption and policy goals. Efforts to develop Life Cycle Analysis standards may help overcome this barrier, but widespread acceptance is necessary. Barriers to green procurement adoption include cost premiums, cost externalities, and misaligned financial interests. Uncertainties revolve around market demand stability, technology effectiveness, and reluctance to invest in nonstandard products. Federal initiatives for green purchasing can be categorized into agency-focused and market-focused programs. These programs aim to facilitate the procurement of green products and services by federal agencies and promote the availability of green products in the broader economy. Programs like Energy Star and BioPreferred, which are market-focused, can also impact federal acquisitions. Information on green initiatives for federal procurement, such as EPP, may be accessible through agency websites. The availability of green products and services in the marketplace can be influenced by agency-focused initiatives, such as EPP, which are accessible through agency websites. Federal procurement operations, with a budget of about $500 billion per year, have the potential to impact the green economy significantly. Most of the focus is on agency-focused initiatives rather than market-focused programs, although some federal initiatives have market-focused components administered by EPA and other agencies. The Federal Trade Commission has developed resources like the Green Guides to assist consumers in acquiring green products. Federal efforts in green procurement focus on acquiring products and began with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. There is no comprehensive central federal source for accessing information on green products and services. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 set requirements for federal purchase of products with recovered or recycled content. Various statutes, regulations, and agency programs have since encouraged federal agencies to purchase products with specified environmental attributes. Currently, there are eight preferences for environmentally friendly products, including alternative fuels, biobased products, and energy-efficient products. Currently, federal agencies are required to purchase environmentally friendly products such as alternative fuels, biobased products, energy-efficient products, EPEAT products, and products with recovered or recycled materials. These preferences aim to promote green procurement, with EPP and EPEAT offering an integrative approach. However, most preferences only apply to products, despite services accounting for half of federal procurement spending. The Obama Administration's Office of Federal Procurement Policy emphasizes green purchasing, including recycled materials, energy-efficient products, and water-saving processes. Energy-efficiency preferences also apply to services, such as energy-savings performance contracts with energy service companies. The Obama Administration's Office of Federal Procurement Policy emphasizes green purchasing, including recycled materials, energy-efficient products, and water-saving processes. EPA defines green procurement as preventing waste and pollution by considering environmental impacts when making purchasing decisions. OMB provides guidance through various policy instruments for implementing green procurement requirements. The Obama Administration's Office of Federal Procurement Policy promotes green purchasing, including recycled materials, energy-efficient products, and water-saving processes. Specific agencies like DOE, EPA, and USDA set preferences and criteria for green procurement. EPA is designated as the lead agency for hazardous substances, and there are government databases listing green products. EPA's WaterSense-labeled products and programs are recommended for water-efficiency requirements, and DOE provides guidance on alternative fuels. EPEAT, a private-sector program, was developed with EPA's assistance. The EPA, USDA, and GSA provide databases listing green products and services for government agencies and the public to make green-purchasing decisions. The EPA lists EPP products, SNAP alternatives, and WaterSense products. The USDA lists renewable biobased products under its BioPreferred label. The GSA offers access to green products through its purchasing system, identifying products according to various standards and criteria. The GSA is responsible for disposing of surplus equipment and property designated as personal property by federal agencies. There are no provisions for GSA to recycle such property if not transferred or sold, with unused property returned to the originating agency for disposal. Agencies may have recycling procedures in place. The GSA online catalog and EPA's EPP database offer over 20 green product certifications and labels, covering various green factors. Most labels focus on one or two attributes, with some referring to specific standards by different agencies and organizations. The GSA schedule includes four general green standards: Recycled, Biobased, Non-Toxic, and Environmentally Friendly. The EPA database provides links to lists, including the GSA schedule, for green product choices. The Office of the Federal Environmental Executive offers a database of green products designated by EPA, USDA, and DOE, covering various green factors. It is challenging to gauge the extent of federal green-purchasing requirements application due to varying agency procurement levels. The Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for the majority of federal procurement spending in FY2008, significantly more than any other agency. DOD's dominance was evident in key areas like transportation equipment, information technology, and building construction, which are the focus of federal green-procurement initiatives. The most comprehensive green procurement initiatives are currently in information technology. Reporting requirements for green procurement activities are mainly qualitative, with no broad federal mandate in place. Federal agencies do not have a broad requirement for reporting their green purchases, but quantitative reporting is needed for recycled content and alternative fuels preferences. Purchases totaling $35.9 billion in FY2008 were reported, with about 7% of total procurement expenditures. Less than 1% of purchases, totaling $333 million, were exempt due to performance, price, or time constraints. Data is limited as many relevant purchases are not included. Agencies are required to report annually on vehicle acquisitions and fuel consumption for alternative fuels. Federal agencies largely met or exceeded requirements for green purchasing in FY2007, acquiring almost twice the required number of alternative fuel vehicles and surpassing the target for alternative fuel consumption by nearly 20%. A 2009 report to Congress confirmed agency compliance with green purchasing requirements, with all agencies having formal plans in place. For example, the Department of Defense has a comprehensive department-wide strategy for green procurement. Federal agencies have green procurement plans integrated with their environmental management systems. The Defense Logistics Agency offers a database and reporting capability for green procurement. DOE guidance requires integration of plans with EMS and includes reporting requirements. Agencies are monitoring compliance and developing corrective actions. New requirements are being drafted for FPDS-NG to capture green-purchasing data routinely. OMB tracks green procurement programs through agency submissions for performance scorecards on energy, transportation, and environment. Agencies receive green, yellow, or red scores based on their environmental performance. Only four agencies scored green in January 2009, with deficiencies noted in GSA's green procurement auditing and compliance monitoring. The discussion raises policy issues for Congress to consider in examining federal efforts in green procurement. Questions include defining useful policy goals, evaluating the effectiveness of current programs, assessing agency implementation and performance, and ensuring harmonization and integration of green procurement preferences. The issues surrounding green procurement requirements and initiatives are explored below, including gaps in federal preferences, implementation methods, and training of procurement officials. These initiatives aim to reduce the environmental footprint, achieve cost savings, promote green industries, and facilitate the development of the green economy. Federal programs could play a role in meeting these goals by providing better ways to achieve them. Federal programs could help meet green procurement goals by facilitating the maturation of life cycle assessment methods and developing standards. Some observers question if green procurement is the right focus for federal policy, but an assessment should evaluate the appropriateness of goals established in statutes and executive orders from past administrations. An examination of green procurement and other relevant concepts, including whether they should be defined in legislation, might be considered as part of an assessment of policy goals. The method used to establish a green-procurement policy can impact its implementation and flexibility. Statutory requirements like recycled content and alternative fuels are likely to be more fully implemented than conditional preferences. Alternative fuels are more likely to be fully implemented than conditional preferences like EPP established by executive order. Policy documents offer flexibility but less stability, as they can be modified or revoked by the executive branch without congressional input. Statutes provide stability as Congress must enact legislation to change them, but changing statutes can make it difficult for the government to adjust policies when external conditions change, especially if the statute sets a fixed design standard. The use of alternative fuels may hinder the adoption of better energy alternatives. Design standards are easier to implement than performance standards. Executive orders and regulations can be changed without congressional action, giving primary authority to the executive branch for green procurement requirements. Congress and the public have opportunities to review and comment on proposed regulations. Congress may consider modifying green procurement preferences and programs to ensure their effectiveness. Current methods for tracking agencies' performance focus on processes rather than outcomes, lacking quantitative measures of results. Statutory authority has been established for preferences for biobased products, aligning with existing executive orders and regulations. The effectiveness of green procurement preferences and programs may be hindered by a lack of quantitative measures to assess outcomes. Fragmented reporting requirements make it challenging for Congress to evaluate agencies' success in integrated green-procurement activities. Agency environmental management systems could aid in performance tracking if agencies collect relevant life cycle data on acquisitions. OMB has directed agencies to consider life cycle costs in procurement planning, but the adequacy of the information collected for EMS analyses is unclear. The effectiveness of green procurement preferences and programs may be hindered by a lack of quantitative measures to assess outcomes. While performance assessment is important for determining program implementation, it does not evaluate if programs meet intended policy goals. An independent examination of program success in meeting broader policy goals could be useful for Congress in decision-making. The federal government's ability to leverage green products and services through purchasing power is limited to contracts for solid waste management valued over $10,000. Broadening the use of green products in service contracts could stimulate green industries, but the cost and effectiveness of such efforts are unclear. Previous proposals aimed to extend green product preferences to additional service contracts, but none have been implemented yet. The George W. Bush Administration proposed requiring contractors to use green products in service contracts, even if not related to supply. The federal government has limited ability to use green products in service contracts, with previous proposals to extend preferences to additional contracts not yet implemented. President Obama's Executive Order on green procurement may have a similar effect, but the approach remains fragmented and lacks clear guidance from Congress. The emphasis has been on single-attribute preferences, with the exception of Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) potentially serving as a framework for a more integrated approach. The federal government lacks clear guidance on green procurement, with preferences implemented as weak and fragmented. There is ambiguity on which green products agencies should procure, with no specific guidance on various types of preferred products. Agencies are left without direction on whether to procure Energy Star or FEMP-designated products, or recovered-content or environmentally preferable products. The federal government lacks clear guidance on green procurement, with preferences implemented as weak and fragmented. An interagency mechanism like the Interagency Sustainability Steering Committee could address these issues. However, gaps exist in the coverage of green factors and life cycle approach, such as the focus on operational energy over life cycle energy, lack of preference for water use, and absence of specific green requirements. The federal government lacks clear guidance on green procurement, with weak and fragmented preferences. There are gaps in coverage of green factors and life cycle approach, such as the absence of specific green requirements for end-of-life management for government property like information technology. Additionally, there is no single, well-coordinated list of green products for federal agencies to use, leading to significant gaps in preferences and hindering the federal green procurement process. The federal government lacks clear guidance on green procurement, with weak and fragmented preferences. Some foreign, state, and local governments have mechanisms for implementing green procurement that the federal government does not use. Congress could promote additional implementing mechanisms to address gaps in green procurement. The federal government may struggle to implement green procurement requirements, especially those related to environmentally preferable products, due to the complexity of considering multiple product attributes. Agencies might need information on vendors' production methods to make informed purchasing decisions. Proposed requirements focusing on sustainability or life cycle costs could also pose implementation challenges."
