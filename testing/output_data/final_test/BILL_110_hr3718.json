    "content": "The \"Educational Advisor and Contractor Integrity Act\" is aimed at preventing conflicts of interest in education by amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include measures to address this issue. The Secretary will establish a screening process to address conflicts of interest for individuals considered for advisory committees related to the administration of the Educational Advisor and Contractor Integrity Act. This process will consider past or present affiliations with organizations promoting pedagogical practices. The screening process for advisory committee members under the Educational Advisor and Contractor Integrity Act will consider affiliations with organizations promoting specific products or services, involvement with educational agencies receiving funds, and financial interests that could compromise advice integrity. The Secretary may grant an exemption for individuals with conflicts of interest on advisory committees if it does not compromise integrity. The Secretary may grant exemptions for conflicts of interest on advisory committees if sufficiently mitigated and reasonable efforts were made to find alternate individuals. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on any exemptions granted, including the identity of exempted individuals and a detailed description of the conflict of interest. The Secretary must work with the Office of Government Ethics to develop policies and procedures addressing conflicts of interest on advisory committees. This includes efforts to identify alternate individuals and detailed conflict mitigation measures. The Secretary must collaborate with the Office of Government Ethics to establish conflict of interest policies for advisory committees, such as implementing a new confidential financial disclosure form. Special government employees on advisory committees are subject to relevant regulations. Consultation with the Committee Management Secretariat is required before convening advisory groups to ensure compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary must establish conflict of interest policies for advisory committees, including a screening process for technical assistance providers to address conflicts of interest. This process considers various factors to ensure compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The entity must disclose any past or present affiliations with organizations promoting specific products or services, involvement with educational agencies receiving funds under the Act, or financial interests that could compromise technical assistance integrity within the last 3 years. The Secretary requires potential technical assistance providers to show evidence of adopting conflict of interest policies and disclose any conflicts before awarding a contract. All technical assistance contracts must include terms for fully implementing conflict of interest policies. The provider must implement conflict of interest policies, ensure subcontractors follow the same policies, and report any conflicts to the Secretary within 10 days. The Secretary will monitor compliance with these policies. The Secretary will continually monitor technical assistance providers to ensure proper implementation of conflict of interest policies. The term 'technical assistance provider' includes contractors and their subsidiaries, subcontractors, employees, and affiliates. The Secretary must fulfill these duties within 180 days of this section's enactment."
