    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Environmental Research Act of 2014\" establishes a program for ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmospheric research to support renewable energy. The \"Renewable Energy Environmental Research Act of 2014\" defines key terms such as Administration, Administrator, and renewable energy, including various sources like wave energy and offshore wind energy. The Administrator is required to develop a plan within 3 years of the Act's enactment to support renewable energy development in the US by defining requirements for an integrated ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmosphere science program, identifying current climate, weather, and water data programs, and providing targeted research and information for renewable energy and smart grid technology. The plan aims to accurately quantify the micro-climate impacts of wind-power turbines, reduce duplication by coordinating with various entities, facilitate public-private cooperation, and educate the public and private sector on renewable energy research progress. The Administrator will provide public notice and hold hearings to gather input from various stakeholders on renewable energy development to enhance climate, weather, and water observation data products and services. Establishment of a research, prediction, and environmental information program. The Administrator will establish a program to support renewable energy development in the United States, including improvements in research and monitoring for renewable energy siting, as well as weather, water, and climate prediction capabilities for decision services in support of renewable energy development. The program supports renewable energy development, reliable delivery of weather, water, and climate products, identifies ecological effects of marine renewable energy, conducts baseline ecological characterization, and implements strategies to address potential impacts on marine habitats. Support for the development of marine special area management plans by states to facilitate renewable energy development while protecting natural resources and coastal-dependent economic growth. Coordination of digital mapping and modeling for planning renewable energy projects and environmental stewardship. The program supports planning for renewable energy and stewardship of ecosystems in ocean, Great Lakes, and coastal areas. It includes examining micro-climate impacts of wind-power farms and providing outreach to the public and private sector. Data collected will be used by resource managers for decision-making on renewable energy projects. The program supports planning for renewable energy in ocean, Great Lakes, and coastal areas. Engineers and government agencies will consider this information for decision-making. The Administrator will seek public-private cooperation to expand information services for the renewable energy industry. The Administrator will submit biennial reports to relevant committees on progress in implementing the Act, including activities, recommendations for prioritization, and funding levels. Additionally, there is a section on the library in the Act. The Administrator, in consultation with relevant Federal agencies, will establish a renewable energy information library and data portal within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The library will include links to data and information products, planning tools, baseline ocean and coastal resources data, and digital mapping services. Federal coordination is also addressed in the Act. The Administrator will work with various Federal agencies to establish a renewable energy information library and data portal. Federal coordination is required for the implementation of the Act. The Administrator has the authority to enter into agreements and receive funds to carry out the purposes of the Act. The Administrator has the authority to receive funds for activities under the Act. Offshore facilities can use platforms for ocean observation sensors, with data managed by the Administration for hazard response and public access. SEC. 12. SAVINGS PROVISION. This Act does not override the jurisdiction, responsibilities, or authority of any Federal or State agency under existing laws."
