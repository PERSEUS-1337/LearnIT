    "content": "Disaster-damaged roads and public transportation systems are eligible for federal assistance under two U.S. Department of Transportation programs, the Emergency Relief Program administered by the Federal Highway Administration and the Public Transportation ER Program administered by the Federal Transit Administration. Both programs aim to restore infrastructure to predisaster conditions and address resilience projects. The report discusses FHWA assistance for repairing highways and bridges damaged by disasters or catastrophic failures. The Emergency Relief Program administered by the Federal Highway Administration provides federal aid for the emergency repair and restoration of disaster-damaged roads, including federally owned public-use roadways. The program has been in place for over 80 years, with the first legislation authorizing such use of federal funds dating back to 1934. Additionally, the Federal Transit Administration's assistance program has provided aid to public transportation systems after disasters like Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the 2017 hurricanes. The Emergency Relief Program, established in 1956, initially funded repairs with 40% from the Treasury's general fund and 60% from the Highway Trust Fund. By 1979, it was fully funded by the HTF. In 1998, Congress made the $100 million HTF authorization permanent. From 2005, supplemental appropriations were authorized from the general fund. The program was reauthorized through FY2020 in the FAST Act. The Emergency Relief Program, established in 1956, is funded by the Highway Trust Fund and the Treasury's general fund. It provides funds for repairing federal-aid highways and roads on federally owned lands damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. State departments of transportation administer the program in coordination with FHWA's division offices. Local officials can seek ER funding through state departments of transportation. ER assistance for roads and bridges on federally owned lands is managed through the Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads program. FHWA dispenses funds through federal land management agencies, not states. Aid is limited to facilities open to the public for use with standard vehicles, with FHWA covering 100% of approved repair costs. The program is designed to address unusually heavy expenses. The Emergency Relief (ER) program covers a portion of approved repair costs for federally owned roads and bridges, supplementing agencies' repair programs. Tribal, state, and government entities must apply through a federal land management agency. Managed by FHWA's Office of Federal Lands Highways, the program has a permanent annual authorization of $100 million from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), with additional funds available as needed under the FAST Act. The Emergency Relief (ER) program provides funds for repair costs of federally owned roads and bridges. States receive reimbursement after making repairs and submitting vouchers to FHWA. The program has a $100 million annual authorization from the Highway Trust Fund, with additional funds available as needed. The funding structure includes a modest annual authorization supplemented by appropriations to address small disaster events occurring every year. The Emergency Relief program has a $100 million annual authorization from the Highway Trust Fund, but its value has diminished over time. Congress faces a decision on whether to increase the permanent authorization or rely on supplemental appropriations for highway repairs. Emergency repairs to restore essential travel or protect facilities after a disaster may be reimbursed with a 100% federal share if completed within 180 days. Permanent repair projects like rebuilding a bridge are reimbursed at a federal share of 90% for Interstate System highways and 80% for most other highways. If a state's expenses for disaster-damaged roads exceed its federal-aid highway funds, the federal share becomes \"up to 90%\". Congress may need to decide on increasing the permanent authorization for the Emergency Relief program. The Emergency Relief (ER) program provides 100% federal share for repair and reconstruction projects after disasters like the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and the collapse of the I-35W Bridge. Recent legislation in 2018 also allowed for a 100% federal share for damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico. ER assistance focuses on restoring highway facilities to pre-disaster conditions, with two categories of repair work: emergency repairs and permanent repairs on federal-aid highways or federally owned roads and bridges. The Emergency Relief (ER) program provides 100% federal funding for repair and reconstruction projects after disasters. It focuses on restoring highway facilities to pre-disaster conditions, with two categories of repair work: emergency repairs and permanent repairs on federal-aid highways or federally owned roads and bridges. ER funds can be used to rebuild older disaster-damaged roads or bridges to meet current geometric and construction standards, with a focus on long-term resilience. Resilience is defined as the capability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from significant multi-hazard threats with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy, and the environment. The ER program provides federal funding for repair and reconstruction projects after disasters, focusing on restoring highway facilities to pre-disaster conditions. Contracts supported by ER funding must meet various conditions and requirements, including prevailing wages, Davis-Bacon Act, Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, Americans With Disability Act, \"Buy America\" regulations, and NEPA requirements. Repair projects funded under the ER program must occur within the federal-aid highway system. Emergency repairs funded by the ER program must occur within the federal-aid highway right-of-way and are typically classified as categorical exclusions. States must submit a list of eligible project sites and repair costs within two years of a disaster. Prior approval from FHWA is not needed for emergency repairs to restore essential traffic or protect facilities. Once the FHWA division administrator deems disaster work eligible, costs can be reimbursed retrospectively. Emergency repair work must be completed within 180 days for a 100% federal share, with possible extensions for access delays. Examples include road regrading, landslide removal, temporary detours, and ferry usage. Debris removal is typically FEMA's responsibility, but funding is available for tribal and federally owned roads. The Relief for Federally Owned Roads program allows for immediate emergency repairs on damaged bridges and roads to restore them to pre-disaster conditions. ER funds can be used for temporary or permanent repairs, with a limitation on project costs. If repair is not feasible, ER funds may be used to build a new, comparable structure. ER funds can participate in building a new bridge if repair is not feasible, with betterments eligible if economically justified. Permanent repair contracts must meet competitive bidding requirements. Techniques like design-build contracting and incentives for early completion can accelerate projects. For example, the replacement of the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis used incentives for early completion. The new bridge, built in 11 months and completed three months ahead of schedule after the collapse in August 2007, used incentives for early completion. FHWA manages the distribution of limited ER funds through allocations, withdrawals, and procedures to manage funding shortfalls. Two processes are used to apply for ER funds after a disaster: quick release and standard method. Quick-release allocations occur individually, while standard allocations are distributed periodically to all eligible states nationwide. The FHWA Emergency Relief Manual describes the \"quick release\" method for developing and processing state requests for ER funding. The quick release method provides limited initial emergency relief funds for large disasters quickly, serving as a \"down payment\" for emergency operations. $140 million has been allocated for road damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Other examples include allocations for repairs to flood-damaged roads in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Kentucky. FHWA reserves funding to ensure availability for quick-release needs. The FHWA Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Transportation, reserves funding for quick-release needs. Standard application method involves site inspections and a damage survey report for permanent repairs. Allocations address recent and backlogged project needs from past disasters, with funds released twice each fiscal year. In FY2018, $1.35 billion was allocated for ER funds nationwide, along with $226 million for disaster-damaged roads on federal lands. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided a supplemental appropriation of $1.4 billion for the ER program after the 2017 hurricanes. The FHWA allocated $1.35 billion for ER funds nationwide in FY2018, with an additional $226 million for disaster-damaged roads on federal lands. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided a $1.4 billion supplemental appropriation for the ER program after the 2017 hurricanes. The appropriations did not specify the disasters the funds were for, but included a provision for 100% federal share for ER funds for Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. FHWA had an unallocated balance of $831 million available for unfunded requests totaling $2.5 billion as of August 12, 2018. Requests for allocations typically exceed available ER funding. FHWA adjusts fund distribution to stay within program means, providing distributions on a proportional basis when unallocated balance is insufficient. Congress must make additional ER funding available for full allocations. FHWA can delay nationwide distribution to replenish funds. ER projects can be funded using state's regular formula funds during shortfall, leading to potential delays in other projects. The FHWA adjusts fund distribution to stay within program means, coordinating the withdrawal of excess ER funds for reallocation. GAO reports expressed concern about the financial sustainability of the ER program due to mission creep and questions about recapturing unused funds. The 2012 GAO report highlighted FHWA officials' reluctance to recoup funds from inactive ER highway projects, citing concerns about harming their partnership with states. The report also criticized FHWA for prioritizing partners' interests over federal interests. States may delay ER-funded projects due to the \"available until expended\" nature of ER funding, leading them to prioritize non-ER projects to avoid expiration of Federal-Aid Highway funding. Congress could consider imposing a time limit on ER funds availability for obligation. Congress could consider placing a time limit on the availability of ER funds for obligation to encourage states to prioritize the obligation of funds to ER projects. Legal and procedural changes have been made to address GAO's concerns, including updates to the Emergency Relief Manual and clarification of eligibility criteria. States now must submit comprehensive lists of eligible project sites and repair costs within two years of an event. The definition of \"comparable facility\" has been expanded, and procedures have been put in place to strengthen the administration and oversight of the ER program. The effectiveness of changes to the ER program, including resilience measures for U.S. highway infrastructure, is of congressional oversight interest. The current program primarily focuses on reactive repair activities following disasters, with limited funding for long-term resilience improvements. There are concerns about the resilience of facilities in the face of climate change and regional threats like earthquakes generating tsunamis. The ER Manual emphasizes considering long-term resilience in repair design and construction. However, the program does not currently allow emergency relief funds to be used for improving the resilience of facilities. The ER program does not allow expenditure of emergency relief funds to improve the resilience of facilities not damaged by a natural disaster. Congress could broaden eligibilities for funding resilience measures and provide additional funds for increased resilience following disasters. Expanding the resilience mission and funding of existing ER programs to cover climate change risks to transportation infrastructure. Creating a stand-alone program for preventive retrofitting or rebuilding at-risk infrastructure. Encouraging states to use federal funds for resilience projects by providing increased federal share. The Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General reviewed FHWA's guidance on incorporating resilience improvements into emergency relief projects for damaged highway infrastructure. The report found that FHWA lacked definitions and processes for resilience improvements, and recommended revisions to the ER Manual to address these gaps. The FHWA lacks definitions and processes for resilience improvements in emergency relief projects for damaged highway infrastructure. Recommendations were made to revise the ER Manual to address these gaps. FHWA agreed to track the consideration of resilience improvements but argued against tracking resilience costs separately. The Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, similar to FHWA's ER program, provides federal funding on a reimbursement basis. The FTA's program provides federal funding for damage to public transportation facilities due to natural disasters or emergencies, aiming to protect assets and support capital and operating expenses. Funding was previously provided by FEMA or FTA following specific disasters, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks. The FTA's Emergency Relief program funds repairs and replacements for transit facilities damaged by disasters, including resilience projects. Operating expenses cover evacuation, rescue, and temporary transit services during emergencies. Funding is not permanently authorized and requires appropriations from the Treasury's general fund. The federal share for projects is typically 80%, but can be increased to 100% by the Secretary of Transportation. The Emergency Relief program funds repairs for transit facilities damaged by disasters, with a federal share typically at 80% but can be increased to 100%. Emergency funding is not provided if costs are reimbursed by another federal agency or funded through insurance. Two appropriations have been made to the program since 2012 in response to Hurricane Sandy and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 allocated $10.9 billion for FTA's Public Transportation ER Program for recovery and resilience projects in areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Approximately $10.2 billion was allocated for response, recovery, rebuilding costs, and resilience projects in New York and New Jersey. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 allocated $10.9 billion for FTA's Public Transportation ER Program for recovery and resilience projects in areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy. $76 million was designated for oversight and administration. By March 31, 2018, $7.1 billion of the Hurricane Sandy funding had been obligated. An additional $330 million was appropriated for FTA's Public Transportation ER Program in response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Damage from these hurricanes was concentrated in Texas, Puerto Rico, and Florida. FTA announced the allocation of funds by purpose and location on May 31, 2018. The Public Transportation ER program lacks permanent annual authorization, leading transit agencies to rely on FEMA for immediate funding after disasters. This reliance can cause confusion about which agency to approach for help. A memorandum of understanding between FEMA and FTA aims to coordinate their roles, but FTA cannot define its role without an appropriation. GAO suggests adding a quick-release mechanism to FTA's ER program to expedite fund distribution. The FTA's ER program, unlike FEMA and FHWA's programs, offers more flexibility with no spending limits on resilience projects and allows for improved asset replacements. This could strain the HTF's resources but expedite fund distribution after disasters. Projects funded through the Public Transportation ER program may include upgrades and improvements to meet safety standards, but this could require larger appropriations from Congress. Some Hurricane Sandy funding awards were for projects outside the program's scope, leading to recommendations for better alignment of program purposes with project evaluation and selection."
