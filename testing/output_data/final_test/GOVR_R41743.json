    "content": "Several important features affect the interpretation of comparative tax rates, including the type of rate, taxes included, and the use of weighted measures for size adjustments. Three basic types of tax rates are reported: statutory rate, effective rate, and marginal effective rate. The statutory rate is the top marginal corporate tax rate, the effective rate is taxes paid divided by profits, and the marginal tax rate estimates the pre-tax return paid in taxes for an investment project. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages for analyzing different behaviors. The statutory tax rate can impact firms' profit-shifting behavior, but adjustments are needed. Multinational firms in the US benefit from a production activities deduction, reducing the statutory tax rate. The effective tax rate, calculated as taxes paid divided by profits, captures tax benefits and subsidies, making comparisons between countries with different tax systems more accurate. This measure is better for assessing investment burdens than the statutory rate, but may not account for timing effects. The marginal effective tax rate is the appropriate measure for determining the effects of tax rate differentials on investment. It includes inventories, intangibles, buildings, and equipment, and depends on economic depreciation, expected inflation, and rates of return. The effective average tax rate, which combines statutory and marginal effective rates, has unclear implications. The combined statutory and marginal effective tax rates of OECD countries, including sub-national corporate taxes, vary. In the United States, state corporate income taxes increase the statutory rate to 39.2% without deductions. Other taxes like property and franchise taxes also impact capital. Property taxes, franchise taxes, and retail sales taxes on capital goods are difficult to measure and not always included in tax rate comparisons. Comparisons between U.S. and worldwide tax rates can be affected by whether rates are weighted or unweighted averages. Smaller countries tend to have lower tax rates, leading to lower unweighted averages compared to weighted averages. The weighted average effective tax rate for capital deployed globally is more relevant for comparisons. In 2013, the U.S. statutory rate is 39.1%, while the OECD weighted average is 28.4% and the unweighted average is 25.1%. The OECD rates are slightly lower, with the U.S. rate influenced by rate reductions in Japan and the United Kingdom. The production activities deduction for multinational corporations decreased tax rates by 2-3 percentage points as of 2010. The adjusted statutory rate of 36.2% compared to the weighted average of 29.6% results in a difference of 6.6 percentage points. The effective tax rate remains similar, as well as the marginal effective rates. The tax rate relevant for investment incentives is comparable between the United States and the OECD. The temporary bonus depreciation in the United States for 2008-2010 allowed 50% of equipment costs to be deducted, with a provision for 100% deduction in 2011. The OECD excludes large countries like China and Brazil in tax rate comparisons. Table 2 compares statutory and effective tax rates for the 15 largest countries, showing a slight decline in rates. The production activities deduction results in a 5.6 percentage point difference in rates. The effective tax rates have slightly declined, with a weighted average of 30 and an unweighted average of 29.2. Tables 3, 4, and 5 compare effective tax rates from different studies, showing that rates in the United States and other countries are similar. Table 6 analyzes marginal effective tax rates. The curr_chunk discusses marginal effective tax rates for different categories of assets, including intangibles, which are often taxed at negative rates. It highlights that expenditures on research, advertising, and human capital investment typically have a zero effective tax rate. The overall marginal effective tax rates for the United States and OECD countries are similar at around 20% and 18%, respectively. The curr_chunk discusses marginal tax rates in OECD countries since 2005, with base broadening potentially offsetting rate reductions. Marginal tax rates are lower than statutory rates, with the U.S. rate at half and OECD rate at 60% of statutory rates. Another measure includes equipment, structures, inventories, and land, but not intangibles, transfer taxes, or certain state and local taxes. It allows for debt finance and excludes wealth, capital stock, and property taxes. The curr_chunk discusses additional state and local taxes in OECD countries, with adjustments made for comparability. The weighted OECD and United States tax differentials are highlighted, with adjustments for intangibles narrowing the gap. The need to lower tax rates to reflect the effects of debt finance is also mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses the United States tax rate compared to the OECD, highlighting a differential of 16.2 percentage points. Factors contributing to this difference include using an unweighted average, transfer taxes, and excluding intangibles. A 2012 study shows similar relationships, with the United States tax rate at 35.6% compared to the OECD's 24.0% weighted and 19.6% unweighted rates. Table 8 compares rates for the 15 largest countries, showing closer values when adjusted for transfer taxes. The Chen and Mintz study emphasizes how other taxes can impact the relative tax burden. The curr_chunk discusses how other taxes, such as property and wealth taxes, can affect the relative tax burden and investment. It introduces a new tax rate measure called the \"effective average tax rate,\" which differentiates between normal and excess returns. This measure combines marginal and statutory tax rates. The curr_chunk discusses the effective average tax rate, which differentiates between normal and excess returns. It shows U.S. taxes to be higher than OECD rates, but the impact on economic behavior is unclear. The tax on normal return affects economic behavior, while the excess return is seen as bearing little or no tax burden. The comparison of statutory and effective marginal tax rates can impact location decisions for firms. It is important to consider weighting tax rates by economic importance when comparing rates globally. Small countries tend to have lower rates, so simple averages can exaggerate differences between the United States and other countries. Marginal effective tax rates show small differences, while weighted statutory tax rates vary. The analysis suggests that U.S. statutory corporate tax rates are higher than a weighted average of OECD countries, but effective tax rates are similar. The impact of other capital taxes has not been fully explored yet. Reforming state and local sales taxes could lead to a more efficient tax system. The section explores the effects of a U.S. corporate rate cut from 35% to 25% on revenue, output, national income, profit shifting, and international capital flows. It also discusses potential reactions from other countries and the outlook for revenue neutral corporate tax reform. The focus is on the impact on the U.S. economy and global economy. The Congressional Budget Office projected a 10-year corporate revenue of $4,360 billion from FY2013 to FY2021, with a potential annual revenue loss of $1,245 billion due to rate changes affecting tax liability before credits. The foreign tax credit, a major credit, could be impacted by a rate cut. The foreign tax credit could be affected by a rate cut, leading to potential changes in the limit on credits for different types of firms. If the limit is reduced, firms with creditable taxes above the limit would see a proportional decrease in foreign tax credits. On average, a reduction in foreign tax credits could result in a loss of almost $132 billion per year. The proposed rate cut could result in a loss of $1.3 trillion to $1.7 trillion in revenues over a 10-year period. Estimates suggest an average annual loss of $168 billion if foreign tax credits remain unaffected. This calculation does not include behavioral feedback effects, debt service, or crowding out of private capital, which could impact the cost. The discrepancy in estimates may be due to lagging liabilities and the timing of collections. Additionally, a rate increase may raise less revenue than a reduction of the same size if firms have unused foreign credits. The proposed corporate rate cut could result in a revenue loss of over $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Job creation is a key focus, but temporary or permanent rate cuts may not be effective stimulus policies. Economic theory suggests that job creation should be a natural outcome of growth and market adjustments. In 1961 and 1991, the unemployment rate remained at 6.7%, while employment increased from 66 million to 117 million. Long-term job policies should focus on reducing structural or frictional unemployment rather than solely increasing jobs. Corporate rate cuts impact output and wage levels more than the number of workers. Capital flows are influenced by various factors, despite the potential effects of cutting corporate taxes. Capital flows into a country can be constrained by various factors such as the abundance of capital driving up wages and reducing returns, the impact on global returns, non-corporate sectors affecting capital movement, imperfect mobility of capital, and products not being perfect substitutes. Gravelle and Smetters studied the effects of a 35% tax using a general equilibrium model with four sectors in the U.S. economy. The study by Gravelle and Smetters analyzed the effects of a 35% tax on capital flows in the U.S. economy, considering four sectors. The estimated increase in output from eliminating the tax was 0.39%, assuming perfect substitution of investments and products. This was calculated based on a 4.5% change in the capital stock, with a capital share of income at 0.29%. Based on a study analyzing the effects of a 35% tax on capital flows in the U.S. economy, it is projected that a reduction in the corporate tax by 10 percentage points could lead to an increase in labor income by 0.47% of total income. This is based on the assumption that 73% of the burden of the corporate tax falls on labor. The study suggests that reducing the corporate tax by 10 percentage points could lead to a 0.47% increase in labor income. However, perfect product substitution is not possible in a multi-good economy, leading to a smaller estimated effect on output and wages. Adjusting for portfolio and product substitution elasticities of 3, the estimated change in output and wages is around 0.18%, lower than the initial estimate of 0.62%. The effect of debt capital on reducing the estimated change in output and wages is not incorporated into the models. Debt is subsidized at the corporate level due to positive inflation and a lower effective marginal tax rate. Lowering the statutory rate reduces these subsidies and discourages debt, which may impact issues like the debt-equity distortion and capital investment. The U.S. tax system is not fully territorial, as it defers tax on foreign income until repatriated, with credits for foreign taxes paid offsetting the tax. Unused credits from high-tax countries can offset tax on income from low-tax countries. The U.S. tax system allows for cross crediting to offset tax on income repatriated from low tax countries. However, gains in output do not translate to gains in U.S.-worldwide income. Labor gains are offset by losses in pre-tax return by existing domestic capital, reducing benefits for firms. There is a transfer between the government and individuals, requiring offsetting tax increases or reduced spending. National welfare gains are likely to be minimal. The U.S. tax system allows for cross crediting to offset tax on income repatriated from low tax countries, but gains in national welfare are likely to be minimal. Gains in national welfare from revenue changes are expected to be small, mainly coming from income transfers from foreigners to U.S. persons. Inbound capital generates returns for foreign investors, with the only gain for the U.S. being the change in taxes and lower pre-tax rate of return. Outbound capital moving back into the U.S. results in gains from taxes paid to the U.S. instead of foreign governments. The study analyzed the effects of inbound and outbound capital on tax rates, finding a slight loss for inbound capital and a gain for outbound capital. Overall, only about 9% of the output increase was attributed to these capital flows. The study found that only about 9% of the output increase was beneficial to the United States, with optimal tax rates for inbound and outbound capital flows. The current tax rules impose taxes much smaller than the optimal rate, leading to too much capital being allocated abroad. Reducing the U.S. tax rate improves welfare, but the effects are relatively small. Cutting the U.S. tax rate improves welfare, but effects are small compared to the economy or revenue. The corporate tax cut discussed is about 0.65% of net output, taxed with labor and capital taxes. The overall marginal tax rate is 23.7%, yielding an offset of 4.7% to 6.6%. Feedback effects are likely too large due to reservations about output effects. The feedback effect from the tax on labor income may be too large, not accounting for potential changes in behavior. Revenue offsets from behavioral changes are expected to be smaller than the increase in revenue from debt service. If the increase in debt displaces the capital stock, output could be reduced, leading to a decrease in revenues. The possibility of profit shifting and concerns about revenue offset from corporate rate changes are discussed. Evidence suggests that real output effects may not be large enough to make a corporate rate cut pay for itself in increased revenues. Proponents point to studies indicating a \"Laffer curve\" with a revenue maximizing tax rate of around 30%. The \"Laffer curve\" studies reviewed in a CRS report did not support a revenue gain from a cut in the U.S. tax rate. Proponents argue that the U.S. collects a smaller share of revenue relative to GDP despite having a higher rate. Hassett notes that U.S. corporate revenue is 2% of GDP compared to 3% in other countries, and that some countries have seen revenue growth with decreased rates. Factors affecting corporate revenues include the size of the base and the share of business income that is corporate source. The U.S. collects a smaller share of revenue relative to GDP despite having a higher tax rate. Factors affecting corporate revenues include rate changes, base changes, and the ability of firms to operate in noncorporate form. A 2007 study by the U.S. Department of Treasury found that U.S. rules allowing large firms to operate in noncorporate form are more generous than other countries. The share of business income received by corporations in the U.S. declined as more generous limits on the number of shareholders for small corporations were adopted. The OECD study showed that corporate tax revenues increased due to incentives for firms to operate in corporate form and compliance measures. Profit shifting estimates suggest a loss of 14% to 20% of total corporate tax revenue, even if it disappeared entirely. A reduction in profit shifting could still benefit low tax rate countries, with a 25% rate leaving room for profit shifting. Recent discussions of profit-shifting techniques, such as the double-Irish, Dutch sandwich, show companies moving profits to low-tax countries like Ireland and Bermuda. Reforms to tax treatment of foreign income could reduce profit-shifting benefits and raise revenues. The U.S. faces the policy issue of how other countries might react to a corporate tax rate reduction. The U.S. corporate tax rate was cut from 48% to 35% from 1986 to 1988, triggering similar cuts in other countries. The tax rate has remained relatively constant since then, with the U.S. combined state and federal tax rate falling to just below 40%. OECD nations also saw a decrease in tax rates during that period. The tax rates for 2012 showed a slight decrease in the unweighted average from 25.5 to 24.9, while the weighted average increased slightly to 29.8 from 29.6. The U.S. tax rate dropped from 39.2% to 39.1%. The graph indicates that tax rates were closely aligned before 1987, but other countries started reducing their rates in the following years. The weighted OECD average had fluctuations with the first drop after a U.S. tax cut, followed by stability until Germany began cutting its tax rate in 2007. The fall in tax rates in the late 1990s may have been linked to lower tax rates in emerging eastern bloc countries. If one country reduces its tax rate, it attracts capital from others, benefiting labor and national welfare. However, if all countries lower their tax rates, none will gain capital but all will lose revenue. Observing rate cuts in other countries after the U.S. tax cut suggests a possible trend. A smaller rate cut by the U.S. may be less likely to trigger a response if it doesn't go below rates of other major countries like Japan and Germany. The OECD countries have varying corporate tax rates, with Japan and Germany at 39.54% and 30.18% respectively. The United Kingdom and France have rates of 28% and 34.4%, with the UK planning to cut to 24%. The US could lower its rate to 25%, resulting in a 29.8% rate. Base broadening options are discussed to offset revenue concerns and their impact on international capital flows and profit shifting. The reduction in the corporate tax rate would allow for revenue changes. The largest provision outside of deferral is accelerated depreciation for equipment, which could result in a rate reduction of about 2 percentage points. This measure is based on an alternative depreciation system. The desirability of restricting depreciation for equipment is unclear, as it is taxed at rates below the statutory rate. A revenue neutral revision cutting the rate in exchange for higher taxation of new investment would raise the marginal effective tax rate. Estimates suggest that the alternative system would tax investments at rates exceeding statutory rates, potentially raising revenues for unincorporated businesses. Accelerated depreciation for buildings, mainly rental housing, could result in revenue losses for unincorporated entities. The Senate Finance Committee has released discussion drafts on cost recovery and accounting related to corporate taxation, including proposals for a new depreciation system and changes to deductions for research and development expenses, advertising expenditures, and oil extraction expenses. Real property would be depreciated over 43 years, and LIFO and lower of cost of market inventory methods would be impacted. The discussion draft proposes repealing percentage depletion and LIFO, as well as reducing the corporate tax rate by 0.7 percentage points through the production activities deduction. This deduction has been criticized for distorting tax treatment across industries and creating compliance issues. About a quarter of the benefits go to unincorporated businesses. The reduction in the corporate tax rate by 0.7 percentage points through the production activities deduction may mainly benefit multinationals due to industry restrictions. Tailoring the provision to focus on multinationals, such as disallowing the deduction for unincorporated businesses and restricting eligible activities, could recoup more than half of the revenues. The largest tax expenditure is the deferral of tax on foreign source income. The largest tax expenditure is the deferral of tax on foreign source income, which could lead to a corporate tax rate reduction of 3.1 percentage points. Moving towards worldwide tax would increase capital in the US and reduce profit shifting. Limiting the foreign tax credit to income earned in that country could allow for a larger reduction in the tax rate. President Obama has proposed revisions to raise $157 billion over 10 years. The proposed revisions aim to raise $157 billion over 10 years by disallowing certain deductions of parent companies, limiting foreign tax credits, taxing excess returns of intangibles, and other changes. These provisions could allow for a rate cut of about a percentage point. Another option is to move to a territorial tax system, which could raise $76 billion and allow for a rate cut of 0.5 percentage points. House Ways and Means Chairman Camp has put forward these proposals. The House Ways and Means Chairman Camp has proposed a territorial tax system that could potentially raise revenue by taxing all foreign source income at a lower rate than the statutory rate. This proposal, which has not been scored yet, could generate revenue depending on the minimum tax rate imposed. Increasing taxation on foreign source income could offset revenue and have significant effects on capital flow and welfare in a global economy. The impact of using revenue from foreign source income as offsets for rate reductions is uncertain. Proponents of rate reductions oppose increasing the tax on foreign source income and suggest moving to a territorial system without cost allocation. This change may reduce capital investment in the US slightly and offset the benefits of a rate cut. Additionally, repealing LIFO accounting could raise $97.5 billion over 10 years and allow for a 0.8 percentage point reduction in the corporate rate. Most firms do not use LIFO due to tax and book conformity. LIFO eliminates tax on inflationary gains. Repealing corporate tax expenditures could cut the rate by 7.9 percentage points. The rate could fall by 5.5 percentage points without revenue from deferral repeal. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a rate of 28% for repeal of corporate preferences excluding deferral. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a rate of 28% for repeal of corporate preferences excluding deferral, with higher gains from depreciation and research and development incentives. The President's budget proposals aim to restrict insurance company and fossil fuel provisions for revenue gains. The curr_chunk discusses various tax provisions and benefits for different sectors, including fossil fuels and low-income housing. It mentions potential reductions in rates for small corporations and taxing income of credit unions. Energy subsidies for conservation and corporate charitable deductions are also highlighted. Additionally, it mentions tax reform possibilities not included in the tax expenditure budget, such as a provision in a tax reform bill introduced in the 110th Congress. The 110th Congress tax provision extended the write period for acquired intangibles, raising $20 billion over 10 years. Restricting interest deductions could lead to a significant rate reduction, estimated at around 2.5 percentage points. This reform may reduce profit shifting through debt borrowing in high tax countries but could impact international capital flows. Treasury data shows a decline in corporate business income since the 1980s. The decline in corporate business income from the 1980s to 50% is attributed to the increase in small corporations electing partnership treatment and new organizational forms like limited liability corporations. Moving back to the early 1980s share could allow for a 3 percentage point rate cut without affecting overall revenue, especially for business owners in the top 35% tax bracket. However, the contribution to rate reduction decreases as the corporate rate is cut. The potential rate reduction for moving operations to corporate form depends on the individual and corporate tax differentials. The average tax rate for partnership and Subchapter S income is 30%, resulting in percentage point reductions of 5, 2.3, and 1.5 at 35%, 30%, and 25% corporate tax rates. Shifting into the noncorporate sector is driven by new forms of large companies, likely leading to higher tax rates for partnership and Subchapter S income. In a global economy, it is better to allow tax cuts within the corporate sector at the corporate rather than the individual level. Rolling back the 2003 cuts in dividends and capital gains could result in a rate cut of about 2.5 to 4 percentage points. These increases in rates are scheduled to occur after 2012 when the Bush tax cuts expire. The more taxes are collected at the individual level by raising taxes on dividends and capital gains, the larger a rate reduction from shifting income into the corporate sectors. The reduction in corporate tax rates to 25% without revenue loss depends on various factors, including taxing dividends at full rates and capital gains at 20%. This would result in a 6.5 percentage point reduction, in addition to other provisions like business preferences and foreign tax credit restrictions."
