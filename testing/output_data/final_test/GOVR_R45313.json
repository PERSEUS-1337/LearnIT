    "content": "Immigration law has historically included exclusion and removal provisions to limit government spending on indigent non-U.S. nationals. The Immigration Act of 1882 provided for the exclusion of individuals unable to support themselves without becoming a public charge. The current Immigration and Nationality Act renders an alien inadmissible if they are likely to become a public charge. This provision mainly affects aliens applying for immigrant visas abroad and those in the U.S. seeking adjustment of status to become lawful permanent residents. The Immigration and Nationality Act renders aliens inadmissible if they are likely to become public charges. States applying for adjustment of status to become lawful permanent residents may be subject to deportation if they become public charges, but this provision is rarely applied in practice. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State are responsible for implementing public charge provisions, with USCIS making determinations for LPR status adjustments and DOS consular officers making determinations for visa applications. The term \"public charge\" is not defined in the INA, so determinations are based on agency guidance materials. The public charge grounds are based on agency guidance defining it as dependency on public cash assistance or government-funded institutionalization. The Trump Administration plans to establish new rules for interpretation. DHS will propose regulatory provisions on inadmissibility determination for public charge status. DOS revised the Foreign Affairs Manual to consider a wider range of public benefits. The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) has been revised to consider a broader range of public benefits when determining visa applicants' admissibility on public charge grounds. The INA contains two public charge provisions: one for inadmissibility and one for deportability. The first applies to aliens seeking adjustment to LPR status, while the second applies to aliens already in the US. The United States considers public charge grounds for inadmissibility, which includes factors like age, health, family status, financial resources, and skills. The term \"public charge\" is not clearly defined in the statute, so agency guidance provides the working definition. USCIS defines it as an individual likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and USCIS define \"public charge\" similarly as an individual likely to become dependent on government assistance. However, the FAM diverges by considering past receipt of any public assistance. Deportability under INA Section 237 applies to aliens who become a public charge within five years of entry. Deportations on public charge grounds are rare and are subject to a three-part test. Most aliens applying for visas or adjustment to LPR status face inadmissibility based on public charge grounds, determined by USCIS or DOS officials. The public charge ground of inadmissibility applies to aliens seeking admission to the United States as LPRs or nonimmigrants for temporary purposes like tourism or work. DOS consular officers rarely make public charge determinations for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Most applicants likely to become dependent on public assistance are also inadmissible under a broader ground of inadmissibility. Certain categories of aliens are exempt from the public charge determination when applying for visas or seeking admission to the United States. These include applicants for refugee status, asylees, Amerasian aliens, Cuban and Haitian entrants, Nicaraguans, and other Central Americans adjusting status, and victims of certain crimes. The Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 exempts certain categories of aliens from the public charge determination when applying for visas or seeking admission to the United States. This includes U-visa and T-visa applicants, special immigrant juveniles, Syrian asylees, aged, blind, or disabled applicants, and other exempt classes. Immigration authorities must consider factors like age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, and education when determining eligibility for adjustment of status. An affidavit of support from the petitioner may also be considered. The affidavit of support is a crucial document for immigrant visa applicants, demonstrating financial backing from a sponsor to alleviate concerns of relying on government assistance. It is a mandatory requirement for certain visa applicants, serving as an enforceable contract between the applicant, sponsor, and the government. An affidavit of support is required for immigrant visa applicants to prevent them from becoming a public charge in the US. The sponsor agrees to financially support the applicant and reimburse any government benefits provided until certain conditions are met. Failure to submit the affidavit can result in inadmissibility on public charge grounds. It is one of the factors considered in the totality of the circumstances test for public charge. DOS changed guidance in January 2018 for public charge determinations, now considering affidavits as one factor in the totality of circumstances. USCIS only considers cash income-maintenance benefits and government-funded institutionalization for public charge determinations. Currently, an alien's past or current receipt of certain cash assistance benefits or government-funded long-term care does not automatically lead to inadmissibility, but factors into the analysis under the totality of the circumstances test. USCIS does not consider an alien's receipt of other benefits for public charge determinations. In January 2018, the Department of State (DOS) revised its guidance for consular officers to consider past or current receipt of public assistance in visa application public charge determinations. This expanded the scope of public benefits to be considered under the totality of the circumstances test. Consular officers must now consider an alien's past or present receipt of public benefits when determining if they are likely to become dependent on government-funded assistance in the future. This may affect immigrant visa applications but not adjustment of status applications by USCIS. DOS and USCIS both administer the INA provision for public charge inadmissibility. Federal court rulings can resolve agency divergence in interpreting statutes, such as the USCIS and DOS guidance on public charge determinations. However, no federal court has yet decided if the agencies' guidance complies with the statute, as their determinations are subject to limited judicial review. Public charge determinations by USCIS and DOS are only subject to limited judicial review. If USCIS denies an adjustment of status application based on public charge grounds and the alien is placed in removal proceedings, the application can be renewed before an immigration judge. There is no direct administrative appeal available for USCIS denials, and federal courts are divided on their jurisdiction to review such denials. Immigrant visa denials on public charge grounds by DOS generally cannot be appealed or reviewed judicially. The FAM allows applicants to challenge public charge determinations by presenting convincing evidence to consular officers within one year of visa denial. While the INA permits admission of aliens deemed inadmissible as public charges if they post a suitable bond, this option is rarely utilized by USCIS and DOS. Statistics on the number of visa denials due to public charge grounds are not readily available as DHS does not publicly share this information. In FY2017, there were 3,237 immigrant visa applications refused on public charge grounds, with just over 2,016 refusals overcome. 51 nonimmigrant visa applications were refused on public charge grounds, out of more than 13 million applications, with 4 refusals overcome. It is challenging to determine the exact number of visas denied definitively on public charge grounds in a given year due to refusals being overcome in subsequent years. In FY2017, there were 280,835 immigrant visa applications refused, with 204,720 refusals overcome. For nonimmigrant visas, 3,450,673 applications were refused, and 738,098 were overcome. USCIS bases its public charge policies on agency guidance that excludes benefits received by family members from the public charge analysis. The USCIS excludes benefits received by family members from the public charge analysis for adjustment of status applications, unless the family has no other means of support. However, the Department of State considers a dependent family member's receipt of public benefits as a negative factor unless the applicant can demonstrate sufficient income and assets to overcome the poverty income guideline. The Department of State requires consular officers to view a family member's receipt of public benefits as a negative factor in the public charge analysis for immigrant visa applications, unless the applicant can prove that family income will exceed the poverty threshold. The timeline for issuing new rules is uncertain, as drafts of proposed regulations are still under review by DHS before undergoing the notice and comment process, which can take a minimum of two months before becoming final."
