    "content": "The report outlines the organizational structure of United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM), its contributions to homeland security, international relationships with Canada and Mexico, and issues for Congress. NORTHCOM was established in 2002 under the Unified Command Plan (UCP) by President Bush, with a regional area of responsibility including the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, and surrounding waters. Key issues for Congress involve DOD reorganization, interagency relationships, reserve component service members, Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center realignment, and resource allocation for mission execution. NORTHCOM's mission covers a vast area of approximately 500 nautical miles, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida. The Commander also oversees NORAD, responsible for air and maritime warning. Headquartered in Colorado, NORTHCOM employs around 1,200 DOD personnel. Most military personnel serve in NORAD positions, with few permanently assigned to manage routine operations. When tasked by the National Command Authority, NORTHCOM conducts homeland defense and civil support operations. NORTHCOM, when directed by the National Command Authority, receives forces from U.S. Joint Forces Command for homeland defense or civil support operations. It has Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps components, with Navy Fleet Forces Command in a supporting role. Five Joint Task Forces oversee forces for specific operations. 5th Army, based in Fort Sam Houston, Texas, assumed its NORTHCOM mission in 2005 under a three-star general. First Air Force, headquartered at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, is designated as NORTHCOM's air component. It is commanded by an Air National Guard two-star general who also leads the Continental NORAD Region. Key subordinate units include the 601st Air and Space Air Operations Center in Florida, Northeast Air Defense Sector in New York, and Western Air Defense Sector in Washington. The organization focuses on supporting civil authorities during crisis response and coordinates with FEMA through Defense Coordinating Officers. AFNORTH, based in Washington, includes Air National Guard fighter wings flying F-22 Raptor, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and E-3 Sentry. They use mobile ground-based air defense systems and unmanned aerial vehicles. AFNORTH leads Operation Noble Eagle to protect the US from terrorist air attacks, conducting surveillance and command 24/7. As of May 1, 2008, they had executed 48,950 sorties and logged 188,553 flying hours. Marine Forces Reserve Command in New Orleans was designated by DOD in 2004. In 2004, DOD designated Marine Forces Reserve Command in New Orleans as a NORTHCOM component. The three-star Marine commander is responsible for force-protection of Marine installations and coordinating Marine forces assigned to NORTHCOM. The command has 32 Marine Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers focused on specific FEMA regions. During Hurricane Katrina, liaison officers worked in various operations centers to coordinate Marine support. JTF-N, established in September 2004, aids law enforcement agencies protecting U.S. borders with a homeland defense focus integrating military capabilities with law enforcement. JTF-N, headquartered at Peterson AFB, Colorado, integrates military capabilities with law enforcement for homeland defense. Operations include reconnaissance, surveillance, and infrastructure construction missions. SJFHQ-N, established in January 2004, maintains situational awareness for NORTHCOM. JTF-AK, based in Alaska, coordinates land defense and DOD support to civil authorities. JTF in Virginia assists in managing consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive incidents. The Joint Task Force (JTF) was established in 1999 under U.S. Joint Forces Command to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive incidents in the United States. It is located at Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington, D.C. and coordinates with various agencies to ensure unity of effort in the event of manmade or natural catastrophes. NORTHCOM's linkage to homeland security is through Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) mission. NORTHCOM maintains strong relationships with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Guard, participates in National Level Exercises, and has liaisons from over 60 federal and non-federal agencies at Peterson AFB, Colorado. Liaisons provide expertise and communication with their parent organizations, including agencies like the CIA, FAA, FBI, EPA, and DHS organizations such as Customs and Border Patrol, FEMA, and TSA. The Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG) collaborates with various agencies like the CDC and HHS to address nationwide issues. DOD and DHS have personnel working together, including NORTHCOM personnel in FEMA regions. The USCG also has personnel at NORTHCOM headquarters for maritime homeland defense discussions. National guard forces typically report to state leadership. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, NORTHCOM and the NGB improved coordination and oversight of National Guard forces. This included formal policies on command, control, and communications, an advisory board for information sharing, and training exercises for DSCA capabilities. Exercise Ardent Sentry in 2007 involved scenarios like a 10-kiloton nuclear device detonation and a hurricane. NLE 1-08 and NLE 2-08 tested military response to radiological dispersion devices and terrorist attacks. NORTHCOM's responsibilities include homeland defense, civil support, and security cooperation with Canada and Mexico. In December 2002, Canada and the United States established a Bi-national Planning Group at NORAD/NORTHCOM headquarters to review theater cooperation post 9/11. The military team dissolved in May 2006 after submitting a final report with 62 recommendations, some requiring legislative action. In February 2008, military leaders from NORTHCOM and Canada Command agreed to a Civil Assistance Plan for military support during civil emergencies. NORTHCOM and Canada Command leaders have agreed on a Civil Assistance Plan for military support during civil emergencies, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. They collaborate on operational plans and participate in annual exercises together. Canada has linked some exercises with the U.S. National Level Exercise schedule, like during NLE 2-08 when Canadian forces participated in a scenario involving a simulated explosion and pandemic flu outbreak. The Canadian ship in a Canadian port experienced a mass casualty scenario from a simulated explosion and a pandemic flu outbreak. Theater security cooperation with Mexico is limited to anti-drug trafficking operations and senior officer visits. Mexican defense leaders historically interacted with the Office of the Secretary of Defense due to a lack of engagement at the combatant command level. Congressional issues for NORTHCOM in FY2009 may involve DOD reorganization, interagency relationships, reserve component forces, Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center realignment, and resource allocation. The ongoing reorganization of the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center and resource allocation for NORTHCOM's missions were approved by Congress. Concerns were raised about the reorganization creating more entry points to navigate, with multiple assistant secretaries having interests in NORTHCOM. After five years, NORTHCOM's geographic AOR has been refined, with shifts in boundaries and ongoing examination of combatant command boundaries. Lessons from Hurricane Katrina have led to improved coordination between DOD and DHS, with NORTHCOM components focusing on military assistance to civil authorities and efforts to enhance cooperation with the National Guard. NORTHCOM, NGB, and FEMA collaborated to purchase deployable cellular communication systems to enhance emergency response. GAO study identified gaps in NORTHCOM's coordination efforts with NGB and states, with ongoing initiatives to improve civil support capacity. State participation in exercises, NGB involvement in planning, and orientation programs for Adjutants General aim to enhance coordination and preparedness. NORTHCOM's civil support role to states is improving through hurricane and wildfire conferences. However, gaps in coordination with states and the NGB were identified by the GAO, leading to recommendations for NORTHCOM to involve states in planning processes and define roles with the NGB. NORTHCOM is urged to involve states in planning processes and define roles with the NGB, with DOD partially concurring and emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive planning process involving additional commands. The Department of Defense (DOD) is working with various agencies to develop an Integrated Planning System (IPS) for interagency coordination. A GAO report highlighted improvements in NORTHCOM's federal interagency coordination efforts but noted a lack of formal procedures for integrated planning. Recommendations were made for clear guidance and documentation of agreements within the IPS framework. The 2008 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to determine military capabilities needed for civil support during national catastrophic incidents. Legislation is being considered to codify interagency coordination processes similar to the Goldwater-Nichols Act. The 2007 NDAA called for a report on improving interagency support, focusing on DOD and civilian executive branch integration. Homeland security requires cooperation across federal, state, and local agencies. Some question creating additional federal layers, as it may complicate interactions with state and local authorities. NORTHCOM headquarters staff includes reserve and national guard members, with reserve component forces increasingly relied upon for support. Recent trends show an increasing reliance on reserve component forces by NORTHCOM for civil support and overseas deployments. Mobilizations are rising, leading to more reserve forces serving full-time. Concerns arise about resource issues for reserve components and National Guard availability for state missions. The 2008 NDAA mandates DOD to coordinate National Guard and Armed Forces for disaster response by June 1, 2008. The 2008 NDAA (P.L. 110-181) mandates the President to establish a Council of Governors to advise on National Guard and civil support missions. There is a debate on whether the NORTHCOM deputy commander should be a National Guard officer. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves recommended that either the commander or deputy commander of NORTHCOM be a reserve component officer. The 2008 NDAA requires that either the commander or at least one deputy commander billet at NORTHCOM be filled with a National Guard officer. In July 2006, NORTHCOM announced the transition of the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center to a combined NORAD/NORTHCOM Command Center at Peterson. The Cold War facility will be in standby status for exercises or contingencies. The Government Accountability Office has raised concerns over costs and security implications, leading to funding stipulations in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The report to Congress compares relocation costs with operational benefits, details functions remaining at CMOC, outlines NORAD relocation plans, and explains security assessment results at Peterson AFB. GAO to review DOD's report within 120 days. Secretary of the Air Force to submit a master recapitalization plan for Cheyenne Mountain Air Station by March 16, 2008. GAO study in April 2008 found high staffing levels for NORTHCOM planning positions. The GAO questioned if DOD has assigned enough forces to NORTHCOM for its missions, as only air defense and supporting forces are routinely assigned. This lack of specifically identified units may increase the risk to homeland defense and civil support operations. NORTHCOM's ability to monitor forces' readiness for civil support missions is hindered due to few units available. The GAO recommended that DOD assign specialized forces to NORTHCOM for civil support missions, while DOD believes readiness can be improved by developing metrics for general purpose forces."
