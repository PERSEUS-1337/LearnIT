    "content": "The Act titled \"Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996\" includes references to amendments or repeals within the Clean Air Act. The table of contents outlines the sections covered in the Act. The \"Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996\" includes sections on operating permits, enhanced monitoring, sanctions, hazardous air pollutants, and more. Operating permits are addressed in Section 2 of the Act. The term 'applicable requirement' in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996 refers to various regulations imposed by the Administrator, excluding specific sections and limitations on emissions or operations in construction permits. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996 define 'applicable requirement' as regulations imposed by the Administrator, excluding certain limitations in construction permits. Operating permits may incorporate terms from minor new source review programs. Permitting authorities retain enforcement authority over all requirements. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996 define 'applicable requirement' as regulations imposed by the Administrator, excluding certain limitations in construction permits. Operating permits may incorporate terms from minor new source review programs. Permitting authorities retain enforcement authority over all requirements. The permitting authority may not require any source to obtain or modify a permit for any physical or operational change at the source until 7 days after the change is initiated. States can still impose separate requirements apart from the program required under this title. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996 allow major stationary sources to obtain permits for emissions changes without revisions if overall limits are not exceeded. States can impose additional requirements separate from the program required under the Act. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996 allow major stationary sources to obtain permits for emissions changes without revisions if overall limits are not exceeded. States can impose additional requirements separate from the program required under the Act. U.S.C. 7661a(d) is amended to allow the Administrator to determine failures that may cause a State to miss air quality standards, and permit terms under Section 502(b)(5)(B) are extended from 5 to 10 years. SEC. 3. ENHANCED MONITORING. Section 114(a) (42 U.S.C. 7414(a)(3)) is amended to require compliance certifications from owners or operators of major sources. Certifications must include identification of applicable requirements, method of determining compliance status, and actual compliance status. Submission of certifications does not limit the Administrator's investigative authorities. The Administrator cannot revise existing compliance methods significantly without proper procedures like rulemaking for public comment and assessing the impact on emission standards. Evidence other than the compliance or test method cannot be used to establish a violation of emission limitations. Compliance methods must meet monitoring or testing requirements for emission standards. The Administrator has the authority to increase control measures or impose new ones as needed under the Act, without limiting compliance with emission standards. SEC. 4. RECOGNITION OF EFFECTIVE CONTROLS. The term 'potential to emit' refers to the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit regulated air pollutants under its design, including any enforceable limits. SEC. 5. SANCTIONS. The Administrator can impose sanctions as necessary under the Act. SEC. 5. SANCTIONS. The Administrator may apply sanctions if a deficiency is likely to result in a failure to attain a national air quality standard by the attainment date. SEC. 6. HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS. Permits must be revised to comply with standards within 10 years of promulgation. SEC. 7. VOLUNTARY CONTROLS ADOPTED PRIOR TO NONATTAINMENT. SEC. 7. VOLUNTARY CONTROLS ADOPTED PRIOR TO NONATTAINMENT. Any voluntary measures implemented before an area is designated as nonattainment for ozone will be considered additional reductions in the revised plan for the area. SEC. 8. ATTAINMENT DATE DETERMINATIONS. Section 181(a)(5)(B) is amended to limit ozone exceedances, design values, and consider episodic variations in air pollution levels. An additional extension may be granted for areas that have achieved attainment but later violate standards upon state application. The Administrator may extend the attainment date for up to 3 years if an area qualifies for redesignation as attainment for ozone but later violates the ozone standard. Only one extension is allowed per nonattainment area. SEC. 9. ATTAINMENT REDESIGNATIONS. Section 107(d)(3) is amended to require the Administrator to publish notice in the Federal Register of receipt of a request for redesignation and to approve or deny such redesignation within 90 days. If a State requests redesignation to attainment, they must demonstrate compliance with specific clauses and a 3-year compliance history. The Administrator must publish notice in the Federal Register within 90 days of receiving a State's request for redesignation to attainment. Failure to approve or deny the request within 90 days will result in automatic redesignation as an attainment area. Compliance with specific clauses and a 3-year history is required for redesignation. SEC. 10. CREDIT FOR EPISODIC CONTROLS. The Administrator will provide credits for plan provisions designed to control air pollution during periods of higher pollutant levels. SEC. 11. OPT-IN REFORMULATED GAS AREAS. Section 211(k)(6)(A) of the Clean Air Act is amended to state that areas included in the prohibition set forth in paragraph (5) must notify the Administrator by December 31, 1997, to continue inclusion after December 31, 1999. Additionally, areas included in the prohibition can be excluded by the Governor's application. The Governor can exclude areas from the prohibition set forth in the Clean Air Act by submitting an application to the Administrator. The exclusion will take effect after 1 year for Phase I Reformulated Gas Regulations and after 8 years for Phase II Reformulated Gas Regulations. Any subsequent inclusion or exclusion of the area will also have a 1-year waiting period after the Governor's application is approved. The Administrator's approval will be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 12 prohibits reductions in NO emissions from baseline vehicles using reformulated gasoline. SEC. 13 establishes national primary ambient air quality standards. Section 109 of the Clean Air Act is amended to require the Administrator to establish national primary ambient air quality goals and standards within two years. The goals will be based on criteria to protect public health without considering infrequent variations. The Clean Air Act is amended to establish national primary ambient air quality standards based on criteria to protect public health, excluding infrequent episodic variations caused by weather. The standards should be as close to the national goals as feasible, ensuring that the costs of compliance do not outweigh the benefits. SEC. 14. TRANSPORTATION CONFORMITY. Section 176 is amended to read as follows: \"SEC. 176. TRANSPORTATION CONFORMITY.\" Beginning on November 15, 1996, each State must submit a revised inventory and performance plan every 4 years for review by the Administrator. The plan must certify that it meets air quality goals and is approved by the Governor. The Administrator has 30 days to disapprove a plan that does not adhere to the State's processes. If not disapproved within 30 days, the plan is considered approved. Plans must be approved every 4 years without the need for resubmission of an inventory or plan. SEC. 15. OVERWHELMING TRANSPORT. The Administrator may redesignate an area as attainment if control of ozone concentrations is beyond the area's ability due to transport from outside. SEC. 16. AUTOMOBILE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE. Safety inspection approval may be required after denial of automobile inspection. SEC. 17. EMISSIONS TRADING. The Administrator must approve emissions trading programs in implementation plans unless they hinder nonattainment areas from meeting air quality standards. No plan increasing emissions beyond maintenance levels will be approved."
