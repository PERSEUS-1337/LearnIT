ADVANCE PAYMENT OF DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT.\" Employers must make an additional payment equal to the employee's dependent care credit advance amount when paying wages to an employee with a dependent care credit eligibility certificate. This certificate certifies the employee's eligibility to receive the credit for the taxable year and confirms that the employee does not have another certificate in effect for the same year from a different employer. The employee's spouse's dependent care credit eligibility certificate status and estimated credit amount for the year are disclosed in the statement. The dependent care credit advance amount is determined based on the employee's wages and estimated amount for each payroll period. The dependent care credit advance amount is calculated based on the employee's estimated amount of dependent care credit included in the eligibility certificate and in accordance with tables provided by the Secretary. The tables for this purpose are similar to those prescribed under section 3402 and are coordinated with other relevant tables. Regulations will be prescribed as necessary to implement this section. The table of sections for chapter 25 of the Code is amended to include a new item after section 3507. The amendments made by this section allow for advance payment of dependent care credit, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1994."
