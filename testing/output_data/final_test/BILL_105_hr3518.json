    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Power Marketing Administration Reform Act of 1998\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that fixed allocations of joint project costs have led to under recovery of costs, inefficiencies in power marketing, and environmental damage. With open access to power transmission and competitive markets, market prices will provide the lowest reasonable rates. The Congress aims to set rates that are cost-effective, promote widespread power use, and encourage efficient power production by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The purpose of this Act is to ensure full cost recovery rates for power sold by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority, transitioning to market-based rates. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, must develop procedures for Federal Power Marketing Administrations to use the same accounting principles as public utilities. Each Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority must submit rates to the Commission within a year of this Act's enactment. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must review and approve rates for the sale of Federal energy submitted by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority every five years to ensure cost recovery, including fish and wildlife expenditures. Transmission costs are not included in these rates. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviews and approves rates for the sale of Federal energy by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority every five years to ensure cost recovery, including fish and wildlife expenditures. Transmission costs are not included in these rates. The Federal Power Marketing Administration applies approved rates to existing contracts for the sale of Federal energy, as authorized by the Commission. This does not apply if there are no outstanding commitments under existing contracts. Accounting principles and requirements are considered in developing or reviewing these rates. The Tennessee Valley Authority and Federal Power Marketing Administrations will use accounting principles for power sales. Interim rates will be based on full cost recovery until market pricing is fully implemented for new and renewed contracts. If full cost recovery rates exceed market rates, the Secretary of Energy can price power at market rates. The Tennessee Valley Authority and Federal Power Marketing Administrations will price power at market rates, ensuring recovery of operation and maintenance costs, maximizing investment recovery, and utilizing competitive bidding for remarketing. The Secretary of Energy will develop and implement market-based pricing within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Energy will establish market-based pricing for power sold by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority, using bid and auction procedures. Revenues collected through market-based pricing will be disposed of according to specific guidelines. The pricing revenues collected from power sales will be remitted to cover expenses and investments first. Remaining revenues will be divided with 50% going towards reducing the Federal budget deficit and 35% deposited in a specific fund. 15 percent of the revenues will be deposited in a fund to cover the incremental cost of nonhydroelectric renewable resources. A fund is established to hold and expend revenues allocated for environmental mitigation and restoration in the region where power is marketed. The fund will be governed by a Board of Directors consisting of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or their designees. The fund established for environmental mitigation and restoration in the region where power is marketed must not exceed $200,000,000. Any excess funds not needed for project-specific plans will be used for Federal budget deficit reduction. The Board of Directors will develop project-specific plans for the fund. The Board will develop project-specific mitigation plans for power projects marketed by power administrations or the Tennessee Valley Authority, utilizing data from various agencies. A fund is established to hold revenues for renewable resources as per paragraph (1)(B)(iii). The fund established within the Department of Energy can be used to pay for incremental costs of nonhydroelectric renewable resources in states where power marketing administrations operate. Revenues from the fund can only be spent according to a plan developed by the Secretary of Energy to support the development of nonhydroelectric renewable resources with long-term potential but are currently too costly for private investment. The fund established under subparagraph (A) must not exceed $50,000,000 not needed for the plan, with excess revenues going to the Treasury for deficit reduction. Public bodies and cooperatives have preference for future power allocations at market prices. The preference customer can consume or resell allocated power, with transmission access regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. If a public body or cooperative declines allocation, it goes to the next highest bidder. The Secretary of Energy mandates Federal Power Marketing Administrations to focus on authorized activities only, with annual reporting requirements. After the enactment of this Act, Federal Power Marketing Administrations must disclose their activities annually, including project costs. Contracts cannot exceed 5 years, and restrictions on construction apply, except for the Bonneville Power Administration. Federal Power Marketing Administrations must provide transmission service on an open access basis at just and reasonable rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Commission will oversee the implementation of this requirement. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authority to review and approve power rate schedules recommended by the Secretary of Energy for power sales by Federal Power Marketing Administrations. The Commission's approval is based on protecting the public interest and consumer interests. They can review factual basis determinations made by the Secretary of Energy and revise rate schedules as needed to protect the public. The Energy Regulatory Commission can proceed with informal rulemaking to transition to market-based rates for power sold by Federal Power Marketing Administrations. Any affected party can seek rehearing and judicial review of the Commission's final decision. SEC. 7. REPEALS. The last sentence of section 302(a)(3) of the Department of Energy Organization Act and Section 505 of Public Law 102-377 are repealed.\n\nSEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. The provisions of this Act and its amendments will take effect for power sales contracts entered into by Federal Power Marketing Administrations or the Tennessee Valley Authority after July 23, 1997."
