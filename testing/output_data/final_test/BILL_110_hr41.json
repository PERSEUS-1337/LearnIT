    "content": "The Business Checking Fairness Act of 2007 allows interest-bearing transaction accounts for all businesses. The Business Checking Fairness Act of 2007 allows depository institutions to offer accounts with up to 24 transfers per month for any purpose, without being subject to certain restrictions. SEC. 3. INTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AUTHORIZED. The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits is repealed, with amendments to various acts. The effective date for these changes is set to be two years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. In the case of an escrow account for a real estate transaction, a depository institution can absorb expenses and refrain from charging fees for banking services provided. Any benefits resulting from these actions by the institution are not considered interest payments under the Act or Public Law 93-100. The Act does not require depository institutions to pay interest on escrow accounts for real estate transactions or prohibit them from doing so. It also does not preempt state laws regarding interest on escrow accounts. SEC. 5. CONSUMER BANKING COSTS ASSESSMENT. The Federal Reserve Act is amended to include a new section for a survey of bank fees and services. The Federal Reserve System must conduct a biennial survey to gather data on retail banking services and products offered by insured depository institutions and credit unions, including checking accounts, savings accounts, ATM transactions, and electronic transactions. The survey must be representative of different types and sizes of institutions, as well as geographic locations. The minimum requirements for checking and transaction accounts include monthly and annual fees, minimum balances to avoid fees, minimum opening balances, check processing fees, check printing fees, balance inquiry fees, fees for using a teller, stop payment order fees, nonsufficient fund fees, overdraft fees, fees for bounced-check protection and overdraft protection programs, deposit items returned fees, and availability of low-cost accounts for consumers with low balances. Data on negotiable order of withdrawal accounts and savings accounts should include monthly and annual fees, minimum balances, interest rates, check processing fees, teller fees, and availability of low-cost accounts for consumers with low balances. Automated teller machine transactions data should include minimum requirements for checking and transaction accounts. Automated teller machine transactions data should include monthly and annual fees, card fees, fees for withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, point-of-sale transaction fees, and wire transfer fees. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may collect data on various fees and charges, including wire transfer fees, internet payment fees, and other charges deemed appropriate. They have the authority to stop collecting information on specific fees if it is no longer necessary. Additionally, a biennial report to Congress is required. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is required to prepare a biennial report to Congress on the results of surveys conducted on the cost and availability of retail banking services nationwide, in 50 representative states, and in each consolidated metropolitan statistical area. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must provide a biennial report to Congress on the availability of retail banking services, detailing differences between institutions based on type and size, as well as any multistate activities. Definitions for 'insured depository institution' and 'insured credit union' are provided. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act defines 'insured credit union' as per the Federal Credit Union Act. An amendment to the Truth in Lending Act requires the Board to collect credit card price and availability information semiannually from financial institutions offering credit card services. This includes disclosure information, average finance charges, and credit card rates and fees such as application fees. The Truth in Lending Act amendment requires disclosure of credit card fees and rates, including application fees, APRs, and fees for cash advances, balance transfers, convenience checks, and foreign currency conversions. The amendment will be effective on January 1, 2008, and repeals certain report provisions from previous acts."
