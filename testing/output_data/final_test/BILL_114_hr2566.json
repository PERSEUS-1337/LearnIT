    "content": "The Act titled \"Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2016\" ensures the integrity of voice communications by amending the Communications Act of 1934 to include measures for this purpose. The Act requires intermediate providers offering voice transmission services to register with the Commission and comply with service quality standards. Covered providers must only use registered intermediate providers for voice communications transmission. The Commission will establish rules, including a registry, within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission will establish a registry for registrations and service quality standards for voice communications transmission by intermediate providers within one year of the Act's enactment to ensure integrity and prevent discrimination among areas in the US. The Commission will establish a registry for voice communications transmission standards and make it publicly available on their website. The requirements of this section apply to all communication formats and protocols, without affecting regulatory classifications. State agencies retain authority to collect data, unaffected by this section. The commission or State agency will collect data and enforce State laws on intrastate voice communications, regardless of format or protocol. A covered provider exempt from service quality standards must be certified as a Safe Harbor provider and meet specified requirements. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'covered provider,' 'covered voice communication,' and 'intermediate provider.' A 'provider' is an entity that enters into a business arrangement for carrying voice traffic generated from or to an end user connection using a North American Numbering Plan resource, without being a covered provider itself. The House of Representatives passed the document on November 14, 2016, as attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
