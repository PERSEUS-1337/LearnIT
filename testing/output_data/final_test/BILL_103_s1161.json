    "content": "The \"Environmental Justice Act of 1993\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Congress finds that significant amounts of toxic chemicals are being released into the environment, with many posing health threats not being reported under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. This Act excludes hundreds of chemicals listed as toxics under various environmental laws. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments regulated over 140 hazardous waste chemicals, identified over 200 human carcinogens, reviewed 69 special pesticides, and identified 90 reproductive toxins. Data on toxic chemical exposure shows that racial and ethnic minorities and lower-income Americans may be disproportionately affected. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 regulated numerous hazardous chemicals, including human carcinogens, special pesticides, and reproductive toxins. Data suggests that racial and ethnic minorities, as well as lower-income Americans, may be disproportionately affected by toxic chemical exposure. The purposes of this Act are to establish and maintain information for assessing health effects by income and race, identify areas with the largest releases of toxic chemicals, assess health effects in high impact areas, ensure participation of residents in determining health impacts, identify activities with adverse health impacts, and incorporate environmental equity considerations. The Act aims to establish information for assessing health effects by income and race, identify areas with high toxic chemical releases, assess health effects in impacted areas, ensure resident participation in health impact decisions, identify activities with adverse health impacts, and include environmental equity considerations in federal environmental programs and statutes. The Act aims to establish information for assessing health effects by income and race, identify areas with high toxic chemical releases, assess health effects in impacted areas, ensure resident participation in health impact decisions, identify activities with adverse health impacts, and include environmental equity considerations in federal environmental programs and statutes. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, \"environmental high impact area\" as regions with high toxic chemical releases, and \"toxic chemicals\" as hazardous substances and registered materials. The Act identifies various categories of chemicals subject to regulations, including those listed under different environmental laws and known human carcinogens. The term \"release\" is defined in alignment with the Comprehensive Environmental Response Act. The Toxic Chemical Facility definition includes facilities subject to various environmental laws such as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The term \"toxic chemical facility\" includes Federal facilities releasing toxic chemicals, subject to environmental laws like the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Clean Air Act, and Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Additionally, it is subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act for material safety data sheets. SEC. 5. IDENTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HIGH IMPACT AREAS. Within six months of enactment, the Administrator, in consultation with various agencies, will determine Environmental High Impact Areas. Within twelve months, a list of toxic chemicals released in each county or geographic unit will be published in rank order based on data from the most recent five-year period. If less data is available, existing data will be used until updated information is reported. The Administrator will compile a list of toxic chemicals released in each county or geographic unit based on available data from environmental regulatory authorities and other sources. The data will include the weight of toxic chemicals released into the environment and each environmental medium. Adjustments will be made to the estimates whenever possible. The Administrator will review and adjust estimates of toxic chemicals released into the environment, publish proposed changes to methodology for public comment, revise and republish the list of toxic chemicals every five years, and identify Environmental High Impact Areas every five years. The Administrator will publish a list of the top one hundred counties with the highest toxic chemical releases every five years, designating them as \"Environmental High Impact Areas\". Compliance inspections of these facilities will be conducted by the Administrator and the Secretary of Labor within two years of the Act's enactment and every two years thereafter. Within twenty-four months of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with relevant authorities, will issue a report for public comment on the health impacts of toxic chemicals in Environmental High Impact Areas. The report on health impacts of toxic chemicals in Environmental High Impact Areas will compare incidence of cancer, birth deformities, infant mortality, and respiratory diseases with other counties in the US. The Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will coordinate the report, isolating environmental pollution impacts and ranking relative risks of toxic chemicals. The report will assess the impacts of toxic chemicals in Environmental High Impact Areas, considering sources and levels of toxic chemicals, and proposing remedies to prevent adverse health effects. If significant impacts are identified, the President will propose administrative and legislative changes to address and prevent these impacts. The report will assess the impacts of toxic chemicals in Environmental High Impact Areas and propose administrative and legislative changes to address them, including adding facilities or chemicals to reporting requirements, regulating toxic chemicals not covered by federal law, and imposing additional regulatory measures on toxic chemical facilities in high impact areas. SEC. 6. REDUCTION OF TOXIC CHEMICALS\n\nIf the report identifies significant adverse impacts on human health from exposure to toxic chemicals in an Environmental High Impact Area, regulations will be promulgated for Federal permits for toxic chemical facilities in that area. These regulations will mandate a reduction in the release of toxic chemicals causing adverse health impacts.\n\nSEC. 7. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. The Secretary may award grants to individuals or groups affected by toxic chemical releases in environmental high impact areas. Grants facilitate access to public participation activities, provide technical assistance for inspections, reviews, and studies, and are limited to $50,000. Grants under this program are limited to $50,000, with recipients required to pay a 20 percent non-Federal share. The Administrator may waive the contribution requirement based on financial need. Only one grant per environmental high impact area is allowed, with the possibility of renewal if deemed necessary for public participation. Grants are considered under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and funded accordingly."
