    "title": "AB 2129",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1203 of the Penal Code in California is amended to define \"probation\" as the suspension of a sentence under supervision, and \"conditional sentence\" as a release subject to court-established conditions without supervision. The Legislature authorizes both options for infractions or misdemeanors. Before judgment is pronounced, if a person convicted of a felony is eligible for probation, the court must refer the matter to a probation officer for investigation and report. The probation officer will provide findings and recommendations to the court regarding probation granting, denial, and conditions. The probation officer's report must include information on the defendant's custody as a minor and may consider juvenile crimes for aggravating circumstances. For sex offenders, the report must include results from the State-Authorized Risk Assessment Tool. The probation officer's report may recommend the amount of a restitution fine and whether the court should require restitution to the victim or Restitution Fund as a condition of probation. The probation officer's report must be provided to the court, prosecuting and defense attorneys at least five days before the hearing, or nine days upon request. It should be filed with the court clerk as a record. A continuance for not meeting the report deadline can only be granted with good cause. At a scheduled time, the court will review probation applications and determine suitability. The court will consider probation officer reports, including SARATSO results if applicable. If deemed appropriate, the person may be placed on probation. If probation is denied, the report is sent to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The court may waive the preparation or consideration of a report with written or oral stipulation from prosecuting and defense attorneys, with court consent. If the defendant is sentenced to state prison, a probation report must be completed. If the defendant is unrepresented, the probation officer must discuss the report with them. If a person is convicted of a misdemeanor, the court may refer the matter to the probation officer for investigation or pronounce a conditional sentence. If the offense requires sex offender registration, the court must obtain a report from the probation officer on the State-Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders. The court may consider any relevant information in sentencing. The court must inform the person convicted of a misdemeanor of the information to be considered in a probation report and allow them to respond before sentencing. A continuance can be granted upon request before judgment is pronounced. Probation shall not be granted to persons convicted of certain crimes, including arson, robbery, burglary, rape, murder, kidnapping, or using a deadly weapon during the crime. Any person convicted of certain crimes, such as inflicting great bodily injury, torture, or multiple felonies, may not be granted probation. Additionally, individuals convicted of specific offenses like burglary with explosives, rape with force, murder, or kidnapping are also ineligible for probation unless they have no prior felony convictions. Any person previously convicted of a felony or public offense involving a deadly weapon, using a deadly weapon on a human, or inflicting great bodily injury/torture, may not be granted probation. (7) Public officials or peace officers who accepted bribes, embezzled public money, or committed extortion. (8) Anyone knowingly providing phencyclidine. (9) Individuals causing great bodily harm during arson or burning inhabited structures. (10) Those causing great bodily harm or death with a firearm from a moving vehicle on a public street. (11) Possession of prohibited firearms or devices. (12) Conviction under Section 8101 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. (13) Conviction under specific sections related to firearms. Probation in such cases requires court justification for the decision. The judge must refer cases where probation is not an option to the probation officer for investigation of relevant facts, including determining the amount of a restitution fine. The probation officer will then provide a written report to the court with findings and a recommendation for the restitution fine amount. If a defendant is convicted of a felony and a probation report is prepared, the probation officer may include the victim's comments on the offense. The court can decide not to obtain a statement if the victim has already testified in court. A probationer must have their case referred to the Administrator of the Interstate Probation and Parole Compacts before being released to another state. They must also reimburse the county for the costs of processing their request for interstate compact supervision. The reimbursement amount and method are determined by Section 1203.1b. The court may order a defendant to undergo a financial evaluation by a county financial evaluation officer to determine their ability to pay restitution. Failure to pay may result in probation violation or enforcement as a civil judgment if unpaid by the end of the probationary period. Probation or sentence suspension is not allowed for individuals convicted of violent or serious felonies while on probation for a previous felony offense."
