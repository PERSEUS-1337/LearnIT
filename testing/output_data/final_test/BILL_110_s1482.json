    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to child well-being. Congress finds that child well-being is a top priority at the state and national levels, influenced by various factors such as family circumstances, the economy, and public policies. States, including smaller ones, require specific, timely, and consistent data on child well-being to inform federal and state-level programs effectively. Regular state-level data collection is crucial for monitoring child well-being trends. Information on child well-being at the State level is crucial for tracking children's welfare over time. Telephone surveys of parents are a cost-effective method to gather this data, especially for small States lacking other data sources. This data is essential for monitoring progress towards national goals like preschool immunization. A State-level telephone survey can provide information on various topics related to children's well-being, including social and emotional development, education, health, safety, family income, and child care. This data is crucial for informing welfare policymaking and is representative of the entire State population. The State-level telephone survey provides crucial data for informing welfare policymaking and other important issues like child care, child welfare, child health, family formation, and education.
