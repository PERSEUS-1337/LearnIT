    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits and services to eligible veterans, including healthcare, disability compensation, education, vocational rehabilitation, employment services, assistance to homeless veterans, home loan guarantees, life insurance, and burial benefits. These programs are administered nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides healthcare services, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) offers disability compensation and education assistance, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national veterans cemeteries and provides headstones for eligible persons. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers healthcare services to veterans and serves as a contingency backup during national emergencies. The VA is required to ensure medical centers are prepared for public health emergencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) identified a new coronavirus, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) plays a crucial role in responding to domestic pandemics. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is a large healthcare system in the US, serving over 7.1 million patients in FY2020. It employs 337,908 full-time equivalent employees, mainly healthcare professionals, and has a statutory mission to contribute to federal emergency response capabilities. This report provides an overview of VHA's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on its activities and emergency preparedness efforts. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing mitigation strategies, testing, and treating veterans with the virus. VA provided information on positive cases to congressional committees and the public, with the number of diagnoses expected to increase as testing expands. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has implemented measures to contain and mitigate COVID-19 exposure. Patients are advised to contact their healthcare providers if they have symptoms, use online portals for communication, and expect enhanced screening measures at VA facilities. VA has also announced safeguards for nursing home residents. VA announced safeguards for nursing home residents and spinal cord injury patients on March 10, 2020. No visitors are allowed at VA nursing homes or SCI/D centers, except for end-of-life situations. New admissions are limited, and enhanced screening procedures for respiratory illness and COVID-19 exposure are in place at all VA facilities. Each facility has its own screening procedures, with standardized questions. VA medical centers have implemented a two-tiered system to separate COVID-19 cases from other care. The VA has implemented a two-tiered system to separate COVID-19 cases from other care, with active and passive zones. All elective surgeries have been canceled, and routine appointments limited. VA policy on testing patients for COVID-19 and treatment post-diagnosis is described. Testing samples can be sent to various centers for testing, and providers decide on a case-by-case basis. Diagnostic testing is covered if patients show respiratory symptoms and other risk factors. The VA may waive copayments for COVID-19 testing and medical visits for veterans during the public health emergency. Cost-sharing for the COVID-19 diagnostic test is uncertain for veterans subject to copayments. VA has not indicated a specific treatment plan for COVID-19 patients, with treatment depending on symptom severity. Coverage and cost for COVID-19 treatment follow standard VA medical benefits, with some veterans possibly needing to pay copayments for care. Eligible veterans must be enrolled in the VA health care system and have received care in the past 24 months for coverage at urgent care or walk-in clinics. Veterans needing urgent care must use VA-contracted community providers. If care is received from a noncontracted provider, full cost may apply. Copayments may be required at VA-contracted urgent care facilities. Non-VA emergency care must meet specific criteria for VA payment or reimbursement. The veteran must meet specific criteria for VA payment or reimbursement for emergency care received from a noncontracted provider. This includes the condition being of a nature where immediate medical attention was necessary, no feasible VA or federal facility was available, recent VA healthcare utilization, financial liability to the provider, and lack of coverage under a health plan contract. Veterans receiving emergency treatment for accident or work-related injuries must first pursue claims against a third party for payment. Homeless veterans are at higher risk for COVID-19 due to lack of access to sanitary facilities. VA offers programs for homeless veterans, and grants are available for housing and services, including transitional housing, rental assistance, and support services. VA released guidance on March 13, 2020, for its grantees administering programs for homeless veterans, recommending actions like developing response plans, coordinating with local entities, and preventing infection through CDC-recommended methods. This includes keeping beds at least three feet apart in congregate living facilities. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) announced on March 18, 2020, that all regional offices will be closed to the public starting March 19. This decision was made to ensure the continuity of services for homeless veterans. Measures such as keeping beds at least three feet apart, conducting health assessments for clients, and isolating individuals showing COVID-19 symptoms were recommended to prevent infection in congregate living facilities. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) announced on March 18, 2020, that all regional offices will be closed to the public starting March 19. VBA is directing veterans to use the Inquiry Routing & Information System (IRIS) or call 1-800-827-1000 for claims assistance. VBA is facing network operationality issues and is conducting tests on the network throughout the week. Regional office directors are to make decisions on work flexibility based on community circumstances. In FY2020, over 900,000 individuals are expected to receive veterans educational assistance from various programs. Due to COVID-19, some participants may experience disruptions in their training and education, leading to potential reductions or loss of benefits. This could result in students needing to stop out, discontinue working, or take a leave of absence. Additionally, training establishments, educational institutions, and work-study providers may temporarily or permanently close, impacting beneficiaries in various ways. Some educational institutions may need to reduce participants' hours, enrollment rate, or rate of pursuit due to COVID-19. This could lead to students transitioning to distance learning or moving off campus. Individuals receiving benefits in foreign countries may face similar circumstances and may need to return to the United States. VA has requested schools to refrain from making enrollment adjustments for online courses not previously approved. VA may continue to pay GI Bill benefits for up to four weeks following the temporary closure of an educational institution under an established policy based on an executive order of the President, or due to an emergency situation. Other limitations noted in the correspondence would be alleviated by recently passed legislation. The National Cemetery Administration has provided limited information for the survivors and dependents of veterans who have passed away and are scheduled to be buried in National Cemetery. As of March 18, 2020, NCA has provided guidance for families and funeral directors regarding interments and services for veterans at VA National Cemeteries. Visitors should follow local restrictions on visitations and travel. Families can choose to inter now and hold the committal service later, with NCA accommodating requests. For families opting for the committal service now, CDC recommendations for group gatherings should be followed. Funeral directors are asked to adhere to CDC guidelines for group gatherings during full committal services, with cemetery personnel advised against handshaking and unnecessary physical contact. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working with funeral directors and families to accommodate future committal services for those who decide to postpone. NCA has established an \"Alerts\" web page for checking cemetery operating status and directs the public to its social media pages for updates. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has additional authorities to contribute to the federal emergency response effort during emergencies and disasters. During emergencies and disasters, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has additional authorities to contribute to the federal emergency response effort. This includes caring for nonveterans and veterans not enrolled in the VA health care system, with service-connected veterans receiving the highest priority for VA care and services. During disasters or emergencies, VA prioritizes care based on clinical need, providing resources to civilian health care systems and assisting with acquisition and logistical support. VA can support HHS by providing ventilators, medical equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals. State, tribal, or territorial governments can request assistance from the federal government through their local HHS Regional Emergency. The House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (H.R. 6201) on March 14, 2020, providing $30 million for VHA's medical services and community care accounts for COVID-19-related expenses. VA can assist HHS by providing resources like ventilators and medical supplies during emergencies. S. 3503 allows VA to continue providing GI Bill benefits for distance learning courses due to emergencies from March 1, 2020, to December 21, 2020. VA can pay the full housing allowance for these courses. Post-9/11 GI Bill participants in distance education are eligible for half the national average housing allowance, except for those covered under S. 3503. The Administration is requesting $16.6 billion for VA's COVID-19 response in FY2020, with $13.1 billion for medical services including healthcare treatment costs and personal protective equipment. An additional $2.1 billion is requested for community care to provide three months of healthcare treatment. $100 million is also included for emergency management coordination and travel costs. The emergency supplemental appropriations request includes funding for coordination of overtime payments, travel and transport costs, and upgrades to VA medical facilities in response to COVID-19. Additionally, $1.2 billion is allocated for upgrading telehealth and internet technology for remote healthcare services."
