The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) are vital for the health and nutrition of American children, serving millions of students daily. These programs are a joint effort between the Federal, State, and local governments, with over $12 billion spent in 2009 to ensure students receive healthy meals. School food service programs are facing budget crises due to increased student participation and costs. A study found that 52% of programs are charged indirect costs by local educational agencies, leading to inconsistency in identifying and calculating these costs. It is crucial for school food service to operate on a nonprofit basis, balance costs with revenue, and ensure all generated revenue is utilized effectively. The Act aims to ensure Federal funds benefit the health and nutrition of American children by studying indirect and direct costs charged to school food programs and encouraging effective use of revenue to support or improve food service. The Act focuses on studying costs and funding related to school food programs to improve the health and nutrition of American children. The Secretary of Agriculture will issue guidance on allowable costs for school food authorities participating in the school lunch and breakfast programs. Additionally, a study will be conducted to assess indirect and direct costs for these authorities.

The regulations will ensure that only reasonable and necessary costs are reimbursed. A report on these regulations must be submitted to specific committees by October 1, 2013.
