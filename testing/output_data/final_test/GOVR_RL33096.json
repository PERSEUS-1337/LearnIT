    "content": "Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, causing extensive wind damage and catastrophic flooding. It led to Presidential disaster declarations for Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Hurricane Rita, a category five hurricane, made landfall in late September 2005, prompting aggressive preparedness efforts following the devastation of Katrina. The death toll from Hurricane Katrina is estimated to have exceeded 1,200 people, with ongoing investigations into the causes of death. The aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita led to over 4,000 missing persons and 2 million displaced individuals. The logistical challenges included communication breakdowns, blocked physical access, civil disorder, and difficulties in delivering aid to isolated victims and hospitals. This required emergency evacuations of critically ill patients to overwhelmed triage centers. Various entities, including governments, businesses, faith communities, and volunteers, all contributed to relief efforts. The response to Hurricane Katrina involved various entities like local governments, businesses, faith communities, and volunteers working together to provide relief. Coordinating public health and medical activities was a challenge, with public health activities focusing on identifying and preventing health problems in populations, while medical activities involved delivering healthcare services to individuals. The medical response may have been more challenging than the public health response. The response to Hurricane Katrina involved coordination of various agencies and organizations at different levels of government. Congress and the Administration created new authorities and plans to improve disaster response after previous incidents. Local and state governments are the first responders, with federal assistance available when needed. Federal assistance is provided under the Stafford Act and other authorities when resources are overwhelmed. The NRP places the Secretary of Homeland Security in charge of coordinating the federal response, while the Secretary of HHS coordinates the public health and medical response. Congress may review response efforts and laws post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to improve national response capability. The report focuses on the public health and medical response to the 2005 hurricanes, particularly Hurricane Katrina. It discusses the roles of agencies in HHS and DHS, policy issues, and the Stafford Act authorizing federal assistance in disasters. FEMA is responsible for administering major disaster declarations. In 2005, President Bush issued major disaster declarations for hurricanes in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. FEMA administers the Stafford Act, providing federal assistance through the Disaster Relief Fund for activities like mass feeding, shelter, debris clearance, and aid for uninsured needs. Federal agencies reimbursed through the DRF for providing assistance under the National Response Plan. The National Response Plan (NRP) is the framework for federal and voluntary agencies to operate during disasters, replacing the Federal Response Plan in 2004. It does not establish new federal authorities but aims to assist state and local authorities. The Secretary of HHS is responsible for coordinating public health and medical services under Emergency Support Function #8. The Secretary of HHS is responsible for coordinating public health and medical services under ESF#8, which includes activities such as assessment of health needs, medical care personnel, patient care, safety and security of medical products, food safety, worker health, behavioral health care, vector control, water and waste disposal, victim identification, and animal health protection. The HHS Concept of Operations Plan (CONOPS) outlines how HHS plans to implement its emergency preparedness and response authorities. The Secretary of HHS is responsible for coordinating public health and medical services during emergencies, with the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (ASPHEP) directing and coordinating efforts. HHS does not have primary responsibility for mass care coordination. HHS is not responsible for mass care coordination, urban search and rescue, or certain ESF activities. They rely on other agencies for support in activities like public safety and power restoration. NDMS provides medical services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) operates under FEMA and provides medical services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Other critical components of the medical response are housed in the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, as well as the private sector. States have authority in responding to public health events, with the federal role being mainly supportive through funding, personnel, and specialized services. The federal government provides funding, personnel, and specialized services for public health emergencies. The Secretary of HHS can declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Service Act, with provisions for waiving certain requirements during emergencies. The Secretary of HHS can declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Service Act, allowing for actions to be taken in response to emergencies such as disease outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks. The declaration expires when the emergency no longer exists or in 90 days, but can be renewed if needed. In response to Hurricane Katrina, HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt declared public health emergencies in several states, including Texas and Louisiana. The declarations were renewed for Katrina-affected states through January 31, 2006. Additionally, public health emergencies were declared in anticipation of Hurricane Rita's landfall in Texas and Louisiana. The HHS Secretary declared public health emergencies in response to Hurricane Katrina in several states, including Texas and Louisiana. The decision to declare emergencies in certain states but not all appears to be at the Secretary's discretion, with no specific thresholds or conditions outlined. Federal leadership for public health emergencies rests with the Secretary of HHS. The Secretary of HHS leads public health emergency response, with key roles in OPHEP and CDC. HHS provides support to states and communities during public health threats. Response activities post-disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are reimbursed through DRF. All HHS agencies were involved in the Hurricane Katrina response. Public health challenges after Hurricane Katrina included compromised water supplies, sewage disposal issues, food and waterborne illnesses, power outages leading to foodborne illness and electrocution risks, traumatic injuries from wind damage, and threats from animals and insects. Predictable causes of death post-disaster included drowning, automobile crashes, carbon monoxide poisoning, and exacerbated chronic conditions. The majority of hurricane-related deaths in the United States before 1990 were due to drowning from storm surges. However, with improved early warning and evacuation systems, indirect causes of death such as electrocution and carbon monoxide poisoning have become more common. Despite warnings, Hurricane Katrina resulted in deaths from coastal storm surges and flooding in New Orleans. Public health threats included dehydration and heat stress, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions. The HHS Office of the Secretary coordinated public health and medical support during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, declaring federal public health emergencies in several states. They mobilized healthcare professionals and deployed over 2,000 Commissioned Corps officers to assist in relief efforts. Emergency Operations Centers were activated to respond to the disasters. The HHS response to emergencies includes activating Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) at headquarters and various agencies, ensuring continuous communication and coordination. Changes in national public health response capability have been made since 9/11 and anthrax attacks in 2001, with ongoing efforts to improve EOC communication with state agencies. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) under CDC plays a role in public health response. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), conducts various functions related to public health and hazardous substances. This includes health assessments, consultations, surveillance, emergency response, research, information dissemination, and education. ATSDR has conducted health hazard assessments following disasters like the oil spill in St. Bernard Parish, LA, after Hurricane Katrina. The CDC also provides public health information through a website post-disaster, offering fact sheets and resources for health professionals. The CDC website provides information and updates for various professionals and the public. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) serves as a point of contact for assistance and information exchange. CDC staff with various specialties were deployed to affected states, along with the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies. The CDC deployed staff with various specialties and the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies to states affected by Hurricane Katrina. Specific supplies included vaccines, insulin, pain medications, and ventilator kits. The agency also made public health recommendations for infectious disease control, including immunization of emergency responders and evacuees. CDC expressed concerns about tetanus, influenza, measles, chickenpox, and hepatitis A in crowded conditions. Additionally, CDC alerted health officials to cases of Vibrio infection in hurricane victims. Vibrio infection in hurricane victims caused 22 illnesses, five fatal. CDC warned health workers about the severe effects of Vibrio infections. CDC and EPA issued a joint report on environmental hazards in New Orleans. FEMA requested CDC's help in assessing health effects of housing displaced persons in trailers. CDC also evaluated the health threat of mold exposure and provided assistance in environmental cleanup efforts. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, various agencies like NIOSH, FDA, and CDC provided assistance in occupational safety, health resources for responders, handling of drugs and medical devices, and ensuring food safety. The medical response to disasters can be more challenging than public health responses. The medical response to disasters involves coordination of various sectors, including public and private entities, and non-traditional partnerships. Six key elements are essential for a successful medical response: patients, care site, drugs/supplies/equipment, provider workforce, record keeping system, and financing mechanism. National disaster planning has long anticipated mass casualty incidents, but recent events in the United States have not seen overwhelming numbers of non-fatal illness and injury victims. Hurricane Katrina is the only recent event in the United States that caused non-fatal mass casualties on a scale that overwhelmed the existing healthcare system. The response to this challenge is still under scrutiny, with federal leadership for medical emergency response based in HHS. Numerous medical response programs and activities are housed within HHS agencies, including the Commissioned Corps of the PHS and the National Disaster Medical System. Hurricane Katrina presented challenges to the healthcare system with physical access to facilities hampered, leading to difficulties in maintaining care standards. Patients with pre-existing conditions suffered due to lack of access to essential medications and treatments. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, victims faced challenges accessing essential healthcare services such as oxygen, insulin, and kidney dialysis. Dehydration was a common issue in flooded areas. Evacuations to temporary field hospitals and healthcare facilities outside the flood zone were conducted. Medical teams worked to reach isolated communities along the Mississippi and Louisiana coast. Morgues were set up to house and identify the deceased. Victims were sent to various healthcare facilities across the southern United States, often separated from loved ones and medications. Public health emergencies were declared in nine states hosting evacuees from Hurricane Katrina, leading to challenges in healthcare coverage for the uninsured. Mental health needs of victims and responders, including long-term disorders like major depression, were a focus. Services had to consider pre-existing mental health and substance abuse issues in some victims. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services played a role in addressing these challenges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) took actions to streamline healthcare access for Hurricane Katrina and Rita evacuees by waiving program requirements. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides grants for underserved populations and administers programs for emergency preparedness. HRSA undertook response efforts following Hurricane Katrina, including staff deployments and advancing funds to establish new health center sites in impacted areas. Providers serving at temporary locations in response to the hurricane continued to receive liability protections. The National Institutes of Health and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provided support and resources in response to Hurricane Katrina, including medical consultation services, hospital bed capacity identification, and GIS development for contaminant tracking. SAMHSA's mission is to aid in recovery for those with substance abuse and mental illness. They provide funding through programs like CCP and SERG to address mental health needs of disaster victims. Eligible entities can receive grants for counseling and training local crisis counselors. SAMHSA provides grants for counseling, outreach, and training local crisis counselors to assist after federal relief workers depart. SERG is available when local resources are overwhelmed. SAMHSA may offer SERG for crisis mental health and substance abuse services. Supplemental appropriations can be used for emergency mental health and substance abuse counseling and related services. This may include substance abuse and mental health treatment services, psychotropic medication expenses, methadone treatment, suicide prevention programs, and major administrative expenses. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was established in HHS in 1984. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was established in 1984 to provide medical services during disasters. It was reauthorized in 2006 and transferred to DHS in 2003. NDMS is administered by FEMA and consists of response teams that can deploy rapidly and provide care for up to 72 hours. It also facilitates transportation of casualties to distant locations for further care. NDMS teams, comprised of 20-35 individuals, are trained in incident command and emergency management protocols. They can be requested by the Secretary of HHS and deployed in response to disasters. Medical professionals on the teams must be licensed in the U.S. and are federalized when deployed. FEMA deployed over 87 NDMS teams in response to Hurricane Katrina. DMATs, consisting of physicians and nurses, provide medical care and all of the nation's 50+ DMATs were deployed by FEMA. FEMA deployed all of the nation's 50+ Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) in response to Hurricane Katrina. Teams provided medical care at various locations, including the New Orleans Superdome and Louis Armstrong International Airport. DMAT members faced overwhelming numbers of patients and worked to accommodate victims across the Gulf Coast. Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORTs) also assisted, composed of various medical and support personnel. Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORTs) consist of 26 members who handle the dead and conduct victim identification and death investigations in mass fatality incidents. DMORT sites were established in Gabriel, Louisiana, and Gulfport, Mississippi, with four teams and a portable morgue at each site. Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMATs) are made up of veterinarians, technicians, and support personnel. Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMATs) provide animal rescues, health assessments, and support during disasters. Following Hurricane Katrina, all four VMAT teams were deployed to the Gulf Coast to care for displaced animals and damaged veterinary practices. NDMS also supports National Pharmacy Response Teams and National Nurse Response Teams for mass medication dispensing and healthcare support during disasters. Federal Coordinating Centers coordinate hospital bed capacity in civilian and military hospitals. NDMS coordinates hospital bed capacity in civilian and military hospitals, and assists in patient distribution during disasters. It is funded through the Public Health Programs account and received $34 million in FY2005 and FY2006. Emergency supplemental appropriations were authorized for Hurricane Katrina relief, with $100 million transferred from the DRF for NDMS operations. FEMA reported the full transfer in its weekly report to Congress. During a presidentially-declared disaster, the DOD and VA assist the Secretary of HHS with ESF#8 responsibilities, including providing hospital beds, personnel, supplies, and medical support. DOD had 789 beds available in field hospitals and 20 Navy ships in the region for humanitarian relief and transportation. The VA assisted in evacuating veterans from medical centers impacted by Hurricane Katrina and activated Federal Coordinating Centers to relocate evacuated patients. Concerns arose about federal readiness for natural disasters due to an emphasis on planning for terrorism. The discussion revolves around the balance between all-hazards preparedness and readiness for specific threats like a cyanide attack or pandemic influenza. Congress authorized grants for bioterrorism preparedness after the 2001 terror attacks, prioritizing bioterrorism and infectious disease outbreaks. There are concerns about whether the focus on terrorism has hindered preparedness for other threats, or if all-hazards grant guidance has failed to ensure readiness for specific threats like a cyanide or plague attack. Reports suggest that improvements made since 2001 streamlined the public health response to Hurricane Katrina. Improvements in all-hazards response since 2001 enabled swift operations during Hurricane Katrina. Disaster response personnel are required to submit after-action reports for review by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of the public health and medical response. The review of the national system for response to health emergencies includes developing standards for public health preparedness, prioritizing response assets effectively, coordinating assessments across all sectors, and deploying Emergency Response Teams for Assessment (ERT-A) after disasters. The FEMA-led Emergency Response Teams for Assessment (ERT-A) work with state Emergency Operations Centers to assess initial and ongoing impacts of disasters, including flooding, road integrity, and electricity grid damage. ESF support agencies are included in ERT-A deployments, reporting to an Interagency Incident Management Group for recommendations to the Secretary of DHS. The CDC manages a Disaster Epidemiology and Assessment program, developing rapid needs assessment tools for public health threats in disasters. The CDC conducts assessments for domestic and foreign disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. The tool is not designed for rapid assessment of medical or mental health needs. CDC has reported on longer-term assessments of medical and mental health needs in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Further review of this information will inform efforts to improve tools for needs assessment. Policy issues may include the performance of the FEMA ERT-A process in supporting specific goals of assessing public health, medical, and mental health needs following Hurricane Katrina. Following Hurricane Katrina, there were reports of problems experienced by fragile or medically needy persons, including drownings and dehydration in facilities that did not evacuate. Emergency evacuations of deteriorating patients from hospitals were also reported. The effectiveness of medical and mental health needs assessments post-disaster is questioned, along with the integration of these processes within the larger FEMA-led assessment. Hurricane Katrina exposed problems in healthcare facilities, such as communication failures and shared resource issues. Authorities in Texas and Louisiana prepared for Hurricane Rita by assisting those with special health needs and providing transportation for evacuations. Following Hurricane Katrina, issues in healthcare facilities were exposed, including communication failures and shared resource problems. The need for coordinated disaster planning in healthcare has been emphasized, integrating facilities into community-wide emergency management activities and ensuring care for vulnerable populations. Healthcare facilities are regulated by state and local authorities, with varying federal involvement, providing oversight for disaster preparedness. Regulations oversee disaster planning functions like evacuation and continuity of operations for healthcare facilities. Hospitals can sustain operations during power outages with generators, making evacuation challenging due to special patient needs. Better preparedness for continuity of operations may be more feasible than evacuation, although healthcare facilities should be prepared for both responses. Evacuation policies for healthcare facilities focus on fire safety drills and planning for predicted threats like hurricanes. Decision to evacuate may be guided by emergency management rather than healthcare expertise. Examples include mandatory evacuation orders for hospitals during disasters like Hurricane Charley in Florida in 2004. In 2004, one county issued a countywide mandatory evacuation order, while a neighboring county issued a mandatory order for nursing homes only. Federal oversight of healthcare facilities' disaster preparedness is through standards developed by OSHA and JCAHO. JCAHO certifies 85% of U.S. hospitals, meeting conditions for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. The 2005 accreditation manual includes standards for emergency management. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the enforcement of JCAHO certification standards for hospitals and other healthcare institutions. While JCAHO has certification programs for various healthcare facilities, not all programs are mandatory or comprehensive. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement conditions vary in addressing disaster planning, with state and local authorities playing a significant role in ensuring preparedness. Congressional testimony post-Hurricane Katrina emphasized the importance of hospitals preparing for disasters. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the importance of hospitals preparing for disasters within a community-wide structure. JCAHO's 2005 emergency management standards require hospitals to conduct a hazard vulnerability analysis and have emergency backup systems. Coordination with local emergency management authorities is also necessary. Reports following hurricanes in Florida in 2004 revealed challenges in delivering care to the chronically ill. Disaster planning for non-institutional services focuses on ensuring continuity of care. Disaster planning for non-institutional services focuses on continuity of care during and after disasters. Some communities have programs to identify vulnerable individuals. The National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program provides grants to improve emergency response capabilities at state and regional levels. The program aims to enhance preparedness but does not guarantee readiness for every facility or service in a state. Some states and communities have developed promising practices for disaster planning in healthcare, such as Florida's requirement for home health agencies to include individual disaster plans in patients' records. Special Needs Shelters were also established in Florida during the 2004 hurricanes to evacuate vulnerable individuals pre-identified by county health departments. Limited information is available on how states have utilized hospital preparedness grant funds. Special Needs Shelters were set up in New York City to care for individuals identified by county health departments, exceeding the expertise of regular shelters. The Office of Emergency Management coordinates with various agencies to plan for special-needs populations during disasters, using databases to pre-identify individuals. Redundant communication systems in city hospitals were praised after the 2003 blackout. Congress could consider examining these practices. Congress could consider examining federal requirements for facility disaster and evacuation plans, as well as the role of the HRSA hospital preparedness grant program in coordinated disaster planning in healthcare. The NDMS was transferred to DHS under FEMA in 2003 to ensure a coordinated federal response to disasters, supported by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) supported the transfer of the NDMS to DHS under FEMA in 2003. A review in 2004 highlighted fragmented medical response capabilities and lack of adequate support for field operating units. NDMS team members have complained about inadequate administrative support under FEMA. Some team members feel that their mission to provide direct medical services is not understood by FEMA management. The Lowell report recommended the appointment of a DHS Assistant Secretary for Medical Readiness to address these concerns. In July 2005, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff proposed reorganizing DHS into two separate directorates for emergency preparedness and response activities. He announced the appointment of a chief medical officer within the preparedness directorate to coordinate with partners at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. The chief medical officer, Dr. Jeffrey Runge, appointed by DHS Secretary Chertoff, will work with partners to prevent biologically-based attacks on human health and food supply. NDMS remains under FEMA, while the CMO is in the new Directorate for Preparedness, raising concerns about coordination and deployment approaches. The transfer of NDMS to DHS highlights differences in deployment approaches between NDMS and FEMA in response to disasters. NDMS teams are trained to rapidly deploy and set up field hospitals within 72 hours, while FEMA historically relies on state and local officials for the first 72 hours. After Hurricane Katrina, it was noted that FEMA struggled to support NDMS's rapid deployment capability. NDMS teams submit after-action reports to improve disaster response planning. Some analyses of the NDMS response to Hurricane Katrina have been released, with more expected, including one from DHS. Policymakers may review NDMS's mission alignment with national goals for terrorism and disaster response as its program authority expires in FY2006. Despite deploying all FEMA DMAT teams after Hurricane Katrina, there were reports of overwhelmed field hospitals and urgent calls for more medical personnel. HHS issued a call for volunteer health professionals to deploy to affected areas, and U.S. Public Health Service officers were put on alert for possible deployment. The NDMS, transferred to DHS in 2002, authorizes deployment of volunteers as disaster response personnel. By September 19, the call for additional personnel was lifted. Federalized VHPs must hold a current license in at least one U.S. jurisdiction. They are considered federal employees for liability and compensation purposes. VHPs can deploy at the request of affected states, following state licensure requirements. Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, Congress established a program to develop a national database for verifying the licensure and credentials of medical volunteers, addressing the challenge of verifying qualifications for mutual aid deployment. The Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP) program was established to create a national database for verifying the credentials of volunteer healthcare workers during emergencies. It provides funding and technical assistance to states for linking to the database, with pilots starting in some states. The program was funded at $8 million in FY2005, with a request for the same amount in FY2006. Congress allocated $4 million for FY2006, and the program's authority expires at the end of FY2006. The ESAR-VHP program is set to expire at the end of FY2006. Congress has tasked HHS with creating a nationwide system for health professional volunteers, but the DHS Chief Medical Officer also wants to coordinate this effort. Details on the CMO's responsibilities and coordination with HHS are not yet available. Legislation introduced after Hurricane Katrina includes establishing a National Emergency Health Professionals Volunteer Corps under HHS and providing assistance for using volunteers during emergencies. After Hurricane Katrina, HHS established an online service for health professionals to access prescription medication records for evacuees from various sources. Immunization records of evacuated children from Louisiana were also made available. After Hurricane Katrina, HHS made immunization records of evacuated children from Louisiana available to public health officials in host states. HHS Secretary Leavitt advocated for a national electronic health records system, citing the benefits for emergencies like pandemic influenza. The VA provided uninterrupted care to veterans evacuated from medical centers in Biloxi and New Orleans using their electronic health records system. Congress has introduced bills to enhance federal investment in health information technology infrastructure. Several bills in the 109th Congress aim to boost federal investment in health IT and incentivize EHR adoption and regional health information networks. The Senate passed a bipartisan health IT bill, S. 1418, which is now under consideration in the House. Several CRS reports on emergency preparedness, disaster assistance, and health information technology were authored by various individuals. Some of the reports include topics such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, civil liability of volunteer health professionals, disaster evacuation policy, and promoting electronic connectivity in healthcare. Marie Stevens authored the CRS Report RL31719, providing an overview of the U.S. Public Health System in the context of emergency preparedness."
