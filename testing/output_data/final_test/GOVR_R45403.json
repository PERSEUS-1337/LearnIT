    "content": "The central concern of Congress is providing for national defense, with U.S. technological advantage historically deterring conflicts and contributing to military victories. However, analysts believe this advantage is at risk due to global innovation changes, shifts in R&D funding, and the increasing technological capabilities of adversaries. Policymakers and Congress are exploring new approaches to maintain U.S. technological superiority in national security. The report provides an overview of changes in global R&D landscape, Administration's policies to maintain U.S. military technological leadership, actions by Congress, and potential issues. Before the 1940s, the U.S. relied on Europe for scientific capital, but WWII led to increased government funding for research and development. During WWII, President Roosevelt established the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to oversee scientific and technological efforts for the war. OSRD's R&D efforts, including the Manhattan Project and radar development, played a crucial role in the Allied victory. President Roosevelt sought recommendations from OSRD Director Vannevar Bush in 1944 for the future of the nation's scientific endeavors. Vannevar Bush's report, Science: The Endless Frontier, was a response to President Truman in 1945, advocating for an expanded federal role in supporting R&D and scientific talent development. The report emphasized the importance of government commitment to scientific research for national health, prosperity, and security in the modern world. It provided specific recommendations for federal government action to ensure continuous and substantial scientific progress. The report by Vannevar Bush in 1945 emphasized the need for continuous and substantial scientific progress to benefit the economy, health, and national security. It called for federal support for basic medical research, military research, and public welfare to create new jobs, products, and enterprises. This was a shift away from pre-war reliance on scientific capital from other countries. Science: The Endless Frontier report in 1945 led to a significant increase in federal R&D funding in the United States, with a focus on creating its own scientific capital and reducing reliance on Europe. This resulted in the establishment of the National Science Foundation and increased funding for various sectors. Federal R&D funding grew substantially from 1953 to 1966, with a majority allocated to national defense and space flight. Following WWII, the United States dominated global R&D spending, with defense-related R&D accounting for a significant portion. However, by 2016, the U.S. share of global R&D had dropped from 69% to 28% due to rapid growth in R&D spending by other nations. Despite a five-fold increase in U.S. R&D expenditures since 1960, the country's global share declined substantially. Since 1960, U.S. R&D expenditures have grown significantly, with federal government funding declining from 65% to 24% of total R&D funding by 2016. Business R&D funding more than doubled during this period, now surpassing federal government funding by nearly three times. This shift has had ongoing implications for U.S. and global technology development. The decline in federal defense R&D funding has implications for U.S. military technological superiority and global R&D trends. The decline in federal defense R&D funding has significant implications for U.S. military technology superiority and global R&D trends. Commercial opportunities largely drive business R&D in fields crucial for 21st-century military applications, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced materials. Competitive commercial markets fuel innovation, revenue generation, and investment in new technologies. In today's commercial environment, the federal government may struggle to keep up with the pace and cost of innovation in defense technologies. The Department of Defense (DOD) is increasingly relying on technologies developed by commercial companies for commercial markets, posing challenges in adapting its organizations and business models to access these technologies. The DOD must also adjust its business culture to embrace technologies from outside its traditional contractor base and find ways to leverage commercial technologies for defense applications. The challenges faced by the Department of Defense (DOD) in engaging with commercial companies for defense technologies are highlighted. Concerns about declining U.S. economic competitiveness and technological leadership are not new, with implications for economic growth, industrial productivity, employment, standard of living, and national security. America's technological leadership post-WWII led to economic growth, but trade deficits and competition in industries like automobiles in the late 1970s and early 1980s posed challenges. In response to declining U.S. economic competitiveness, Congress enacted legislation to improve development and commercialization, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, Bayh-Dole Act, Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, Cooperative Research and Development Act of 1984, and Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. Japan's economic success and technological capabilities raised concerns about U.S. competitiveness in the late 1980s. The rise of Japan's economic success and technological capabilities in the late 1980s led to concerns about U.S. competitiveness. Some attributed Japan's success to government-coordinated industrial policies and trade advocacy, while others saw it as a result of a superior competitive structure offered by Japan's economic system. The perceived loss of U.S. competitiveness was also linked to factors such as industrial complacency. In response to Japan's rising technological and industrial strength, Congress enacted legislation like the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989. The U.S. semiconductor industry faced a decline in market share during the 1980s due to competition from Japanese producers, with Japan surpassing the U.S. in commercial semiconductor chip production in 1986. The U.S. semiconductor industry faced a decline in market share during the 1980s as Japanese firms dominated the global market, leading to concerns about the loss of U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. The Department of Defense was particularly worried about this trend, with a report by the Defense Science Board highlighting the erosion of U.S. technological leadership in semiconductors. The DSB proposed a public-private semiconductor R&D partnership focused on next-gen technology, with DOD funding up to $100 million for SEMATECH. Congress directed funding towards research on advanced manufacturing techniques for various semiconductor products. SEMATECH was established in late 1987 under a memorandum signed by DOD and 11 U.S. representatives. SEMATECH was established in late 1987 with $100 million in funding from Congress and approximately $870 million from industry partners. It aimed to preserve the U.S. semiconductor's competitive position, although opinions on its effectiveness vary. Concerns about Japanese dominance in technology-intensive industries have lessened over the years. In recent years, concerns have been raised about competitive challenges from countries like South Korea and India. South Korea's success is attributed to export-oriented policies, business environment improvements, and innovation incentives. India experienced rapid growth in software, IT services, and IT-enabled industries in the 1990s and 2000s. India's population and IT industry, including outsourcing, provide a competitive advantage in creating and testing products tailored to developing countries. South Korea and India have improved their industries and living standards but do not pose a significant economic or national security threat to the US. China remains a dominant player in global technological dominance. China's leading role in driving advances in critical technologies poses a challenge to American military technological preeminence. The emergence of China as a potential military adversary and science and technology powerhouse threatens the Department of Defense's technological and industrial base. China's leading role in critical technologies poses a challenge to American military preeminence. China's national goal is to acquire foreign technologies to advance its economy and military capabilities through both licit and illicit means. China's share of global R&D funding has significantly increased, while the US, Japan, and Germany have seen a decrease in their collective share. China's R&D funding has been growing rapidly, surpassing Germany and Japan. If current growth rates continue, China may soon exceed the United States in R&D spending. China's R&D investments have grown by 1,264% between 2000 and 2016, far outpacing the growth of the US and the European Union. The total R&D funding of the 28 countries of the European Union combined was $208.8 billion, raising concerns among defense analysts and senior DOD leaders about military capability advantage. Obama Administration Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall highlighted the U.S. and allies' military dominance over the past few decades, citing examples from conflicts like the First Gulf War, Serbia, Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq. The rise of foreign capability and decline in U.S. research and development investments are threatening technological superiority. Adversaries have acquired technologies putting them on par with the West, particularly in information technology. China's strategy includes funding domestic R&D to achieve global technology leadership. China's strategy for global technology leadership involves reducing reliance on foreign technology, developing indigenous innovation capabilities, and closing the military gap with the United States. This includes a focus on dual-use technologies like AI, autonomous systems, robotics, nanotechnology, AR/VR, financial technology, and gene editing. China's approach includes theft of intellectual property, foreign direct investment, and China-based venture capital. China's strategy for global technology leadership involves reducing reliance on foreign technology, developing indigenous innovation capabilities, and closing the military gap with the United States. This includes a focus on dual-use technologies like AI, autonomous systems, robotics, nanotechnology, AR/VR, financial technology, and gene editing. China utilizes various methods such as industrial espionage, cybertheft, foreign direct investment, China-based venture capital, acquisition of companies, and sending Chinese students to study STEM in Western countries to achieve its goal of technological leadership.

China utilizes various methods such as industrial espionage, cybertheft, foreign direct investment, China-based venture capital, acquisition of companies, and sending Chinese students to study STEM in Western countries to achieve its goal of technological leadership. Plans and initiatives like the 13th Five Year Plan and Made in China 2025 guide China's public and private activities towards technological dominance. The National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy of the United States provide insights into the changing global R&D landscape and strategic framework for ensuring U.S. technological dominance. The National Security Strategy (NSS) emphasizes the importance of understanding global science and technology trends to maintain America's competitiveness. It recognizes the role of industry in developing new technologies vital for national defense. The National Security Strategy highlights the need for the federal government to utilize private sector technical expertise and R&D capabilities for national defense. Strategic partnerships with U.S. companies will align private sector resources to priority security applications, eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to innovation. Collaboration with industry will facilitate the rapid development and upgrading of new capabilities in line with emerging technologies. Defense Secretary Mattis emphasized the Department of Defense's commitment to leveraging private sector technologies for national security missions. Defense Secretary Mattis emphasized DOD's commitment to leveraging commercial research and development for leading edge capabilities, focusing on DOD-specific problems. The National Security Strategy prioritizes speed in technology development and acquisition to maintain a competitive edge against potential adversaries. The United States must field new technologies at the pace of modern industry to regain the element of surprise. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Secretary Mattis emphasized the need for DOD to shift to a culture of performance and affordability that operates at the speed of relevance. Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin discussed the implications of commercial firms leading technology development, which could reduce the U.S. military's technological advantage and necessitate new approaches for national security. Secretary Mattis highlighted the importance of speed in innovation and delivering military capabilities to maintain technological superiority over adversaries. He emphasized the need for DOD to leverage commercial research and develop new approaches to counter the advancements made by competing powers. Speed in developing new technologies is crucial in the current global landscape where technology parity is a challenge. The National Security Strategy emphasizes the need to develop new capabilities quickly to stay ahead of competitors. It also stresses the importance of protecting the National Security Innovation Base from adversaries seeking to gain access to American knowledge and expertise through both legal and illegal means. The NSIB is defined as the network of knowledge, capabilities, and people that turn ideas into innovations. The landscape of innovation is not limited to specific sectors, as technologies used in weapon systems often come from diverse businesses. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) builds on the National Security Strategy (NSS) framework, emphasizing the importance of maintaining America's innovation and technological edge to ensure prosperity and power. The NDS recognizes the changing global landscape, increased pace of innovation, reliance on commercial technologies for defense needs, potential erosion of U.S. technological advantage, and the need for cultural change within the Department of Defense (DOD). Rapid technological advancements and the evolving nature of warfare are driving the development of new technologies, including advanced computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and autonomy. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) emphasizes the importance of advanced technologies like computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnology for future warfare. The NDS highlights the need for maintaining technological advantage, rapid innovation, affordability, and cultural changes within the Department of Defense. It also recognizes the potential risks of state competitors and nonstate actors accessing these technologies, requiring changes in industry culture and protection across the National Security Innovation Base. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) emphasizes the importance of advanced technologies for future warfare, highlighting the need for maintaining technological advantage, rapid innovation, affordability, and cultural changes within the Department of Defense. It also stresses the establishment of a twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base to support Department operations effectively. The NDS mandates DOD structural and cultural changes to support innovation, empowering the warfighter with knowledge, equipment, and support systems to ensure success in combat. The Department of Defense is committed to consolidating, restructuring, and streamlining processes. They will adopt a rapid, iterative approach to reduce costs and acquisition risk. Changes in authorities and incentives will be made to increase delivery speed and involve warfighters in the acquisitions process. Under Secretary Griffin emphasized the need for innovation before the House Armed Services Committee. The Department of Defense is focused on innovation and partnerships with industry to maintain a technological edge. Initiatives like the Army Research Lab Open Campus and DIUx are key in fostering innovation. Policymakers are concerned about the erosion of the U.S. military's technological advantage. Concerns have been raised about the diminishing technological edge of the U.S. military due to increased development of advanced technologies outside the defense sector and barriers within the DOD. Congress has taken steps to address these concerns, such as eliminating the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics in 2016. The establishment of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD (R&E)) aimed to promote innovation and reduce risk-intolerance in pursuing new technologies within the Department of Defense. This position was created in response to the dominance of the \"acquisitions culture\" in the previous office, which hindered innovation and experimentation. The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD (R&E)) was reestablished in the FY2017 NDAA to drive key technologies for the \"Third Offset\" strategy, including cyber, space capabilities, unmanned systems, directed energy, undersea warfare, hypersonics, and robotics. This position aims to promote innovation and reduce risk-intolerance in pursuing new technologies within the Department of Defense. The USD (R&E) was established in the FY2017 NDAA to drive key technologies for the \"Third Offset\" strategy, promoting innovation and reducing risk-intolerance in pursuing new technologies within the Department of Defense. The USD (R&E) is tasked with advancing technology and innovation for the military services and DOD, overseeing research and engineering activities, technology development, prototyping, experimentation, and developmental testing. The USD (R&E) was established in the FY2017 NDAA to drive key technologies for the \"Third Offset\" strategy, promoting innovation and reducing risk-intolerance in pursuing new technologies within the Department of Defense. On February 15, 2018, Michael D. Griffin was confirmed as the first USD (R&E). The new organizational structure aims to create a more risk-tolerant and innovative DOD. Congress also shifted certain acquisition authority and management of RDT&E activities back to the military services, impacting the role and efficacy of the USD (R&E). The USD (R&E) was established in FY2017 to drive key technologies for the \"Third Offset\" strategy, promoting innovation within the Department of Defense. Michael D. Griffin, the first USD (R&E), believes in delegating programs to the services for daily operations. However, the office lacks direct authority over funding and program direction, making it advisory in nature. Congress may monitor its effectiveness in achieving its mission without direct control over programs and funding. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) was established to engage with start-up technology companies and commercial enterprises for innovative technologies. DIU has offices in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and Washington, DC, and provides capital to companies to solve defense problems. It uses other transaction authority to acquire prototypes from nontraditional defense contractors. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) uses other transaction authority to acquire prototypes from nontraditional defense contractors, providing federal agencies with more flexibility. Defense Secretary James Mattis supports DIU's growth, while some Members of Congress are cautiously optimistic about its engagement with new commercial sources of innovation. The conferees are optimistic about DIUx's potential to engage with new commercial sources of innovation and integrate new technologies into defense systems. They emphasize the importance of outreach to non-traditional defense contractors and express concerns about the focus and effectiveness of DIUx's investments to-date. Recent organizational and management changes are being made before seeking rapid expansion of resources for DIUx. Congress provided DIUx with $44 million in funding, which was $27 million below the President's budget request due to unjustified mission and personnel growth. The S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 requires a report on how DIU will be integrated into DOD research, measure impact, institutionalize best practices, and address challenges for nontraditional companies. Congressional actions raise questions on DIU's role as a 'change agent', challenges in working with DOD, appropriate size and funding, focus areas, and investment decisions. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) focuses on rapidly identifying and integrating new technologies into defense systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) has been increasing collaboration with academia and industry through initiatives like the Defense Innovation Board (DIB). The Defense Innovation Board (DIB) is appointed by the Secretary of Defense and includes senior representatives from U.S. technology companies, venture capital firms, research institutes, and universities. It provides independent advice on innovative solutions in areas like artificial intelligence, workforce capacity building, acquisition reform, and technology industry collaboration. Congress may oversee DOD's implementation of DIB recommendations. Congress may leverage the expertise of DIB members for policy changes and reform efforts to sustain DOD's innovative capacity. The Army Research Laboratory's Open Campus Initiative aims to strengthen S&T partnerships by co-locating Army R&D personnel in S&T hubs. Congress supports these efforts and encourages DOD to expand its presence locally and globally, citing the open campus program as a model for collaboration with the research and engineering enterprise. The committee recommends that laboratories embrace open innovation and become more active in the Department's requirements process. They cite the Army Research Lab's Open Campus project as a model for increased collaboration with the research community and suggest laboratories increase their presence in innovation hubs across the United States. Congress also supports DOD-backed venture capital funds to strengthen ties. Congress has supported DOD-backed venture capital funds, like the Army Venture Capital Initiative (AVCI), to enhance connections with innovative companies. The impact and success of AVCI's investments are unclear, prompting Congress to consider examining DOD's venture capital funds to ensure effectiveness and proper management. The Air Force has also established partnerships to foster collaboration with nontraditional partners. The Air Force and Navy have initiated partnerships with various organizations to accelerate development and commercialization in aerospace, advanced materials, human performance, sensors, and environmental technologies. Examples include collaborations with the Wright Brothers Institute and the Center for Technology, Research and Commercialization to establish innovative programs like CyberWorx. The Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, and the U.S. Special Operations Command have established partnership intermediary agreements with organizations to facilitate collaboration, innovation, and commercialization. Congress has expanded the Department of Defense's authority to use other transactions agreements, providing flexibility for tailored project needs. Other transactions (OTs) are flexible alternatives to contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, exempt from most federal procurement laws. They are legally binding agreements bound by select laws and regulations, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act and the Trade Secrets Act. Only agencies with OT authority can engage in OTs, with DARPA being granted OT authority in 1989 by Congress to spur innovation in the federal government. DARPA officials emphasize their unique organizational structure within the federal government, citing flexibility and efficiency due to their small size and flat hierarchy. Congress made DOD's ability to use Other Transactions (OTs) permanent in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, allowing for prototype acquisition and follow-on production activities. The use of Other Transactions (OTs) under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 allows for more flexibility in government contracting, attracting firms not typically involved. This has enabled the Department of Defense to access new sources of innovation, such as Silicon Valley startups. However, the awarding of a $950 million production contract to REAN Cloud by DIU raised concerns and led to a bid protest by Oracle America, Inc. that was sustained by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 requires DOD to collect data on the use of Other Transactions (OTs) and submit an annual report to Congress summarizing OT agreements. The House Armed Services Committee supports providing DOD flexibility to acquire advanced capabilities through streamlined processes, recognizing OT authority as effective for research and development. The committee emphasizes the importance of effective oversight in the Department's use of Other Transactions (OTs) for research and development. Congress should monitor DOD's increasing use of OTs to ensure alignment with congressional intent, promote innovation, and prevent potential waste, fraud, and abuse. The Department of Defense (DOD) is facing challenges in adapting to the rapidly evolving technology landscape, prompting reforms to enhance innovation and technology delivery to the military. Congress is urged to focus on oversight of organizational and procedural changes, particularly those led by the newly established position of USD (R&E). The USD R&E is leading structural and procedural changes in DOD's R&D enterprise. Policymakers should consider the office's structure, staffing, strategic plan, stakeholder input, and implementation of RDT&E activities. The USD R&E is implementing changes in DOD's R&D enterprise, focusing on prioritizing activities, maintaining technical workforce, and ensuring state-of-the-art facilities. Coordination of RDT&E programs, best practices, fostering risk-taking culture, and increasing collaboration with technology companies are key areas of interest. In the mid-term and long-term, Congress may focus on outcomes of DOD actions, such as transitioning promising technologies into operational use, metrics for success, increased use of prototypes, and DOD's tolerance for failure. Questions include the change in failure rate and speed of projects, resource reallocation speed, and pursuit of multiple lines of inquiry simultaneously. The USD (R&E) is evaluating the effectiveness of DOD's RDT&E activities, strategic plan implementation, technological advancements, collaboration with technology companies, use of innovative hiring authorities, and systemic changes within the agency. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 emphasized the importance of technology and industrial innovation for U.S. economic performance and technological leadership. Congress may hold hearings to monitor the competitive positions of near-peer nations in science and technology fields. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 highlighted the significance of technology and industrial innovation for the economic, environmental, and social well-being of the United States. It aimed to address concerns about potential U.S. decline in industrial and technological innovation compared to other nations, emphasizing the need for a national policy to enhance technological innovation. The act sought to improve technology transfer from federal laboratories to industry. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 aimed to improve technology transfer from federal laboratories to industry by requiring active technical cooperation, expanding information dissemination, and establishing Offices of Research and Technology Applications. The Government Patent Policy Act (P.L. 96-517, known as the \"Bayh-Dole Act\") allowed small businesses, universities, and not-for-profit organizations to obtain titles to inventions developed with federal funds. The Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-219) established the Small Business Innovation Research program, requiring agencies to set aside R&D funding for small businesses. The Cooperative Research and Development Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-462) aimed to encourage firms to engage in precompetitive research by eliminating treble damages for antitrust violations. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-502) authorized government-owned laboratories to enter into cooperative research agreements, share patent royalties with inventors, and made technology transfer a responsibility of each scientist and engineer. It also established the Federal Laboratory Consortium to facilitate technology transfer. The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-107) aimed to enhance the quality of American goods and services through an awards program and sharing successful quality improvement strategies. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-418) focused on trade and competitiveness measures. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-418) aimed to facilitate open, equitable, and reciprocal market access, reduce trade barriers, increase intellectual property protections, and improve enforcement of U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties. It also authorized trade adjustment assistance, extended federal patent royalty payments, and emphasized the protection of intellectual property rights in international science and technology agreements. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act for 1989 (P.L. 100-519) changed the name of the National Bureau of Standards to NIST, expanded its technology transfer role, established the NIST Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program to assist U.S. businesses in commercializing new scientific discoveries and enhancing productivity of small and medium-size manufacturers. The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-189) extended CRADA authorities to government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories, protected information created under CRADAs, and provided a technology transfer mission to the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons laboratories."
