    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of 1998\". Congress finds that hydroelectric power is a vital source of clean, renewable energy in the United States, offering various benefits such as recreation, irrigation, flood control, and wildlife support. The relicensing process for non-Federal hydroelectric projects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is due to occur in the next 15 years, highlighting the need for improved efficiency in the licensing process. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's licensing process for non-Federal hydroelectric projects is inefficient and does not lead to optimal decisions because participating agencies are not required to submit conditions by a specific deadline or consider a broad range of factors. The purpose of this Act is to improve the hydroelectric licensing process by authorizing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose deadlines for agencies to submit proposed conditions to a license, requiring agencies to consider a broad range of factors, and making other improvements to the licensing process. The Act aims to enhance the hydroelectric licensing process by allowing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set deadlines for agencies to propose conditions for a license, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of various factors, and implementing other enhancements to the licensing process. Definitions in the Act clarify terms like \"condition\" and \"consulting agency\" in relation to project licenses on Federal reservations and fishway construction. The Act aims to improve the hydroelectric licensing process by giving agencies deadlines to propose license conditions. Factors considered include economic impacts, power values, system reliability, air and water quality, and compatibility with other conditions. Consulting agencies must create written documentation detailing all proposals, comments, facts, and analyses related to factors considered before submitting a condition to the Commission. Each condition determined by a consulting agency must undergo scientific review based on current empirical data and peer review. Conditions must be directly related to project impacts within the Federal reservation. Before submitting a proposed condition to the Commission, a consulting agency must allow a license applicant to expedite review by an administrative law judge. The review assesses the reasonableness of the condition's impact on energy and economic values of a project, as well as the agency's compliance with relevant requirements. The review of a proposed condition by a consulting agency must be completed within 180 days of notification by the license applicant. Failure to provide a timely review may result in the Commission treating the condition as a recommendation. If a proposed condition is found to be unreasonable or if the agency fails to comply with requirements, it may be remanded by the administrative law judge or reviewing body. The reviewing body must render a decision explaining the reasons for finding a condition unreasonable or a requirement not met, and may make recommendations for improvement. The matter may be remanded to the consulting agency for further action after administrative review. After administrative review, a consulting agency must take appropriate action to formulate a reasonable condition or comply with requirements. The agency must submit the record and documentation of actions taken to the Commission. The Commission may set a deadline for the agency to submit recommended conditions after an applicant files for a license. The Commission may set a deadline for a consulting agency to submit recommended conditions for a license application. If the agency fails to meet the deadline, they lose the authority to recommend conditions, and the Commission may establish appropriate conditions. The Commission may grant a 30-day extension for deadlines set for submitting recommended conditions for a license application. They will conduct an economic analysis to determine if the proposed conditions would make the project economically unfeasible. If requested by a license applicant, the Commission will provide a written determination on the impact of conditions proposed by a consulting agency. The consulting agency's submitted conditions for a license must be in the public interest, reasonable, supported by evidence, and consistent with the Act. Technical amendments are made to sections 4 and 18 of the Federal Power Act. The conditions for a license must be in the public interest, reasonable, supported by evidence, and consistent with the Act. Technical amendments are made to sections 4 and 18 of the Federal Power Act. SEC. 5. COORDINATED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. Amendment to the Federal Power Act to include a coordinated environmental review process. The Commission, as the lead agency for environmental reviews, conducts a single consolidated environmental review for each licensed project under the National Environmental Policy Act. Deadlines are set for the submission of comments by government agencies, considering the license applicant's need for a prompt decision and available resources. The Commission conducts consolidated environmental reviews for licensed projects under the National Environmental Policy Act, considering the resources of government agencies and statutory requirements. SEC. 6 of the Act requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study the feasibility of a separate licensing procedure for small hydroelectric projects with a generating capacity of 5 megawatts or less."
