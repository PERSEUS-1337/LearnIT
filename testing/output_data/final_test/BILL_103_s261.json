    "content": "The Act titled the \"Preventing Our Kids From Inhaling Deadly Smoke (PRO-KIDS) Act of 1993\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that environmental tobacco smoke, originating from secondhand smoke exhaled by smokers and sidestream smoke from burning tobacco products, poses significant health risks. Studies have linked exposure to environmental tobacco smoke to lung cancer in nonsmokers, respiratory issues, and other health impacts, especially in sensitive populations like children, who are often exposed in indoor settings such as schools and public buildings. According to Congress, environmental tobacco smoke poses significant health risks, exceeding those of many regulated pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that it results in an annual economic loss of over $3 billion. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"children\" refers to individuals under 18 years old. \"Children's services\" include direct health and educational services funded by Federal funds. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. SEC. 4. NONSMOKING POLICY FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES. SEC. 4. NONSMOKING POLICY FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES. The Administrator will issue guidelines for implementing a nonsmoking policy at indoor facilities providing children's services within 180 days of this Act. The policy must prohibit smoking in areas not ventilated separately. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. The Administrator and the Secretary will provide technical assistance to persons offering children's services and others upon request. Assistance includes information on smoking cessation programs for employees and compliance with the Act's requirements. Each person providing children's services must establish and enforce a nonsmoking policy that meets certain requirements, including prohibiting smoking indoors and posting no smoking signs. A nonsmoking policy for children's services may allow smoking in ventilated areas not directly serving children, with a waiver option available for certain requirements upon petition to the Federal agency providing funds. The head of the Federal agency may grant a waiver for a nonsmoking policy after consulting with the Administrator, holding a public hearing, and receiving satisfactory assurances from the person requesting the waiver. The Federal agency head may grant a waiver for a nonsmoking policy if the person establishes and enforces an alternative policy to protect children from tobacco smoke exposure. The Federal agency head may grant a special waiver to a person who employs labor union members and provides children's services under a pre-existing collective bargaining agreement to establish and enforce an alternative nonsmoking policy to protect children from tobacco smoke exposure. The Act allows for a special waiver for employers with labor union members providing children's services under a collective bargaining agreement to enforce a nonsmoking policy. Failure to comply with the smoking restrictions outlined in the Act may result in civil penalties. Failure to comply with the smoking restrictions outlined in the Act may result in civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation, not exceeding the amount of Federal funds received for children's services. Each day of violation constitutes a separate offense, with penalties assessed by the head of the Federal agency providing funds after a hearing. The head of the Federal agency can assess civil penalties after a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, United States Code. Before issuing the order, written notice must be given to the person, who then has the opportunity to request a hearing within 15 days. The amount of the civil penalty is determined based on the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation. The head of the Federal agency can assess civil penalties based on various factors such as ability to pay, impact on operations, past violations, culpability, and willingness to comply. The agency can also modify or remit penalties as needed, with or without conditions. A person aggrieved by a civil penalty assessment can file a petition for judicial review within 30 days of the order. Failure to pay the penalty after a final order can result in consequences. The Attorney General can recover assessed penalties in court without review of validity, amount, or appropriateness. This section does not apply to individuals over 18 providing children's services in a private residence. Children's services provided in a private residence must only be offered to grandchildren, nieces, or nephews of the provider. The provider must be registered and comply with state regulations. This section will be effective on the first day of the fiscal year following the enactment of the Act. SEC. 7. REPORT BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.\n\nWithin 2 years of the Act's enactment, the Administrator must report to Congress on compliance with the Act and the legal status of smoking in public places.\n\nSEC. 8. PREEMPTION.\n\nThe Act does not override any state or local laws that are stricter than its provisions."
