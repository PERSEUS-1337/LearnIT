    "content": "The \"Voter Freedom Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act, which includes findings and purposes. The \"Voter Freedom Act of 1997\" includes findings that highlight the low voting participation in the US compared to other democracies and emphasizes the fundamental rights of eligible citizens to participate in the election process. These rights, protected by the Federal Government, include the right to vote, seek election, and associate for political purposes. The Federal Government has a duty to ensure that citizens' rights to create and develop new political parties are not impaired in elections for Federal office. Restrictions on ballot access can hinder citizens' ability to participate in the electoral process. Many States overly restrict access to the ballot for nonmajor party candidates and political parties through excessive petition requirements and other barriers. Many States impose high requirements for political parties to remain on the ballot, such as polling a high number of votes or registering a large number of voters. In 1983, the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional an Ohio law that favored major party candidates by setting earlier petition filing deadlines. This decision has influenced lower court rulings on challenges by nonmajor parties and candidates regarding early filing deadlines. In 1996, 34 States required nonmajor party candidates for President to qualify for the ballot before the second major party national convention. Twenty-six of these States required nonmajor party candidates to qualify before the first major party national convention. In 1996, nonmajor party candidates for President had to obtain a significantly higher number of petition signatures compared to major party candidates to be listed on the ballots of all 50 States and the District of Columbia. In 1996, nonmajor party candidates for President had to obtain a higher number of petition signatures compared to major party candidates to be listed on the ballots of all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Thirty-two states did not require signatures for major party candidates, while only three states did not require signatures for nonmajor party candidates. In 1996, the number of petition signatures required to list a major party candidate for Senate ranged from zero to 15,000, while for nonmajor party candidates it ranged from zero to 196,788. Thirty-one states did not require signatures for major party candidates, and only one state (Louisiana) did not require signatures for nonmajor party candidates if they were willing to be listed without a party label. In 1996, the number of petition signatures required to list a major party candidate for Congress ranged from zero to 2,000, while for nonmajor party candidates it ranged from zero to 13,653. Thirty-one states did not require signatures for major party candidates, with Louisiana being an exception. In 1996, several states required additional signatures for nonmajor party candidates to be listed on the ballot with a party label for President, Senate, or Congress. Louisiana only required a $600 filing fee for nonmajor party candidates for Congress. In 1996, some states had varying signature requirements for nonmajor party candidates to be listed on the ballot with a party label for President or Senate. California required 89,006 registrants for a party label, while Texas required 147,238 signatures in 105 days for nonmajor party candidates. Major party candidates had lower signature requirements in some states. In 1996, some states had different signature requirements for nonmajor party candidates for President or Senate. Texas required 43,963 signatures in 75 days, while seven states required a certain number of signatures in each congressional district. Twenty states restricted petition circulation for nonmajor party candidates. In 1996, several states had varying restrictions on petition circulation and signature requirements for nonmajor party candidates for President or Senate. Some states limited petition circulation to specific counties or congressional districts, while others prohibited individuals who voted in a primary election from signing petitions. Additionally, some states required signers to indicate intent to support or vote for the candidate or party. In 12 states, major party candidates faced varying petition requirements, with 5 states not requiring petitions at all. Two states had no nonmajor party Senate candidates on the ballot due to strict access laws, and two states had no nonmajor party House candidates. Restrictions on citizens' ability to participate were noted. The Congress has authority, under various provisions of the Constitution, to establish fair national standards for access to the ballot in Federal elections, removing barriers to citizens' participation and maximizing their rights. The Act aims to establish fair and uniform standards for ballot access in Federal elections to maximize citizen participation. SEC. 3. BALLOT ACCESS RIGHTS. An individual has the right to be a candidate and have their political affiliation on a ballot for a Federal election by presenting a petition with the required number of signatures. For a Federal election, a petition must have a certain number of signatures based on the number of voters in the previous election, with a minimum requirement of 1,000 signatures. The petition must also be circulated within a specific timeframe before the election date. For a Federal election, a petition must have a certain number of signatures based on the number of voters in the previous election, with a minimum requirement of 1,000 signatures. The petition must be circulated within a specific timeframe before the election date, with a special rule allowing individuals to be placed as candidates on the ballot. In a Federal election, ballot access rights are granted to a political party, body, or group without needing a petition if a candidate received one percent of the votes in the most recent general Federal election for President or Senator in the State. This provision does not apply to states with greater ballot access rights provided by law. The Attorney General will create rules to implement the Act. General definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal election,\" \"State,\" \"individual,\" and \"petition.\" The Act defines terms like \"signer,\" \"signature,\" and \"address\" in relation to petition requirements."
