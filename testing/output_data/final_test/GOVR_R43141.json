    "content": "In 1977, Congress passed the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act (P.L. 95-124), establishing NEHRP as a program led by USGS and NSF to research and predict earthquakes. However, in 1990, NEHRP shifted its focus to minimizing earthquake losses. FEMA became the lead agency for NEHRP in 1980, with additional funding authorized for earthquake preparedness and mitigation. In 1990, Congress changed NEHRP's focus from earthquake prediction to reducing earthquake hazards through the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act (P.L. 101-614). The law clarified FEMA's role, expanded program objectives, and required seismic safety standards for existing federal buildings. In 2004, P.L. 108-360 shifted program coordination from FEMA to NIST, establishing committees focused on earthquake hazard reduction. Program activities included developing measures to reduce earthquake hazards and promoting adoption of safety standards. The program focuses on reducing earthquake hazards by promoting safety standards and conducting interdisciplinary research. It also involves maintaining seismic monitoring systems and supporting earthquake engineering facilities. The NEHRP program aims to mitigate earthquake damage through improved materials, designs, and monitoring tools. Prior to P.L. 115-307, NSF supported NEHRI as the successor to NEES. The House Science Committee recommended restructuring NEHRP with NIST as the lead agency to enhance coordination and effectiveness. The 2004 law appointed the director of NIST as chair of the Interagency Coordinating Committee for NEHRP. The Interagency Coordinating Committee for NEHRP, chaired by the director of NIST, oversees planning, management, and coordination of the program. NIST leads NEHRP planning and coordination, supporting the development of seismic engineering tools. FEMA assists in preparing and disseminating building codes and practices, while also aiding in the development of performance-based codes for buildings and infrastructure. The NEHRP agencies, including FEMA, USGS, and NSF, work together to assess earthquake risks, develop building codes, and support research for building safety and performance. Enacted budgets for these agencies from FY2005 to FY2018 totaled $617.9 million, with a budget request for FY2019. The new NEHRP reauthorization act authorizes $760.3 million over five years, $142 million less than the previous authorization. It largely maintains the current four-agency program with some new areas of emphasis and specific funding levels. Introduced as S. 1768 and H.R. 6650, the bill went through the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The NEHRP reauthorization act, introduced as S. 1768 and H.R. 6650, was passed by the Senate and House committees and became law on December 11, 2018. The bill shifted NEHRP activities from earthquake prediction to hazard reduction. The 2018 NEHRP reauthorization act shifted focus from earthquake prediction to hazard reduction by introducing the concept of an earthquake early warning system. This system would automatically send alerts to areas in danger of shaking, allowing critical infrastructure to prepare before the earthquake's surface waves reach them. The 2018 NEHRP reauthorization act introduces the concept of resilience to earthquake hazards, emphasizing the importance of increasing community resilience to future earthquakes. It defines \"community resilience\" as the ability of a community to prepare, absorb, recover from, and adapt to seismic events. The act also highlights the importance of designing and constructing buildings to withstand earthquake damage. The 2018 NEHRP reauthorization act emphasizes the need for buildings to withstand earthquake damage and introduces the concept of resilience to earthquake hazards. It adds Oregon, Tennessee, and Puerto Rico to states at risk of seismic events and includes new measures for earthquake hazards reduction, such as publishing maps of active faults and liquefaction zones. The new NEHRP reauthorization act requires the publication of maps showing active faults, liquefaction susceptibility, and other seismic hazards. This repository of maps could help reduce earthquake risk for various stakeholders. The act also includes provisions for the development of the Advanced National Seismic System and earthquake early warning capabilities. The NEHRP reauthorization act includes provisions for earthquake early warning capabilities and the development of a strategic plan for NEHRP. It also requires the Interagency Coordinating Committee to develop memoranda of understanding with relevant federal agencies for data sharing and resource commitments in the event of an earthquake disaster. Coordination with NASA and NOAA is mandated for data sharing and resource allocation related to earthquakes. The NEHRP reauthorization act mandates the coordination of the Interagency Coordinating Committee with various federal agencies for earthquake monitoring, research, and data collection. It also requires collaboration with transportation and housing departments to address earthquake impacts on infrastructure. Additionally, the committee must coordinate with other natural hazards committees for data sharing and best practices. NIST remains the lead agency for the program, with FEMA retaining most of its duties and responsibilities. The NEHRP reauthorization act mandates coordination with federal agencies for earthquake monitoring and research. FEMA retains most duties, with modifications such as requiring cooperative agreements for earthquake hazard projects. States must provide a 25% cost share, which FEMA can waive for impoverished communities. The NEHRP reauthorization act mandates coordination with federal agencies for earthquake monitoring and research. FEMA retains most duties, with modifications such as requiring cooperative agreements for earthquake hazard projects. States must provide a 25% cost share, which FEMA can waive for impoverished communities. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5133(a)) is amended to require the USGS to develop procedures for issuing alerts and early warnings for earthquakes. P.L. 115-307 mandates the USGS to issue alerts and earthquake warnings to FEMA, NIST, and state and local officials when necessary. The act also updates language regarding NSF support for earthquake-related research and funding tracking within the NEHRP program. The NEHRP reauthorization act mandates coordination with federal agencies for earthquake monitoring and research. FEMA retains most duties, with modifications such as requiring cooperative agreements for earthquake hazard projects. States must provide a 25% cost share, which FEMA can waive for impoverished communities. P.L. 115-307 requires a report every two years on NSF funding for earthquake science research. The Comptroller General must review federal earthquake hazard risk reduction efforts within three years of enactment, focusing on USGS identification of earthquake risks, FEMA and NIST resilience efforts, and progress in NEHRP goals. The report will assess the effectiveness of research in earthquake risk reduction supported by NSF under NEHRP, dissemination of results to stakeholders, and application of research in public and private earthquake risk reduction. Recommendations from the Comptroller General to enhance NEHRP and U.S. earthquake resiliency will be included. P.L. 115-307 replaces seismic safety standards for federal buildings with an assessment and recommendations for improving the built environment and critical infrastructure. The NEHRP program direction is shifting towards enhancing earthquake resilience by focusing on reoccupancy and functional recovery time after earthquakes. A committee of experts will provide assessments and recommendations for improving the built environment and critical infrastructure. The committee, appointed by the Director of NIST and Administrator of FEMA, will include representatives from various sectors. The report with recommended options is due to Congress by June 30, 2020. The new act requires a new five-year management plan for the ANSS, including strategies for developing an earthquake early warning system, securing participation of state and regional earthquake monitoring entities, integrating geodetic and geospatial data, and evaluating additional data sources. The new act mandates a five-year management plan for the ANSS, including strategies for developing an earthquake early warning system and ensuring a geographically diverse management structure. The total five-year NEHRP authorization of appropriations is $760.305 million for FY2019-FY2023. The National Research Council recommended funding of $300 million annually for 20 years for earthquake research. Despite Alaska's high earthquake probability, predicting earthquakes remains impossible. NEHRP shifted focus to hazards reduction in 1990. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) focuses on understanding earthquake hazards, reducing risks, and promoting hazard reduction measures in the US. Legislation in the 108th Congress aimed to improve coordination among NEHRP agencies. The 2018 Reauthorization Act emphasizes resilience to earthquakes and enhancing early warning systems, with slightly higher annual appropriations levels than FY2017. The 2018 Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-307) slightly lowers enacted appropriations for the NEHRP program compared to FY2018 but remains higher than FY2017. The Act removes statutory language on earthquake prediction and focuses on reducing losses during earthquakes. Section 4 of the Act requires a review by the Comptroller General to assess how federal activities, states, tribes, and local governments are addressing earthquake risks and hazards."
