    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, ensuring a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all. \"Child find\" requires locating, identifying, and evaluating children with disabilities. Private school education is covered by IDEA, but requirements differ from those in public schools, leading to ongoing controversies over required services and funding. Under IDEA, private school education for children with disabilities has been a source of controversy. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of these children in private schools, with benefits comparable to public schools. However, the vague statute led to differences among states, localities, and courts. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, courts had differing views on providing services for children with disabilities in private schools. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard and ensured special education services for children in private schools consistent with the number enrolled. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 ensured special education services for children with disabilities in private schools, including parochial schools, funded by federal funds under Part B of IDEA. The 2004 reauthorization maintained much of the 1997 language but made changes to clarify LEAs' responsibilities. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified LEAs' responsibilities to ensure fair and equitable services for children with disabilities in private schools. The changes reflect current policy and aim to resolve contentious issues surrounding placements in private schools. A child with a disability may be placed in a private school by the LEA or SEA to fulfill the FAPE requirement, with costs covered by the LEA or SEA. Parents can unilaterally place their child in a private school, but reimbursement is only possible if certain findings are made by a court or hearing officer. IDEA allows for reimbursement of private school costs if FAPE was not provided in a timely manner. However, even if parents unilaterally place their child in a private school, a proportionate amount of federal funds must be made available. In cases of disagreement with the LEA, courts can order reimbursement for private school placement. The power to order school authorities to reimburse parents for private school expenditures is permitted only if a court determines the private school placement is proper under the act. Reimbursement may be reduced or denied for various reasons, such as lack of notice or unreasonable actions by parents. Reimbursement cannot be denied if the school prevented notice, parents were unaware of the requirement, or compliance would harm the child. Additionally, reimbursement may not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate or cannot write in English. The issue of whether FAPE has been or will be provided is complex and has been central to many judicial decisions, including reimbursement for parental private school placement. The Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley established that FAPE is met when a child receives personalized instruction with support services, meets state educational standards, approximates grade levels, and aligns with the child's IEP. The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of parents receiving reimbursement for placing their child in a private school if the child has not received IDEA services. In Forest Grove School District v. T.A., the Court ruled that reimbursement is authorized when a public school fails to provide FAPE and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of prior special education services. Recent lower court decisions have held that if a child is making educational progress with an IEP provided by the public school, they are not entitled to private school placement reimbursement. This standard also applies when parents want to place their child in a different private school. If a private school does not meet the child's needs, the court may not require reimbursement. Private school tuition reimbursement may not be required if the school does not adequately address the child's educational needs. Reimbursement is also barred if parents arrange for private school services without notifying the LEA or act unreasonably with the school. Children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by parents without arguing for reimbursement, but they should still receive special education services consistent with district requirements. The 2004 change in the law requires children with disabilities to be located in the school district served by the Local Education Agency (LEA) responsible for implementing IDEA. This change aimed to protect LEAs from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions, but it has sparked controversy due to issues such as disproportional effects on LEAs with many private schools and the lack of funding formula adjustments. The funding formula for private schools under IDEA has not changed, leading to potential conflicts with state laws. LEAs must provide equal federal funds for parentally placed children with disabilities, conduct child find processes, and may offer services on private school premises. State and local funds can supplement but not replace federal funds. LEAs are required to maintain records. Each LEA must maintain records and provide the number of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions. IDEA requires services for parentally placed children, but they do not have an individual right to receive the same services as public school children. LEAs must consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities on child find processes and federal funding allocation. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of federal funds for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, the consultation process between LEAs, private school officials, and parents, the provision of special education services, and the requirement for LEAs to provide a written explanation if services are not provided. Private school officials must sign a consultation affirmation with LEAs. If not, the documentation goes to the SEA. Complaints can be made to the SEA if consultation is inadequate. Dissatisfaction with SEA's decision can be escalated to the Secretary of Education. IDEA due process procedures do not apply. Private school officials must sign a consultation affirmation with LEAs, or documentation goes to the SEA. Complaints about inadequate consultation can be made to the SEA, with further escalation to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied. IDEA due process procedures do not apply to children parentally placed in private schools unless the complaint concerns child find."
