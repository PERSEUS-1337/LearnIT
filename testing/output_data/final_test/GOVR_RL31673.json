    "content": "The Air Force F-22 fighter, known as the Raptor, is considered the most capable fighter aircraft ever built. Procurement of 195 F-22s occurred between FY1999 and FY2009. Ongoing concerns for Congress include pilot oxygen supply, potential production resumption, aircraft reliability, modernization, and international sales. A fatal crash in 2010 prompted an investigation into pilots reporting hypoxia-like symptoms. At least 25 \"physiological incidents\" were recorded among F-22 pilots, with symptoms similar to hypoxia. The oxygen deprivation issue was attributed to equipment problems including valve issues in vests, improper programming of vests, and effects of charcoal canisters added by the Air Force during the investigation. The F-22 pilots experienced oxygen supply issues due to a valve problem causing vests to inflate at lower altitudes. The Air Force conducted basic testing on the valve in the past, but the issue was not detected when the vest was reintroduced on the F-22. In response to a 2010 crash, the Air Force is replacing handles on the emergency oxygen system of the F-22 fighter jet. Lockheed Martin delivered the final F-22 to the Air Force in May 2012, completing the fleet. The company stored tooling and documented the assembly process to potentially restart production. About 5,600 employees worked on the F-22 program at its peak in 2005. Lockheed Martin delivered the final F-22 to the Air Force in May 2012, completing the fleet. About 5,600 employees worked on the F-22 program at its peak in 2005, including 944 in Marietta. The current number is 1,650 companywide, 930 in Marietta. 600 Marietta employees will handle technical support and modernizations for the existing F-22 fleet. There is speculation about the potential restart of F-22 production for various reasons, with estimated costs being less than $200 million according to a Lockheed spokeswoman. In a 2009 study by the RAND Corporation for the Air Force, costs of different industrial scenarios for the F-22 were analyzed. Shutdown, hiatus, and restart would cost $513 million, $434 million more than termination. Lockheed officials mentioned it would cost $900 million to reopen the production line in 2010. The unit cost of any F-22s built after a potential restart is uncertain. The F-22A Raptor is a highly capable air-to-air combat aircraft with air-to-ground capabilities. The F-22 is a fifth-generation aircraft with stealth capabilities, supercruise, and thrust-vectoring for high maneuverability. It is designed to replace the Air Force's aging F-15 fighters. The F-22 is more stealthy and capable in air-to-air combat compared to the F-35. The F-35A is intended to be a more affordable complement to the F-22. The F-35A is a strike fighter with capabilities in air-to-ground and air-to-air combat, intended to complement the F-22. The Air Force views the F-22/F-35A combination as the future high-low mix of air superiority fighters and more affordable dual-role aircraft. Both the F-22A and the F-35 are key elements of U.S. defense and deterrence, enhancing other government efforts and reducing the need for military confrontation. The F-22A and F-35 are essential for maintaining air superiority and freedom of maneuver. The F-22A is a primary air superiority fighter with unmatched capabilities in speed, stealth, and maneuverability. Its ability to track and target threats ensures air dominance. The F-22 program, initiated in the early 1980s, aims to develop a highly capable successor to the F-15 to target enemy air and surface threats for air dominance. Milestone I approval was granted in October 1986, with the first flight of an industry prototype in August 1990. Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) approval was given in August 2001, and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in December 2005. Operational F-22s are currently stationed at various bases. The F-22 program aims to develop a successor to the F-15 for air dominance. Operational F-22s are stationed at various bases including Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Holloman AFB, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Tactics development is at Nellis AFB, and testing at Edwards AFB. Lockheed Martin studied a fighter-bomber version called the FB-22, but there is no current program for it. Major contractors include Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and United Technologies. Lockheed identified 1,040 F-22 supplier firms in 44 states. Lockheed estimated that the F-22 program supported a total of about 95,000 jobs directly or indirectly across 44 states. In 2009, there were 25,800 direct F-22-related jobs in 44 states. States with over 1,000 jobs included California, Texas, Georgia, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Washington, and Florida. Some states had only a few hundred jobs, while North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming had no direct F-22-related jobs. The Department of Defense planned to procure a total of 187 operational F-22s, including production aircraft and test vehicles. The Air Force initially planned for a production run of 750 F-22s, which was later reduced to 339 in 1997. The planned number of production F-22s was further reduced to 177, including 4 F-22s from the FY2009 supplemental appropriations act. The procurement quantities for F-22s from FY1999 to FY2010 totaled 195 aircraft. By December 31, 2010, the estimated total acquisition cost for a 179-aircraft F-22 program was approximately $67.3 billion, including research and development, procurement, and military construction costs. The F-22 program had a total acquisition cost of $67.3 billion for 179 aircraft by December 31, 2010. The Program Acquisition Unit Cost was $369.5 million and the Average Unit Procurement Cost was $185.7 million. Legislative limits were placed on engineering and manufacturing development costs and production costs. The limit on EMD cost was repealed in FY2002, leaving the limit on total production cost adjustable for inflation and changes in laws. The F-22 program had a total acquisition cost of $67.3 billion for 179 aircraft by December 31, 2010. Legislative limits were placed on production costs, with the adjusted limit for FY2009 being $37.6432 billion. The Administration's proposed FY2013 defense budget includes funding for modifications and maintenance of in-service F-22 aircraft, as well as research and development funding for software and squadrons. The Air Force established a program in 2003 to modernize its in-service F-22s, including upgrades to air-to-ground and ISR capabilities in four scheduled increments. The F-22 modernization program faced cost increases and delays, with the total projected cost more than doubling to $11.7 billion and the schedule slipping 7 years. Factors contributing to this included additional requirements, unexpected problems during testing, and funding fluctuations. Program oversight was hindered by how it was established and managed, as it was not treated as a major defense acquisition program. The F-22 modernization program faced cost increases and delays, with the total projected cost more than doubling to $11.7 billion and the schedule slipping 7 years. Factors contributing to this included additional requirements, unexpected problems during testing, and funding fluctuations. Program oversight was hindered by how it was established and managed, as it was not treated as a major defense acquisition program. Future F-22 modernization programs will be managed as major defense acquisition programs, including modifications or upgrades meeting the statutory definition. Congressional attention has also focused on F-22 sustainment costs and alternative methods for sustaining the F-22 fleet. The F-22A Raptor sustainment costs are projected to be significant, with an estimated $160.0 billion in total costs over the aircraft's useful life. The Air Force has already spent almost $1.4 billion on sole-source contracts for sustainment, and will need over $100.0 million for retrofitting the fleet to ensure they can fly for their full 8,000-hour lifespan. The Air Force completed an F-22A sustainment strategy review, finding a joint contractor/government approach could save over $1.0 billion in costs. Congress has included the Obey amendment in annual DOD appropriations acts since FY1998, prohibiting the sale of the F-22 to foreign governments. Japan's fighter force includes about 200 F-15s and 90 aging aircraft. Japan's fighter force includes about 200 F-15s and 90 aging F-4s. Japan wanted to purchase 40-50 new fighters to replace the F-4s through the FX program. Secretary of Defense recommended the F-35 over the F-22, but Japan preferred the F-22. Japan ultimately chose the F-35 in December 2011. Former Air Force Secretary mentioned Japan and Australia could partner to restart the F-22 line if Congress lifted the export ban. Other countries may also be interested in purchasing F-22s. The F-22 Raptor, unable to be sold outside the US, will be at the Dubai Air Show after missing the Paris Air Show due to debates over US Air Force purchases. With the F-22 program effectively ended, it is now less sensitive to showcase the aircraft internationally. The F-22 Raptor, previously debated for US Air Force purchases, will now be showcased at the Dubai Air Show. With the program effectively ended, displaying the aircraft internationally is less sensitive. President Obama signed the Defense Authorization Act for 2010, including language on a potential export version of the F-22. Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton will submit a report to Congress on foreign military sales of the restricted aircraft in about six months. The report will include cost estimates for developing an \"exportable version\" of the F-22 and analysis of the strategic implications for the United States of such sales. There are ongoing discussions within the Air Force about the need for more F-22s, with potential options including foreign sales to countries like Israel and Japan to sustain the production line. Maintaining air supremacy in the future may require continued use of the F-22. Lockheed Martin and the Air Force did not comment on potential foreign sales of the F-22, stating that decisions would be made by the U.S. government. The Air Force emphasized that the F-22 is not available for foreign sales due to its advanced capabilities. Despite discussions about the need for more F-22s and potential foreign sales to countries like Israel and Japan, the Defense Authorization Act does not guarantee such sales. Pike and Thompson question the likelihood of foreign sales of the F-22 despite the Defense Authorization Act not guaranteeing such sales. Lockheed Martin has been advised not to expect foreign sales of the fighter jet. Lockheed Martin's director of F-22A strategic plans and sustainment stated that foreign military sales of the F-22 are not assumed. Following a crash in 2010, the Air Force investigated pilots reporting hypoxia-like symptoms, with at least 25 incidents recorded. The Air Force investigated oxygen issues in F-22 pilots, with at least 25 incidents recorded. Various measures were taken, including installing charcoal canisters and examining operating procedures. Concerns were raised by Members of Congress about the safety of flying the F-22. The Air Force investigated oxygen issues in F-22 pilots, with at least 25 incidents recorded. The oxygen deprivation problem was attributed to a series of cockpit equipment issues, including valve problems in vests, improper programming of vests, and the addition of charcoal canisters. The valve was not strong enough to handle the higher pressure oxygen needed for flying at higher altitudes, leading to inflation of pilots' vests at lower altitudes. Basic testing was conducted on the valve. The Air Force conducted basic testing on the valve in pilots' vests, finding issues with inflation at lower altitudes. The valve caused problems in the F-22, leading to difficulties in operating the emergency oxygen system. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Air Force to explain how they have addressed these issues. The Air Force is required to implement recommendations from the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board to address F-22 oxygen issues. Any disagreement with the recommendations must be explained, and alternative corrective actions should be described. Retaliation against pilots raising safety concerns about the F-22 is deemed unacceptable. Congress had to decide whether to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft or provide funding for more. The debate over F-22 procurement emerged as a high-profile issue in the FY2010 defense budget. The White House threatened to veto any bill supporting acquisition beyond the 187 already procured. Disagreement between OSD and Air Force leaders on the total number of F-22s to procure led to the resignation of top Air Force officials in June 2008. The disagreement over the total number of F-22s to procure led to the resignation of top Air Force officials. Restarting production could change the economic argument for more F-22s, potentially benefiting the U.S. if costs are shared with a foreign buyer. Arguments exist for and against increasing the U.S. F-22 fleet size, with concerns about maintenance costs and funding for other Air Force programs. The Air Force fighter gap of up to 800 aircraft by 2024 is questioned due to assumptions on threats and coalition involvement. Procuring F-22s may not be the most cost-effective solution, with alternatives like F-35s, upgraded F-15s, or upgraded F-16s. Advocates argue for more F-22s citing the Obama Administration's defense strategy shift towards the Pacific. The current number of F-22s may not be sufficient for U.S. strategic goals in the Pacific theater. As F-22 mission-capable rates increase, maintenance costs per flight hour will decrease. Despite being expensive to operate, the F-22's capabilities justify the costs. The F-35 program is behind schedule and may not match the F-22's capabilities. Procuring additional F-22s could help maintain Air Force capabilities in case of delays in the F-35 program. The House Armed Services Committee acknowledges the importance of advanced fifth-generation aircraft like the F-35 and F-22 for projecting power. Concerns exist about the reliability and maintainability of the current F-22 fleet, with a reported mission capable rate of 60%. Critics argue this rate is below Air Force standards, while Air Force leaders defend the F-22's capabilities. Operations and sustainment costs for the F-22 are significant, with the Air Force spending $803.4 million in FY2012 for modifications and maintenance. The F-22 aircraft is facing issues with corrosion, with the Defense Department planning to spend $228 million to fix deteriorating panels. Lockheed developed alternative materials to address the problem. Concerns also arise about the cost effectiveness of the F-22 modernization program. Upgrading the aircraft's capabilities could enhance its mission flexibility. The F-22's air-to-ground and ISR capabilities will enhance mission flexibility and maximize the investment in the aircraft. Upgrading these capabilities could potentially replace UAVs in ISR missions. Critics question the necessity of these upgrades given the F-35's air-to-ground capabilities and existing ISR systems. Resolving avionics issues has been costly, and adding new features may pose risks to the program's progress. The F-22's avionics software progress could be jeopardized by upgrades like air-to-ground radar or new communications capabilities, potentially making the aircraft less stealthy. Congress is considering lifting the ban on foreign sales of the F-22, but the cost of restarting production may impact this decision. The FY2013 defense budget includes funding for modifying in-service aircraft. The FY2013 defense budget includes funding for modifying in-service aircraft and facilitizing Air Logistics Centers for F-22 maintenance. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommend authorizing requested amounts for F-22 without amendment. This includes funding for Increment 3.2B software and F-22A Squadrons. The committee recommends requiring the Air Force to report F-22A modernization and upgrade programs under the Selected Acquisition Reports system. Despite new production ending, there is still $11.7 billion for F-22A upgrades. The committee believes any F-22A program for modifications or upgrades should be tracked as a major defense acquisition program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on the costly and delayed modernization of the F-22A Raptor fleet, highlighting the complexity of upgrades compared to other fighter jets. The projected cost more than doubled to $11.7 billion, with a 7-year delay in full capabilities delivery. GAO expressed concerns that many F-22A Raptors may not receive their promised upgrades. The Air Force's F-22A Raptors may face delays in receiving capability upgrades, potentially limiting their utility. Sustainment costs for the F-22A could reach $160.0 billion, with over $100.0 million needed for retrofitting under the structures program. The Air Force needs over $100.0 million to retrofit the F-22A fleet for 8,000 hours of flight. Sole-source contracts totaling almost $1.4 billion were issued for fleet sustainment in the last 2 years. A joint contractor/government approach could save over $1.0 billion in sustainment costs. The Air Force must adopt the least expensive sustainment strategy and explore competition opportunities. Oxygen-supply problems for F-22A Raptor pilots are being closely monitored. The Air Force has documented 11 reported incidents of hypoxia-like symptoms in F-22A Raptor pilots since late 2011, with no conclusive root cause identified. Measures have been implemented to ensure aircraft safety, including new oxygen sensors and emergency handles. The Air Force has returned the F-22A to flying under its full mission envelope after grounding the fleet due to hypoxia-related symptoms in pilots. Despite some pilots expressing concerns, Air Force leadership maintains that the aircraft is safe to fly. The Navy faced similar issues with F-18s in the past but overcame them. The committee will continue to closely monitor the situation. The committee will oversee how the Air Force addresses the F-22A safety issue and directs the Secretary to explain the implementation of recommendations within 90 days. Any retaliation against pilots raising safety concerns is deemed unacceptable. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $333.9 million for in-service modifications in FY2013. The committee recommends authorizing $333.9 million in FY2013 for modification of in-service F-22s, an increase of $50.0 million from the Administration's request. Concerns about hypoxia-type events involving the F-22 and the importance of addressing the issue are highlighted. The recommendation includes $50 million for the procurement and installation of an automated backup oxygen system. The recommendation includes $50 million for the procurement and installation of a backup oxygen system for the F-22. The Committee directs the Air Force to provide updates on physiological events involving F-22 pilots and progress on implementing solutions. Funds cannot be used to sell the F-22 to foreign governments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a $4.4 million addition for FY2013 procurement funding for F-22 modifications. The committee recommends a $4.4 million addition for F-22 modifications, including a reduction of $17.5 million for engine modifications and an addition of $21.5 million for a backup oxygen system. The Air Force was directed to install an automatic backup oxygen system for F-22 pilots' health and safety, with a funding requirement of $21.5 million for procurement. The committee recommends an additional $21.5 million in fiscal year 2013 for the accelerated procurement and installation of an automatic backup oxygen system (ABOS) for F-22 pilots. Section 8038 of H.R. 5856 prohibits the sale of the F-22A advanced tactical fighter to foreign governments but allows for the development of a future export version that protects classified information and U.S. warfighting capabilities."
