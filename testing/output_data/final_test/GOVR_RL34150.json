    "content": "The 1997 Kyoto Protocol set emissions objectives for countries, leading to the development of implementation strategies. The European Union is using an emissions trading scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. This decision was influenced by the success of the United States' sulfur dioxide control program. The EU's Emissions Trading System covers over 10,000 energy-intensive facilities in its 27 Member States. The EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) covers over 10,000 energy-intensive facilities in 27 Member countries, accounting for 45% of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions. The program does not include emissions from the transportation sector or non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Phases 1 and 2 have already taken place, with Phase 3 planned for 2013 to align with the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction targets. The EU agreed to reduce emissions by 8% from the Protocol's baseline levels. By 2006, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU were 2.7% below Kyoto baseline levels, mainly due to a shift from coal to natural gas. The EU adopted the EU-ETS in 2003 to meet Kyoto Protocol targets. Emissions trading became more important with the accession of 12 new countries to the EU. Greenhouse gas emissions in the expanded EU dropped 7.7% from 1990 to 2006. The EC believes Phase 1 prepared the community for achieving reductions. The Phase 1 experience of the EU ETS prepared the community for achieving Kyoto Protocol reduction requirements by establishing critical infrastructure and improving emission data. It also jump-started project-based mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation. The Phase 1 of the EU ETS had a positive impact on CO2 reduction projects in developing countries, particularly in China and India. It also influenced corporate behavior, with many firms incorporating the value of allowances into their decision-making processes. However, some issues like allocation and new entrant reserves remain contentious as Phase 2 is implemented. The Phase 2 of the EU ETS faces new challenges related to National Allocation Plans (NAPs) and compliance criteria set by the EC. These challenges include ensuring emissions caps align with Kyoto targets, preventing discrimination between companies, and outlining the use of CDM and JI credits. The EU ETS Phase 2 faces challenges with NAPs and compliance criteria set by the EC, including preventing discrimination between companies and sectors, delineating the use of CDM and JI credits, and ensuring Kyoto compliance. The EC reviewed and approved all Member States' NAPs, reducing proposed allocations by an average of 10.5% to increase the EU's chances of meeting Kyoto Protocol targets. The effectiveness of the first phase in achieving real emissions reductions remains unclear. During the first phase of the EU ETS, Member States developed emissions baselines to project future trends in emissions based on population, economic activity, and greenhouse gas intensity. Uncertainties in data collection, monitoring methods, and forecasting economic growth were challenges faced in Phase 1. During Phase 1 of the EU ETS, uncertainties in economic growth rates led to inflated business as usual baselines, raising doubts about the actual emissions reductions achieved. Despite this, verified emissions in 2005 were 3.4% below the estimated baseline, and high allowance prices indicated some abatement efforts were taking place. This situation also raised concerns about potential \"windfall\" profits. During Phase 1 of the EU ETS, high EUA prices suggested abatement efforts were being made by power companies and industrial plants, with anecdotal evidence supporting this. However, Phase 1 EUAs lost their value in the final six months of 2007, indicating a decline in their transferability. The decline in EUA prices in 2007 was partially due to the non-transferability of Phase 1 EUAs to Phase 2. Excess Phase 1 EUAs became worthless by the end of 2007, leading to firm prices for Phase 2 EUAs. The EC's restrictions on Phase 1 EUAs in Phase 2 aimed to maintain market stability and prevent disruptive effects. The scarcity of allowances is crucial for market functioning, with Phase 2 NAPs using more verifiable data than Phase 1. The EUA market is evolving, with challenges ahead. The EU-15 needs further reductions to meet Kyoto requirements. The European Environment Agency projects a shortfall in emissions reduction, with three key actions proposed by the EU. By 2010, EU-15 emissions are projected to be 11.3% below Kyoto baseline levels. The EU-27 is projected to be 7.7% below Kyoto baseline levels by 2010, with a potential reduction of 10% with additional measures. 22 out of 25 countries are expected to meet their reduction requirements, with Denmark, Italy, and Spain falling short. The EC responded by reducing Member States' proposed ETS allocations, with only four countries unaffected: Denmark, France, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom. The EC has approved a proposal for mandatory CO2 emissions standards on light-duty vehicles. The linking directive for Phase 2 allows the use of Kyoto mechanisms for compliance, benefiting JI and CDM markets. The World Bank estimates a 900-1,500 million metric ton CO2e shortfall for the EU-15 in Phase 2, with potential compensation from JI/CDM projects. The World Bank estimates a 1,000-1,200 million metric tonnes of CO2e credits from CDM and JI projects could be imported into the EU-ETS, potentially balancing installations or creating a slight shortfall. However, the \"supplementarity\" requirements of the Kyoto Protocol may pose a barrier to this scenario. The approval process for NAPs resulted in reductions in proposed limits for some countries, while others saw an increase. Analysts believe these changes do not hinder the cost-effective use of JI/CDM. The World Bank assessed NAPs to limit imports of carbon assets to no more than 50% of the \"expected distance to target\" for each Member State, but analysts believe this does not constrain demand for CDM/JI from EU installations. The EU decision in November 2006 led to an immediate increase in the price of EUA-II, while uncertainty about supplementarity caps dampened prices for CERs. The advantage of EU access to the JI/CDM market is lower costs. Guaranteed CDM and JI credits are selling at a discount to EUAs, reflecting transaction risks. The Chinese government set a credit price floor, indicating its dominant role in the CDM market. The discount on CDM/JI credits depends on efforts to streamline procedures and integrate markets. The availability of JI/CDM credits will affect EUA prices, with potential for price increases. Observers praise the flexibility of CDM and JI in helping countries meet Kyoto requirements. The World Bank argues that flexibility mechanisms like Kyoto flexibility mechanisms and banking are better for cost concerns than a price cap. Flexibility is crucial for compliance without market distortion through price caps, as it is a tool to help achieve stringent targets and stimulate low carbon clean investment. Arbitrarily setting a price cap distorts innovation needed to meet compliance targets. The use of CDM and JI in the Kyoto Protocol raises concerns about hindering domestic investment efforts and the quality of credits, particularly in relation to additionality. WWF-UK emphasizes that CDM projects do not directly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions but only enable projects to proceed. Projects under the Kyoto Protocol like CDM and JI may not reduce global greenhouse gas emissions directly but enable investors to pollute more at home. It is crucial to ensure projects are additional to prevent an increase in global emissions. Eleven EU countries plan to use Kyoto mechanisms for their commitments, with allowances allocated free to participating entities. Some countries have the option to auction allowance allocations, with only a few utilizing auctions during Phase 1. The political difficulty in introducing significant auctioning into ETS allowance allocations is due to the widespread preference for free allocation of allowances by covered entities. Despite concerns about windfall profits and economic distortions, there is little change in the allocation philosophy for Phase 2, with most countries not proposing to auction the maximum percentage of allowances allowed. Denmark was the only country to auction the full 5% of allowances. The reluctance to use auctions in allocating emissions allowances is mainly due to equity concerns, such as the inability of some entities to pass on costs, potential economic impacts, and uncertainty about revenue recycling. However, economic analysis supports auctions as they align with the \"polluter pays\" principle and reduce distributional distortions compared to free allocation. In the EU ETS, auctions are favored for these reasons. Auctioning emissions allowances aligns with the \"polluter pays\" principle, reduces distributional distortions, creates a level playing field, and can improve market liquidity and transparency. In contrast, free allocations can lead to perverse incentives for covered entities and discourage efficiency improvements. The EU Member States have included provisions for allocating allowances to new entrants in the cap-and-trade system to address equity concerns and avoid disadvantaging Member States in competing for new investments. This decision prioritizes fairness over economic efficiency concerns. The EU Member States allocate allowances to new entrants in the cap-and-trade system to address equity concerns over economic efficiency. The size and distribution of this subsidy vary among Member States, influencing investment decisions of covered entities. Rules regarding the reserve's size, allocation, and managing demand-supply imbalances need to be established. Member States have not harmonized new entrant reserve rules. Countries have not harmonized new entrant reserve rules with respect to size or standardization on dispensing allowances and replenishing the reserve. Member States use different formulas for determining allowance allocations based on \"benchmarking,\" leading to technology or fuel-specific subsidies that vary by country. The study shows varying technology or fuel-specific subsidies for new entrants in different countries. For example, Germany offers an annual subsidy of 11 million euros for a natural gas power plant, while Sweden provides no free allocation. These subsidies can impact investment decisions, contradicting the purpose of emission trading systems. The issue of new entrant allocation in emission trading systems is tied to the closure policy, where allowances allocated to existing plants that shut down are fed into the entrant reserve for new sources. This policy can lead to inefficient facilities continuing operation to maintain the subsidy of free allowances. The closure policy in emission trading systems can create perverse incentives for inefficient facilities to continue operating to maintain the subsidy of free allowances. Germany and a few other countries have responded by imposing conditions that tie the allocation of allowances to the continued operation of the installation, effectively transforming the allocation into a production subsidy. In response to the closure policy in emission trading systems, Germany and other countries have introduced the \"transfer rule\" where owners of closing facilities can transfer allocations to new ones. Benchmarking is also used for new entrants, but expanding it to existing facilities is challenging due to process diversity. Benchmarking is challenging due to process diversity and can be manipulated to favor certain technologies or fuel sources. The Netherlands attempted to use benchmarks in its allocation scheme but abandoned the effort after developing 125 benchmarks. Germany's Phase 2 NAP allocates allowances to new power plants based on benchmarks reflecting best practices for each fuel type. Coal-fired facilities have a benchmark of 750 grams CO2/Kwh, while natural gas-fired facilities have a benchmark of 365 grams CO2/Kwh. These benchmarks represent achievable conversion efficiencies without carbon capture. The government proposed a new policy to provide allowances to new power plants based on benchmarks reflecting best practices for each fuel type, with almost no incentive to reduce CO2 emissions by fuel shifting. This could encourage the use of lignite, Germany's most abundant fossil fuel, due to concerns about dependency on imported Russian natural gas. The price of an EUA would need to reach 45 euro before lower-carbon emitting natural gas-fired facilities become more economic than coal. RWE's CFO discusses developing lignite energy with new technology and environmentally friendly processes, contingent on government creating the right political framework. The EC disapproved extending allowances to new entrants beyond the Kyoto compliance period but approved fuel-specific allocation formulas. National energy policies conflict with carbon market workings in most countries' allocation schemes, allowing substantial control over energy policy and economic investment. The carbon market's control over energy policy and economic investment is influenced by conflicting national energy policies. Economists argue that the strategy of preserving existing investments and jobs while lowering energy prices is based on a misconception. Deutsche Bank Research states that the objectives of climate protection and lower energy prices are contradictory, with higher energy prices being desirable from an ecological standpoint. More competition in the electricity and gas sectors may reduce prices, but this could be outweighed in the medium term. In the medium term, rising commodity prices and higher fiscal burdens may outweigh any reduction in prices due to more competition in the electricity and gas sectors. The EC has imposed limitations on countries' ability to influence investment, including disallowing guarantees of allowances to covered entities beyond the allocated phase. This is to prevent unfair advantages and lock-in of high carbon emitting technologies. The EC and member governments are concerned about locking in high carbon emitting technologies. The next 10 to 20 years will be a transition period towards universal carbon pricing. Governments need to avoid risks of high-carbon infrastructure by promoting advanced low carbon energy technology under the ETS. This involves reducing behavioral distortion from free allocation and implementing energy pricing reflecting carbon costs. The NAP 2 submitted to and approved by the EC generally have not reduced distortions from the free allowance system. Increasing auctions and uniform benchmarks could help reduce distortions. Only a few countries have implemented auctions for Phase 2 allocations. Uniform benchmarks are also rare. The Phase 1 experience provided valuable insights on emissions inventories and registries but did not stimulate new technology development through a price floor. Banking was underutilized in Phase 1, leading to price collapse in 2007. Phase 2 may see more importance placed on banking. Options for a price floor in the ETS include expanding auctions, financial instruments, and coverage of industries. The EC is slow in adopting auctions despite support from environmental groups and economists. The EU aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels. Phase 3 of the EU greenhouse gas program includes expanding coverage and considering longer allocation periods for allowances. The proposed EU-wide ETS cap for Phase 3 envisions a linear reduction to meet the 20% reduction target. Financial instruments are available but underutilized, with the EC slow in adopting auctions despite support from environmental groups and economists. The EC plans to reduce the ETS cap linearly to align with the 20% emissions reduction target. Changes in numbers will occur as countries expand ETS coverage to include more facilities and sectors. The EU aims to reshape the ETS for efficiency, harmonizing installations covered by the ETS across Member States. Phase 2 did not advance in harmonizing countries' allocation schemes. The EC is proposing to eliminate NAPs and replace them with EU-wide rules for allowance availability and allocations in Phase 3 of the ETS. This would involve one EU-wide cap instead of 27 national caps, with fully harmonized rules for auctions, transitional free allocations, and new entrants. No free allocations would be given to closed installations, and the coverage of industries in Phase 2 remains similar to Phase 1, except for aviation. The EC proposed including aviation emissions in the ETS in two phases, starting in 2012. Emissions would be capped at 97% of 2004-2006 levels, with 85% of allowances allocated free to operators. The cap would be reduced to 95% in 2013. The ETS would also expand to include petrochemicals, ammonia, and aluminum sectors, as well as nitrous oxide and perofluorocarbon emissions. This would increase ETS covered emissions by 4.6% in Phase 3. The EC proposes expanding ETS covered emissions by 4.6% in Phase 3, with additional increases expected from harmonization of eligibility criteria. To improve cost-effectiveness, a small installation exemption is suggested, with modifications to combustion size limitations. Approximately 4,200 installations may opt out, accounting for 0.70% of total ETS emissions. Auctioning would be the basic principle for allocation in Phase 3. The EC proposes to expand ETS covered emissions by 4.6% in Phase 3, with auctioning as the basic principle for allocation. At least two-thirds of allowances will be auctioned, starting in 2013, with full auctioning for the power sector and a gradual phase-in for other sectors. Concerns about carbon leakage will be addressed with exceptions to the phase-out of free allowances. Member states will conduct auctions and receive revenues in proportion to their 2005 emissions. The EC proposes to expand ETS covered emissions by 4.6% in Phase 3, with auctioning as the basic principle for allocation. Member states will conduct the auctions and receive revenues in proportion to their 2005 emissions and per capita income. A percentage of the proceeds should be used for various purposes including funding emission reductions, renewable energy, and assisting developing countries. The United States is not part of the Kyoto Protocol but may gain insight from the EU's experience with carbon emissions trading. The ETS experience highlights the importance of a credible emissions inventory for cap-and-trade programs. In the United States, the Clean Air Act Amendments require monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions from electric generating facilities. Owners can use continuous emission monitoring or fuel analysis for compliance. The EU-ETS experience suggests expanding data requirements for all facilities under a cap-and-trade program to develop allocation systems, reduction targets, and enforcement provisions. Despite economic analysis, the EU limited ETS coverage to six sectors, increasing compliance costs compared to a comprehensive trading program. Various practical, political, and scientific reasons were cited for this decision. The EU decided to limit the coverage of its ETS trading program to six sectors due to practical, political, and scientific reasons. Despite aiming to expand coverage in Phase 3, the ETS still covers fewer sectors emitting greenhouse gases compared to most U.S. cap-and-trade proposals, which typically include 80% to 100% of the country's emissions. The bills center on sectors like agriculture, commercial, and residential sources, with some discretion for EPA exemptions based on data and economic factors. Another focus is on the electric utility industry, which accounts for 33% of U.S. greenhouse gases. These bills may include controls for non-greenhouse gas pollutants like mercury. Adding sectors to an emission trading scheme, as seen in the EU's experience with the ETS, can be a slow and contentious process. If one believes the economy needs to adjust to a carbon-constrained environment, a comprehensive approach may be justified. The ETS experience shows setting up a tradeable allowance system is like creating a new currency, leading to windfall profits for allowance recipients. The power industry's windfall profits from emissions allowances in the trading scheme have sparked controversy. Producers of electricity marked up prices to include the value of allowances, creating distortions in the emissions markets. The free allocation of allowances incorporates mechanisms like new entrant reserves and closure policy, leading to a greenhouse gas reduction scheme influenced by national interests. The proposed expansion of auctions for Phase 3 of the ETS could simplify allocations and permit market forces to influence compliance strategies more fully. Efforts to expand auctions met opposition from industry groups but attracted support from environmental groups and economists. The EC's proposal to increase auctioning to two-thirds of total allowances for Phase 3 would represent a major development for the scheme. Proposals in the US suggest increasing use of auctions for emissions allowances, with a final target of 66%-100% auctioned. Funds would support new technologies, with some proposals including a reserve price to create a price floor. U.S. industry groups generally oppose auctions or prefer them as a supplement to free allocation. Congress may need to specify auction requirements to fully incorporate market economics into compliance decisions, similar to the situation in the EU's ETS. The EU's Phase 2 of the Kyoto Protocol allows for flexibility in meeting reduction targets through the use of project credits and banking of allowances for Phase 3. Market mechanisms and financial instruments are expected to reduce compliance costs and price volatility. However, Phase 1 experience with the ETS does not provide clear insights on the effectiveness of these mechanisms. The EU's Phase 2 of the Kyoto Protocol aims to create a stable allowance market through mechanisms like project credits and banking. Initial experiences with the ETS show extreme price volatility, but Phase 2 shows signs of a mature market developing. U.S. cap-and-trade proposals also aim to create a stable allowance market with devices like banking and offsets, with some proposals including a \"safety valve\" to limit allowance prices. Some proposals suggest creating a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to oversee allowance prices and implement cost-relief measures if needed. Concerns have been raised in the United States about regulating allowance markets and instruments due to the potential for speculation and manipulation. Analysis of ETS allowance prices in Phase 1 indicates a connection between allowance price changes and oil and natural gas price changes, raising the possibility of market manipulation. The text suggests potential regulatory oversight of financial instruments like options and futures contracts by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Congress may need to consider granting enhanced regulatory authority over these instruments."
