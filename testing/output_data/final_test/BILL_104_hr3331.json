Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by excessive bone tissue loss, leading to increased fracture risk. It affects an estimated 25 million Americans, with 80% being women. Additionally, 3-4 million Americans have related bone diseases. Osteoporosis causes 1.5 million bone fractures annually, including hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures. Direct medical costs of osteoporosis in the United States are estimated to be $10 billion annually, with projections of increasing costs due to the aging population. Technology now allows for early diagnosis, prevention, and management of osteoporosis. Funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases is limited at key research institutes. Further research is needed to improve medical knowledge on cellular mechanisms related to bone resorption and formation, risk factors for osteoporosis, and the effects of different agents on bone remodeling. The curr_chunk discusses risk factors for osteoporosis, bone mass measurement technology, calcium and vitamin D intake requirements for building denser skeletons. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for further educational efforts to increase public and professional knowledge of osteoporosis causes, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. SEC. 442A. RESEARCH ON OSTEOPOROSIS AND RELATED DISEASES. The Director of the Institute and other specified Directors shall expand research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases through mechanisms like investigator-initiated research, funding for new investigators, mentorship grants, and specialized centers. Authorization of Appropriations: $30,000,000 for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, $6,500,000 for the National Institute on Aging, $6,500,000 for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, $4,000,000 for the National Institute of Dental Research, and $3,000,000 for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development for fiscal years 1997 through 1999, with additional funding as needed for subsequent years. These funds are for research on related bone diseases, including osteoporosis. The term 'related bone diseases' includes Paget's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, renal bone disease, and primary or postmenopausal osteoporosis. The curr_chunk discusses primary or postmenopausal osteoporosis, secondary osteoporosis induced by corticosteroids, and other bone diseases related to abnormalities of vitamin D."
