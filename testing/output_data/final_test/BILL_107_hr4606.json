Alzheimer's disease is a disorder that destroys brain cells, leading to dementia with symptoms like memory loss, disorientation, and personality changes. In the US, 4 million people have Alzheimer's, with 19 million having a family member with the disease. Without a cure, it is projected that 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Alzheimer's disease affects a significant portion of the population, with 1 in 10 people over 65 and nearly half of those over 85 having the disease. The process may start in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms appear, leading to an average lifespan of 8-20 years post-symptoms. The average lifetime cost per person is $174,000, with the total annual cost of care in the US exceeding $100 billion. Medicare spent $31.9 billion in 2000 for Alzheimer's care, projected to increase to $49.3 billion by 2010. The total annual cost of care for Alzheimer's disease in the US exceeds $100 billion. Forty-nine percent of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease also receive Medicaid. Seven in 10 people with Alzheimer's disease live at home, with family and friends providing most of the care. The average annual cost of paid care for those with Alzheimer's disease at home is $12,500. At least half of nursing home residents have Alzheimer's disease or another dementia, with an average annual cost of care of $42,000. Medicaid pays nearly half of the nursing home bill. In 2010, Medicaid expenditures for nursing home care for people with Alzheimer's disease are estimated to increase to $33 billion. The Federal Government will spend $585 million on Alzheimer's disease research in 2002, a small amount compared to the $100 billion annual cost of the disease. If science can delay Alzheimer's symptoms by 5 years, the nation could save $50 billion in annual health and long-term care costs. 70% of people with Alzheimer's live at home where families provide 75% of their care. Family caregiving comes at a significant physical, emotional, and financial sacrifice, with an estimated annual value of $196 billion. Caregivers face risks such as illness, injury, medication use, and depression. Elderly spouses providing care are at a higher risk of mortality. Three-quarters of caregivers are women, with one-third having young children at home, leading to less time for other family members and increased family conflicts. Alzheimer's disease caregivers often experience work-related challenges, leading to missed work, part-time employment, or early retirement. This results in significant costs to American businesses, estimated at $36.5 billion in lost productivity and $24.6 billion in business contributions to care expenses in 2002. The National Institute on Aging's purpose is amended to include Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Additionally, there is an Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include an Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative, aiming to accelerate the discovery of risk factors, identify diagnostics and therapies, support clinical trials, and implement prevention and treatment strategies. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include an Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative, focusing on accelerating the discovery of risk factors, diagnostics, therapies, supporting clinical trials, and implementing effective prevention and treatment strategies to improve patient care and alleviate caregiver burdens. SEC. 5. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CLINICAL RESEARCH. Amends Section 445F of the Public Health Service Act to establish the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group. The Director of the Institute will establish a national consortium for cooperative clinical research on Alzheimer's disease to investigate therapies, enhance clinical trial infrastructure, develop novel trial approaches, expand patient enrollment, improve diagnostics, and include diverse populations. The Director of the Institute will conduct research on early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, including evaluating diagnostic tests and imaging techniques. Additionally, research on vascular disease will be conducted in consultation with other relevant institutes. The Director of the Institute, in consultation with other relevant institutes, will conduct research on the relationship between vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. This includes clinical trials to investigate if drugs for cerebrovascular disease can prevent or slow down Alzheimer's progression. Additionally, a National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center may be established to promote collaborative research among Alzheimer's Disease Centers and Research Centers. SEC. 6. RESEARCH ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CAREGIVING. Amends Section 445C of the Public Health Service Act to focus on research related to interventions for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. SEC. 7. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2003 to 2007 increased to $1.5 billion. Amendments made to aging process regarding women and clinical research and training awards. SEC. 8. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DEMONSTRATION GRANTS. Amendment to allocate $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and additional funds for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 to Section 398B(e) of the Public Health Service Act."
