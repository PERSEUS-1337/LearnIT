    "content": "The Act, known as the SAFE TECH Act, defines terms like \"Administration\" and \"Administrator\" as related to the Transportation Security Administration. It also addresses third-party testing of security screening technology. The SAFE TECH Act mandates the development of a program for third-party testing of transportation security screening technology within a year of enactment. This program will assess the technology's detection performance before procurement or development. The SAFE TECH Act requires third-party testing of transportation security screening technology to evaluate detection performance for explosives and prohibited items. The Administrator must coordinate testing with the Department of Homeland Security and international partnerships when feasible. The Administrator is required to conduct third-party testing of transportation security screening technology for explosives and prohibited items. This includes sharing information with international partners and aligning testing standards. Alternative testing factors may include health and safety, operator interface, and human factors testing at the TSA Systems Integration Facility. The Administrator, in consultation with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of Homeland Security, shall establish a framework for third-party testing of security screening technology to ensure it meets requirements before operational testing at transportation facilities. Phased implementation will be used to establish best practices. The Administrator, in consultation with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of Homeland Security, will establish a framework for third-party testing of security screening technology. The field testing may be prioritized by third parties, and entities must be owned and controlled by a U.S. citizen, with a waiver option for U.S. subsidiaries of parent companies with approved foreign ownership mitigation plans. The Administrator has discretion to reject proposals for third-party testing that require a waiver. Conflicts of interest must be avoided in entities providing testing for security screening technology. The Administrator, in coordination with the European Civil Aviation Conference, is developing a validation process for reciprocal recognition of security standards. This process ensures that international security partners comply with Administration standards. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a study on the third party testing program developed under the Act, including a review of efficiencies gained, oversight of testing entities, and the impact on introducing innovative detection technologies into security screening operations. The study will review the availability of testing for technologies developed by small to medium-sized businesses, along with any vulnerabilities related to national security, conflicts of interest, and waste, fraud, and abuse. The House of Representatives passed the document on January 9, 2018, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
