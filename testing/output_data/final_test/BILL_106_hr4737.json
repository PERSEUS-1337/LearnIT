The \"Nuclear Secrets Safety Act of 2000\" mandates an inventory of Restricted Data at national security laboratories within 90 days. The Administrator for Nuclear Security must report the findings to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. The Act defines \"national security laboratory\" and \"Restricted Data\" as per specific sections of relevant legislation. SEC. 3. INCREASED SECURITY FOR VAULTS AT NATIONAL SECURITY LABORATORIES. Increased security measures are implemented for vaults at national security laboratories, requiring verification of individual's identity before access using visual observation, biometric technology, or other high-confidence means. The Administrator ensures high-security measures for vaults at national security laboratories by verifying individual's identity through various means. Access to vaults requires maintaining a permanent record, changing lock combinations after removal of individuals, and complying with specified timeframes for lock changes. The Administrator for Nuclear Security must change lock combinations for vaults containing Restricted Data at national security laboratories within 30 days of this Act. Additionally, a report on the use of polygraph examinations within the National Nuclear Security Administration must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Armed Services within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The use of polygraph examinations is required for access to Restricted Data and vaults containing such data. Restricted Data is defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. After October 1, 2002, the National Nuclear Security Administration must use electronic locks that meet the FF-L-2740A standard to secure vaults containing Restricted Data. The title is amended to require an inventory of documents and devices containing Restricted Data at national security laboratories of the National Nuclear Security Administration to enhance security procedures for access to vaults with Restricted Data."
