    "content": "The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a 1,153-square-mile estuary in California that provides water to over 25 million people and habitat for various species. The Delta has faced competing water demands, leading to environmental degradation and decreased water supplies for urban, agricultural, and natural areas. Stakeholders with different interests, such as agricultural, urban, industrial, environmental, and recreational, are involved in the management of water flowing through the Delta. In 2007, flow restrictions were ordered on the Delta water projects. The Delta Protection Act of 1959 governs Delta waters to address salinity control and water supply issues caused by uneven distribution of resources, impacting California's water supply. The Delta in California faces challenges such as saltwater intrusion and contamination from runoff, impacting water supply. California law regulates water use through riparian and prior appropriation doctrines. Under the prior appropriation doctrine, a person who diverts water from a watercourse and makes reasonable use acquires a right to that water. Users must obtain permission from the state through a permit system. Riparian rights are shared equally among users, with appropriative rights prioritizing the first user. Under the prior appropriation doctrine, the first person to appropriate water has superior rights. Riparian rights take precedence over appropriative rights, allowing riparians to use water before appropriators. Water rights can be modified with permission from the Board, ensuring no harm to other legal water users. All water users, regardless of their rights, are limited to specific uses under state rules. The rule of reasonable use limits water rights to reasonable and beneficial purposes, upheld by courts as a valid exercise of state power. The public trust doctrine further restricts water rights, with the state acting as a trustee to protect water from harmful diversions. Two major water projects in California, the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP), transfer water throughout the state by diverting and storing water in reservoirs. The Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) in California transfer water by diverting and storing it in reservoirs. The CVP acquired appropriative rights between 1927 and 1967, complying with state law and acquiring water rights. Settlement contracts were negotiated with pre-existing water users to avoid legal issues. Reclamation negotiated settlement contracts with users holding pre-CVP water rights to the Sacramento River, providing agreed water allocations for 40 years. Exchange contracts ensured needs of pre-CVP users were met by selling San Joaquin River water rights to the government in exchange for substitute water delivery. The contracts involve a conditional permanent substitution of water supply. The United States has a right to use the Exchange Contractors' water rights for delivering CVP water from the Delta via the Delta-Mendota Canal. Reclamation holds legal water rights in the CVP and enters contracts with users based on contract terms rather than water rights doctrines. These contracts incorporate federal legislation requirements and address water shortage possibilities affecting users' access to water. The State Water Resources Control Board regulates water rights permits and water quality issues, including addressing water shortages that may impact users' access to water under their contracts. The Board has the authority to issue appropriation permits, determine surplus water availability, and protect the public interest. Applicants must apply for a permit to appropriate water from the Board. The State Water Resources Control Board regulates water rights permits and water quality issues, including addressing water shortages. Applicants must apply for a permit to appropriate water, which requires a review to determine surplus water availability and public interest. The Board considers beneficial uses and water resource plans, as well as regulates water quality under the federal Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to adhere to federal standards for water quality, including regulating saltwater intrusion as a form of pollution. States must maintain a planning process and review water quality standards every three years, subject to EPA approval. California's Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act implements the CWA and additional state requirements. The Porter-Cologne Act in California establishes nine regional boards to formulate water quality plans subject to state Board approval. The state Board has broad authority to set statewide water quality policy and must consider all demands on water resources. Litigation over water rights, Delta water management, and regulation of permits has influenced Delta management. In 1978, the Board exercised its authority to regulate water supply and quality. In 1978, the State Water Board adopted a water quality control plan to regulate salinity and protect Delta wildlife, modifying permits for water projects. In 1986, a court upheld permit modifications but found water quality standards insufficient under the Porter-Cologne Act. The Board was deemed responsible for providing water quality protection. The court emphasized the State Water Board's duty to protect the ecosystem in the Delta by establishing water quality standards that consider all users and future impacts. The Board must not focus solely on individual projects but must look at the overall system comprehensively. The court emphasized the State Water Board's duty to regulate both consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of water, including protection for fish and wildlife. The Board has the authority to modify permits to meet water quality standards and prevent degradation of water quality. State law allows the Board to reserve jurisdiction to modify permits issued. The State Water Board has the authority to modify permits to prevent waste or unreasonable use of water. The court recognized the Board's expertise in balancing considerations for water use. In 1995, a new water quality control plan was adopted with 17 beneficial uses, leading to lawsuits over flow regulation. The Board implemented alternate flow objectives agreed upon by interested parties, which was later challenged in court. The state court ruled against the Board for implementing provisions not included in the adopted plan, emphasizing the need to account for all objectives in the water quality control plan for the Delta. Various federal actions have led to reduced flows in the Delta rivers, such as Endangered Species Act consultations in the 1990s. Congress also passed the Central Valley Project Improvement Act to consider fish and wildlife preservation in the project's management. The project's authorization was amended to allocate 800,000 acre-feet of water for fish and wildlife purposes, resulting in reduced allocations for some water contractors. Litigation has addressed issues such as accounting for b2 water and reductions due to environmental conditions. In one case, a federal court upheld Reclamation's reduction of water released during a drought. Trinity County sued Reclamation in the late 1970s over reduced flows in response to drought conditions. The court upheld Reclamation's decision to reduce water flows in response to drought conditions, stating that it was reasonable and in compliance with federal Reclamation law. The measures adopted for fish conservation were deemed appropriate given the context of drought conditions. The court emphasized that the statutory provision for wildlife preservation should be considered in conjunction with the overall management practices of the Central Valley Project. The court issued an interim order in 2007 to protect the delta smelt by limiting water flows in the Delta. This order remained in place until a new biological opinion was issued in 2008, which upheld the restrictions. Another ongoing case in 2008 addressed protective measures for another species in the Delta, with potential restrictive measures pending court decision. The court has not yet decided on a remedy for water reductions. The Exchange Contractors have unique contracts predating the CVP, guaranteeing their water share. Congress regulates water under interstate commerce authority. Reclamation law governs water from federal projects. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937 reauthorized the CVP, regulating navigation and flood control. Federal legislation has led to action to protect environmental interests in the Delta. Congress may redirect Reclamation's authority in CVP operations. Recent events have brought attention to water resource issues in California, likely to remain of interest to Congress as new lawsuits arise. Two environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the state water resources department, SWRCB, and Reclamation in December 2008, alleging that water projects' diversions are causing environmental problems for fish and water quality, violating public trust doctrine and water quality requirements."
