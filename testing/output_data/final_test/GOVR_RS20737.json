    "content": "The September 2000 election of Vojislav Kostunica in Yugoslavia marked a significant political and economic shift, with the country facing challenges in transitioning to a free market economy and democratic system. The US and Europe have offered assistance in response to the country's devastated infrastructure from years of war and international sanctions. Limited U.S. economic assistance was provided to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1990s due to restrictions imposed after the Bosnia conflict. Humanitarian aid programs were initiated in Kosovo, targeting the vulnerable and elderly. USAID also launched a food aid program for refugees from Bosnia and Croatia. Democratization efforts faced challenges without U.S. monitoring on the ground. Some assistance was given to Albanian language newspapers and a civic education program in Kosovo. After the lifting of sanctions in 1996, a USAID office was established in Belgrade to support democracy and economic development. In Belgrade, a small program was initiated to support democracy, economic growth, and quality of life through U.S. and local NGOs. Projects focused on independent media, indigenous NGOs, and advising political parties. Economic projects targeted Montenegro, aiding in privatization and providing business services. The 1999 Kosovo war changed U.S. assistance in Yugoslavia, with Kosovo now under international administration. After the Kosovo war, Kosovo and Montenegro received significant U.S. assistance for reconstruction and development. Kosovo received aid for UN administrative budget, infrastructure repair, and law enforcement, while Montenegro received attention and assistance as a supporter against Milosevic. The United States provided $15 million in balance-of-payments support and technical assistance to help Montenegro survive economic disruption caused by the war. After the Kosovo war, the influx of Kosovar refugees caused by the war and Serbian efforts to destabilize it led to increased aid to Serbia. President Clinton committed $10 million to democratization, with additional funds supporting opposition parties, independent media, labor unions, and opposition local governments. The U.S. has continued to support Serbia's transition to democracy and economic reform since the end of the Milosevic regime. In the aftermath of the Kosovo war, the U.S. provided financial and trade sanctions relief to Serbia, along with $10 million in emergency energy support and $45 million in humanitarian food aid. Congressional action in October 2000 allowed for input on changes in Serbia, leading to the FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations removing previous restrictions on aid. In FY2001, Congress approved up to $100 million for Serbia aid, with a recommended expenditure of at least $89 million in Montenegro. Funding for Serbia includes $24.9 million for electricity supply, $9.8 million for heating system improvements, $22.1 million for municipal communities, and $14.3 million for economic policy reform. Congress also encouraged support for FRY membership in international organizations. In FY2001, the United States provided financial assistance for policy reform, bank supervision, emergency aid to the National Bank of Yugoslavia, microfinance activities, and support for democratic systems in Serbia and Montenegro. The Bush Administration requested $145 million for the FRY in FY2002. The Bush Administration requested $145 million for the FRY in its FY2002 budget. The House approved $60 million for Montenegro, while the Senate approved $115 million for Serbia. The United States pledged $181.6 million in international donor conference for 2001, with $75 million being FY2002 funds. The $100 million provided as FY2001 bilateral aid to Serbia had conditions attached, including cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the FRY (ICTY) and respecting minority rights and the rule of law. The Administration provided certification on April 2, with a watchful eye on FRY's continued compliance. Section 594 also impacted the U.S. position on FRY's entry into international organizations like the World Bank and the European Bank (EBRD). Montenegro, exempt from most aid restrictions, could benefit from international loans to the FRY. The bill instructed U.S. representatives to support FRY's membership in international institutions once the President certified resolution of debt issues. U.S. support for loans and assistance hinged on the same determination as the $100 million in bilateral aid. No assistance, except for specific categories, could be provided to countries under section 564. The bill instructed U.S. representatives to support FRY's membership in international institutions once the President certified resolution of debt issues. Assistance, except for specific categories, could be provided to countries that give sanctuary to indicted war criminals like Milosevic in the FRY. Despite the April certification, Members of Congress indicated that the FRY's cooperation with the Tribunal must be considered for future aid requests. President Kostunica was reminded of U.S. interest in seeing Milosevic handed over to the Tribunal during his visit to the White House. The Bush Administration threatened to skip aid notifications if cooperation was not met. The Bush Administration threatened to skip the international donors conference if no further steps were taken in handing over Milosevic to the Tribunal. The Administration announced it would attend the conference but disbursement of pledges would depend on FRY cooperation. The European Union and multilateral financial institutions are key potential aid donors to Serbia, with the IMF and World Bank unable to provide assistance until the FRY settled its debts and liabilities. On December 15, 2000, FRY settled arrears with EBRD and joined. On December 20, FRY paid $129 million to IMF, granted membership, and received a $151 million loan. IMF approved a $249 million stand-by loan through March 2002. FRY owes World Bank $1.7 billion in arrears but became a member on May 10 after meeting requirements. Bank set up a $30 million Trust Fund for short-term grant assistance. The EU and other European donors provided over $800 million in aid to the FRY for urgent needs such as heating oil, medicines, and food supplies. They also pledged funds for the restoration of navigation on the Danube. The EU and World Bank organized donor coordination meetings to clarify the FRY's priority needs and secure additional funding. The U.S. aid program for Kosovo is not significantly impacted by other donors, but there is a congressional limitation of 15% on U.S. aid. The U.S. has expressed that Europe should lead in Balkan development. At a donor conference, $1.3 billion was pledged, with the U.S. contributing 13.5% and EU members 47.4%. Issues with Serbia's treatment of Montenegro and Kosovo could affect U.S. assistance. The quality and quantity of future U.S. aid to Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo may be influenced by their independence movements. U.S. aid has supported the independence of Montenegro and Kosovo from the FRY, despite not formally endorsing their independence. Aid projects have helped strengthen their separateness from the FRY, creating the framework of an independent state in Kosovo. The change of regime in Belgrade offers new possibilities for peaceful settlements in both relationships. New possibilities for a peaceful settlement have emerged in Montenegro, with officials delaying an independence referendum until early 2002. While FRY leaders claim they won't interfere with Montenegrin independence, the US and EU oppose it and threaten to cut off aid. Congress has shown strong support for Montenegro, with specific funding levels allocated. In Kosovo, US assistance aims to support a peaceful outcome, although uncertainty remains about its effectiveness. The outcome of US assistance in Kosovo is uncertain if a peaceful settlement is not possible."
