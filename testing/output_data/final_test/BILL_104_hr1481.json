The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to provide RTC funding for various purposes, including making deposits in the Savings Association Insurance Fund and satisfying claims against the Federal Government related to supervisory goodwill. If the funds transferred to the Corporation exceed a certain amount, they must be returned to the treasury. If funds transferred to the Corporation exceed the necessary amount, the excess will be deposited in the Treasury's general fund. SEC. 4. Limited FDIC authority to temporarily transfer funds between the BIF and SAIF allows the Corporation to transfer funds between deposit insurance funds to maintain the designated reserve ratio. SEC. 5. One-time special SAIF capitalization assessment. Section 7(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to allow the Corporation to impose a special one-time assessment on Savings Association Insurance Fund members to recapitalize SAIF. The assessment amount cannot exceed 0.40 percent of the assessment base as of January 1, 1995. The proceeds from the assessment will be deposited into the SAIF fund, and the assessment can be imposed over a period of years. The Board of Directors may impose incremental assessments over a period of years, with a larger percentage allocated to the first year. They also have the authority to abate assessments for troubled institutions. Establishment of designated reserve ratio as a floor rather than a target. The designated reserve ratio for each insurance fund must be at least 1.25 percent of estimated insured deposits, as determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has the authority to set semiannual assessments to maintain the reserve ratio of any insurance fund at the designated reserve level, ensuring appropriate reserves against expected losses without excessive buildup. The Board of Directors can reduce assessments for insurance funds if the reserve ratio equals or exceeds the minimum designated reserve ratio. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to clarify that insurance fund assessments should primarily be used for insurance fund purposes and not diverted to other uses. Additionally, certain institutions insured by the SAIF are subject to FICO assessments. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act is amended to include certain Savings Association Insurance Fund members and Bank Insurance Fund members. The minimum SAIF assessment rule is repealed from the Federal Deposit Insurance Act."
