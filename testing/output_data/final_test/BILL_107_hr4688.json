    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Petrified Forest National Park Expansion Act of 2002\". Congress finds that the Petrified Forest National Park was established to preserve globally significant paleontological resources of the Triassic period and manage resources to retain cultural, natural, and scenic values. Adjacent land areas contain significant resources vulnerable to theft and disappearing rapidly. The purpose of this Act is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land to expand the boundaries of the Petrified Forest National Park and protect its rare paleontological and archaeological resources. This expansion aims to further protect nationally significant archaeological sites, preserve the scenic integrity of the landscape, and alleviate major threats to these resources. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"map,\" \"Park,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" SEC. 4. BOUNDARY REVISION. The Park's boundary is revised to include approximately ____ acres as shown on the map. The map will be available for public inspection. SEC. 5. ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL LAND. The Secretary can acquire private land within the Park's boundary from willing sellers. They can also acquire State land with consent and develop a plan for its inclusion within 2 years. Administration details are outlined in Section 6. The Secretary can acquire land for the Park and transfer administrative jurisdiction to the National Park Service. Grazing may continue on transferred land, and leases or permits can be terminated if necessary.
