The national security of the United States is threatened by terrorist attacks against American citizens, military personnel, institutions, landmarks, infrastructure, and industry. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in collecting and disseminating intelligence on terrorists and terrorist organizations to prevent attacks and bring perpetrators to justice. Previous terrorist attacks have underscored the importance of these efforts, including the investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, exposed flaws in intelligence storage, retrieval, and dissemination regarding known or suspected terrorists and organizations. It is crucial for agencies to have timely access to this information to prevent future attacks. The purpose of this Act is to establish an interoperable counterterrorism intelligence data system to store and retrieve information on known or suspected terrorists and organizations. It aims to ensure timely availability of this information to protect against terrorism at the Federal, State, and local levels. The Terrorist Identification Classification System is established under this Act to store and retrieve information on known or suspected terrorists and organizations. The Director of Central Intelligence is required to establish and maintain a list of known or suspected international terrorists and organizations. This list, known as the Terrorist Identification Classification System, must be shared with relevant departments and agencies. The Director also has the authority to determine who is included or omitted from the list. The Director of Central Intelligence maintains a list of international terrorists and organizations, using all-source intelligence. The list is shared with relevant government agencies and foreign entities, in accordance with laws governing intelligence collection. The Director of Central Intelligence reviews information provided by departments and agencies annually to ensure it comes from a wide range of intelligence sources. They certify if the intelligence community has provided comprehensive information for the list of international terrorists and organizations. Additionally, the Director must submit a report on criteria for information sharing to Congress by March 1, 2003. The Director of Central Intelligence must submit a report to Congress by March 1, 2003, detailing the criteria for sharing information on the list of international terrorists and organizations with various government agencies. The report should also include instances where sharing information would be inappropriate due to concerns about protecting sources and methods. The Director must ensure interoperability of the Terrorist Identification Classification System with relevant government information systems and effective field identification technologies. A report on the system's status must be submitted to congressional intelligence committees within one year of the Act's enactment. The report must certify whether the System contributes to domestic security, if departments have appropriate access, and if it maximizes its contribution. Any necessary modifications for a positive certification must be outlined. The report will be unclassified but may include a classified annex. The report must certify the System's contribution to domestic security and access by departments. It may include a classified annex and is to be submitted to congressional intelligence committees."
