The curr_chunk discusses an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code regarding percentage limitations on qualified conservation contributions. Contributions of qualified conservation contributions are allowed up to 50 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base. The curr_chunk explains that if the taxpayer's contributions exceed the limitation, the excess amount can be carried over as a charitable contribution for up to 15 years. Contributions described in the clause shall not be treated as redundant with other subparagraphs. \"If the individual is a qualified farmer or rancher for the taxable year in which the contribution is made, clause (i) shall be applied by substituting '100 percent' for '50 percent'. The term 'qualified farmer or rancher' means a taxpayer whose gross income from the trade or business of farming.\" The total deductions for corporations under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed 10 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income, except for qualified conservation contributions by certain corporate farmers and ranchers. Qualified conservation contributions by certain corporate farmers and ranchers, whose stock is not publicly traded, to eligible organizations are allowed as deductions, limited to the aggregate amount of contributions made. The excess of taxpayer's taxable income over allowable charitable contributions is subject to limitations. Any excess can be carried over as a charitable contribution for up to 15 years. Taxable income is computed without certain deductions. Taxable income is computed without certain deductions, including sections 199 and 1212(a)(1). Conforming amendments are made to sections 170(b)(1)(C) and 170(b)(1)(D) of the Code.
