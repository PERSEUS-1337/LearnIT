    "content": "Bonus depreciation was introduced in 2002 as part of corporate tax cut proposals to stimulate the economy after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The House passed H.R. 3090, which included temporary partial expensing for three years, similar to an investment credit. Other provisions in the bill included a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and an extension of net operating loss carrybacks. The Senate also developed proposals for business tax cuts, with the Finance Committee chairman's plan including several tax cuts for businesses. The Finance Committee chairman's plan included tax cuts for business such as expensing investments, increasing expensing limits for small businesses, and repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax. The Senate approved a version of H.R. 3090 with a 10% expensing provision, but it did not pass. A final version of H.R. 3090 in 2002 included a two-year 30% expensing provision known as bonus depreciation. In 2003, President Bush proposed corporate tax relief through an exclusion for dividends and a step up in basis. H.R. 2 enacted a 15% maximum tax rate on dividends and capital gains, along with a 50% bonus depreciation rate extended through 2004. Bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004. In 2003, President Bush proposed corporate tax relief through an exclusion for dividends and a step up in basis. H.R. 2 enacted a 15% maximum tax rate on dividends and capital gains, along with a 50% bonus depreciation rate extended through 2004. Bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004. Interest in short-term stimulus measures waned as the economy recovered, but resurfaced after Hurricane Katrina. Dividend relief and lower capital gains rates were extended through 2010, not solely for short-term stimulus. Recent economic concerns led to new interest in fiscal stimulus, with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extending and expanding bonus depreciation. The report discusses issues related to business tax subsidies as a fiscal stimulus, including the extension of bonus depreciation in various legislative acts. It questions the appropriateness of fiscal policy, the effectiveness of subsidies, and potential consequences of permanent subsidies. Investment subsidies have historically been provided through an investment tax credit, which has been used as a counter-cyclical measure. The investment tax credit was initially introduced in 1962 and repealed in 1969, reinstated in 1971, and made permanent in 1976. Economists noted distortions in asset types due to the credit. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the credit and moved towards a more neutral system. Accelerated depreciation can also provide investment subsidies but is not commonly used for counter-cyclical purposes due to complexity in tax law. Accelerated depreciation and investment credits have different impacts on tax law. Investment credits occur the year the investment is made, while accelerated depreciation adds complexity when used temporarily. Partial expensing allows a fraction of investment to be deducted upfront, with the remainder depreciated. A temporary partial expensing provision was included in tax legislation in 2002 and expanded in 2003, but expired in 2004. The 2008 stimulus proposal reintroduced bonus depreciation as a stimulus measure. Corporate tax rate changes have historically not been used for counter-cyclical purposes. The repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax in 2001 is similar to a corporate tax rate cut but its effects on investments are uncertain. Net operating loss carryback provides tax benefits similar to a rate cut but does not directly stimulate investment. Many economists have expressed uncertainty about the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus measures such as bonus depreciation and tax cuts. They are skeptical of fiscal policy as a counter-cyclical tool due to administrative lags and potential offset through a decline in net exports. In 2007 and 2008, concerns about the economy led to proposals for a fiscal stimulus, including bonus depreciation and tax rebates. A larger stimulus plan was adopted in 2009, extending bonus depreciation. Unemployment remained high despite economic growth in mid-2009. Additional small stimulus proposals were enacted in 2010. In 2010, stimulus proposals included extending bonus depreciation and the Bush tax cuts through 2012. Unemployment is projected to remain high, leading to discussions about fiscal expansion and business tax cuts. Fiscal stimulus aims to increase spending, with direct spending having a more immediate impact compared to personal tax cuts. Tax cuts can have a muted effect on the economy if only a portion is spent, with higher-income individuals likely to save more. Capital gains tax cuts may not effectively stimulate demand. Uncertainty about the future can also lead consumers to save rather than spend. Short-term measures to increase consumption may detract from long-term growth due to deficit finance. Government spending and tax reductions financed by deficits can crowd out investment, but stimulating investment spending could avoid negative effects on long-term growth. Government investment in infrastructure can provide a short-term stimulus without harming long-term growth. Subsidies to private investment spending could also prevent crowding out. If business subsidies are invested in, there would be no crowding out, but permanent subsidies could lead to a loss in efficiency. The success of investment subsidies depends on their effectiveness in stimulating spending. A business tax cut aims to boost investment by changing the cost of capital, but if there is little response in the short run, most of the cut may be saved or used to pay debt. A business tax cut aims to increase investment by altering the cost of capital, potentially leading to higher rates of return and incentivizing spending. Evaluating the effectiveness of such tax cuts involves considering empirical evidence, the \"bang for the buck\" in terms of cost efficiency, and other advantages or disadvantages. Despite efforts to analyze the impact of investment tax credits, there remains uncertainty regarding their effectiveness in stimulating aggregate investment. Tax credits and other factors affecting the tax burden on capital have shown little relationship to stimulating investment. Recent studies have found varying elasticity values for equipment investment, with one study suggesting a price elasticity of -0.66. This higher estimate reflects advancements in statistical identification of responses, but its applicability to overall investment stimulation is uncertain. During downturns, firms may not respond as strongly to changes in the cost of capital due to excess capacity. The timing of investment stimulus may be too slow to be effective, potentially occurring during the recovery phase. Evidence suggests temporary tax incentives like bonus depreciation may have little impact on business investment. The study by Cohen and Cummins at the Federal Reserve Board found little evidence to support a significant effect of temporary expensing on business investment. Reasons for this include firms without taxable income not benefiting, firms not electing bonus depreciation for eligible investment, and the small incentive effect reducing the user cost of capital by only about 3%. Adjustment costs and long planning periods may also limit the impact of investment subsidies. Knittel suggests that firms may have found bonus depreciation costly to comply with, as most states did not allow it. House and Shapiro found a more pronounced response to bonus depreciation, but the overall effect on the economy was small due to limited investment affected. Cohen and Cummins' study showed little evidence of bonus depreciation affecting investment timing, with surveys indicating minimal impact. Hulse and Livingstone's study had mixed results on the matter. The effectiveness of bonus depreciation in providing short-term economic stimulus is questioned. Policymakers aim to design business tax subsidies that offer the most powerful incentive per dollar of revenue loss. Three issues arise: the type of tax incentive, the impact of making the subsidy temporary, and the success of restricting the subsidy. The effectiveness of investment subsidies like bonus depreciation is compared to corporate rate cuts for economic stimulus. The size and impact of these subsidies depend on the durability of the investment. A corporate rate cut's effectiveness is measured against an investment credit using the ratio (g+d)/(r+d), where g is the normal growth rate, r is the after-tax rate of return, and d is the economic depreciation rate. The effectiveness of investment subsidies like bonus depreciation and corporate rate cuts for economic stimulus is compared. The value of these subsidies depends on the durability of the investment, with different ratios for structures and equipment. A corporate rate cut stimulates less investment per dollar of revenue loss compared to an investment subsidy, especially for short-lived assets. The stimulus also depends on the ratio of growth to return and on pre-existing capital stock. The size of the stimulus depends on the ratio of growth to return and pre-existing subsidies. Short-lived assets may have a larger absolute impact for an investment credit. For equipment investment, each dollar of revenue loss produces 35 cents of investment, while for structures it is 28 cents. Even at high elasticities, the increases are not dollar for dollar. Investment credits offer a more certain subsidy compared to corporate rate cuts, as they are allowed at the time of investment and are unlikely to be retroactively disallowed. Other types of corporate tax changes, such as accelerated depreciation or expensing, can be seen as similar to an investment credit. Investment credits provide a certain subsidy at the time of investment, unlike corporate rate cuts. Repealing the alternative minimum tax can benefit existing assets but may have mixed effects on new investments. Modifying the minimum tax by allowing accelerated depreciation methods could act as an investment subsidy for firms under the alternative minimum tax. Expanding net operating loss carry-back periods or investment tax credit carry-back periods has a large cash flow effect similar to a corporate rate cut. Dividend relief and capital gains relief for individuals may have less direct impact on firm investment. Investment subsidies aim to increase the effectiveness of incentives for investment. One proposed method to increase the effectiveness of investment subsidies is to make the investment tax credit temporary. This temporary subsidy is believed to have a more pronounced effect on investment in the short run compared to a permanent one, at a lower cost. However, empirical evidence supporting this effect is scarce due to various challenges in studying temporary subsidies. Investors must also believe that these temporary subsidies will indeed be temporary for them to have a stronger impact than permanent subsidies. Investors must believe temporary subsidies will be temporary for them to have a stronger impact than permanent subsidies. Historical evidence shows temporary subsidies tend to become permanent, which may not be effective as an economic stimulus. A temporary corporate rate cut may not stimulate new investment and could discourage certain types of investments. Depreciation deductions are larger in the early stages of an investment to reflect economic depreciation, while they are too small later on. Policymakers have considered incremental investment subsidies in the past, focusing on the margin. Designing a permanent incremental subsidy is virtually impossible. The potential effect on capital allocation is a key consideration in choosing a subsidy. The corporate tax rate reduction aims to improve economic efficiency by equalizing taxation across different types of capital income. However, an investment credit may distort investment by favoring certain assets and potentially leading to negative tax rates, especially with high depreciation values and low inflation rates. The effective tax rates on investments can be distorted by investment credits, especially with high depreciation values and low inflation rates. A 10% investment credit without a basis adjustment could result in assets having a negative effective tax rate. Accelerated depreciation methods can help make the tax system more neutral. Accelerated depreciation methods and investment subsidies can help make the tax system more neutral, but the largest distortion often occurs between assets eligible for credits or accelerated depreciation and those that are not eligible. Some argue that business tax changes could impact the economy by raising stock market prices, but the consequences of this are unclear. Cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% could potentially increase consumer confidence in the economy. However, this analysis does not consider the effects of capital stock adjustment, adjustment costs, and potential higher interest rates. The analysis discusses the impact of cutting the corporate tax rate on consumer confidence, considering capital stock adjustment, adjustment costs, and higher interest rates. A geometric adjustment path is described, showing how the stock market price increase will be affected over time. Adjustment processes and temporary loss of productivity can reduce the value of the stock market increase. The analysis highlights the uncertainty surrounding the adjustment path and magnitude of adjustment costs in response to cutting the corporate tax rate. It criticizes the assumption of no adjustment costs and no other economic effects that could impact earnings discount rates. The criticism suggests that a tax cut may not have a significant effect on the stock market due to potential offsetting factors like rising interest rates. The future tax cuts may reduce the stock market's potential effect without a general equilibrium analysis. It is argued that tax cuts could decrease stock market values by raising future interest rates and discouraging investment. The impact of an investment credit on stock prices is uncertain, with conflicting forces at play. Some analysts suggest a rate cut instead of an investment credit due to this uncertainty. Some analysts propose a rate cut over an investment credit. Doubts exist about using rational expectations to predict short-term stock market effects. Initial rise in stock market expected from either policy as more investors buy stocks. Effects likely not very large compared to other short-term market swings. Stock market considerations may not be crucial in evaluating tax instruments. Business tax subsidy may not be best for fiscal stimulus due to uncertainty in stimulating demand. If used, temporary investment subsidy likely most effective short-term policy. The most effective short-run policy is likely a temporary investment subsidy, as permanent subsidies can distort investment allocation in the long run. Measuring the \"Bang for the Buck\" involves calculating the percentage change in the cost of capital and the elasticity of investment with respect to the price of capital. The incentive for investment can be related to revenue cost, with a bigger stimulus for shorter-lived assets. The effect of a rate reduction on investment can be compared to revenue by considering the present value of the cost of an investment credit. The cost of an investment credit is related to the growth rate and discount rate. Taxable income is calculated as the rental price of capital times the capital stock minus depreciation. The cost of a rate reduction is influenced by economic depreciation. The ratio of the cost of an investment credit to a corporate rate reduction simplifies when using economic depreciation. A marginal effective tax rate is determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, considering timing effects like accelerated depreciation and deferral of taxes on capital gains. The relationship between pre-tax and after-tax returns in the corporate sector is determined by the rental price formula. The formula for calculating the effective tax rate on investments in equipment and structures takes into account factors such as the individual tax rate, depreciation deductions, investment tax credit rate, and inflation rate."
