    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"EPSCoR Research and Competitiveness Act of 2006\". The Congress recognizes the importance of regional diversity in research funding for international competitiveness. Economic development in high technology fields benefits from partnerships with nearby research institutions. The National Science Foundation was established by Congress in 1950 to promote science and national welfare. Congress has directed the Foundation to strengthen research and education in sciences and engineering. The National Science Foundation aims to promote research and education in sciences and engineering across the United States to avoid concentration of resources. Currently, research investments are focused in a few states, limiting the ability of many universities to compete for funding and contribute to economic development and competitiveness. The National Science Foundation's EPSCoR program aims to improve research infrastructure in states with limited funding to enhance innovation and competitiveness. The Foundation for EPSCoR is authorized to receive funding of $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2011, an amount based on the Foundation's budget request. Additionally, there are Research Infrastructure Improvement Grants available. The Director of the Foundation's research infrastructure improvement grant program can allow partnerships with out-of-State research institutions if funding transferred to another State is under 5% of the grant amount in a fiscal year. Funding levels for the program are set at $65,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and for fiscal years 2008 to 2011, an amount determined by the Foundation's budget request. The total amount appropriated to the Foundation for fiscal year 2007 is exceeded for such fiscal year. For fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Director must allocate at least 20% of EPSCoR funds to top-ranked co-funding projects. An annual report on co-funded projects and their use must be submitted to relevant committees. Additionally, there is a section on cyber infrastructure. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Director will develop plans for States in EPSCoR to fully participate in the Foundation's Cyber Infrastructure and Major Research Instrumentation Initiatives. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation. \"EPSCoR\" stands for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research authorized by section 113 of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1988. The term \"Foundation\" refers to the National Science Foundation."
