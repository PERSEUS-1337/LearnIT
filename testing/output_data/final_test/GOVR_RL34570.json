    "content": "Prior to the LRA, record votes in the House were conducted orally and by hand. The House Administration Committee was exploring electronic voting, but the LRA did not initially include this provision. However, the House amended the LRA to authorize the development of an electronic voting system. Additionally, record votes were not allowed in the Committee of the Whole, but this restriction was overturned. The House historically followed ancient British practice in the Committee of the Whole, which originated during the time of the Stuarts to discuss taxation without fear of the King. The Committee of the Whole House continues to use separate procedures from the House, with voice, division, and \"teller\" votes available before the LRA's enactment. The House rule in the 91st Congress on voting, which originated from the First Congress, required the Speaker to conduct votes by asking members to say \"Aye\" for in favor and \"No\" for opposed. If needed, a division would be called for, and a count would be conducted by appointed tellers. The teller vote was a way to determine the will of the people without angering a powerful monarch. The House rule in the 91st Congress required votes to be conducted by appointed tellers to determine the will of the people without angering a powerful monarch. H.R. 17654, the LRA, did not include a provision for automated voting, but authorized \"recorded teller votes\" instead. In 1970, Representative Robert McClory proposed amending House rules to allow electronic voting, despite skepticism from some Members. The amendment aimed to replace oral roll-call voting with automated voting, garnering considerable support in the House. In 1970, Representative Robert McClory proposed amending House rules to allow electronic voting, replacing oral roll-call voting with automated voting for efficiency. The contingent fund of the House of Representatives would provide necessary electronic equipment. Advocates for automated voting highlighted its efficiency compared to oral roll-call votes, which could take over 30 minutes. Members shared experiences from state legislatures supporting automated systems. A previous investigation into \"ghost voting\" led to a recommendation for a new voting system. During debate on the McClory amendment, no one opposed automated voting. The wording of the amendment allowed for electronic recording of Members' names, using \"may\" instead of \"shall.\" Representative McClory explained this choice during questioning. Representative McClory explained that the word \"may\" in the amendment allows for flexibility in the House's decision-making process regarding electronic voting. Members of the House Administration Committee were satisfied with this explanation, while some skeptics supported an amendment by Representative Leggett that set a specific start date for the electronic voting system. Ultimately, Leggett withdrew his amendment after further discussion. Mr. Leggett withdrew his amendment for an electronic voting system after remarks by Representative Waggonner. The McClory amendment was approved by voice vote in the Committee of the Whole and became law when President Nixon signed the LRA. H.R. 17654 did not include a provision for recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole, only allowing voice, division, and teller votes. In the 91st Congress, teller votes in the Committee of the Whole became controversial as there was a growing sentiment that Members used secrecy to avoid accountability for votes. Some believed that controversial amendments would have passed if there had been recorded votes. The House generally allowed recorded votes only in the House itself. In the 91st Congress, citizens in the House visitors' gallery tried to observe how individual Members voted on amendments by tellers, known as gallery \"watchers\" or \"observers.\" They reported their observations on issues like the Vietnam War, invasion of Cambodia, anti-ballistic missile (ABM), and supersonic transport plane. In the 91st Congress, citizens in the House visitors' gallery tried to observe how individual Members voted on amendments by tellers, known as gallery \"watchers\" or \"observers.\" Democratic Representative Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill Jr. proposed an amendment to allow \"recorded teller votes,\" or \"tellers with clerks,\" in the Committee of the Whole, but it failed on a 6-6 vote. On July 27, 1970, Representatives O'Neill and Charles S. Gubser offered a floor amendment to H.R. 17654 to add language allowing tellers with clerks if supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum. In the 91st Congress, Representative O'Neill proposed an amendment for recorded teller votes in the Committee of the Whole to increase accountability and decrease absenteeism among Members. The amendment was supported by arguments emphasizing the importance of going on record on vital issues and the need for Members to not miss recorded votes. The justification for unrecorded teller votes had diminished with the year-round Congress and the complex relationship between the people and their government. The O'Neill-Gubser amendment for recorded teller votes in the Committee of the Whole was supported to increase accountability and decrease absenteeism among Members. The amendment was enacted when President Nixon signed the Legislative Reorganization Act (LRA) into law, focusing on the evolution of House rules and voting procedures since 1970. The changes to House rules were contained in rules packages adopted at the beginning of new Congresses and resolutions agreed to during various Congresses. The focus of this section is on rules, precedents, and practices related to record voting procedures in the House and the Committee of the Whole, based on Congressional Record references from the 92nd Congress onwards. It draws from editions of the House Rules and Manual, specifically sections 76 through 80, Rule I, cl. 6, and Rule III. The report focuses on rules, precedents, and practices related to record voting procedures in the House and the Committee of the Whole. It covers various rules such as Rule III, Rule XVIII, Rule XX, and others, but some topics are only briefly mentioned or not covered at all. For example, quorum requirements are briefly explained, while the precedence of the motion to adjourn is not examined. Some subjects like the motion to recommit are included even though they are not directly related to record voting procedures. The report discusses rules and precedents related to record voting procedures in the House and the Committee of the Whole. It explains how rules of the House generally apply to the Committee of the Whole and mentions the possibility of temporary rule changes. Table 1 cross-references House rules before and after recodification in the 106th Congress. The Speaker or chairman of the Committee of the Whole initiates the voting process. During the 106th Congress (1999-2001), voting in the House often involves voice votes, division votes, and record votes. A supermajority is required for certain questions, such as overriding a presidential veto or approving a constitutional amendment. The House also uses suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority for passage. During the 106th Congress, voting in the House involves voice, division, and record votes. A supermajority is needed for specific questions like overriding a presidential veto or approving a constitutional amendment. Rules, precedents, and practices related to votes requiring a supermajority are not generally included in this report. Many long-standing rules and precedents of the House related to voting exist, such as Rule I, cl. 6, on the form of a question. Since the LRA of 1970, the House has adopted rules and developed precedents through votes related to appeals of a chair's ruling. During the 106th Congress, voting in the House involves voice, division, and record votes. Rules and practices related to voting have been developed through votes related to appeals of a chair's ruling. Changes in rules have both narrowed and broadened opportunities for obtaining a vote. The House and the Committee of the Whole have different subparts for changes in rules. During the 104th Congress, two significant procedural changes were made in the House part of the rules. One change made certain votes automatic, while another prohibited the Rules Committee from disallowing a motion to recommit. The Rules of the House also apply to the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. The LRA of 1970 amended Rule I, cl. 1 regarding the Speaker's approval of the Journal, allowing the Speaker to approve the Journal and order its reading at his discretion. In the 97th Congress, Speaker Tip O'Neill Jr. confirmed the presence of a quorum without disclosing the actual count. In the 98th Congress, a Speaker pro tempore was involved in a vote on the Speaker's approval of the Journal. In the 98th Congress, a Speaker pro tempore announced the electronic voting system was inoperable. A recorded vote was ordered due to a quorum objection. The Speaker pro tempore stated that business by unanimous consent couldn't be transacted once a quorum absence was disclosed. It was not possible to delay a vote once commenced. In the 101st Congress, a Speaker pro tempore counted Members present to determine support for a demand. In the 102nd Congress, the Speaker admitted error in ordering yeas and nays without a voice vote. In the 102nd Congress, a Speaker pro tempore announced a voice vote result, but a Member demanded yeas and nays. Another Member raised a point of order, leading to a colloquy about timeliness. The parliamentarian's notes clarified that yeas and nays can be demanded after a vote announcement if the House has not moved on to other business. The 104th Congress (1995-1997) adopted rules changes for automatic vote on final passage of certain legislation and protected the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions. The 104th Congress adopted rules changes to allow for an automatic vote on final passage of certain legislation and protected the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions, expanding the rights of the minority party. The 104th Congress adopted rules changes to allow for an automatic vote on final passage of certain legislation and protected the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions, expanding the rights of the minority party. An exception in the rules change allowed the House to substitute the text of a House-passed measure for the text in a Senate bill or resolution, restricting the authority of the Rules Committee regarding a motion to recommit with instructions sought by Republican Members. The rules changes in the 104th Congress allowed for an automatic vote on final passage of legislation and protected the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions. The intent was to restore the original purpose of clause 4(b) to give the minority a final opportunity to offer an amendment before the final passage of a bill. In the 105th Congress, a rule change stated that a recorded vote taken by electronic device would be considered a vote by yeas and nays to avoid a second vote on the same question. The LRA of 1970 allowed record votes in the Committee of the Whole, with 25 Members required to support a request for a recorded vote. In the 93rd Congress, a resolution proposed several rules changes. The resolution (H.Res. 998) proposed rules changes, including increasing the number of Members needed to support a recorded vote in the Committee of the Whole to 20 or 40 depending on the circumstances. The Rules Committee considered various options for this change. The resolution H.Res. 998 proposed increasing the number of Members required to support a recorded vote in the Committee of the Whole to 40 if 200 or more Members were present, and to 20 if fewer than 200 Members were present. Representative H.R. Gross offered an amendment to strike this section, which was supported by House Rules Committee members as a compromise to prevent frivolous and dilatory tactics. In the Committee of the Whole, Representative B.F. Sisk criticized \"frivolous and dilatory tactics\" during the amending process on an energy bill in December 1973. Members argued over a proposed rule change that would affect voting procedures, with Representative Robert E. Bauman defending the minority's right to the 20-Member rule. Members can force a rollcall vote on a hot issue by getting at least 20 Members to support it. A new rule in the 96th Congress increased the number of Members needed for a recorded vote in the Committee of the Whole to 25. This change was meant to expedite voting procedures in the Committee of the Whole. During the 94th Congress, demand for a recorded vote was refused multiple times in the Committee of the Whole, with the chairman stating that a second request for a recorded vote on the same amendment was not possible. The chair's count in support of a recorded vote was ruled not appealable. In the 95th Congress, a point of order was made that a quorum was not present after a division vote result was announced. Members recorded their presence, and a recorded vote was demanded and ordered. The parliamentarian's notes clarified the procedures for such situations. In the 97th Congress, a chair ruled that a request for a recorded vote on an amendment could not be renewed after being denied, even when a quorum was disclosed. However, a different outcome occurred when a Member pointed out the absence of a quorum before a vote count was completed. The chair declared the count \"inoperative,\" called for a quorum, and the pending business remained the demand for a recorded vote. In the 97th Congress, a chair ruled on the demand for a recorded vote. In the 101st Congress, a chairman's ruling on an amendment to a general appropriations bill was appealed by Representative Tom Ridge. During the 105th Congress, Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt demanded a recorded vote, which sustained the decision of the chair. In the 109th Congress, Members made untimely demands for recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole. During the 105th Congress, Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt demanded a recorded vote, which sustained the decision of the chair. In the 109th Congress, Members made untimely demands for recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole. The LRA of 1970 allowed record votes in the Committee of the Whole, with changes to House rules allowing votes to be postponed and clustered, and voting times on clustered votes to be reduced. During the 93rd Congress, changes were made to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes, increasing predictability in the House's schedule and allowing for debate on measures at different times. In the 96th Congress, voting time was reduced to five minutes. The House Rules Committee reported a resolution in the 93rd Congress that allowed recorded votes on measures to be postponed and clustered. During the 93rd Congress, changes were made to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes, increasing predictability in the House's schedule and allowing for debate on measures at different times. In the 96th Congress, voting time was reduced to five minutes. The House Rules Committee reported a resolution in the 93rd Congress that allowed recorded votes on measures to be postponed and clustered. The provision added a new paragraph to Rule XXVII, cl. 3, allowing the Speaker to announce the postponement of further proceedings on motions to suspend the rules and pass bills or resolutions until all such motions have been entertained and any debate concluded. During the 93rd Congress, changes were made to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes, increasing predictability in the House's schedule and allowing for debate on measures at different times. In the 96th Congress, voting time was reduced to five minutes. The Speaker may postpone further proceedings on motions to suspend the rules and pass bills or resolutions until all such motions have been entertained and any debate concluded. The Speaker can reduce the time for recorded votes on additional motions. If the House adjourns before all motions are voted on, they will be addressed on the next legislative day. During the 93rd Congress, changes were made to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes, increasing predictability in the House's schedule. In the 96th Congress, voting time was reduced to five minutes. The proposed change in H.Res. 998 allowed votes to be postponed and clustered, with voting time reduced to five minutes, defended as a time-saving measure by the Rules Committee. During the 93rd Congress, changes were made to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes, increasing predictability in the House's schedule. In the 96th Congress, voting time was reduced to five minutes. The proposed change in H.Res. 998 allowed votes to be postponed and clustered, with voting time reduced to five minutes, defended as a time-saving measure by the Rules Committee. Some Members expressed concern over potential loss of attention to legislation under suspension of rules procedures. Speaker Carl Albert announced the postponement of further proceedings on motions to suspend rules with recorded votes or objections. After debate on all motions, the Speaker determined the next steps. During the 93rd Congress, changes were made to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes, increasing predictability in the House's schedule. In the 96th Congress, voting time was reduced to five minutes. The proposed change in H.Res. 998 allowed votes to be postponed and clustered, with voting time reduced to five minutes, defended as a time-saving measure by the Rules Committee. Speaker Carl Albert announced the postponement of further proceedings on motions to suspend rules with recorded votes or objections. After debate on all motions, the Speaker determined the next steps. The Speaker then proceeded to put the question on each motion, with votes taken in a specific order and time limit set for electronic votes. During the 95th Congress, rules were adopted to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes on resolutions reported by the Rules Committee. The Speaker could announce the intention to postpone further proceedings on resolutions for recorded votes and put the questions in the order they were considered. Voting time could be reduced to five minutes after the first 15-minute vote. If votes were not completed, they would be the first order of business the next day. This rules change was not debated in the 96th Congress. In the 96th Congress, new rules were adopted to allow the Speaker to postpone and cluster votes on bills and resolutions. The Speaker could delay further proceedings on questions for a designated time or place within two legislative days. The time for votes in a cluster could be reduced to five minutes after the first vote, at the Speaker's discretion. The Speaker in the 96th Congress could postpone and cluster votes on bills and resolutions, allowing for a designated time or place within two legislative days. The time for votes in a cluster could be reduced to five minutes after the first vote, at the Speaker's discretion. The House made changes to voting procedures, allowing the Speaker to reduce vote times to five minutes after certain actions. This includes voting on bills, resolutions, and conference reports. Additionally, the Speaker can now postpone votes on motions to suspend the rules until the next legislative day. Majority Leader Jim Wright explained the changes to voting procedures, aiming to save Members from repeated harassment and inconvenience caused by dilatory tactics. Minority Members opposed concentrating more power in the hands of the Speaker and sacrificing legislative deliberation for efficiency. In the 97th Congress, the House adopted rules consolidating the Speaker's authority to postpone votes, aiming for legislative efficiency. Minority Whip Robert H. Michel argued against clustering votes, stating it could lead to absenteeism and inhibit open debate. Clause 4 of Rule XV allows the Speaker to postpone certain questions to a designated time or place in the legislative schedule. Precedents from the 98th Congress allowed for rescheduling of postponed votes within the rule limits. The previous day, votes were taken to suspend rules, cluster votes, and reduce voting time by unanimous consent. A precedent was set for considering a Senate measure similar to a House measure. Representative Mitchell obtained unanimous consent to consider a Senate bill and move to insert provisions of a House bill. The Speaker pro tempore confirmed the request was in order. In the 99th and 100th Congress, unanimous consent requests were made to adjust voting procedures, including reducing voting time. The Speaker pro tempore confirmed the requests in both instances. In the 101st Congress, the House amended rules to allow the Speaker to postpone votes on motions to instruct conferees and reduce voting time on separate amendments reported by the Committee of the Whole. In the 102nd and 103rd Congresses, the House amended rules to allow the chairman of the Committee of the Whole to reduce voting time on clustered amendments after the first 15-minute vote to \"not less than five minutes\". The electronic voting system remained the customary method, with a minimum of 15 minutes for voting, and subsequent votes could be reduced to five minutes after the initial 15-minute vote. The House adopted a rules change to provide a process for considering and voting on questions of privileges of the House. If a resolution was offered by the majority leader, minority leader, or reported from committee, it would have precedence over other questions except a motion to adjourn. If offered by another Member, the Speaker could designate a time within two legislative days for the resolution to take precedence. In the 104th Congress, the House amended rules to reorder the list of questions the Speaker could postpone and added a vote to move the previous question on certain questions. In the 105th Congress, the House made rules changes allowing the Speaker to reduce roll-call vote time and added more votes that could be postponed during bill consideration. Precedents were set in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses by Speaker pro tempore on clustering votes and Speaker's discretion. In the 104th Congress, a Speaker pro tempore established the precedent that the Speaker can postpone votes without prior announcement. Members moved to reconsider votes, which were then tabled, with the Speaker ordering recorded votes on the underlying measures. In the 105th Congress, the House adjourned without voting after postponing motions to suspend the rules. Questions were postponed to the next meeting by unanimous consent. The Speaker was given authority to postpone a vote on the original motion to instruct conferees in the 106th Congress. The House also allowed the Speaker to postpone proceedings on motions to instruct conferees after 20 days in conference. In the 106th Congress, rules were recodified and authority to postpone proceedings was codified as Rule XX, cl. 8. The Speaker could reduce vote times to five minutes on certain matters. In the 107th Congress, the chairman of the Committee of the Whole was authorized to postpone recorded votes on amendments and reduce vote times to five minutes after a 15-minute vote. In the 108th Congress, the Speaker's authority to conduct five-minute votes was further perfected to simplify the rule and make it applicable to any question arising \"without intervening business\" after another vote. Rule XX, cl. 9 was amended to allow the Speaker to reduce electronic voting time to five minutes for questions arising without intervening business after a previous electronic vote. In the 109th Congress, the Speaker was authorized to postpone votes. In the 109th Congress, the Speaker was authorized to postpone votes on various motions. In the 110th Congress, the majority leader requested unanimous consent for five-minute votes on certain motions in the House. The House adopted rules for the new Congress, including provisions for voting times and recorded teller votes. Recorded teller votes were a voting procedure used by the Committee of the Whole before the implementation of electronic voting systems. The first recorded teller vote took place on March 3, 1971, on an amendment to a bill. Speaker Albert had announced the procedures for recorded teller votes in February, where members filled in their name, state, and district on a ballot before the vote commenced. During a recorded teller vote, members filled out green cards for \"aye,\" red cards for \"no,\" and amber cards for \"present.\" Tellers collected the cards, and the amendment was defeated 180-211. The names of Members voting were printed in the Congressional Record for March 3, with changes made in 1972 for recorded tellers. In 1972, changes were made related to recorded tellers in the House. Members no longer conducted teller votes, leaving it to clerks. Tellers could be requested directly without an order. The House repealed the provision for demanding teller votes in the 103rd Congress. The new clause in House Rule XV allowed for electronic recording of roll calls or quorum calls. The electronic voting system was implemented in the 93rd Congress, with rules changes to make it the customary form of conducting record votes and quorum calls. Speakers from Albert to Pelosi have made policy announcements regarding electronic voting. The challenge has been to take advantage of the system's efficiency, with some Members arriving late to vote. The issue of Members changing their votes has also been addressed by Speakers Albert and O'Neill. During the 92nd Congress, the House agreed to H.Res. 1123 on October 13, 1972, amending rules to make electronic voting the standard method for roll calls and quorum calls. If requested by one-fifth of a quorum, a recorded vote would be taken by electronic device. The House agreed to make electronic voting the standard method for roll calls and quorum calls during the 92nd Congress. This change increased the minimum voting time to 15 minutes and allowed for recorded votes to be taken by electronic device if requested by one-fifth of a quorum. The Rules Committee clarified that a recorded vote can be requested before or after other types of votes. If supported by one-fifth of a quorum, the vote will be taken electronically. Members can no longer demand a vote by tellers, but can still cast a vote without a card by obtaining a ballot from the Speaker's dais. The House changed Rule VIII, cl. 2 regarding the announcement of pairs and amended Rule XV, making the first four clauses subject to clause 5. H.Res. 1123 also modified clause 5 related to calls of the roll and the House. H.Res. 1123 amended clause 5 to allow electronic recording of Members' votes during roll call or quorum call, with names published in alphabetical order. Members have at least fifteen minutes to have their vote recorded. H.Res. 1123 amended House rules to allow electronic recording of votes during roll call or quorum call, with a 15-minute minimum time period. The Speaker has discretion to choose a different voting method. Rule XXIII was also altered to require electronic quorum calls in the Committee of the Whole, aligning with Rule XV. Members discussed potential issues with the new electronic voting system. The House Administration Committee is still working on addressing issues with the electronic voting system, including confusion over similar last names. Members discussed concerns about voting integrity and the availability of printouts showing voting patterns. Chairman Hays mentioned the possibility of providing such printouts in the future. Representative John M. Ashbrook raised a related observation during a colloquy with Chairman Hays. The House Administration Committee is addressing issues with the electronic voting system, including confusion over similar last names. Members discussed concerns about voting integrity and the availability of printouts showing voting patterns. There is no plan for a retrieval system for Members who leave before leadership can pressure them to change their votes. Suggestions were made for equipping leadership with tracking devices to address this issue. The House Administration Committee is considering improvements to the electronic voting system to address concerns about voting integrity and confusion over similar last names. Representative Conable raised concerns about strategic maneuvering on close votes, while Chairman Hays suggested potential responses such as programming changes and recording Members' actions with the system. Representative Seiberling inquired about displaying Members' names based on party affiliation in the chamber. The House Administration Committee discussed potential improvements to the electronic voting system, including addressing concerns about voting integrity and confusion over similar last names. Chairman Hays mentioned the possibility of displaying Members' names based on party affiliation in the chamber, with Representative White asking about procedures for a vote by division. Representative Price, who supported the electronic voting system, cautioned colleagues about the need for efficiency and confidence in the House's work. Speaker Albert cautioned his colleagues about the potential misuse of the electronic voting system, citing examples of \"ghost voting\" in Pennsylvania. He emphasized the importance of guarding against any misuse to maintain the credibility of Congress. The implementation of the system was delayed to prepare personalized Vote-ID Cards for each Representative. The Speaker announced the policy on electronic voting, detailing how the system operated and how Members were to use their Vote-ID Cards at the voting stations. The presiding officer would instruct Members to record their presence or votes using the electronic device, initiating a 15-minute voting period. Members could cast, change, or check their votes until the time on the summary displays reached 0:00 minutes. The Speaker detailed the policy on electronic voting, including how Members could cast their votes using their Vote-ID Cards at voting stations. Members could vote until the presiding officer closed the vote and announced the final result. Voting stations would close when the final result was announced, and a Member without their Vote-ID Card could use a green, red, or amber ballot card. The presiding officer could choose alternative procedures for recorded votes or quorum calls. The electronic voting system was first used in 1973, but faced failures leading to votes being taken by standby procedures instead. The Speaker directed the clerk to call the roll for votes when the electronic system was not operable. In 1973, the electronic voting system faced failures, leading to votes being taken by standby procedures. A quorum call was ordered on June 6, 1973, with a minimum of 15 minutes for Members to respond. Representative Robert E. Bauman made a point of order on July 17, 1974, stating that a regular quorum call must be made if fewer than 100 Members respond to a quorum call. In 1973, the electronic voting system faced failures, leading to votes being taken by standby procedures. A quorum call was ordered on June 6, 1973, with a minimum of 15 minutes for Members to respond. Representative Robert E. Bauman made a point of order on July 17, 1974, stating that a regular quorum call must be made if fewer than 100 Members respond. The Chairman clarified that clause 5, rule XV provides a minimum of 15 minutes for Members to respond on any quorum call, with the discretion to continue the call. Speaker Albert ruled against entertaining a unanimous consent agreement to correct wrongly recorded votes by electronic device. In the 97th Congress, Speaker Albert stated that a recapitulation of an electronic vote is not allowed, even in close votes. Representative Bauman inquired about the possibility of a recapitulation, but the Speaker maintained that all names would still appear on the voting panel for verification, allowing Members to verify their changed votes without a recapitulation. A correction was made to a vote taken by electronic device due to an error in identifying a signature on a voting card. A Member raised concerns about the constitutionality and authority of conducting votes by electronic device, stating that votes should be cast publicly. The Speaker clarified that the Constitution requires the yeas and nays to be recorded in the Journal, which is guaranteed by House rules. The Member later objected to a voice vote due to a lack of quorum. During a vote, a Member objected to a voice vote due to a lack of quorum. The Speaker then ordered a vote by electronic device, but faced issues with malfunctioning voting stations. This led to voting being conducted by standby procedures as per Rule XV. In a previous instance during the 100th Congress, the electronic voting system malfunctioned, leading to a recorded vote being vacated and a roll call being conducted instead. The Chair announced that the electronic voting system was being fixed before the next vote. The system was used for the next vote despite previous malfunctions. Issues related to voting system malfunctions are discussed in the next section. Speakers in past Congresses had policies on Members changing their vote when using electronic devices. During the convening of the 102nd Congress, the Speaker pro tempore announced a policy on electronic voting, emphasizing the need to expedite the voting process to prevent delays caused by Members notifying the Chair through the Cloakrooms of their imminent arrival in the Chamber. During the 102nd Congress, the Speaker pro tempore announced a policy on electronic voting to expedite the voting process and prevent delays caused by Members notifying the Chair through the Cloakrooms of their imminent arrival in the Chamber. In the 103rd Congress, the Speaker continued this policy with a proscription against individual requests to hold open a vote by electronic device. During the 104th Congress, Speaker Newt Gingrich implemented a policy to conduct votes within a 15-minute time frame, discouraging requests to hold open a vote by electronic device and urging Members to promptly enter the chamber upon signal. Members were advised not to rely on external signals for vote timing. Speaker Gingrich implemented a policy to conduct votes within a 15-minute time frame, allowing Members in the well to vote and aiming to close votes promptly. He emphasized the importance of schedules and limiting votes to 17 minutes, urging Members to leave on the first bell. This policy was tested in a dispute over a vote on June 21, 1995. In the 105th Congress, a Member requested display boards showing all Members to be turned on for a list, but the request was denied. The evolution of rules and precedents related to electronic voting system was concluded in the 106th Congress with recodification of rules. In the 106th Congress, Rule XV was recodified into a new Rule XX, which included a provision allowing for manual voting or quorum calls in case of electronic voting system malfunctions. This provision clarified the Chair's discretion to choose backup procedures. During a session, a Member raised concerns about the reliability of the electronic voting system and questioned the Clerk's assurance of the accuracy of the votes. The Speaker pro tempore clarified the options available in case of a malfunction, including continuing to use the system with operational voting stations or resorting to a backup procedure like calling the roll. During a session, a Member questioned the reliability of the electronic voting system and the Clerk's assurance of vote accuracy. The Speaker pro tempore mentioned past cases of inoperative displays but accurate Clerk recordings. Mr. Dingell inquired about the Chair informing the House of the vote certification's accuracy. The Chair assured Members of being informed about the vote accuracy in due time. During a session, the electronic voting system malfunctioned, leading to uncertainty about the vote accuracy. The Chairman of the House Administration Committee explained that a technical problem and human error caused a display board error, not a voting recording error. The Chair directed the Clerk to call the roll for a manual vote recording. During the 107th Congress, the electronic voting system failed, leading to a vote being held open for nearly 3-1/2 hours. Members were allowed to verify their votes using ballot cards. In the 108th Congress, the system failed twice, prompting different responses from the presiding officer. During a vote in the 108th Congress, technical difficulties with the electronic voting system led to a reset. Members were asked to confirm their votes, but the system was deemed inoperable. A new vote was announced after the system was restarted, requiring Members to recast their votes. Members in the 102nd Congress faced frustrations with the electronic voting system, leading to delays in votes. Speaker Foley implemented a policy to address the issue by allowing votes to be held open until Members arrived to cast their votes. In the 102nd Congress, Speaker Foley implemented a policy to close votes shortly after the 15-minute minimum time. Speaker Gingrich tightened the policy, which has been continued by subsequent Speakers. The 110th Congress attempted to prevent votes from being held open \"for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome\" of a vote. Prior to the 91st Congress, Members were not allowed to vote after the clerk had called the roll. House Rule XV, cl. 1 allowed Members to vote even after their name had been called twice under certain conditions. The parliamentarian clarified that a Member who missed their name being called could still vote if they were present in the Hall and listening. The Speaker had the duty to qualify a Member requesting to vote at the end of the roll. The Speaker must qualify a Member requesting to vote at the end of the roll, but it is up to the Member to confirm if they were present and listening when their name was called. Rule XV, cl. 1 was amended by H.Res. 7 in 1969 to allow Members to vote or announce a pair after their name is called but before the result is announced. Speaker Albert implemented a policy following the change in House rules to allow recorded teller votes in the 92nd Congress. Speaker Albert implemented a policy in the 92nd Congress to allow late-arriving Members to vote after the second teller reported the \"noes.\" Members had at least 12 minutes to fill in their vote cards and be counted. Additionally, Members could vote present by announcing their presence after the vote was announced. In the 92nd Congress, Speaker Albert implemented a policy for electronic voting, allowing late-arriving Members to vote after the second teller reported the \"noes.\" When the electronic voting system's clock reaches zero, the Speaker will allow Members a minute or two more to vote before locking the machine. During the 93rd Congress, voting procedures were established for electronic voting, with a minimum of 15 minutes allowed for Members to respond to a quorum call. The Chair would close vote stations once the final result was announced, preventing further votes. During the 94th Congress, Speaker Albert announced a procedure where voting machines would be turned off after 15 minutes, allowing late-arriving Members to vote by submitting a ballot card. This was primarily aimed at Members wishing to change their vote. During the 96th Congress, a Member raised a point of order regarding voting after time had expired. Precedents were cited allowing Members to insist on their vote being recorded even after the presiding officer declared the vote result. In the 100th Congress, a Member inquired about voting after time had expired, seeking clarification on whether Members could still cast votes. During the 100th Congress, a Member asked if votes could be cast after time had expired. The Speaker stated that the roll call would be open for a minimum of 15 minutes, with discretion beyond that. Representative Mickey Edwards inquired about additional votes after time had expired, seeking clarification on the rules. Speaker Jim Wright reiterated the rules regarding the length of votes. Speaker Foley announced a new policy on voting by electronic device in the 102nd Congress (1991-1993), where late-arriving Members were encouraged to promptly cast their votes when the bells sounded. In the 103rd Congress (1993-1995), the policy continued with a directive for Cloakrooms not to forward individual requests to hold open a vote, but to inform Members of the remaining time on the voting clock. In the 104th Congress, Speaker Gingrich implemented a new policy on voting, allowing Members in the well to vote and aiming to close votes quickly. This policy was tested during a close vote on June 21, 1995, where two Democratic Members missed their chance to vote. After a close vote on June 21, 1995, Majority Leader Dick Armey defended the Chairman's decision to close the vote after 17 minutes, stating that the Chair was on solid parliamentary ground. Despite claims of Members being prevented from voting, Armey stated that the well was empty when the vote was called. Mr. Armey sought unanimous consent in the House to vacate the June 21 vote in the Committee of the Whole and explained the importance of upholding fairness and dignity in all actions. Minority Leader Gephardt acknowledged differences in facts but supported Armey's decision. Representative Foglietta mentioned Members trying to vote and one Member calling out for one more vote. During a House session, a Member called out for one more vote as Mr. Foglietta passed by. The Speaker ordered a new vote in the Committee of the Whole, reiterating the policy on electronic voting. The amendment was later approved 220-204. Speaker Gingrich and the minority leader reaffirmed the voting policy in the 105th Congress, aiming to close votes within 17 minutes. The Speaker emphasized the importance of closing electronic votes within 17 minutes, citing a previous instance where a vote was held open for three hours in the 108th Congress. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi later raised concerns about the duration of the vote and submitted a resolution regarding the matter. The House denounced the practice of holding votes open beyond a reasonable period to influence a Member's vote. The Speaker ruled the resolution as a question of House privileges, leading to a debate and eventual tabling of the resolution. This incident is discussed further in the section on voting issues since 1970. In the 110th Congress, a rule change was made to prevent holding electronic votes open to reverse outcomes. Speaker Pelosi modified the policy to allow members a reasonable amount of time to record their votes. Parliamentary inquiries in the 110th Congress clarified the new rules provision regarding the minimum duration of a vote and the responsibility of the Chair to ensure all members have a chance to record their votes. The new rules provision clarifies that a vote by electronic device cannot be held open solely to reverse the outcome. The Chair must distinguish between establishing an outcome and potentially reversing it. Members can still vote by card in the well even during an electronic vote. The Chair will not disenfranchise a district trying to vote, even after the minimum voting period. This response was reiterated in a parliamentary inquiry about the prevailing side. On June 27, 2007, a parliamentary inquiry was made regarding a voting process where members changed their votes after the minimum voting time. Representative Lynn A. Westmoreland raised a point of order based on a new rule, and the Committee of the Whole kept the vote open to calculate if Delegate votes would change the outcome. On May 8, 2008, a response clarified that the rule using \"shall\" is a standard for presiding officers, not mandatory. The Chair suggests enforcing the rule on collateral bases through a resolution with \"whereas\" clauses alleging violations and proposing remedies, rather than making instant decisions in the face of competing demands. The new rule does not establish an immediate procedural remedy but sets a standard of behavior for presiding officers. The language establishes a standard of behavior for presiding officers that may be enforced on collateral bases. Points of order and parliamentary inquiries in the 110th Congress related to the new rule. Voting procedures with electronic devices were introduced in the 94th Congress. The Speaker implemented a new policy in the 94th Congress disallowing Members from changing their votes by electronic device. This change was made to keep better track of Members' votes and reduce the number of position changes during a vote. After the 15-minute voting period, Members could still change their votes by coming to the well of the House and submitting a ballot card. Speaker Albert modified the voting procedure for Members to change their votes, allowing changes at voting stations during the first 10 minutes of a vote. After this time, Members had to go to the well of the House to change their vote. Speaker O'Neill continued this policy in the 95th Congress, with the addition that Members had to go to the well to change a vote cast during a five-minute vote. Speaker O'Neill modified the voting procedure for Members to change their votes, allowing changes at voting stations during a five-minute vote. Once the voting machines were turned off, Members had to go to the well to change a vote. Rule III, cl. 1 has its origin in the First Congress, requiring Members to be present and vote on each question unless they have a direct personal or pecuniary interest. Throughout the report, it has been noted that Members of the House are required to be present and vote on each question unless they have a direct personal or pecuniary interest. Leaves of absence are granted for official business, personal illness, illness in the family, or military service in wartime. The Speaker has the authority to determine if a Member has a personal or pecuniary interest in a question, and Members cannot vote by proxy in the House. In the 94th Congress, Speaker Albert addressed a parliamentary inquiry by Representative Bauman regarding voting conflicts of interest related to the New York City \"bailout\" legislation. The inquiry focused on whether Members with financial interests in New York City could vote on the legislation. Speaker Albert referred to precedents stating that personal interests do not disqualify Members from voting. Speaker Albert addressed voting conflicts of interest related to the New York City \"bailout\" legislation in the 94th Congress. He noted that personal interests of Members do not disqualify them from voting, and emphasized that each Member should decide on their own disqualifying interests. Speaker O'Neill made a similar ruling in the 96th Congress regarding a Member named in a resolution for expulsion. In the 96th Congress, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct investigated \"ghost\" voting, finding House rules ambiguous and recommending rule amendments. The House added a new clause prohibiting Members from authorizing others to vote on their behalf. In the 106th Congress, the House adopted new rules deleting the previous rule on pairing in favor of Members announcing their positions by submitting statements to the Congressional Record within \"1 to 2 hours\" of a vote. In the 106th Congress, the House adopted new rules regarding voting procedures. Members could submit statements to the Congressional Record within \"1 to 2 hours\" of a vote, which would appear immediately after the vote. Pairing was a procedure where absent Members could offset their votes, with different types of pairing arrangements noted in the Congressional Record. Live pairs were noted in the Congressional Record, allowing absent Members to offset their votes. Two principles to keep in mind were that a pair on a two-thirds vote required three Members, and there was no recourse for a Member breaking a pair. The House changed Rule VIII, cl. 2 related to the announcement of pairs in 1972, allowing pairs to be announced after the second call of the roll. The House rules regarding pairing of votes were changed over time. Initially, pairs were announced after the second call of the roll, but later, pairs were announced immediately before the presiding officer's announcement of the vote result. Speaker Albert maintained the practice of not allowing pairs in the Committee of the Whole, but later rules allowed pairs in both the Committee of the Whole and the House. In the 106th Congress, the House ended the practice of pairing except for live pairs. The House rules regarding pairing of votes were changed over time. The previous rule allowing pairing was deleted, and a new rule pertained to the conduct of a record vote or quorum call. The practice of pairing was eliminated in favor of Members submitting statements on how they would have voted, which would be recorded as \"stated yea\" or \"stated nay.\" The House rules regarding pairing of votes were changed over time. The practice of pairing, where absent Members could arrange how they would have voted, was abolished. Only \"live pairs,\" involving one present Member and one absent Member, were allowed. On the advent of electronic voting in the House, Members could correct their votes before the Journal's approval. Despite attempts to correct recorded votes due to electronic system errors, Speaker Albert ruled against changing them. In the 97th Congress, the Speaker allowed a correction to a vote taken by electronic device due to an error in identifying a voting card signature. In the 106th Congress, a correction was made by unanimous consent to address an electronic voting system malfunction. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard was absent from the House on June 21, 2000. The House Administration Committee investigated a vote recorded for Lucille Roybal-Allard on June 21, 2000, despite her absence and possession of her voting card. The Speaker pro tempore corrected the vote by unanimous consent on June 26, citing the presumptive reliability of the electronic voting system. The House Administration Committee investigated a vote recorded for Lucille Roybal-Allard on June 21, 2000, despite her absence and possession of her voting card. The Speaker pro tempore corrected the vote by unanimous consent on June 26, citing the presumptive reliability of the electronic voting system. In adopting its rules for the 103rd Congress (1993-1995), the House allowed Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole. The Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico and Delegates to the House have the same powers as Members. A new rule allows for a re-vote if Delegates' and the Resident Commissioner's votes are decisive. Democrats argue this change promotes fairness and democracy. Some Republican Members argued against allowing Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole, citing constitutional objections and concerns about population disparities among territories. They also raised practical and political concerns about seeking their votes to build a majority and the impact on election gains. The change reduced Republicans' election gains by half since Delegates and Resident Commissioner, all Democrats, voted against an amendment in the 103rd Congress. The new Republican majority in the 104th Congress deleted provisions allowing Delegates to vote, sparking debates on fairness and democracy. During the 105th Congress, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton sought the right to vote in the House on impeachment resolutions, citing the Twenty-third Amendment. She argued for the resolution to enhance the rights of District residents under the Amendment. During the 105th Congress, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton sought the right to vote in the House on impeachment resolutions, citing the Twenty-third Amendment to enhance the rights of District residents. The Speaker pro tempore ruled that altering the voting rights of a Delegate is not a proper question of privilege. In the 110th Congress, a rules change allowed Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole. During the 105th Congress, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton sought the right to vote in the House on impeachment resolutions, citing the Twenty-third Amendment to enhance the rights of District residents. In the 110th Congress, a rules change allowed Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole, with the possibility of an immediate revote in the House where their votes were decisive in the outcome of a question. Rule III, cl. 3 was amended to provide equal powers and privileges to Delegates and the Resident Commissioner as Members of the House. Rule XVIII, cl. 6 was amended to require a de novo vote in the House if the votes of Delegates and the Resident Commissioner were decisive in a recorded vote in the Committee of the Whole. During the 110th Congress, a rules change allowed Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole, with the possibility of an immediate revote in the House if their votes were decisive. The rules change was based on fairness and democratic principles, with opponents arguing on constitutionality grounds. Parliamentary inquiries in the 110th Congress clarified the rules changes regarding recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole. The Speaker pro tempore clarified that in the House, immediate review occurs automatically when recorded votes by Delegates are decisive, regardless of the outcome. Delegates and the Resident Commissioner can vote on all matters in the Committee of the Whole. The Delegates and Resident Commissioner have the same voting powers as Members in the Committee of the Whole House. The test to determine if their votes are decisive is a \"but for\" test. The voting powers of Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole House are determined by a \"but for\" test, regardless of the absence of some Members. The Chair's decision on the votes of Delegates and Resident Commissioner is not appealable, even if a Member believes their votes are decisive. The voting powers of Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole House are determined by a \"but for\" test. The Chairman confirmed that Delegates and the Resident Commissioner count for establishing and maintaining a quorum. Additionally, there is a mechanism for an immediate vote in the full House on procedural issues if necessary. The voting powers of Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole House are determined by a \"but for\" test. An immediate vote in the House is contemplated under certain circumstances, with the Speaker's discretion to vote explained. The Speaker may vote to break a tie and decide a question in the affirmative. The duty of giving a decisive vote may be exercised after the intervention of other business or on another day if a correction of the roll shows a condition where his vote would be decisive. The Speaker's tie-breaking vote is entered into the electronic voting system prior to the announcement of the result. In the House Rules and Manual, the roll call may not be interrupted except for specific reasons like messages or adjournment. In the 98th Congress, a Member was recognized for a parliamentary inquiry during a voice vote, leading to a recorded vote in one instance and a refusal in another. During the 109th Congress, an emergency recess was declared twice due to a plane entering restricted airspace at the Capitol, interrupting votes. Members were allowed extra time to record their votes after the recess. Additionally, Members were sworn in and cast their votes during record votes, following the signal system designed to alert them to certain occurrences. During the 96th Congress, the Speaker revised the House's bell and light signals to accommodate changes in House rules affecting voting and quorums. The changes included signals for Tellers, notice quorum calls, termination of notice quorum calls, Electronically Recorded Votes, and Manual Roll Call votes. The House's bell and light signals were revised during the 96th Congress to accommodate changes in voting and quorums. The signals include Manual Roll Call votes, Suspension of the Rules votes, Quorum calls, Manual Quorum Calls, Committee of the Whole Quorum calls, Adjournment, and Electronically Recorded Votes. The electronic voting system in the House of Representatives has been used since January 23, 1973, for most record votes. Despite occasional malfunctions, the system has been managed effectively by the presiding officer. Voting issues can be categorized into five types, including system failures and Members' explanations of votes. The electronic voting system in the House of Representatives has been used since January 23, 1973, for most record votes. Voting issues, including inoperative display boards and Members' attempts to vote, have led to investigations by committees. When the system fails, the presiding officer can vacate the results, continue the vote with special instructions, or call for a new electronic vote. On March 7, 1973, the electronic voting system was inoperative, and votes were taken by standby procedures. The system malfunctioned on December 21, 1973, during Roll Call No. 723, and the House combined electronic and oral votes. Members who voted electronically were included in the list of voters for the motion. During the first session of the 93rd Congress, the electronic voting system malfunctioned on multiple occasions, causing delays in voting. On September 19, 1985, the system's display boards malfunctioned during Roll Call No. 313, but voting continued as usual. During Roll Call No. 99 on May 4, 1988, the electronic voting system malfunctioned, leading to a switch to a standby procedure where the clerk called the roll. The system was repaired before Roll Call No. 100 on the same day. On October 3, 1989, the electronic voting system malfunctioned during Roll Call No. 264. The presiding officer vacated the vote and initiated a new vote on the same question due to the machine not working properly. The voting process was restarted with the machine now functioning correctly. The Chair announced an irregularity in the electronic voting system during roll call 264 on October 3, 1989. Five Members who had voted in the vacated proceedings were not recorded on the new vote, so their votes were directed to be recorded. On October 6, 1999, a malfunction occurred in the electronic voting system during Roll Call No. 483, leading to the vacating of the results. The cause was attributed to a Member's faulty voting card, which disrupted the alphabetical order on the visual screen. On September 14, 2001, the electronic voting system malfunctioned during Roll Call No. 341. The presiding officer announced measures to ensure all Members' votes were recorded accurately, including holding the vote open until all Members were accounted for. The system records votes based on a unique identifier number, regardless of alphabetical placement on the visual screen. During voting sessions in April 2002, March 2004, and July 2004, there were instances of voting station malfunctions. The presiding officers urged Members to verify their votes due to the malfunctions. In one case, the electronic voting system malfunctioned, leading to multiple announcements and instructions for Members to confirm their votes. The presiding officer announced issues with the electronic voting system, advising Members to check their votes. The system was declared inoperable, votes were not to be cast, and a reboot was needed. After restarting the system, Members were instructed to recast their votes. When the display boards are inoperative, the Speaker recommends Members to check their vote by using another voting station, looking at leadership computer monitors, or confirming with the clerk. Malfunctions with the display boards have occurred in the chamber since the electronic system was first used in 1973. The main display boards list each Member's name and vote, located behind and above the Speaker's dais. On August 7, 1974, the presiding officer announced a malfunction with the Republican monitor used for electronic votes. The Chair suggested using the Democratic monitor alternately to save time. On June 6, 1977, the electronic voting system display boards were not functioning, but voting stations were operational. Members could verify their votes by using electronic devices or reinserting their card at a voting station. On June 21, 1978, the display boards were not working, but voting stations were operational, and Members could verify their votes at any monitor. The voting stations are operational, and all vote monitoring stations are staffed with personnel for verification. Display boards may not be working, but votes can still be conducted using the electronic voting system. During a parliamentary inquiry, the presiding officer confirmed that the electronic voting system was functioning correctly, despite a display issue with the panel showing names from \"Danner\" to \"Doyle.\" Members were advised to recheck their votes on the electronic device, but assurance was given that votes were being recorded. During Roll Call No. 402 on September 19, 2002, an inoperative display panel did not show votes, but Members were assured their votes were being recorded. Similar issues occurred during Roll Call No. 463 on September 4, 2003, and an unnamed vote on August 3, 2007, where Members were asked to verify their votes at voting stations. During a voting session, technical issues with the electronic voting system led to absent Members being displayed as having voted. Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer requested to vacate the vote until the issue was resolved, which was approved by the House. This situation was different from past investigations into \"ghost voting\" by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. Chairman Frank Thompson addressed a malfunction in the voting system that incorrectly showed Representative Patricia Schroeder as having voted while she was away in Cambodia. He assured members that it was a light malfunction and not an actual vote. Similarly, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard was also incorrectly shown as voting while absent, which was deemed a \"statistical anomaly\" by Chairman Thomas. Chairman Thomas addressed a voting anomaly where a 64-bit string was misread, causing confusion. Steps were taken to recreate the anomaly to ensure it wasn't a system issue. Representative Roybal-Allard was involved in the incident. On June 26, Representative Roybal-Allard addressed a voting anomaly in the House of Representatives due to a family emergency. The mistake in her recorded vote was caught by Minority Leader's staff, and investigations are ongoing to prevent such incidents in the future. On June 26, Representative Roybal-Allard addressed a voting anomaly in the House of Representatives due to a family emergency. The mistake in her recorded vote was caught by Minority Leader's staff, and investigations are ongoing to prevent such incidents in the future. The Clerk informed the Committee on House Administration of the anomaly where Roybal-Allard was mistakenly recorded as voting \"aye\" on an amendment, but she would have voted \"nay\" if present. The Congressional Record was corrected to reflect that she was absent during Roll Call No. 305 on June 21, 2000. The Chair and the Chairman of the Committee on House Administration believe it is necessary to correct the Record and the Journal due to a voting anomaly involving Representative Roybal-Allard. Despite the reliability of electronic voting systems, corrections are being made to ensure accuracy. The Clerk certified a correction in the Congressional Record on July 10, stating that Representative Roybal-Allard did not vote on Roll Call No. 305 due to an error in the electronic voting system. Members have historically provided \"personal explanations\" in the Congressional Record to clarify their intended vote in such situations. Members use personal explanations to clarify their intended vote in situations where they were absent or incorrectly recorded during a vote. They can request to have a statement appear in the Congressional Record or submit a signed statement through their cloakroom for publication. If received on the day of the vote, the explanation is inserted immediately after the vote; otherwise, it is placed in the Extension of the Remarks. During roll call votes, Members can provide personal explanations for their absence and state how they would have voted if present. These explanations are recorded in the Congressional Record for transparency. Since the introduction of electronic voting in the 93rd Congress, Members can use personal explanations to correct a recorded vote if they believe it was incorrectly recorded. These explanations do not change the official record but allow Members to state their intended vote when the electronic system fails to register it. On December 13, the speaker was in Washington D.C. for official business and intended to vote on Rollcall No. 498, H.Res. 314, but the electronic voting machine did not register the vote. The speaker requests that the Congressional Record reflect a \"no\" vote on this rule. The speaker experienced an issue with the electronic voting system during rollcall No. 226 for the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Despite intending to vote \"yea,\" the system did not register the vote. This incident is part of a small fraction of voting clarifications in the Congressional Record, with only 0.62% of personal explanations involving inaccuracies by the electronic voting system. Under House Rule III, Members must be present in the House during sittings and vote on each question unless they have a direct interest. Speaker Gingrich implemented a policy for expedited voting, aiming to conclude votes within 17 minutes. The policy allowed Members in the well to vote and resulted in a dispute over a vote. The Speaker's policy to expedite votes led to a dispute over a vote on June 21, 1995. Members questioned the timing of votes on the floor and in committee. Some Members left a committee markup for a floor vote, leading to confusion. The Committee of the Whole chairman prioritized floor votes and waited for committee members to arrive before closing the vote. Minority Whip David E. Bonior raised a parliamentary inquiry after Roll Call No. 405. David E. Bonior raised a parliamentary inquiry regarding a disputed vote where two Members were still voting when the vote was called. Majority Leader Dick Armey reviewed the videotape and defended the presiding officer's actions, emphasizing the importance of fairness in the Chamber. The House revisited the vote on the Fazio amendment after a unanimous-consent request. The amendment offered by the gentleman from California was agreed to in the Committee of the Whole. Electronic voting results are usually announced within minutes after the 15-minute voting period. The House typically announces electronic voting results within minutes after the voting period. Votes may be held open longer for specific reasons, such as technical failures or Members arriving late to vote. House Rule XX, cl. 2(a) was amended to prevent holding open a vote solely to change the outcome. Speaker Jim Wright once asked for additional votes during a roll call in 1987. During a House vote, Speaker allowed Members to vote as long as they were in the Chamber and wanted to cast a vote. The bill passed with a close margin of 206 yeas to 205 nays. Representative inquired about the rules regarding reopening a vote after time had expired. The Speaker clarified that additional votes may be cast after the minimum 15-minute roll call period at the discretion of the Chair. A specific instance of a prolonged vote in 2003 is mentioned, along with the establishment of the House Office of Congressional Ethics in 2008. After a prolonged debate, a vote was taken on H.Res. 1031. The presiding officer held the vote open for an additional 15 minutes before announcing the previous question was ordered. Representative Roy Blunt raised a parliamentary inquiry about holding open votes, leading to a potential challenge under Rule XX. Minority Leader John A. Boehner later raised a question of the privileges of the House regarding the practice of holding votes open beyond a \"reasonable\" time. Boehner's resolution aimed to denounce the practice of holding open votes for an extended period, investigate Democratic leadership's violations of House rules, and look into voting irregularities on August 2, 2007. The House has investigated voting anomalies four times since 1973, with the latest investigation focusing on Roll Call No. 814 in 2007. \"Ghost\" voting, where one Member votes for another on the House floor, has been investigated twice since electronic voting began in 1973. The first investigation involved Representatives Morgan Murphy and Tennyson Guyer during the 96th Congress, while the second involved Representative Austin Murphy during the 100th Congress. Both investigations were conducted by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. Mr. Speaker, I request that the Record reflect I was not present and did not vote on July 30. I ask the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to investigate this matter. Representatives John Murtha and Bill Thomas were designated to serve on an investigative subcommittee in 1979. The subcommittee was tasked with investigating three votes cast by Representative Tennyson Guyer in 1979. The General Accounting Office (GAO) found no evidence linking Representatives Murphy and Guyer to a proxy voting scheme. The committee did not bring charges but noted the seriousness of willful abuse of the Electronic Voting System. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct investigated allegations against Representative Austin Murphy for allowing others to vote for him in his absence. The committee investigated six counts against Representative Murphy, including allegations of other Members casting votes on his behalf. Two voting-related counts were sustained, along with two non-voting-related counts. Count four charged Murphy with diverting resources from his district office to his former law firm, violating House rules and ethics codes. Count five, which alleged allowing someone with a professional relationship to benefit from official funds, was dismissed. The Committee on Standards and Ethics recommended a reprimand for Representative Murphy for various violations, including retaining an employee who did not perform duties commensurate with pay received. The House agreed to reprimand Representative Murphy. The Committee also initiated informal fact-finding into allegations linking Representative Nick Smith's support for a bill with support for his son's congressional candidacy. The investigative subcommittee found no evidence of bribery in support of Representative Nick Smith's son's congressional candidacy. While Smith's conduct did not meet House standards, formal sanctions were deemed unjustified. The investigative subcommittee found that Representative Candice S. Miller and Majority Leader Tom DeLay were implicated in the investigation. Representative Miller made a specific threat of retaliation against Representative Smith, while Majority Leader DeLay's actions contributed to the public allegations. The investigative subcommittee found that Representative Candice S. Miller and Majority Leader Tom DeLay were implicated in the investigation. Representative Smith believed that the Majority Leader's endorsement would greatly assist his son's election campaign. The full committee unanimously adopted the report, which included a public admonishment to Representative Nick Smith, Representative Candice Miller, and Representative Tom DeLay for their conduct. On August 2, 2007, Representative Jerry Lewis offered a motion to recommit with instructions to H.R. 3161, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008. The vote on the motion was initially announced as a tie, but later corrected to show that it was not agreed to. Some Members disputed the initial announcement, citing an electronic voting display showing a different result. Majority Leader Hoyer requested to vacate the vote, but Minority Leader Boehner objected. Majority Leader Hoyer then moved to reconsider the vote. On August 3, Majority Leader Hoyer introduced a resolution for the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to review the events surrounding the vote on the motion to recommit H.R. 3161. Mr. Boehner opposed referring the matter to the committee and proposed working together. Mr. Hoyer withdrew the resolution later that day. The House agreed to a resolution directing a select committee to investigate voting irregularities related to a motion to recommit. The Select Committee met publicly for the first time on September 27, 2007, adopting rules, an interim report, and hearing testimony from the clerk of the House and her staff. The Select Committee to Investigate Voting Irregularities of August 2, 2007 set out four areas of investigation for future hearings: Persons on the Speaker's dais, Electronic voting system, Duration of a vote, and Sequence of events. Testimony has been taken from various individuals regarding these areas in public hearings. The Select Committee to Investigate Voting Irregularities of August 2, 2007 has gathered testimony from various individuals, including Majority Leader Hoyer and Parliamentarian John V. Sullivan, regarding electronic voting in the House of Representatives. The final report is due by September 15, 2008. Voting processes have remained relatively unchanged for over 200 years, with rare problems that can have lasting ramifications in the chamber. The Select Committee is authorized to recommend changes to voting procedures in the House. Various options for voting protocol changes are discussed, ranging from minor adjustments to a complete overhaul. These options are presented for consideration, with no specific order of importance. The House rules can be changed on the opening day of a Congress through a resolution, which includes specific changes for the new Congress. Suggestions for rule changes are solicited prior to an election, evaluated by the Rules Committee, and may include changes to voting processes. The rules resolution for a new Congress is typically numbered H.Res. 5 or H.Res. 6 and is considered for one hour as an indivisible package. The House rules can be changed through a resolution on opening day of a Congress, typically H.Res. 5 or H.Res. 6. The rules package is usually considered for one hour as an unamendable entity. The minority party may offer an alternative rules package, but it often fails on a party-line vote. Rules changes can also be made through a \"self executing\" provision in a special rule, allowing changes without a direct vote. Amendments to House rules can be brought up through a discharge petition. The House rules can be changed through a resolution on opening day of a Congress, typically H.Res. 5 or H.Res. 6. Changes can also be made through a discharge petition or by unanimous consent. Statutes can set rules for considering legislation, which can be incorporated into House rules. Speaker announcements or policies are protocols established by the Speaker at the start of a new Congress. Speaker announcements or policies are protocols related to legislative practices observed during a Congress. These practices reflect long-standing traditions and are not included in House rules but pertain to the operation of the chamber and the legislative process. Standing orders, similar to Speaker's announcements, are directives with the force of chamber rules but not formally incorporated. Various entities such as the Office of the Clerk of the House and the Committee on House Administration can issue guidance on internal chamber operations, including voting procedures. In the 110th Congress, the clerk of the House changed the process for preparing measures for the President. House operations can also change through custom and tradition, like allowing party leaders time to discuss upcoming work. A key issue is determining when it's too late for a Member to vote, as every Member has the right to vote on behalf of their constituents. The House could consider enforcing a firm 15-minute voting time, with a single exception for system malfunctions. A rules change would be needed to eliminate the \"minimum\" voting time of 15 minutes and replace it with a fixed voting time. Closing the electronic voting system at a certain time could eliminate the use of well cards, unless retained for Members without personalized electronic voting cards. The House could enforce a 15-minute voting time limit by requiring all votes to be by electronic device or using well cards within a specified time frame. Options include increasing the voting time beyond 15 minutes for Members' travel, adding a strict 20-minute time limit, or allowing a 15-minute voting time with a cap and additional 5 minutes for electronic voting or well card use. It may be recommended or required for Members to arrive on the floor to vote within 15 minutes. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer recently stated that Members should arrive on the floor to vote within 15 minutes. Well cards are traditionally kept on the round table in the well, but this location may obstruct the view of the presiding officer. Concerns about the rule on reversing the outcome of a vote in House Rule XX, cl. 2(a) have been raised due to its ambiguity and enforcement issues. The House rules may need to be clarified or repealed due to ambiguity and enforcement issues. Potential changes could include drafting a new rule for voting procedures, authorizing the Speaker's announcements, and providing guidance on voting by electronic device. Clarifying the relationship between the well and the chamber is also important. The House rules and Speaker's policies regarding official policy need clarification. A meeting was held to explain the electronic voting system, highlighting the need for Members to be educated on voting procedures. Training sessions could be designed by the clerk and parliamentarian to address this issue. The select committee's walk-through participants could design training sessions on the voting system for new and returning Members, including roles on the Speaker's dais. Training for Members could be during early meetings and a second session within the first months of a Congress. The clerk and parliamentarian could also design training for all officials on the dais to understand each other's roles and responsibilities for uniformity of action. Training manuals could be prepared for both Members and dais staff, including information on responsibilities, voting procedures, and the electronic voting system. Manuals could be distributed to Members early on, and dais personnel could receive them before a new Congress convenes. The House could require training for all Members asked to preside over sessions, with a focus on clarifying roles and responsibilities. The House could consider clarifying the roles of the presiding officer and parliamentarian, including how members are selected to preside and the parliamentarian's intervention in advising the presiding officer. Currently, presiding officers are provided with cue cards for language use in response to developments on the floor. The parliamentarian provides training to presiding officers on language use and maintaining decorum in the chamber. Restrictions on approaching the rostrum may be implemented for non-Members or selected staff. The House could consider reinstating the use of \"pairs\" for absent Members to have their position noted prior to a vote. Three types of pairs were historically recognized: general pair, specific pair, and live pair. The rules for the 106th Congress eliminated all but live pairs, which were used in 2003 on the Medicare prescription drug measure. The House could institute an official policy on pairs. The House could consider implementing a policy for Members to make statements on missed votes, potentially through unanimous consent or other means. The absence of a \"tally sheet\" is important for investigating votes. Consideration could be given to allowing the use of \"pairs\" for absent Members to have their position noted before a vote. The House discussed the process of tally sheet preparation for votes on August 2, 2007. It was suggested that a final tally sheet, marked with a different color, be completed by a clerk and provided to the presiding officer to make the vote official. The use of tally sheets for recording votes was questioned as automated systems are increasingly used in the House. The select committee also raised concerns about the use of summary boards versus tally sheets by the presiding officer. The House may need to reconsider the use of tally sheets and summary boards for recording votes, as well as the display of the word \"final\" during the clerk's termination of a vote. It could also be beneficial for the presiding officer to have more control over tally sheets, summary boards, and the bell and light system. Additionally, a review of the number and locations of voting stations in the chamber, which were determined without actual experience, may be warranted after over 30 years of use. A survey could be conducted to determine the usage of voting machines and the appropriateness of voting station locations in the House. Clarification of jurisdiction between House committees regarding voting issues is needed. The House Rules Committee's authority over voting rules and potential points of order could be clarified. The role of the Office of Congressional Ethics in investigating voting irregularities should be determined. Reports on voting concerns could be required periodically. The House may require biennial reports on electronic voting system operations, security, and voting irregularities. Reports would cover preparation, conduct, conclusion of daily use, support for system personnel, security measures, voting by personnel on the Speaker's dais, and points of order raised. Reports would be printed as official documents at the end of each Congress and provided to Members and dais personnel, as well as used in training sessions for new Members. The House may consider potential voting issues and whether action is needed, taking into account the events of August 2, 2007. Changes to voting procedures could have unintended consequences. Constitutional provisions and House rules related to voting are outlined in the documents provided to Members and dais personnel. Article 1, Section 5, clause 3 states that the Yeas and Nays of Members can be recorded on the Journal if desired by one fifth of those present.

Each Delegate and the Resident Commissioner possess the same powers and privileges as Members of the House. Standing committees are elected by the House within seven days after the start of each Congress. One member of each standing committee is elected by the House. The Committee on Rules may not report a rule or order without a two-thirds vote. Rule XIV states that business under clause 6 of rule XV can be set aside by a vote of less than two-thirds of Members present. Rule XV requires a two-thirds vote to suspend a rule. Private Calendar: On the third Tuesday of a month, the Speaker may call bills and resolutions on the Private Calendar. Two-thirds of Members can vote to dispense with the call. Calendar Call of Committees: On Wednesdays, business is delayed until completion of committee calls unless two-thirds of Members agree to dispense with the call. Rule XVI: A third reading precedes passage, with the final reading by title. Rule XVIII states that a quorum of 100 Members is required for the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. If a quorum is not present, the Chairman can invoke procedures to address the issue. The Chairman may also refuse to entertain a point of order regarding the quorum during general debate. The Chairman may address the issue of a quorum not being present in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union by invoking specific procedures, including announcing a minimum time for electronic voting on the pending question. The Chairman can also declare a quorum constituted at any time during a quorum call, which would vacate proceedings under the call. In the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, the Chairman can order a recorded vote on a request supported by at least 25 Members and may reduce the minimum time for electronic voting to five minutes without debate on pending amendments. The Chairman can also postpone a recorded vote on any amendment and resume proceedings at any time.

The Chairman can also postpone a recorded vote on any amendment and resume proceedings at any time. The Rules of the House are applicable to the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. Clause 2(a) allows for the House to recommit a measure to a committee with or without instructions. Voting procedures are outlined in Rule XX, including how a recorded vote is conducted if requested by a Member supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum. In the House, a recorded vote is taken under specific rules, with the outcome determined by yeas and nays. The Clerk conducts record votes electronically, listing members' names in the Journal and Congressional Record. A vote cannot be held open to change the result, and a minimum 15-minute time frame is required. When the electronic voting system is inoperable, the Speaker or Chairman may direct the Clerk to conduct a record vote or quorum call by roll call or tellers. The Clerk calls Members alphabetically by surname, with the state name added if necessary. Members can vote or announce a pair after the second call. The Speaker may also direct a record vote or quorum call to be conducted by tellers, with names recorded by the tellers named by the Speaker. When the electronic voting system is inoperable, the Speaker or Chairman may direct the Clerk to conduct a record vote or quorum call by tellers. The tellers named by the Speaker record the names of Members voting on each side of the question, with absentees noted. The minimum time for a record vote or quorum call by tellers is 15 minutes. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of at least 15 Members, including the Speaker, may compel the attendance of absent Members. The Speaker or Chairman may direct the Clerk to conduct a record vote or quorum call by tellers when the electronic voting system is inoperable. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of at least 15 Members, including the Speaker, may compel the attendance of absent Members. If the House is without a quorum due to catastrophic circumstances, a provisional number of the House will be used until a sufficient number of Representatives appear. The provisional number of the House is determined by the number of Representatives responding to a call of the House. If a Representative leaves or joins the House, the provisional number is adjusted accordingly. The House is considered without a quorum in catastrophic circumstances if a call of the House exceeds 72 hours without a quorum being produced. In catastrophic circumstances, if a call of the House exceeds 72 hours without a quorum, the Speaker, along with the Majority Leader and Minority Leader, receives a catastrophic quorum failure report from the Sergeant-at-Arms. This report advises on the reasons for the quorum failure, such as natural disasters or attacks, rendering Representatives unable to attend. In catastrophic circumstances, if a call of the House exceeds 72 hours without a quorum, the Speaker, along with the Majority Leader and Minority Leader, receives a catastrophic quorum failure report from the Sergeant-at-Arms. The report advises on the reasons for the quorum failure, such as natural disasters or attacks, rendering Representatives unable to attend. A report is prepared specifying vacancies, incapacitated Representatives, those incapable of attending, and those unaccounted for. The report is updated daily and made available to the House. Upon the death, resignation, expulsion, disqualification, removal, or swearing of a Member, the whole number of the House shall be adjusted accordingly. The Speaker shall announce changes in the provisional number of the House, which is the number of Representatives needed for a quorum until the full number is present. Upon the death of a Member, the Speaker may present relevant documentation. If a quorum fails to vote, a call of the House is initiated, absent Members are brought in, and the yeas and nays are recorded. Each Member arrested under this clause is brought before the House and noted as present. The Speaker may present relevant documentation upon the death of a Member. If a quorum fails to vote, a call of the House is initiated, absent Members are brought in, and the yeas and nays are recorded. Each Member arrested under this clause is brought before the House, noted as present, discharged from arrest, and given an opportunity to vote. If a majority of the House is present and voting, the Speaker declares a quorum, and the pending question is decided based on the majority vote. A motion to adjourn can be made before the result is announced, and if passed, all proceedings under this clause are vacated. The Speaker may not entertain a point of order regarding a quorum. Clause 7 states that the Speaker may not address a quorum issue unless a vote has been taken. The Speaker can allow a call of the House to establish a quorum, but further proceedings may be skipped unless a motion is made to compel attendance. A call of the House is not allowed after the previous question is ordered unless a quorum is confirmed. Clause 8 allows for the postponement of proceedings when a recorded vote is ordered. The Speaker may postpone proceedings on certain questions to a designated place in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days. The questions include passing a bill, adopting a resolution, agreeing to a conference report, and ordering the previous question on specific matters. The Speaker may postpone proceedings on certain questions to a designated place in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days, including passing a bill, adopting a resolution, agreeing to a conference report, and ordering the previous question on specific matters.

A motion to close a meeting of a conference committee is privileged, decided without debate, and by yeas and nays. Members convicted of a crime should refrain from committee participation and voting until innocence is reinstated or reelected. Speaker Pelosi announced policies in line with tradition. Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced policies for the 110th Congress regarding voting by electronic device, with modifications to the existing rule of providing at least 15 minutes for voting. The policy was published in the Congressional Record on January 5, 2007. The Chair announced a policy on October 30, 1991, to close electronic votes promptly after 15 minutes to avoid unnecessary loss of time in conducting House business. Members were encouraged to cooperate and depart for the Chamber promptly upon the bell signal. Requests to hold a vote by electronic device should not be forwarded to the Chair. Members should not rely on signals relayed from outside the Chamber to assume that votes will be held open until they arrive in the Chamber. Voting is a public act that Representatives should not miss, as it demonstrates their dedication to their constituents. Understanding voting procedures in the House is crucial for Members. In the House, lawmakers can vote through voice votes, division votes, yea and nay votes, and recorded votes. Voice votes involve calling out \"yea\" or \"nay\" in response to the Speaker's question. Division votes are used when the outcome of a voice vote is uncertain or when a Member demands a division. When a Member demands a division in the House, those in favor and opposed to the question must rise to be counted. This method, although quick, does not provide individual voting records. The Constitution allows for a Yea and Nay vote if one-fifth of Members present desire it, regardless of a quorum. When a Member demands a division in the House, those in favor and opposed to the question must rise to be counted. The Speaker will order a yea and nay vote if supported by one-fifth of those present. An automatic vote is triggered if a quorum is not present, as stated in House Rule XX, clause 6. Additionally, the yeas and nays are ordered on final passage of specific measures, such as concurrent budget resolutions. The Constitution requires that votes to override presidential vetoes shall be determined by the yeas and nays, with recorded votes taken by electronic device if requested by at least one-fifth of a quorum. Standby procedures are used if the computerized voting system malfunctions. A recorded vote is obtained when a Member states, \"Mr. Speaker, on that I demand a recorded vote,\" and is supported by at least 44 members. Recorded votes require one-fifth of a quorum to support the request. In the Committee of the Whole, a recorded vote can be requested by at least 25 Members, and if supported, it will occur by electronic device. In the House or Committee of the Whole, a lawmaker can request a recorded vote if a quorum is not present. The minimum time for a recorded vote is 15 minutes, but the chair can extend it. A new rule prohibits holding votes open solely to change the outcome. The Speaker in the House has discretion to reduce voting time to five minutes and cluster votes. Votes in the Committee of the Whole can also be reduced to five minutes. Points of order related to voting in the 110th Congress were compiled, resulting in 443 documents. In the 110th Congress, points of order related to voting were compiled, resulting in 220 documents containing parliamentary inquiries between January 4, 2007, and May 23, 2008. Each document was examined for inquiries dealing with voting, including the date, Member raising the inquiry, Congressional Record page number, and colloquy with the presiding officer."
