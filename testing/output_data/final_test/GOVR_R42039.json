    "content": "The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued Policy Letter 11-01 on September 12, 2011, providing guidance to executive branch agencies on identifying and managing inherently governmental and critical functions. This policy letter, effective from October 12, 2011, ensures that only federal employees handle these functions as per the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 and President Obama's memorandum on government contracting. The NDAA'09 tasked OMB with reviewing and developing a single consistent definition of \"inherently governmental function\" to ensure that only government personnel perform critical functions necessary for agency missions. Criteria were also developed for identifying positions that government personnel should perform to maintain sufficient expertise and technical capabilities. The Obama administration tasked OMB with clarifying outsourcing guidelines to ensure agencies maintain expertise. OFPP issued a proposed policy letter in response on March 31, 2010, focusing on work reserved for federal employees. Congressional interest in inherently governmental functions may persist despite the final policy letter. The final policy letter addresses recommendations on inherently governmental functions and directs agencies to reserve work for federal employees. The final policy letter directs agencies to reserve work for federal employees based on whether it involves inherently governmental functions, functions closely associated with them, or critical functions. Agencies must ensure adequate government personnel for contracted work, prioritize federal employee performance in strategic human capital planning, and review outsourced work for potential insourcing. The policy letter directs agencies to prioritize reviewing work by small businesses that is not inherently governmental and to give preference to small businesses for private-sector work. Agencies must use the \"rule of two\" to determine if small businesses can perform the work at a fair market price. Other requirements include implementing procedures, providing regular training to employees, and conducting periodic reviews. The policy letter requires agencies to prioritize reviewing work by small businesses that is not inherently governmental, give preference to small businesses for private-sector work, and use the \"rule of two\" to determine if small businesses can perform the work at a fair market price. It also mandates regular training for employees, periodic reviews of internal management controls, and designating a senior official accountable for agency compliance. The letter defines \"inherently governmental functions\" as those requiring the exercise of discretion in applying federal authority or making value judgments for the government. The policy letter establishes tests for identifying inherently governmental functions based on the nature of the function and the exercise of discretion. Agencies may not contract out functions involving discretion that would commit the government to a course of action without specified ranges of acceptable decisions or oversight. The policy letter establishes tests for identifying inherently governmental functions based on the nature of the function and the exercise of discretion. It provides examples of such functions and requires agencies to take steps to ensure they are not contracted out. Before issuing a solicitation, agencies must ensure that requirements are not designated as inherently governmental, listed in Appendix A, or qualify as such under specific tests. Agencies must also confirm that contractors do not limit the agency's decision-making abilities. Ongoing responsibilities include reviewing contractor performance and agency contract management. If contractors are found to be performing inherently governmental functions, agencies should strengthen oversight, insource the work, refrain from exercising contract options, or terminate the contract. The policy letter directs agencies to reserve certain work for federal employees, giving \"special consideration\" to using government personnel for functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. Agencies must ensure contractors do not cross the line into performing inherently governmental functions. The letter does not define these functions but provides examples in Appendix B. Agencies must determine in writing before solicitation if federal employees should perform functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The policy letter requires agencies to give special consideration to using federal employees for work closely associated with inherently governmental functions. Agencies must ensure contractors do not perform inherently governmental functions and comply with agency responsibilities outlined in Appendix C. This includes limiting contractors' discretion, assigning qualified government personnel to monitor activities, identifying contractors and their work product, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Agencies must ensure federal employees perform critical functions necessary for effective agency operation and mission control. The policy letter defines critical functions as necessary for agency effectiveness and mission control. Agencies must ensure federal employees perform these functions, with contractors allowed only if the agency has sufficient internal capability. Agencies must monitor contractor performance and consider insourcing critical functions when necessary. The final policy letter emphasizes the importance of insourcing critical functions to maintain control over mission and operations. It has been renamed to \"Performance of Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions\" to better reflect its purpose of finding the right balance between contracted work and reserved functions for federal employees. The policy letter emphasizes the importance of insourcing critical functions to maintain control over mission and operations. It provides guidance on managing the workforce mix in all phases of the contracting process, recognizing the expertise contractors can offer while cautioning against overreliance on them. The policy letter emphasizes the importance of insourcing critical functions to maintain control over mission and operations, directing agencies to consider whether functions are inherently governmental, critical, or \"essential\" for effective government performance. The final policy letter lists specific inherently governmental functions, including combat operations, security operations, price determinations, contractor performance evaluations, and grant recipient selection. The final policy letter includes specific security functions that could limit agencies' discretion to contract out, addressing concerns of some Members of Congress and commentators. It also lists acquisition-related functions not explicitly addressed in the proposed policy letter, such as conducting market research and developing inputs for cost estimates. The final policy letter establishes a checklist for agencies when contracting functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. It distinguishes between \"functions\" and \"activities\" and includes specific security functions that could limit agencies' discretion to contract out. OFPP responded to criticism by clarifying that agencies should focus on activities when determining if work should be done by government personnel. The final policy letter emphasizes that functions deemed \"critical\" can vary based on agency mission and operations. The final policy letter reorganizes and consolidates guidance on critical functions, emphasizing agency discretion. Policy Letter 11-01 also directs agencies to prioritize small businesses for certain functions. The final policy letter directs agencies to prioritize small businesses for certain functions, placing a lower priority on reviewing work performed by small businesses when the work is not inherently governmental and where continued contractor performance does not put the agency at risk of losing control of its mission or operations. The final policy letter directs agencies to prioritize small businesses for certain functions and apply the \"rule of two\" when insourcing contracted work currently performed by small and large businesses. This rule requires competitions to be set aside for small businesses when two or more are capable of performing the work at fair market price. Agencies should also consider setting aside work reduced through insourcing for small businesses. The Policy Letter 11-01 proposes changes to regulations for determining termination of contracts and selecting incumbent contractors. OMB adopts the definition of \"inherently governmental function\" from the FAIR Act, replacing existing definitions in regulations and policies like the FAR. By adopting the FAIR Act's definition of \"inherently governmental functions\" and modifying the FAR and/or OMB Circular A-76, Policy Letter 11-01 aims to standardize definitions across federal law and policy. This would help agencies determine whether commercial activities should be outsourced or performed in-house. The final policy letter aims to standardize definitions of \"inherently governmental functions\" across federal law and policy, but does not directly address other provisions of law that designate specific functions as inherently governmental or commercial. This lack of clarity has been identified as an impediment to producing consistent results on the permissibility of contracting out certain functions. The final policy letter aims to standardize definitions of \"inherently governmental functions\" and establish a definition of \"critical function\" in federal law. Legislation in the 112th Congress proposes creating a category of \"mission essential functions.\" The policy letter does not address functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The final policy letter aims to standardize definitions of \"inherently governmental functions\" and establish a definition of \"critical function\" in federal law. Agencies are required to give \"special consideration\" to using federal employees for functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The final policy letter lists nine examples of such functions, which are similar to the 19 examples currently given in the FAR. The final policy letter aims to standardize definitions of \"inherently governmental functions\" and establish a definition of \"critical function\" in federal law. It could raise issues for Congress regarding agencies' determinations on whether to perform certain functions in-house or by contractors, particularly security functions designated as inherently governmental. The final policy letter aims to standardize definitions of \"inherently governmental functions\" and establish a definition of \"critical function\" in federal law. It could raise issues for Congress regarding agencies' determinations on whether to perform certain functions in-house or by contractors, particularly security functions designated as inherently governmental. Policy Letter 11-01 has sparked debate on whether certain activities constitute \"combat\" and potential legislative implications. The publication of Policy Letter 11-01 provides agencies with guidance on differentiating between inherently governmental functions, functions closely associated with them, and critical functions. Compliance with the policy may be challenging as agency personnel need to understand and apply an expanded typology of functions. Some concerns exist about potential widespread insourcing, but it is unclear if data will be collected on agencies' activities and outcomes. The publication of OFPP's Policy Letter 11-01 categorizes agency functions into commercial, inherently governmental, critical, and functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. Only inherently governmental functions require federal employee performance. Contractor employees, federal employees, or a combination of both may perform other functions, with guidance provided for appropriate circumstances. Proper identification of agency functions may depend on personnel knowledge availability. The policy letter provides instructions for identifying inherently governmental functions, reinforcing agency personnel's understanding and clarifying the use of the illustrative list in Appendix A. This process is crucial for determining which agency functions require federal employee performance. The policy letter instructs agency personnel on identifying inherently governmental functions by applying tests if not listed in Appendix A or designated by statute. This process is essential for determining functions that must be performed by federal employees. Under President George W. Bush, agencies were required to submit lists of inherently governmental functions along with their annual inventories of commercial activities. There are differences between the Bush and Obama Administration initiatives in terms of the unit of analysis and definitions used. The Obama Administration focuses on agency functions and contractor performance, using the FAIR Act definition of inherently governmental. The policy letter addresses the identification of inherently governmental functions, emphasizing the need for informed, independent judgments by government officials. It also mentions functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions, providing examples in Appendix B. This may require a revised approach and training for agency personnel. The policy letter expands on the identification of inherently governmental functions and closely associated functions, emphasizing the need for agency personnel to receive training on determining the appropriate workforce for each function. Additionally, the addition of critical functions is highlighted, with a checklist provided by OFPP for agencies when contractors perform closely associated functions. The proposed OFPP policy letter from March 2010 focuses on identifying commercial functions eligible for public-private competition. Agency personnel are tasked with determining the criticality of functions and assessing internal capability. This requires a different perspective and training on workforce selection. The OFPP policy letter from March 2010 emphasizes the importance of identifying critical functions for public-private competition. Agency officials need to exercise informed judgment to determine if functions are critical and if the agency has the internal capability. Critical functions vary based on an agency's mission and operations, and over-reliance on contractors also differs between agencies. Interagency discussions and information sharing can help agencies identify critical functions effectively. The Chief Acquisition Officers Council has established a working group on Multi-Sector Workforce Management to discuss agency personnel needs for implementing policy letter provisions. Additional federal employees may be required for pre-award and post-award tasks, small business contracting, agency procedures, training, management responsibilities, and potentially performing functions currently done by contractors. The policy letter addresses personnel issues related to strategic human capital planning, ensuring agencies have the necessary personnel to manage contractors, evaluate work products, and maintain acquisition workforce quality. This includes recruiting, hiring, training new employees, and reallocating incumbent employees as needed. The policy letter emphasizes the importance of agencies having the right personnel to manage contractors, evaluate work products, and maintain acquisition workforce quality. It highlights the need for agencies to consider funding and workforce size when deciding on using federal employees for certain tasks. The expansion of agency functions and responsibilities may strain an understaffed and undertrained acquisition workforce. The Acquisition Advisory Panel reported a significant mismatch between demands on the acquisition workforce and available personnel and skills since the 1990s. From 2001 to 2008, contract spending doubled to over 500 billion dollars while the acquisition workforce size remained relatively flat, leading to challenges in coping with the growth in contract spending and agencies' missions. The implementation of Policy Letter 11-01 and related documents aims to strengthen an agency's internal capacity, allocate additional personnel to contract management, and consider insourcing as a management tool to address overreliance on contractors. Insourcing is not the sole focus, as competitive sourcing and outsourcing are also important considerations according to OFPP. The policy letter aims to address overreliance on contractors by strengthening contract oversight using government employees with appropriate expertise. The head of OFPP stated that the letter should not lead to a widespread shift away from contractors, as agencies have been informally following its principles for over a year without significant change. The policy letter aims to address overreliance on contractors by strengthening contract oversight using government employees with appropriate expertise. Agencies may rely on contractors for functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions, as long as they maintain control. Rebalancing does not always require insourcing, and insourcing decisions should consider practical and other considerations. Agencies are advised to prioritize reviewing work performed by small businesses and apply the \"rule of two\" for work remaining in the private sector. Agencies are advised to apply the \"rule of two\" for work remaining in the private sector, especially if part of the contracted function to be insourced is currently performed by small and large businesses. OFPP provides guidance on insourcing work on an accelerated basis if agencies are unable to reestablish control of inherently governmental functions through other means. Insourcing can be synchronized with the non-exercise of an option period in the contract, but accelerated insourcing is not mentioned as an option for critical functions that put internal control of mission and operations at risk. The policy letter does not mention accelerated insourcing as an option for critical functions that could disrupt agency operations. Agencies may need time to secure funding and capacity for in-house operations. OFPP could consider having agencies compile outcome data for a centralized database. Options include expanding workforce inventories or modifying the Federal Procurement Data System. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required federal agencies to develop a multi-sector workforce planning pilot to map out current workloads and utilization of in-house and contracted labor. This includes tracking the number and location of full-time federal employee equivalents (FTEs) and contractor employees for each function performed. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required federal agencies to develop a multi-sector workforce planning pilot to map out current workloads and utilization of in-house and contracted labor. Work is classified into different categories based on criticality and funding source. Agencies that complied with this requirement have gained experience in assessing a portion of their workforce, which could be useful for an expanded workforce inventory. The FAIR Act requires agencies, except DOD, to compile annual inventories of service contracts and submit them to OMB. The inventory must include details such as services purchased, role in achieving agency objectives, dollar amounts, contract type, contractor information, and work location. The FAIR Act mandates agencies (excluding DOD) to compile annual service contract inventories with details like contractor names, work locations, contract types, and whether contracts were awarded noncompetitively. This data is available on agency websites and can provide insights into the agency's workforce composition when combined with information on the type of functions contractors perform. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is used by agencies to report contract actions, and the public can access this data through database searches. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) contains a large amount of procurement information, including solicitation numbers, contract action dates, and contracting officer determinations. Developing a data collection system to properly classify agency functions could be beneficial for planning and evaluating compliance efforts. Making this system public could enhance transparency and understanding. Members of the 112th Congress have introduced bills addressing governmental functions, such as the CLEAN-UP Act requiring federal employees to perform critical functions closely associated with inherently governmental ones. This could potentially impact agencies' determinations and decisions. The Freedom from Government Competition Act, introduced in the 112th Congress, aims to limit government competition with private citizens and rely on commercial sources for goods and services. It requires federal agencies to take specific steps regarding non-inherently governmental goods and services. Legislation in the 112th Congress addresses awarding contracts through competitive procedures, converting activities to performance by qualified Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian Organizations, and conducting public-private competitions. Other proposed laws focus on designating functions as inherently governmental, reducing contractors, limiting public-private competitions, and restricting DOD's conversion of functions to civilian employees. The conversion is necessary to comply with DOD's general personnel policy (H.R. 1540, \u00a7965)."
