    "content": "The \"Evacuees Assistance Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. It includes a provision for a tax credit for evacuation expenses during mandatory evacuations. Tax credit for evacuation expenses allows individuals to claim qualified expenses incurred during a mandatory evacuation, up to a limit of $2,000. Qualified expenses include travel costs such as meals and lodging. The term 'qualified evacuation' refers to a mandatory evacuation of an individual's area during a qualified disaster. The tax credit for evacuation expenses increases the aggregate credits allowed to an individual, based on certain criteria. The tax credit allowed for social security taxes paid by an individual in a taxable year will reduce the overall credit allowable under subsection (a). Social security taxes include taxes imposed on income received by the taxpayer and 50 percent of self-employment income taxes. The tax credit for social security taxes paid by an individual in a taxable year includes 50 percent of self-employment income taxes and taxes on income received by the taxpayer. The term 'social security taxes' excludes taxes eligible for a special refund under section 6413(c) and amounts paid under agreements related to foreign affiliates. The text discusses the denial of double benefits for tax credits and the option for taxpayers to elect not to apply a certain section regarding qualified evacuation expenses. The text introduces a new section regarding evacuation expenses in mandatory evacuations, with amendments applying to taxable years ending after August 29, 2008."
