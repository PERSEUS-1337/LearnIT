    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Article 3 in Chapter 6.1 of Part 28 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, establishing a statewide accountability system. The intent is to create a comprehensive accountability system that addresses various needs and standards, promotes continuous improvement, and identifies schools requiring support and intervention. The Legislature intends to establish a statewide accountability system aligned with state and federal priorities, including the local control funding formula. The system must meet federal requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, promoting continuous improvement and support for schools. The state board aligns California's local control framework with the need to support high-need schools by setting ambitious statewide standards for performance and improvement, differentiated by subgroup to comply with federal law. Establish a mechanism to differentiate school performance based on outcomes for all pupils and subgroups, including identifying the lowest-performing schools and those with consistently underperforming subgroups. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for identifying schools in the lowest 5 percent based on subgroup performance, supporting parents in school decisions, and complying with federal and state requirements for school improvement activities. The curr_chunk outlines key indicators for evaluating schools, including measures of pupil achievement, academic growth, progress toward English proficiency, chronic absenteeism, and school climate for elementary and middle schools. For high schools, indicators include pupil achievement, graduation rates. The curr_chunk lists indicators for evaluating schools, including graduation rates, progress in English proficiency, college and career readiness, chronic absenteeism, and school climate. The paragraph outlines the inclusion of additional statewide measures in the accountability system for schools, emphasizing the use of evaluation rubrics and indicators for continuous improvement and providing support and intervention. In compliance with federal law, academic indicators specified in certain clauses shall carry significant weight compared to other indicators. Subgroup performance will also be given substantial weight. The California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, county superintendents of schools, and the public will use data aligned with state priorities to provide support and intervention to schools and local educational agencies. Subgroup performance will receive substantial weight in the analysis for assistance. The legislation ensures the creation of a data and reporting system for school performance displayed on an electronic platform. Stakeholders can easily access and analyze school reports, pupil performance results, and progress towards state priorities. The system aims to identify strengths and weaknesses, inequities, monitor academic achievement, and provide meaningful differentiation. The legislation aims to create a data and reporting system for school performance under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Users can access data in machine-readable formats and information will be available in the top five languages. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
