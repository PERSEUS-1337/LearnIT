    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Renewable Power for Agriculture Incentive Program Act of 2008\" and introduces a credit for farmers to offset high energy costs, promote the use of renewable energy, and lower prices for consumers. The farmer's renewable energy credit for 2008 offsets excessive fuel costs incurred for creditable fuel used in farming. Excessive fuel cost is the amount paid for fuel exceeding the adjusted base price. The adjusted base price for creditable fuel is determined based on the average price on September 6, 2004, in the region where the fuel was purchased. After 2008, the farmer's renewable energy credit is calculated by multiplying the annual fuel reduction amount by the average fuel price for eligible taxpayers. The taxpayer must demonstrate prior year credit use to be eligible for the renewable energy credit. 50% of the credit must reduce agricultural commodity prices, and 50% must substitute renewable energy for fossil fuels. The taxpayer can use the renewable energy credit to substitute electricity from renewable resources for grid electricity or increase efficiency in electricity usage for farming. The annual fuel reduction amount is defined for this purpose. The annual fuel reduction amount is the excess of creditable fuel used in farming in the preceding year over the current year. The average fuel price is the average price of the fuel in the year before the current year. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to any taxpayer who received a credit under this section in the previous year or was not involved in farming for any year after December 31, 2008. 'Creditable fuel' includes fossil fuel and electricity, to be applied separately. The farmer's renewable energy credit under section 45Q shall be applied separately to electricity and each type of fossil fuel. No credit allowed after December 31, 2013. The credit is part of the general business credit. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2008."
