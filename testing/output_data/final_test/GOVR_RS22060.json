The Sport Fish Restoration Program receives funding from the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund to grant state agencies funding based on a formula. States receive funding based on the number of licensed anglers and land/water area. Around $400 million is allocated to states annually through this program. Projects funded by the Sport Fish Restoration Program can include land acquisition, development, research, operations, maintenance, and sport fish population management. Prohibited activities are law enforcement and public relations. States must certify licensed anglers, agree not to misuse funds, and provide a 75% match for most projects.

Proposals for reauthorizing federal surface transportation programs may include an increase in the federal fuel tax to fund highway infrastructure programs.
