    "content": "Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Despite being led by an increasingly autocratic leader, the country was considered the most open and progressive in Central Asia. The United States has been interested in helping Kyrgyzstan enhance its sovereignty, increase democratic participation, bolster economic reform, strengthen human rights, and combat transnational terrorism and trafficking. The United States increased its significance in Kyrgyzstan after the 9/11 attacks, repairing and upgrading the airfield at Manas international airport for military operations in Afghanistan. The 2005 national legislative election aimed to strengthen political pluralism for a peaceful transfer of power. Many were concerned about the president's and prime minister's children running for seats. The 2005 national legislative election in Kyrgyzstan saw concerns over family members and friends of high officials running for seats. Less than half of the seats were filled initially, with run-offs held in some districts. The Central Electoral Commission announced valid results for 71 districts, with less than 10% of seats won by opposition candidates. Allegations of massive vote fraud arose, fueled by reports of serious irregularities from election observers. After opposition candidates won only two seats in the first round, protests erupted in Kyrgyzstan calling for a new election and President Akayev's resignation. Demonstrators in southern Kyrgyzstan, including a majority ethnic Uzbek community, felt discriminated against by the government dominated by northerners. Protests spread throughout the country after the March 13 run-off election. Akayev quickly convened the new legislature and urged the public to focus on the upcoming planting season. After opposition candidates won only two seats in the first round, protests erupted in Kyrgyzstan calling for a new election and President Akayev's resignation. Demonstrators blamed foreign NGOs and religious extremists for the unrest. Akayev's supporters dispersed an opposition rally on March 23, leading to thousands of angry demonstrators storming government offices. Akayev fled to Moscow as protesters released opposition leader Feliks Kulov from prison. The Kyrgyz Supreme Court recognized the former legislature as still empowered amidst chaotic legal situation. Deputies appointed Kulov to oversee security ministries and named Bakiyev acting prime minister and president. Bakiyev proposed a provisional government with opposition figures in key roles. The old legislature clashed with Bakiyev over appointments, leading him to dissolve it and support the new legislature. The Constitutional Court, Bakiyev, Kulov, and the new head of the CEC declared the new legislature as constitutionally valid. The new legislature elected Tekebayev as speaker, confirmed Bakiyev as prime minister and acting president, and scheduled a presidential election for July 10, 2005. Akayev's resignation on April 4, 2005, boosted the interim government's legitimacy. The new Kyrgyz authorities accepted Akayev's resignation and pledged to combat corruption. Bakiyev announced plans to prosecute those responsible for electoral fraud and maintain close relations with Russia and the United States. Observers are divided on Kyrgyzstan's future democratization. Some are optimistic about Kyrgyzstan's democratization due to its vibrant civil society, while others are concerned about economic challenges and social divisions between north and south. Power struggles involve pro-Akayev groups and those feeling marginalized, with ethnic issues initially less prominent. Ethnic tensions remain a concern in Kyrgyzstan despite the regime change. The opposition lacks clear policies for the country's future, and there are concerns about nepotism and corruption within the interim government. The coup involved two groups - the dispossessed and the political opposition, with the former being motivated by poverty and unemployment rather than politics. Otunbayeva highlighted that mainly poor people, not party members, stormed the government complex. The government complex was stormed by people, not party stalwarts, on March 24. Analysts warn of potential violence if economic distress is not addressed by the new government. Some believe the political opposition may have planned to oust Akayev. Bakiyev's influence has been growing, but there is tension within the opposition camp, particularly between Bakiyev and Kulov. Bakiyev seeks to expand his power base by gaining support from northern politicians. Bakiyev seeks to expand his power base by gaining support from northern politicians, potentially reducing Kulov's appeal in the north. Oppositionists may unify to support Kulov in a presidential race. Kulov is trying to woo former Akayev supporters by endorsing Akayev's immunity from prosecution. The Akyykat (Justice) political movement has been created to challenge opposition candidates in the election, raising concerns about a contentious presidential election and potential civil disorder. Disputed legislative seats may lead to further disorder if re-contested or if a new election of the whole legislature is carried out. Calls for rewriting the constitution in Kyrgyzstan to remove illegitimate changes made during Akayev-orchestrated referenda create uncertainties about the country's stability. Some observers believe the relatively bloodless March coup may lead to a peaceful transition, while others warn of potential political disorder and the rise of Islamic extremists bidding for power. The coup in Kyrgyzstan led to cooperation among ethnic groups but also criticism of the new government for favoring Kyrgyz nationalists. It defied expectations of authoritarian regimes enduring in Central Asia, causing regional opposition and unease among elites. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev faced criticism for his response to the Kyrgyz coup, with some suggesting Kazakhstan could see opposition influence due to his limited suppression of civil society. Nazarbayev took measures to prevent a similar coup, such as raising salaries and pensions, and implementing laws to restrict political rallies after elections. Opposition leader Zamanbek Nurkadilov called for Nazarbayev to step down in 2006 for a peaceful leadership transition. In late 2005, Tajikistan faces a planned presidential election where the incumbent authoritarian leader Emomali Rakhmanov is expected to win. The OSCE and Tajik opposition have criticized the government for interference in past elections. The Tajik opposition may view the 2005 presidential race as a turning point for future cooperation with the government. In Uzbekistan, the government censored news about the Kyrgyz coup, restricted public gatherings near Kyrgyzstan, and closed the border. President Islam Karimov condemned the coup harshly. The coup in Kyrgyzstan led to strained relations among Central Asian states, with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan imposing restrictions on trade and travel. Regional presidents reached out to Kyrgyzstan's interim leaders to establish working relations, despite initial tensions. Uzbek opposition leaders saw the events in Kyrgyzstan as a call to arms, but political expression is limited within Uzbekistan. The coup in Kyrgyzstan has raised concerns about the potential rise of Islamic extremists or ultra-nationalists to power, which could lead to increased discrimination and violence against ethnic minorities in the region. Islamic extremists may use a weakened Kyrgyzstan as a base to support affiliated groups in the Fergana Valley, posing threats to neighboring countries. The coup in Kyrgyzstan could lead to discrimination and violence against ethnic minorities, affecting foreign relations and water supply to neighboring countries. The change in government may result in increased efforts to combat criminal activities, potentially benefiting Afghanistan. Cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan in promoting democracy is also possible. The coup in Kyrgyzstan has led to political transformations in other Eurasian states. Russia initially criticized the opposition but later offered aid to the interim government after assurances of strategic partnership. Putin expressed regret over the unlawful means used in Kyrgyzstan but hoped to work with the new leaders. The coup in Kyrgyzstan led to concerns about Russia's regional influence and tensions in U.S.-Russia relations. Some believed the CSTO was impotent in the situation, while others in Russia accused the U.S. of meddling in Eurasia. The coup in Kyrgyzstan raised concerns about U.S. meddling in Eurasia, with authoritarian states cracking down on civil society. Belarus and Azerbaijan implemented measures to prevent opposition movements, while some saw the Kyrgyz coup as a potential for Muslim countries to challenge dictatorship. Leaders of Moldova's Transnistria and Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions expressed concerns about Russia's influence in Kyrgyzstan. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili supported the Kyrgyz coup and offered advice and support to the interim leadership, proposing Kyrgyzstan join a \"Democratic Choice Coalition\" for democratic reforms. China is concerned about the coup in Kyrgyzstan potentially leading to a more democratic country that could inspire Chinese democrats and embolden ethnic Uighurs advocating for separatism in Xinjiang. China had previously cooperated with Kyrgyzstan to combat groups like the East Turkestan Independence Movement. There were attacks on Chinese businessmen during the coup, which China fears may escalate into hate crimes. China is concerned about the coup in Kyrgyzstan leading to instability and increased crime, including attacks on Chinese businessmen. China emphasizes the need for law and order to be re-established and good neighborly relations to continue, especially in combating terrorists within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The coup raised questions in China about the effectiveness of the SCO's emergency consultation provisions. The United States had high hopes for a peaceful presidential race in late 2005 in Kyrgyzstan, focusing on civil society aid for a free and fair election. The ouster of President Akayev caught the US and observers by surprise. The US provided significant aid to Kyrgyzstan, ranking third in aid per capita among Eurasian states, supporting democratization programs and anti-terrorism efforts. The US provided significant aid to Kyrgyzstan for democratic reform, including support for political parties, media, and civic education. The estimated aid for FY2005 was $36.4 million, with a request for $35.7 million for FY2006. Opposition leaders acknowledged the helpfulness of US democracy assistance, such as participation in the International Visitors Program. Additionally, a printing press was established to print opposition newspapers. The US provided aid for democratic reform in Kyrgyzstan, including support for political parties, media, and civic education. Opposition newspapers faced obstacles but received assistance from a printing press. Ahead of the legislative race, an opposition newspaper exposed the alleged wealth of the Akayev family, leading to a power outage at the press. The US Embassy protested and provided generators until power was restored. The US Administration acknowledged the role of democratization aid in Kyrgyzstan's civil society development but denied orchestrating the coup. Secretary Rice reassured Russia that democratic movements in Eurasia are indigenous and beneficial for all countries. The US supported democratic reform in Kyrgyzstan, including aid for political parties and media. The Administration cautiously assessed the situation before the coup, urging peaceful negotiations. US Ambassador promised aid for a democratic transition, while Deputy Secretary of State endorsed a role for the OSCE in facilitating talks among pro-Akayev and opposition leaders. The US supported democratic reform in Kyrgyzstan, including aid for political parties and media. Secretary of State Rice and Deputy Secretary Zoellick expressed support for democratization in Kyrgyzstan, comparing it to other democratic movements worldwide. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld visited Kyrgyzstan to show support for democratization and security ties. Donald Rumsfeld visited Kyrgyzstan on April 14, thanking the interim leadership for their support in the Global War on Terror. The interim government pledged to continue good relations with both the United States and Russia, with some uncertainty about potential changes in the future. The interim leadership appears to support important U.S. interests in the region, with key figures like Kulov being pro-U.S. but also acknowledging the significant economic ties with Russia. Russia provides oil, so maintaining close relations with China, Russia, and the United States is important for Kyrgyzstan. The United States is upgrading its airbase at Manas to combat terrorism and drug trafficking from Afghanistan. Kyrgyzstan received requests from the United States and NATO to deploy AWACS planes at Ganci, but denied them due to commitments to the CSTO and the SCO. The interim government in Kyrgyzstan aims to maintain security ties with Russia, China, and the United States, but a more Western-oriented government may reassess these ties. Suggestions for democratic and economic transformation include creating an advisory group of international experts to make Kyrgyz politics more inclusive. However, observers caution that democratic transformation is not guaranteed and a free and fair presidential election would be a positive sign. A group of international experts is examining how Kyrgyz politics can be more inclusive of northern and southern interests and accelerate private sector economic transformation. The House Democracy Assistance Committee is considering providing technical assistance to Kyrgyzstan. The International Monetary Fund acknowledges Kyrgyzstan's progress in fiscal reforms, GDP growth, and poverty reduction, urging continued support from international financial institutions. Kurmanbek Bakiyev, former prime minister, faced blame for a government crackdown on a protest in the south and was forced to resign. Several deaths led to Kurmanbek Bakiyev's resignation in late 2004. He then became head of the opposition People's Movement of Kyrgyzstan (PMK) bloc. Azimbek Beknazarov, a nationalist leader, criticized President Akayev in 2001 and was arrested in 2002. Murtabek Imanaliyev, former foreign minister, now heads the Jany Bagyt Social and Political Movement. Feliks Kulov, head of the Ar-Namys Party, was imprisoned in 2001 on corruption charges but was released in 2005. Adakhan Madumarov, co-head of the Ata Jurt party bloc, contested the March 2005 run-off election and was declared the winner. Roza Otunbayeva, former deputy prime minister and U.N. emissary, was denied registration as a candidate in a recent legislative election. Omurbek Tekebayev, leader of the Ata Meken Party, won a legislative seat in the March 2005 run-off."
