    "content": "The \"Child Nutrition Protection Act of 1994\" may be cited as such. The Congress acknowledges instances of fraudulent activity in food purchases for school lunch and breakfast programs. Executive Order 12549 aimed to address fraud in Federal programs. The Antitrust Division has been active in recent years. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has filed numerous criminal cases against companies and individuals for bid-rigging, price-fixing, and other activities related to dairy products sold to schools or the Department of Defense. Multiple grand juries in different states are investigating similar activities, with several convictions and fines totaling around $100 million. Despite violations, some companies continue to participate in food and nutrition programs. The Comptroller General's report in March 1992 highlighted that dairy companies and individuals convicted of bid-rigging in milk contracts were still allowed to participate in school meal programs. Implementing effective educational and monitoring programs can help reduce fraud and save millions of dollars for school districts and taxpayers. The Comptroller General of the United States emphasized the effectiveness of bid-rigging awareness training in deterring collusion and saving taxpayers money. A General Accounting Office report addressed concerns about bid-rigging in the school lunch program. The National School Lunch Act is amended to include new duties for the Secretary of Agriculture regarding nonprocurement debarment. The definitions for the child nutrition program include the school lunch program, school breakfast program, special milk program, and special nutrition program for women. The child nutrition program includes various programs such as the school lunch program, school breakfast program, special milk program, special nutrition program for women, infants, and children, summer food service program for children, and child and adult care food program. A contractor is a person who provides goods or services for a child nutrition program, while a local agency is authorized to operate such programs at the local level. The child nutrition program includes various programs like school lunch, breakfast, special milk, and summer food service. A contractor provides goods or services, while a local agency operates programs at the local level. Nonprocurement debarment bars individuals from federal assistance programs. Assistance is provided to prevent fraud and anticompetitive activities. The Secretary must cooperate with authorities to prevent fraud in child nutrition programs and initiate debarment proceedings within 180 days of notification. The Secretary must cooperate to prevent fraud in child nutrition programs and initiate debarment proceedings against contractors who violate regulations or are found guilty in criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings related to supplying products to local agencies or the Federal government. The Secretary must initiate debarment proceedings against contractors involved in anticompetitive activities, fraud, breach of contract, false claims, or obstruction of justice in child nutrition programs. If further investigation is needed, the Secretary may extend the time to make a decision on debarment up to an additional 180 days. Debarment of a contractor in child nutrition programs will be for a minimum of 3 years after initiating nonprocurement debarment proceedings. Debarment in child nutrition programs lasts a minimum of 3 years, with a 5-year debarment for repeat offenses. Contractors are barred from providing goods or services in these programs during the debarment period. The Secretary has the authority to reverse, reduce, or grant exceptions to a debarment decision in child nutrition programs if there is good cause. The Secretary must provide information to congressional committees upon request regarding these decisions. Debarment under this section does not diminish other authorities. The Secretary can impose penalties, including debarment, but it does not limit the authority of other government agencies or courts to take action in civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings. The Secretary will issue necessary regulations. Mandatory debarment proceedings will be initiated unless it negatively impacts competition or local agencies. The Secretary can impose penalties, including debarment, if it is deemed necessary. Debarment may not be pursued if it hinders a local agency's ability to procure essential products for a child nutrition program, is unfair to entities not involved in the improper activity, or is not in the public interest. Contractors facing nonprocurement debarment must exhaust all administrative procedures before seeking judicial review. The Secretary can present information to congressional committees on anticompetitive activities, fraud, and waivers. Section 25(c) of the National School Lunch Act does not apply retroactively to causes for debarment. The Secretary of Agriculture must report on the feasibility of a consistent debarment policy within 120 days of the Act's enactment. This policy would apply to federal acquisition and nonprocurement regulations. Additionally, the Act ensures that the authority to debar or suspend individuals from federal financial and nonfinancial assistance remains intact. The Secretary of Agriculture's authority to debar or suspend individuals from federal financial and nonfinancial assistance will not be reduced by the Act. The Secretary can continue to debar or suspend individuals for specified causes as outlined in regulations."
