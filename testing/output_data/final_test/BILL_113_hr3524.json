    "content": "The Act titled \"Economic Recovery On-the-Job Training Act of 2013\" introduces on-the-job training for economically disadvantaged areas, amending the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to include training for extremely economically disadvantaged areas. The Act defines economically disadvantaged and extremely economically disadvantaged areas based on median household income. Grants are available for training programs in these areas. The Secretary will provide grants to State and local boards for adult on-the-job training in economically disadvantaged and extremely economically disadvantaged areas. 25% more funds will be allocated to extremely economically disadvantaged areas compared to economically disadvantaged areas. The Secretary will provide grants to State and local boards for adult on-the-job training in economically disadvantaged areas. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local board must submit an application containing required information. The Secretary may allow higher reimbursement of wage rates based on factors such as employer size and target populations with barriers to employment. The Secretary may allocate up to 1% of funds for program administration, management, and oversight, including evaluating and sharing lessons learned. The local board receiving a grant must allocate 5% of funds to the State for specific functions. This section does not impact the implementation of subtitle B activities funded through section 137 appropriations. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 and beyond. For areas not within census tracts, equivalent county divisions will be used to determine median household income. The median annual household income is amended in the table of contents of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Sec. 173B outlines on-the-job training programs for economically disadvantaged areas."
