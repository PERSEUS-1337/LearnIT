    "content": "The Act titled \"Advanced Cable Deployment Authorization Act of 2009\" supports qualified advanced electric transmission manufacturing plants, high efficiency transmission property, and advanced electric transmission property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include support for qualified advanced electric transmission manufacturing plants and high efficiency transmission property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to support advanced electric transmission technology utilizing superconductive materials or other advanced technology capable of transmitting at least 5 gigawatts of energy for distances greater than 300 miles with energy losses not exceeding 3 percent. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 supports advanced electric transmission technology with energy losses not exceeding 3 percent, no electromagnetic field creation, approval by energy regulatory body, safe underground location, and exclusion of certain properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 supports advanced electric transmission technology with energy losses not exceeding 3 percent, no electromagnetic field creation, approval by energy regulatory body, safe underground location, and exclusion of properties placed in service after December 31, 2016. Qualified high efficiency transmission property includes high voltage overhead electric transmission lines, related substations, or integrated facilities utilizing advanced conductor core technology determined by the Secretary of Energy as likely to become commercially viable within 10 years of enactment. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 supports advanced electric transmission technology with energy losses not exceeding 3 percent, no electromagnetic field creation, approval by energy regulatory body, safe underground location, and exclusion of properties placed in service after December 31, 2016. Qualified high efficiency transmission property includes high voltage overhead electric transmission lines up to 765kV with power losses at least 30 percent lower than conventional ACSR conductors, determined to be in the public interest and eligible for regulated rates. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 supports advanced electric transmission technology with energy losses not exceeding 3 percent, no electromagnetic field creation, approval by energy regulatory body, safe underground location, and exclusion of properties placed in service after December 31, 2016. Qualified high efficiency transmission property includes high voltage overhead electric transmission lines up to 765kV with power losses at least 30 percent lower than conventional ACSR conductors, determined to be in the public interest and eligible for regulated rates. The term 'qualified advanced electric transmission manufacturing plant' refers to any industrial facility in the US that can produce qualified advanced electric transmission property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 now allows for additional loan guarantee authority for the development, construction, or retrofitting of qualified advanced electric transmission manufacturing plants or properties. The Secretary of Energy is also authorized to provide grants for up to 50 percent of costs incurred in connection with these projects. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes grants for up to 50 percent of costs incurred in developing qualified advanced electric transmission properties. A maximum of $100,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2010, with no ownership interest taken by the United States in the funded projects."
