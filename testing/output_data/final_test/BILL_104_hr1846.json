The Congress finds that Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 as the world's first national park, designated as a World Heritage Site, and the Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area was designated in 1978 to protect certain lands. Additionally, a 20.5 mile segment of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River was designated in 1990 as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System in Wyoming. Henderson Mountain and certain lands of the Beartooth Mountains, located near Yellowstone National Park, Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area, and Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, have important recreational, ecological, and historical values. Mining activities have degraded the area's resources, posing a threat to its natural beauty and wildlife. Mining activities pose a significant threat to the resource values of Henderson Mountain, the Beartooth Mountains, Yellowstone National Park, Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area, and Clarks Fork National Wild and Scenic River. It is crucial to protect these lands from further degradation. The Yellowstone Headwaters National Recreation Area is established within the Gallatin and Custer National Forests in Montana to protect resources and adjacent areas like Yellowstone National Park. The area includes lands, waters, and interests depicted on a specific map for public inspection. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to make minor revisions in the boundary of the Yellowstone Headwaters National Recreation Area to improve management efficiency. Notice of any revisions must be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary will administer the recreation area in accordance with applicable laws and may use statutory authority for wildlife conservation. A management plan must be developed within 3 years to reflect the establishment of the recreation area. The Secretary will administer the recreation area in accordance with applicable laws and may use statutory authority for wildlife conservation. A management plan must be developed within 3 years to reflect the establishment of the recreation area, including measures to maintain traditional recreational activities like hunting and fishing. The Secretary shall permit hunting and fishing on lands and waters within the recreation area in accordance with Federal and State law, with the ability to designate zones and establish periods where such activities are not permitted for various reasons. Regulations issued by the Secretary for the recreation area must be consulted with State agencies responsible for hunting and fishing activities. The Secretary is directed to acquire lands within the recreation area for the purposes of this Act through donation, purchase, or exchange. Lands owned by the State of Montana can only be acquired by donation or exchange. Additionally, regulations for the recreation area must be coordinated with State agencies responsible for hunting and fishing activities. After the enactment of this Act, lands within the recreation area are withdrawn from mining claims, mineral leasing, geothermal leasing, and disposal of mineral materials. No patents will be issued after June 14, 1995, for any location or claim in the recreation area under the mining laws of the United States. Federal lands cannot be used in connection with these activities. (c) Prohibition.--No Federal lands within the recreation area may be used for mining activities. Reclamation requirements must be met for any mining-related activity that disturbs the land or water, ensuring restoration to a condition similar to premining state. The Secretary of Agriculture must review all unpatented mining claims in the area within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of the Interior will promptly determine the validity of contestable claims in agriculture. No permits for mining activities can be issued within the recreation area until previous environmental damage has been remediated according to Federal and State requirements. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the purposes of this Act."
