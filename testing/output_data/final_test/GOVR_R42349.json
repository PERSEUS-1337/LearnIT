    "content": "Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the government recognized the need for new medical countermeasures to combat chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) agents. The pharmaceutical industry cited the lack of a profitable market for CBRN treatments due to their infrequent occurrence. In response, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act in 2004, allocating $5.6 billion for CBRN countermeasures from FY2004 to FY2013. Subsequent Congresses have reviewed the progress of Project BioShield. The 109th Congress created BARDA and the position of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in HHS through PAHPA. The 112th Congress is evaluating Project BioShield-related policy questions, including the program's efficiency and performance. Congressional policymakers are considering changes to funding levels and mechanisms for providing Project BioShield funds. Congressional policymakers are evaluating the federal government's coordination of CBRN countermeasure efforts and potential changes to emergency use authority. Various acts such as the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2011 address these issues. The report will discuss the authorities established by the Project BioShield Act of 2004. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 established authorities, discussed appropriations, identified medical countermeasures, reviewed the relationship with BARDA, and current legislation. President Bush proposed it in 2003, and the 108th Congress passed it in 2004. It has provisions for government-market guarantees and purchasing countermeasures in development. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 established authorities for government-market guarantees and purchasing countermeasures in development. It allows the HHS Secretary to temporarily approve emergency use of countermeasures without FDA approval and provides expedited procedures for CBRN terrorism-related spending. Companies developing new CBRN countermeasures may face challenges in predicting government demand and pricing. The Project BioShield Act guarantees government purchases of new CBRN countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile. Contracts can be made up to eight years in advance for products deemed a threat to national security. This ensures a minimum economic value for companies developing these products. The Project BioShield Act allows milestone-based payments for countermeasures, reducing market and development risks for companies. HHS can purchase unapproved products with sufficient clinical data to support their effectiveness. The Project BioShield Act allows milestone-based payments for countermeasures, reducing market and development risks for companies. HHS can purchase unapproved products with sufficient clinical data to support their effectiveness, potentially leading to FDA approval within eight years. Critics argue that the government may end up buying countermeasures that never get approved, but the act has provisions to mitigate financial risks, such as lower costs for unapproved products and milestone payments. The FDA's standard approval processes protect against ineffective or dangerous treatments. The Project BioShield Act allows emergency use authorizations for unapproved medical products during emergencies. These authorizations require the HHS Secretary to determine the product's effectiveness, risks, and lack of alternatives. EUAs last for one year and can be renewed. The HHS Secretary has issued several EUAs for emergency medical products, including anthrax vaccine for Department of Defense personnel and countermeasures for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Two active EUAs permit the distribution of antibiotic kits and doxycycline hyclate to prevent inhalational anthrax. The Project BioShield Act allows for expedited procurement procedures by HHS for CBRN countermeasure research and development. It increases the maximum contract amount to $25 million and authorizes simplified acquisition procedures. HHS used this authority for five contracts totaling $30 million in 2004 and 2005. The Act authorizes the HHS Secretary to use an expedited peer review award process for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements related to CBRN countermeasure R&D, limited to awards worth $1.5 million or less. Some scientists are concerned that this expedited process may reduce research quality compared to the normal peer review process, which typically takes 9 to 17 months for funding. NIAID funded 5 contracts and 55 grants using expedited peer review between 2004 and 2008, with awards funded between 3 and 9 months after review. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 requires the HHS Secretary to report annually to Congress on the use of expedited procurement and grant procedures for emergency use of unapproved products. GAO published reports in July 2009 recommending actions to address deficiencies in the Act. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 authorized up to $5.593 billion for procuring countermeasures from FY2004 through FY2013. The funds were appropriated into a special reserve fund by the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004. These funds were designated for the procurement of CBRN countermeasures. The Project BioShield account is designated for the procurement of CBRN countermeasures using Project BioShield authorities. Congress has the power to adjust the funding in the special reserve fund through rescission, transfer, or additional appropriation. Funds have been transferred and removed from this account for various purposes. In 2009 and 2010, funds were transferred to BARDA for countermeasure development and pandemic preparedness. In 2011, additional funds were allocated for countermeasure development. In 2012, more funds were transferred to BARDA for advanced development and administrative costs. President Obama had requested even more funding for BARDA. In 2013, $665 million was allocated to BARDA for countermeasure development, with an additional $100 million for a strategic investment corporation. However, Congress did not approve the transfer for the corporation. President Obama requested transferring up to $415 million from Project BioShield to BARDA for advanced development. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 provided for a transfer of up to $202 million to BARDA. HHS awarded contracts for 10 medical countermeasures under Project BioShield, focusing on CBRN threats like anthrax and smallpox. Project BioShield focuses on acquiring countermeasures for CBRN threats like anthrax, smallpox, botulinum toxin, and radiological/nuclear agents. Contracts include vaccines, antibodies, antivirals, and chemical compounds. The first contract was with VaxGen, Inc. for 75 million doses of anthrax vaccine, valued at $879 million. Subsequent contracts include $691 million for 29 million doses of anthrax vaccine from Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. and $334 million for 65,000 doses of another anthrax vaccine. Project BioShield has acquired various countermeasures for CBRN threats, including anthrax, smallpox, botulinum toxin, and radioactive agents. Contracts have been awarded for vaccines, antibodies, antivirals, and chemical compounds. This includes purchases such as $505 million for 20 million doses of a new smallpox vaccine, $433 million for an antiviral treatment for smallpox, and $476 million for botulinum antitoxin. Additionally, funds were allocated for treatments for radioactive iodine exposure and internal radioactive contamination. In FY2013, HHS plans to use remaining Project BioShield funds to replace expiring anthrax treatments and smallpox vaccine currently in the SNS and to acquire countermeasures against radiological, nuclear, and chemical threat agents. HHS may add products lacking FDA approval to the SNS through Project BioShield, such as Anthrax Immune Globulin, MVA smallpox vaccine, ST-246, and botulinum antitoxin. Congressional policymakers have scrutinized the implementation and effectiveness of the Project BioShield Act since its enactment. Congress created BARDA in 2006 to manage and fund the development of CBRN countermeasures. BARDA, under the Office of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, contracts with companies to develop and commercialize these countermeasures. Funding for BARDA comes from annual appropriations into the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund. BARDA focuses on developing countermeasures that are not yet mature enough for Project BioShield acquisition. BARDA manages Project BioShield acquisition contracts for countermeasure development and commercialization. HHS can contribute to all phases of development, coordinated by the PHEMCE. The federal government has successfully used the Project BioShield Act authorities to contribute to national preparedness for a CBRN attack and pandemic influenza. Recommendations for further improving federal medical countermeasure development and acquisition have been made by various groups. The 112th Congress is considering reauthorizing and modifying Project BioShield, including the acquisition mechanism and emergency use of medical countermeasures. Congress funded Project BioShield acquisitions through FY2013, prompting a decision on reauthorization and additional appropriations. Congressional policymakers may choose to extend the program with or without modifications, potentially changing the amount appropriated for acquisitions. Congressional policymakers may choose to let Project BioShield lapse due to the limited protection provided by medical countermeasures acquired, which only cover a portion of the population and require regular replacement. The potential benefits of Project BioShield may not justify its continuation. Policymakers in the 112th Congress are considering extending the Project BioShield acquisition authority through bills such as H.R. 2405, H.R. 6672, and S. 1855. Congress initially provided $5.6 billion for 10 years, but HHS has been obligating funds at a slower pace, averaging $290 million annually. Since 2001, HHS has spent over $15 billion on biodefense research and countermeasure development. Congressional policymakers may decrease, maintain, or increase the average annual appropriation for Project BioShield acquisitions based on factors such as potential increase in eligible countermeasures. Congress may consider changing the method of providing appropriations for Project BioShield, potentially establishing a multiyear, advance-funded account dedicated to countermeasure procurement. While advance funding was intended to assure stable funding for developers, these funds have been subject to the annual appropriations process, with a significant portion rescinded or transferred by subsequent Congresses. Policymakers may consider altering how Project BioShield funds are allocated, possibly shifting to annual appropriations. However, developers argue that a multiyear advance-funded account is crucial for countermeasure development. The uncertainty in this process leads to fluctuating acquisition opportunities. In some years, significant funds may be allocated for countermeasures, while in others, no money may be obligated. Developers of Project BioShield contracts may prefer advance appropriations for multiple years to aid in planning acquisition programs. However, providing a 10-year advance appropriation in the current fiscal environment may be challenging. Congress could balance these concerns by allocating funds for longer than 2 years but less than 10. Project BioShield is part of the federal effort to research, develop, and acquire countermeasures for civilian use, including risk assessment, strategic planning, and countermeasure distribution. The Institute of Medicine and the National Biodefense Science Board recommended better coordination and management to increase the pace of countermeasure development. In 2009, HHS Secretary Sebelius ordered a review of countermeasure development for public health threats, including CBRN agents. The review recommended creating a private strategic investment corporation to support small companies developing technologies for medical countermeasures, modeled after In-Q-Tel. Congress rejected the proposal in FY2011 and FY2012. President Obama has requested the establishment of a new corporation funded by $50 million in new budget authority in FY2013 to serve the intelligence community's needs. A review by HHS recommended creating a centralized decision-making body and a new position, the Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Development Leader, to improve the medical countermeasure decision-making process. The HHS is working to coordinate and integrate medical countermeasure development efforts, including implementing a five-year budget-planning system. Progress has been made in implementing recommendations, but challenges remain. The Project BioShield Act allows emergency use of unapproved countermeasures, but legal restrictions may hinder emergency planning and response. The 112th Congress is considering related policy options in various bills. The current law allows HHS to issue Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for actual ongoing public health, military, or domestic emergencies. However, there is uncertainty for stakeholders as EUAs are not issued for potential public health emergencies. This complicates countermeasure pre-positioning programs and the FDA finds the EUA process too unwieldy for broader application. Modifying the EUA authority is being considered to address these challenges. The 112th Congress is considering legislation to modify the Emergency Use Authority for FDA approved countermeasures during emergencies. Bills such as H.R. 2405, H.R. 6672, and S. 1855 aim to improve response and planning activities at federal, state, tribal, and local levels. The House passed several bills related to biosecurity and emergency preparedness, including the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2405) and the WMD Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2011 (H.R. 2356). These bills would extend the Project BioShield procurement program, modify the countermeasure development process, and authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2014-2018. H.R. 2405 authorizes appropriations of $2.8 billion for five fiscal years, grants the HHS Secretary authority to use up to $840 million for BARDA countermeasure activities, and requires formal planning and reporting. It also authorizes $415 million annually for BARDA through FY2016 and mandates a comprehensive 5-year budget analysis for countermeasure activities. H.R. 2405 mandates the ASPR to develop an annual Countermeasure Implementation Plan for CBRN threats, evaluate progress on countermeasure activities, prioritize needs, report BioShield fund amount, and address pediatric countermeasures. It also repeals reporting requirements and modifies aspects of HHS emergency use. H.R. 2405 would modify HHS emergency use authority for medical countermeasures, allowing the Secretary to issue an EUA based on a significant potential for a public health emergency. All EUAs would expire when the emergency no longer exists, and the Secretary could modify active EUAs and waive manufacturing process requirements during emergencies. The bill also allows mass dispensing of approved countermeasures without individual prescriptions and pre-positioning of unapproved countermeasures for emergencies. The Senate passed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act Reauthorization of 2011 (S. 1855) on March 7, 2012, extending the Project BioShield procurement program to FY2018 and authorizing appropriations of $2.8 billion for five fiscal years. The bill would affect Project BioShield implementation, change the countermeasures development process, and modify the emergency use authority. The Senate passed S. 1855, extending Project BioShield to FY2018 with $2.8 billion in appropriations. The bill allows for development costs in procurement contracts, extends contract signing to 10 years before delivery, reauthorizes BARDA, and requires a biennial strategy plan for countermeasure activities. The Senate passed S. 1855, extending Project BioShield to FY2018 with $2.8 billion in appropriations. The bill requires the HHS Secretary to develop a coordinated five-year budget plan for all activities related to the Public Health and Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Strategy and Implementation Plan, including identifying countermeasure life-cycle costs and measurable outputs. Additionally, the bill authorizes BARDA to partner with a private non-profit corporation. S. 1855 authorizes BARDA to partner with a private non-profit corporation to accelerate the development of medical countermeasures using venture capital practices. It also modifies HHS emergency use authority for medical countermeasures, allowing EUAs to expire when the emergency circumstances no longer exist. S. 1855 allows the Secretary to modify active EUAs, waive manufacturing process requirements, and issue EUAs for countermeasures against agents posing a national security threat. It also permits pre-positioning of unapproved medical countermeasures. The House passed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2012 (H.R. 6672) on December 19, 2012. This bill extends the Project BioShield procurement program to FY2018 and authorizes $2.8 billion for five fiscal years. It grants the HHS Secretary authority to use up to $1.4 billion for BARDA countermeasure advanced development activities. H.R. 6672 extends Project BioShield procurement program to FY2018, authorizing $2.8 billion over five years. It allows contracts to include development costs and be signed up to 10 years before delivery. The bill requires the HHS Secretary to report to Congress when the special reserve fund drops below $1.5 billion. BARDA would receive $415 million annually for countermeasure development activities through FY2017. The HHS ASPR must develop a coordinated five-year budget plan for countermeasure advancement. H.R. 6672 mandates the ASPR to create a five-year budget plan for countermeasure activities, including developing and providing an annual strategy and implementation plan to Congress. The plan must address CBRN threats, efforts to develop countermeasures, progress in research, procurement, and deployment, as well as identifying and prioritizing countermeasure needs. It must also include advanced development and procurement awards, timelines, metrics, stakeholder input, and progress in meeting countermeasure needs for at-risk individuals. H.R. 6672 would modify aspects of the HHS emergency use authority for medical countermeasures, allowing the Secretary to issue an EUA in response to a public health emergency. The bill would also change the expiration criteria for EUAs and grant the Secretary the ability to modify active EUAs and waive certain manufacturing requirements during emergencies. H.R. 6672 and S. 1855 would allow the HHS Secretary to issue an EUA for medical countermeasures in response to a public health emergency, regardless of a material threat determination. The bills also permit the pre-positioning of unapproved countermeasures by government entities and mass dispensing of approved products during emergencies without individual prescriptions. The WMD Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2011 (H.R. 2356) introduced changes to the countermeasure development process, creating a new White House position for coordinating federal biodefense policy. This bill requires the President to appoint a Special Assistant for Biodefense to advise on policy coordination and develop related plans. The Special Assistant to the President for Biodefense would lead the development of a National Biodefense Plan, including prevention, protection, response, and recovery activities. This plan would address biological risks, define activities, identify capability gaps, and coordinate federal, state, local, and tribal authorities. Additionally, the Special Assistant would develop an annual cross-cutting biodefense budget analysis. The submission of an annual cross-cutting biodefense budget analysis would detail account level amounts for biodefense activities supporting the National Biodefense Plan. It would cover budgets of various departments and require DHS to reassess CBRN agents for eligibility under Project BioShield."
