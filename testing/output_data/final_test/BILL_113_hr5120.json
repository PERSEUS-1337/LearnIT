This includes evaluating the Technology Transfer Coordinator's role and effectiveness, along with proposing policy and legislative changes to enhance technology transfer to the private sector.\n\nSEC. 103. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Congress acknowledges the importance of the independent Commission to Review the Effectiveness of the National Energy Laboratories in developing a strategy for the National Laboratories. Congress anticipates receiving the Commission's findings and aims to work with the Administration to enhance the mission and modernize the operations of the National Laboratories. The Secretary is urged to support the National Laboratories. The Secretary should encourage National Laboratories and research centers to inform small businesses of opportunities and resources under this Act. Title II introduces the Agreement for Commercializing Technology Pilot Program under SEC. 201. The Secretary will implement the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program for National Laboratories, allowing increased authority for contractors to negotiate terms like intellectual property rights and payment structures. Eligibility extends to any National Laboratory director for entering into agreements with non-federal entities. The Secretary will allow National Laboratory directors to enter agreements with non-Federal entities, with funding used solely for Federal award purposes. The Bayh-Dole Act applies if the agreement is a funding agreement and one party is eligible for rights under that chapter.
