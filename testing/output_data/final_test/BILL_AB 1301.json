    "title": "AB 1301",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 5 of Division 0.5 of the Elections Code introduces State Preclearance, defining terms like \"Citizen,\" \"Citizen voting-age population,\" \"Covered political subdivision,\" and \"Electoral jurisdiction.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to multilingual voting materials, political subdivisions, protected classes, and voting locations. To prevent voter discrimination based on race, color, or language minority status, voting laws affecting at-large elections or electoral boundaries changes must comply with this chapter. A change through redistricting that alters district boundaries in an electoral jurisdiction where a protected class has seen a significant population increase, as determined by the US Census. Additionally, any changes to multilingual voting materials that reduce non-English options or alter distribution methods must comply with voting laws to prevent discrimination. If a covered political subdivision enacts a voting-related law different from the current one, it must be approved by the Secretary of State before taking effect. The Secretary of State must provide a written decision to the governing body of a covered political subdivision within 60 days of a request for a voting-related law. If no decision is given, the subdivision can implement the law. An expedited review can be requested if there is a need for a quick decision. The governing body of a covered political subdivision must prove that any voting-related law is not discriminatory or motivated by intent to reduce voter participation from a protected class. If the Secretary of State denies a request, the subdivision can seek review in court. The Secretary of State can also take legal action to stop implementation of a violating law. Venue for actions under subdivision (d) or (e) is exclusively in Sacramento County Superior Court. A covered political subdivision can enact voting-related laws different from existing ones due to unexpected circumstances before an election, but must seek approval from the Secretary of State after the election. The Attorney General or a registered voter in a covered political subdivision can file a court action to enforce voting-related obligations. The court may enjoin voting laws unless approved by specified procedures. Data from the US Census Bureau is not subject to court challenge. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
