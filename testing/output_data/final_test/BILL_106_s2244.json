    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Working Families Trade Bonus Act\" and involves amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. Exports have been a significant part of the US economy, accounting for over 10% of the GDP in recent years. Export growth has contributed to more than a third of overall economic growth between 1987 and 1997, creating millions of jobs. The rapid growth of international trade compared to the economy since 1950 necessitates domestic policy measures to ensure American workers benefit from globalization. The purpose of this Act is to ensure American workers benefit directly from international trade by sharing in the economic growth and profits generated by globalization. TITLE I--TRADE BONUS\n\nSEC. 101. DETERMINATION AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF TRADE BONUS. The Secretary of Commerce determines if international trade contributed to the US GDP each year. The determination must be submitted to the President by June 1 of the following year. The President includes this determination in the budget summary for the next fiscal year. The Secretary of Commerce determines if international trade contributed to the US GDP each year and submits the determination to the President by June 1. The President includes this determination in the budget for the following fiscal year. TITLE II--PROVISIONS TO ENSURE WORKERS SHARE IN TRADE BONUS\n\nSEC. 201. UNITED STATES POLICY ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE BONUS. The United States policy aims to ensure that workers benefit from the increase in GDP due to international trade by encouraging the establishment or expansion of employee stock purchase plans and additional contributions to retirement plans. Employers should contribute up to $2,000 per employee to employee stock purchase plans, while workers can contribute up to $2,000 to individual retirement plans. Guidelines state that employers should allow employees to purchase additional stock up to $2,000, make the plan available to all employees without discrimination, and allow for the purchase of the maximum amount of stock at the lowest price allowed by law. Employees should be allowed to purchase additional stock up to $2,000 at the lowest price allowed by law, and the establishment or expansion of employee stock purchase plans should provide additional compensation to employees without affecting the diversification of their assets, especially retirement assets. SEC. 202 eliminates capital gains tax on stock acquired through employee stock purchase plans. SEC. 202 exempts employees from including gain from the sale of stock acquired through trade bonus stock options in their gross income. Trade bonus stock options are defined as options granted under an employee stock purchase plan following a determined trade bonus percentage. Under the Working Families Trade Bonus Act, employees can designate trade bonus stock options with an annual limitation of $2,000 in stock value. Conforming amendments include changes to maximum capital gains rates and modifications related to gain exclusions. Amendments are made to various sections of the tax code, including modifications related to net operating loss deduction, adjustments, distributable net income, coordination with capital gain provisions, and capital gains of aliens present in the United States. These changes involve inserting references to sections 1203 in addition to 1202. Amendments to the tax code include inserting references to section 1203 after section 1202. The amendments made by section 1203 provide an exclusion for gain from stock acquired through an employee stock purchase plan. This applies to stock acquired on and after the enactment date of the Act. Additionally, section 203 allows trade bonus contributions to individual retirement plans. The amendment allows for an increase in the deduction amount for eligible individuals in trade bonus years by $2,000 for taxable years following a determination of a trade bonus under the Working Families Trade Bonus Act. Eligible individuals are those who are not eligible to receive a trade bonus. The amendment increases the deduction amount for eligible individuals in trade bonus years by $2,000 for taxable years following a determination of a trade bonus under the Working Families Trade Bonus Act. Eligible individuals are those who are not eligible to receive a trade bonus stock option. Amendments to various sections adjust the dollar amounts accordingly. Section 408(p)(8) is amended to change the dollar amount to match section 219(b)(1)(A). These amendments will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2000. SEC. 204. CREDIT FOR SMALL EMPLOYER STOCK PURCHASE PLAN START-UP COSTS. An amendment adds a new section for a small employer stock purchase plan credit. The small employer stock purchase plan credit allows eligible employers to claim a credit for qualified start-up costs incurred during the taxable year. The credit is limited to 50% of the costs or specific dollar amounts for the first three taxable years after establishing the plan. The term 'eligible employer' refers to an employer with 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation from the employer in the preceding year. This definition excludes employers who established a qualified stock purchase plan in the three taxable years before the first year the credit is available. Qualified start-up costs are expenses incurred by an eligible employer in establishing a qualified stock purchase plan for employees, including providing educational information about the plan. Services related to retirement are not included in this definition. The term 'qualified stock purchase plan' refers to an employee stock purchase plan that allows employers to designate options as trade bonus stock options, limits the amount of options per employee to $2,000 per year, and does not favor highly compensated employees. The term 'qualified stock purchase plan' is defined as an employee stock purchase plan under section 423(b). Special rules include aggregation of employers under certain sections and disallowance of deductions for qualified start-up costs if a credit is claimed. Taxpayers can elect not to claim the credit for a taxable year. The small employer stock purchase plan credit is part of the general business credit, available to eligible employers defined in section 45D(c). A portion of the credit may be refundable for small employer pension plans. The small employer stock purchase plan credit under subsection (b)(13) increases aggregate credits allowed under subpart C by the lesser of the credit without the limitation under paragraph (1) or the increase if the limitation under paragraph (1) were raised by the taxpayer's applicable payroll taxes for the year. The credit allowed under this paragraph reduces the credit allowed under this section for the taxable year. Applicable payroll taxes include taxes on compensation paid by the taxpayer during the year. The text discusses a credit that reduces taxes on self-employment income and amounts received by the taxpayer. It also mentions agreements regarding foreign affiliates and a conforming amendment to the tax code. The amendments made by this section apply to costs paid or incurred in connection with qualified stock purchase plans established after the date of the enactment of this Act."
