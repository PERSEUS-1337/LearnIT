The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to include a definition for \"eligible high hazard potential dam\" as a non-Federal dam classified as high hazard potential by the State dam safety agency with an approved emergency action plan. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines an \"eligible high hazard potential dam\" as a non-Federal dam classified as high hazard potential by the State dam safety agency with an approved emergency action plan. The term excludes licensed hydroelectric dams and dams built under the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"non-Federal sponsor\" includes entities receiving assistance under section 8A. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines \"rehabilitation\" as the repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. Additionally, a program for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams is added to the Act. \"Section 8A addresses the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams.\" The Administrator will establish a program within FEMA to provide grants for rehabilitating high hazard potential dams. Grants can be used for repair, removal, or other measures. Non-Federal sponsors can apply for grants by submitting an application meeting specified requirements. The Administrator may make a grant for rehabilitating high hazard potential dams to non-Federal sponsors who submit an application meeting specified requirements. A project grant agreement will be established to outline the terms of the grant and project. The Administrator requires a non-Federal sponsor to provide assurance for dam maintenance during its expected life. Grants under this section are limited to 12.5% of total funds or $7,500,000. Grants must be approved by the State dam safety agency and involve cost-sharing. The assistance provided for projects under this section requires a non-Federal cost-sharing of at least 35%. The total funds for each fiscal year are distributed equally among states with project applications and based on need. The funds provided under this section are distributed among states based on the number of eligible high hazard potential dams in each state. The funds cannot be used to rehabilitate a Federal dam, perform routine maintenance, or modify a dam for hydroelectric power production. The funds provided under this section are distributed among states based on the number of eligible high hazard potential dams in each state. Grants can be used for specific purposes such as modifying a dam for hydroelectric power production, increasing water supply storage capacity, or making other modifications that do not improve dam safety. Non-Federal sponsors receiving grants must ensure that contracts and subcontracts for various services are awarded in accordance with specific requirements. The section authorizes $60,000,000 for fiscal years 2017 through 2027 for contracts awarded under specific qualifications-based requirements, without conferring proprietary interest to the United States. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must issue a proposed rule within 90 days and a final rule within 150 days regarding amendments to the National Dam Safety Program Act."
