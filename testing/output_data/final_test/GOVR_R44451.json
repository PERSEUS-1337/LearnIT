Recent international negotiations and domestic policy developments have brought attention to current and projected U.S. GHG emissions. The United States pledged in 2015 to reduce GHG emissions by 26%-28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels as part of the Paris Agreement. The Obama Administration pledged to reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. U.S. involvement in the Paris Agreement is uncertain, with reports suggesting President Trump may withdraw. The fate of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which aimed to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants, is also uncertain. The fate of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is uncertain due to ongoing litigation and President Trump's Executive Order directing EPA to review and potentially revise or repeal the rule. The Supreme Court stayed the rule in 2016, and its enforceability is currently in question. This raises concerns about the deadlines for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The report examines recent trends in U.S. GHG emissions, focusing on CO2 emissions from electricity generation and the factors influencing emission levels in that sector. It also explores how the implementation (or lack thereof) of the Clean Power Plan may impact CO2 emissions from power plants. The report analyzes U.S. GHG emissions trends, particularly CO2 emissions from electricity generation. It discusses the impact of the Clean Power Plan on power plant emissions and challenges in projecting CO2 emissions. Emissions fluctuated but have not exceeded 2009 levels, with 2015 levels similar to those in 1994. The United States is making progress towards its 2020 emission goals, with 2015 GHG levels 11% below 2005 levels. Forecasting future emissions is complex, with the Energy Information Administration providing various projections in its Annual Energy Outlook publications. The Reference case projection assumes trend improvement in known technologies and economic and demographic trends. Actual CO2 emissions have remained below past projections, with recent projections indicating flat or declining emissions over the next decade. Over the next decade, GHG emissions in the United States come from various sources like power plants, vehicles, households, and industrial facilities. In 2015, 77% of total U.S. GHG emissions were from CO2 generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. Recent legislative proposals focus on reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, with the electric power sector contributing 35% of these emissions. The residential, commercial, and industrial sectors contribute to CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Reduction programs target electricity generation due to its significant emissions. U.S. electricity generation increased until 2007, then decreased, mirroring CO2 emission trends. In 2010, CO2 emissions from electricity generation decoupled from generation levels. By 2016, electricity generation was similar to 2005 levels, while CO2 emissions were 25% lower. Factors contributing to the emission decrease include the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, with the largest GDP decrease in 2009. The recent decrease in CO2 emissions from electricity generation was influenced by changes in the generation portfolio. Different sources produce varying levels of CO2 emissions per unit of electricity, with natural gas emitting less than coal and petroleum. The U.S. electricity generation portfolio has shifted significantly between 2005 and 2016, with coal-fired generation decreasing by 38% and natural gas increasing by 81%. This change has had a considerable impact on CO2 emissions from the electricity sector, affecting total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Between 2005 and 2016, natural gas surpassed coal in electricity generation, with a 81% increase. Renewable energy generation also saw a significant rise, increasing by 254%. Petroleum-fired generation, on the other hand, decreased by 87%. Technological advances, such as directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing, played a key role in the increase of natural gas production levels. The annual price of natural gas dropped by 60% between 2005 and 2015, while coal prices increased by 40% during the same period. This shift in fuel prices has influenced power generation economics, leading to natural gas displacing coal in certain regions. Wind power generation increased significantly, with a 13-fold increase between 2005 and 2016, surpassing solar generation by a large margin. Wood fuel generation remained relatively constant, while other renewable sources also saw an increase in usage. The increase in \"other\" renewable sources, particularly landfill gas, more than doubled between 2005 and 2016. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion account for 77% of total U.S. GHG emissions, with the electric power sector contributing 35% of these emissions. Policymakers and stakeholders are closely monitoring recent trends and future projections of CO2 emissions in the electricity generation sector, influenced by factors such as economic impacts, fossil fuel and renewable energy prices, and the electricity generation portfolio. Recent trends in coal, natural gas, and renewable energy use, along with federal and state policy developments like the CPP implementation and improvements in energy efficiency, are difficult to forecast precisely. The fate of the CPP is uncertain, with a potential 32% reduction in CO2 emissions from the electricity sector by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This rule would establish national CO2 emission performance rates and state-specific targets. The final rule under the CPP would reduce CO2 emissions in the electricity sector by 32% in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This scenario would result in an additional 377 million metric tons reduction in CO2 compared to the baseline scenario without the CPP. EPA projects a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 under the baseline scenario. Based on EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis, factors explaining emission results in 2030 between baseline and CPP scenarios include DSEE improvements, coal generation decrease by 22%-23%, natural gas generation increase by 5%-18%, and non-hydro renewable energy generation increase by 8%-9%. Other organizations used models to compare scenarios. Table 1 shows CO2 emission projections from various groups and the EPA, comparing baseline scenarios with different CPP scenarios. These projections considered factors like CPP implementation options, energy efficiency improvements, and renewable energy tax extensions from December 2015. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended and modified the production and investment tax credits for specific renewable energy technologies. The PTC will not be available for projects starting construction after December 31, 2019. The PTC will not be available for projects starting construction after December 31, 2019. The ITC for solar will decline from 30% to 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021, before returning to the permanent rate of 10% after 2021. The CPP would have a substantial impact on future CO2 emission levels from electricity generation. President Obama announced U.S. GHG emission reduction goals for 2020 and 2025. The United States' achievement of its goals depends on CO2 emissions from power plants. While electricity generation remained steady after 2010, CO2 emissions decreased by 25% in 2016 compared to 2005 levels. Changes in the electricity generation portfolio, such as a decrease in coal and an increase in natural gas and renewable energy, played a significant role in this reduction. The contribution of renewable energy to total electricity generation increased from 2% to 8% in 2016, potentially leading to a decrease in CO2 emissions in the electric power sector. Despite this trend, the importance of the CPP in meeting U.S. GHG emission goals remains significant, as modeling results suggest it would have a substantial impact on future CO2 emission levels."
