    "content": "Child support is a cash payment that noncustodial parents must pay for their children's financial support. All 50 states, along with other territories, have Child Support Enforcement programs. Tribal CSE programs were included in the 1996 welfare reform law, allowing direct federal funding for approved tribal CSE programs. As of April 20, 2016, there were 61 tribal CSE programs in operation. Indian tribes or tribal organizations with tribal CSE programs are listed in the text box on the next page and are shown on the map in Figure 1. In FY2014, 57 tribes or tribal organizations distributed over $36 million in total child support collections to 50,892 cases in the CSE tribal program. Only federally recognized tribes are eligible to operate tribal CSE programs, and they must have a judicial or administrative system to establish and enforce child support orders while protecting due process rights. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires adjustments to court systems or administrative processes for tribal CSE programs. Tribes applying for funding must show a sufficient judicial or administrative process to enforce child support orders. Not all 566 potentially eligible tribes have the necessary systems in place, as they must also have at least 100 children under their jurisdiction. Limited demographic data makes it hard to estimate the number of eligible tribes. Tribal CSE programs face challenges in estimating the number of children not covered due to limited data. An estimate based on ACS data in 2014 showed that roughly 335,000 American Indian and Alaska Native children were living with only one parent. Additionally, in 2014, about 66% of these children were born to unmarried women. The report discusses the legislative history of CSE provisions for tribes, requirements for tribal CSE programs to receive federal funding, current tribal CSE program data, and issues related to program approval. The report provides data on tribal CSE programs, including funding and program features. It also discusses the mission of the CSE program and its evolution since its enactment in 1975. Appendices in the report display rankings, information on comprehensive and start-up tribal CSE programs, and population estimates for each tribe. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program has evolved to focus on enhancing children's well-being by obtaining support from noncustodial parents. It provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, and enforcement of support payments. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), focuses on obtaining support from noncustodial parents for children's well-being. It operates in all 50 states, four jurisdictions, and 61 tribes or tribal organizations. Initially, interstate CSE cases faced challenges due to local court autonomy and jurisdiction conflicts between states. During the 1930s and 1940s, domestic/family law was used to enforce child support obligations within the same state. However, enforcing child support for noncustodial parents living out of state was difficult and often involved extradition and jail time. Interstate child support cases remained challenging to enforce even until the late 1990s. Before the 1996 welfare reform law, child support cases involving Native American children added complexity due to limited state authority on tribal lands. Indian tribes have the power to enforce laws, adjudicate disputes, and provide services within their jurisdictions. State power is restricted in these cases. Before the 1996 welfare reform law, states had limited authority to provide child support services on tribal lands. Cooperative agreements between Indian tribes and states were the main way Indian children on reservations received child support services. Federal laws, such as the Federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act of 1994, addressed child support issues involving Indian tribes and tribal organizations. The 1996 law allowed states to enter into cooperative agreements with Indian tribes and tribal organizations for child support services, and authorized direct federal funding to Indian tribes. The 1996 law allowed states to cooperate with Indian tribes for child support services, providing direct federal funding to tribes for CSE programs. The law also established funding rates of 100% during start-up, 90% for the first three years, and 80% thereafter. P.L. 105-33 made minor amendments to the 1996 welfare reform law. The 1997 technical amendments clarified provisions for state CSE agencies to work with Indian tribes, allowing direct federal funding for tribal CSE programs. The OCSE provides guidance and oversight to state and tribal CSE offices, with the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families overseeing the OCSE. The OCSE manages daily operations and works with tribal CSE programs. Federal CSE staff in regional offices collaborate with states and tribes, providing technical assistance and support. Indian tribes running tribal CSE programs must align with state objectives and regulations, with some flexibility to incorporate tribal laws and traditions. A tribal CSE plan must align with state objectives and regulations, incorporating tribal laws and traditions. It must include components such as population description, application procedures, due process protection, administrative procedures, record maintenance, and noncustodial parent location procedures. The tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) plan must align with state objectives and regulations, incorporating tribal laws and traditions. It includes procedures for noncustodial parent location, establishment of paternity, child support obligations, income withholding, and intergovernmental case processing. Tribes can request start-up funding if they demonstrate capacity to operate a CSE program and meet required components within a specified timeframe. There are 566 federally recognized tribal governments in the United States. According to Census Bureau data, there were 2.9 million American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) individuals in the US in 2010, representing about 1% of the population. 30% of AIAN individuals are under 18 years old. Tribes must have at least 100 children under 18 to certify their tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) plan. This includes children under tribal jurisdiction, even if they are not tribal members. The tribal CSE plan must include a description of the tribal administering agency and the distribution of responsibilities within the agency, ensuring that federal funds and collected amounts are protected. Tribes and tribal organizations must demonstrate financial accountability for all individuals handling funds. The tribal CSE plan requires that individuals handling funds have sufficient bond or insurance coverage. Procedures for providing notices of child support collected must be included, with limitations on application fees and restrictions on charging fees to certain individuals. The tribal CSE agency must recover actual costs of providing services in excess of the application fee, with fees collected and costs recovered considered program income. This income must be used to reduce federal matching expenditures. The agency must maintain records for proper program operation, including applications for child support services, efforts to locate noncustodial parents, actions to establish paternity, child support amounts owed, and program expenditures. The tribal CSE agency is required to extend services to states and other tribal programs, cooperate with them, and locate custodial and noncustodial parents. They must use all available resources to locate parents and their sources of income. The tribal CSE agency must locate parents and their sources of income using various resources such as tribal records, employment records, utilities, postal service, tax departments, and licensing boards. They may also contact other agencies for information and access state systems for locating individuals. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 allows tribes and tribal organizations to access the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) for locating parents and enforcing child support obligations. The FPLS assists in identifying overpayments, fraud, and assessing benefits, and was expanded by the 1996 welfare reform law. Tribes and tribal organizations can access FPLS data including NDNH and FCR, as well as data from federal agencies like SSA, DoD, VA, and FBI for child support enforcement. The tribal CSE agency must establish paternity according to tribal law and provide the alleged father a chance to acknowledge paternity. In contested cases, genetic testing may be required if supported by a sworn statement alleging or denying paternity. Federal regulations clarify that paternity establishment does not imply tribal enrollment. Tribal law must explicitly allow for genetic testing to meet CSE plan requirements. Federal regulations allow tribal CSE programs to establish paternity based on tribal law, which must explicitly provide for genetic testing. The tribe may presume paternity in certain situations, such as when a child is born to married parents or when a noncustodial parent fails to contest paternity after being served in a paternity proceeding. Additionally, some tribal programs may recognize a man as the father if he holds himself out to be the father, preventing him from challenging paternity. In cases where paternity has already been determined by the tribe, genetic testing may be prohibited. Federal regulations also state that tribal CSE agencies are not required to establish paternity in cases involving incest. The tribal CSE agency is not required to establish paternity in cases involving incest or rape, or when legal proceedings for adoption are pending. When genetic testing is used, accredited laboratories must be used to identify the father or exclude the alleged father. The tribal CSE plan must establish child support guidelines and specify if noncash payments are allowed, except for assigned support obligations. The tribal CSE plan must allow for noncash payments, with specific dollar amounts stated in the support order. Guidelines must consider the child's needs and the parent's income, unless deemed unjust by the tribunal. The child support guidelines must consider the child's needs and the noncustodial parent's income, based on specific criteria. They should be reviewed every four years and provide a rebuttable presumption of the correct support amount. Tribal child support orders can be established through various methods, including tribal courts, state courts, and administrative processes. Most tribes use petitions to establish child support orders, serving process through various means such as tribal process servers, police, and private servers. Jurisdictional issues impact case establishment, with some tribes claiming jurisdiction over members nationwide based on enrollment. Tribes are not required to include medical support in support orders, but they are encouraged to ensure children have access to medical care. Jurisdictional disputes between tribes and states can be contentious. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives from federally recognized tribes. Tribal CSE agencies enforce child support orders, with income withholding being the mandated method. Other enforcement actions are at the tribe's discretion and based on tribal policies. Some tribes and tribal organizations use innovative methods to encourage timely child support payments, including Elders' Panels for non-paying parents, intercepting per capita payments, withholding child support from casino winnings, reservation taxes and license suspensions, and requesting court-mandated actions for unemployed parents. The court or administrative agency may mandate actions to improve the noncustodial parent's employability, such as attending classes or undergoing treatment. Tribes are required to use income withholding for child support enforcement, similar to state programs. Income withholding can be waived with good cause or a written agreement between parents. The tribal CSE agency must allocate withheld amounts across multiple orders and ensure prompt service to employers. Tribal CSE plans outline procedures for child support collection distribution, prioritizing current support obligations and family payments. Tribal TANF assistance eligibility may be tied to child support assignment. The tribal CSE agency must allocate child support collections to families unless they are receiving assistance from tribal TANF or a request for assistance has been made by another agency. Distribution of support owed to multiple states or tribes is determined by the tribal CSE agency. Federal regulations require states to extend services to tribal CSE programs for child support collections. Prior to 1996, state agencies lacked jurisdiction over tribal members for child support, while tribal courts lacked resources. Now, cooperative agreements between states and tribes facilitate child support for Native American children. Tribes must utilize existing resources to better serve Indian children. Tribes can enhance services for Indian children by utilizing state CSE programs through cooperative arrangements. They can delegate functions to states or other entities while retaining responsibility for meeting CSE plan requirements. Tribes may also contract with private vendors to carry out necessary functions. Federal regulations hold tribes accountable for the proper operation of tribal CSE programs. Tribes can delegate functions of operating a CSE program to other entities while remaining responsible for compliance with the approved tribal CSE plan. Cooperative agreements with state CSE agencies allow tribes to perform agreed-upon activities reimbursed by the state CSE program. Ultimately, the state is responsible for ensuring all requirements are met in the operation of its CSE program. When entering into a cooperative agreement with a state under Section 455(f) of the Social Security Act, the state must meet tribal CSE requirements. The tribe remains responsible for its CSE program and ensuring all requirements are met. Some suggest states should consider specific procedures when interacting with tribes, such as verifying tribal enrollment and respecting tribal laws. When interacting with tribes, states should consider specific procedures such as verifying tribal enrollment, respecting tribal laws, coordinating service of process in Indian country with the tribe, relying on state and tribal court clerks for information, and ascertaining tribal court practices and procedures. Cooperation between tribes and states is enhanced through common goals, open dialogue, and maintaining communication between tribes and state CSE staff. Automating CSE information systems improves productivity by allowing automatic searches of databases and tracking court actions related to child support. Many argue that automation is necessary for tribal CSE programs to process collections accurately and efficiently. Costs for developing automated programs should be allowable expenditures for tribal CSE programs. The final regulations on tribal CSE automated systems now allow tribal expenditures for the development of data systems to receive federal matching funds, expanding allowable activities and costs for comprehensive tribal CSE programs. The regulations allow tribal CSE programs to receive federal funding for the installation, operation, maintenance, and enhancement of automated systems. Programs within the first three years receive 90% reimbursement, while those after receive 80%. Automation has helped overcome barriers for geographically isolated tribes, but there may be challenges with a primarily automated administrative structure. Federal funding is based on the tribal CSE application, including budget and program scope. The CSE application for tribal programs must adhere to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act and federal regulations. Tribes can apply for comprehensive CSE programs meeting 14 requirements or start-up funding if they do not meet regulatory requirements. Approval by the HHS Secretary is required for comprehensive programs. Tribes can apply for start-up funding to operate tribal CSE programs solely funded by federal dollars. Operational tribal CSE programs receive funding at 90% for the first three years and 80% thereafter. The non-federal share of expenditures can be in cash or in-kind, valued by the tribe or a third party. Both state and tribal CSE programs are entitlement programs with open-ended federal matching funding. Federal funds are available for operating a tribal CSE program approved by the HHS Secretary, with reimbursement for specific activities and costs. Funds cannot be used for certain activities, including legal counsel for indigent defendants in tribal CSE program actions. Federal funds are available for operating a tribal CSE program approved by the HHS Secretary, with reimbursement for specific activities and costs. Start-up funding is provided for tribes to develop a CSE program that meets all regulatory requirements, including costs for planning, staff training, and other reasonable expenses. During the start-up funding period, tribes or tribal organizations receive 100% federal funds for approved CSE expenditures, up to a capped amount. No non-federal matching funds are required for start-up tribal CSE programs. Federal funds cover reasonable and necessary costs for developing a tribal CSE program meeting federal requirements. Start-up funding is limited to $500,000 with no tribal match required, to be used within two years of approval. Comprehensive programs receive 90% federal funding for the first three years. After the initial start-up funding period, tribal CSE programs receive 90% federal funding for the first three years, with a 10% tribal match required. After this period, the federal funding decreases to 80% annually, with a 20% tribal match necessary. Budgetary information must be submitted for funding approval, including expenditure estimates and justification for program elements. The tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program requires certain elements listed on the application form, a statement certifying the availability of non-federal share of expenditures, or a waiver request. Funding for tribal CSE programs is separate from state programs, with different funding mechanisms based on program size. Tribal CSE funding does not impact state CSE program funds. The tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is funded separately from state programs, with different funding mechanisms based on program size. Tribal CSE funding does not impact state CSE program funds. Data on Native American population, women with children outside of marriage, living arrangements of children, and child support orders are presented, but there are challenges with population data for federally recognized Indian tribes. The Census Bureau does not provide detailed demographic or socioeconomic data on tribal members alone, as data on American Indians and Alaska Natives are based on race, not tribal membership. The decennial census collects information by Indian reservation or other statistical areas for federally recognized tribes, serving as proxies for actual tribal data. The Census Bureau does not provide detailed demographic or socioeconomic data on tribal members alone. Data on American Indians and Alaska Natives are based on race, not tribal membership. The Bureau of Indian Affairs publishes biennial estimates of its own service population, based on figures received from federally recognized tribes. Tribal enrollment totals are reported by tribes, but the BIA does not confirm these figures with censuses. The report lacks geographic, demographic, or socioeconomic data on tribal enrollees. The report lacks detailed demographic or socioeconomic data on tribal members, including their age or characteristics. It also does not analyze factors like tribe size, wealth, or employment opportunities on the effectiveness of tribal programs. In 2010, the Census Bureau estimated 5.2 million AIAN individuals, with 2.9 million reporting AIAN as their only race, making up 0.9% of the U.S. population. In 2010, about 0.9% of the U.S. population were American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) individuals. 30% of AIAN individuals were under 18 years old. 66% of AIAN babies were born to unmarried mothers. 52% of AIAN children lived in single-parent families. Among custodial mothers, 51% of AIAN mothers had child support orders, lower compliance rate compared to other minority mothers. For AIAN mothers with child support orders, 67% received some child support. Data on tribal CSE programs provided by tribes and tribal organizations to federal OCSE is complex and should not be simplified by summary statistics. The tribal CSE programs have wide differences among program indicators and have been operating for a relatively short time. Unlike state CSE programs, tribal CSE programs lack federal auditors to assess data completeness and reliability. Data from tribes and tribal organizations do not include cases processed outside of tribal CSE programs. Table 2 summarizes tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program data from FY2004 to FY2014, showing an increase in comprehensive tribal CSE programs from 9 in FY2001 to 57 in FY2014. Child support payments collected by tribes rose from $14.5 million in FY2004 to $47.3 million in FY2014. Unlike state CSE programs, tribal programs lack federal auditors to assess data completeness and reliability. The tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program saw significant growth from FY2004 to FY2014. Funding increased from $14.5 million to $47.3 million, with a 196% increase. Paternity establishment rose by 150%, child support orders by 246%, and program expenditures by 357%. Despite an 83% increase in caseload, collections on current child support obligations grew by 136%. In FY2014, the tribal CSE program collected $12.3 million on past-due child support obligations, representing a 606% increase. However, only 16% of the $268.5 million owed to families was paid. The program collected 48% of current child support obligations but only 6% of child support arrearage payments. The tribal CSE program struggles, similar to the state program, in collecting past-due child support. The tribal CSE program faces challenges in collecting past-due child support, with a significant amount of child support arrearages potentially transferred from state CSE programs. Data from FY2004 shows child support arrearages were already at nearly $50 million. The effectiveness of the tribal CSE program is measured by dividing total collections by total expenditures. In FY2014, the tribal CSE program collected $0.87 for each dollar spent, showing a decrease from previous years. The collections-to-expenditures rate fluctuated over an 11-year period, reaching a low in FY2014. This decrease may be due to newly established tribal CSE programs being included in the data. The tribal CSE program expenditures per case grew by 149% from FY2004 to FY2014, reaching nearly $820. Collections per case also increased by 78% during the same period, from $522 to $929. However, these averages do not accurately reflect what individual families receive. In FY2014, $226 million of child support owed to tribal members went unpaid, which is 84% of the amount supposed to be collected for Native American children. There were wide differences in child support collections among tribes, ranging from 0 cents in the Blackfeet Nation tribe to $2.37 in the Forest County Potawatomi tribe. Table 4 presents tribal CSE program data by tribe for FY2014, showing collections, expenditures, and caseload data. The Navajo Nation ranked highest in child support collections, expenditures, caseload, paternities, and support orders. They were one of the first tribes to receive federal CSE funding and have had a comprehensive program since FY2002. The Forest County Potawatomi tribe had the best collections-to-expenditures ratio in FY2014, two times higher than the average for all tribes, with a program since FY2003. The Navajo Nation and Forest County Potawatomi tribe have effective CSE programs, with the Navajo Nation being the largest tribe in the U.S. and the Forest County Potawatomi tribe being relatively wealthy. Program indicators may not be clear-cut during the formative years. The effectiveness of tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs cannot be accurately determined based solely on caseload and expenditure data. High caseloads and expenditures may be influenced by external factors such as divorce rates, single-parent families, nonmarital childbearing, and nonpayment of child support. Drawing conclusions or making broad generalizations about tribal CSE programs based on this data is not advisable. Final regulations were established to implement direct funding to Indian tribes and tribal organizations for tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs. The regulations require that all child support agencies accept applications for service and provide appropriate services, including basic assistance like location, document preparation, and case monitoring. The regulations require child support agencies to provide services such as location, document preparation, and case monitoring. States and tribes must collaborate to ensure families receive the child support they deserve, even though jurisdictional issues may arise. Federal regulations clarify that paternity establishment under tribal CSE programs does not imply tribal enrollment or membership. Paternity under tribal CSE programs is not linked to tribal enrollment or membership, but some tribes view membership as a cultural and political issue. Tribal CSE programs can use noncash payments for child support, but concerns exist about the administrative burden of assigning values to these payments. Child advocates worry that children receiving tribal CSE services may not receive their full child support entitlements. Tribal CSE programs face challenges in collecting child support due to limited resources compared to state programs. Some believe that setting realistic child support orders from the start can improve program success, while others worry about unequal resources affecting children's support. Indian tribes are considered \"domestic dependent nations\" under federal law. Tribal sovereignty applies in matters affecting tribe members on reservations. Census data show 67% of AIAN live outside these areas. Jurisdiction is crucial in domestic relations cases involving tribal members. P.L. 83-280 granted states jurisdiction over Indians on some reservations. Public Law 280 granted states jurisdiction over Indians on reservations. There are mandatory and optional Public Law 280 states, with jurisdiction concurrent with tribes. States with complete civil jurisdiction can handle domestic relations cases involving tribal members. Law 280 grants states jurisdiction over Indians on reservations. Tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over parentage and child support matters when both parents are tribal members living on the reservation. However, there are exceptions such as cases involving Indian and non-Indian parents or parents from different tribes. Concurrent jurisdiction under Public Law 280 may not always resolve conflicts. When there is concurrent jurisdiction under Public Law 280, conflicts may arise between state and tribal interests in cases involving tribal members residing on reservations and non-tribal members. State concerns like public assistance or CSE services may conflict with tribal interests in establishing paternity. Tribal courts may not use genetic testing as extensively as state courts and may not recognize presumptions of paternity or marriage. Balancing state and tribal interests is crucial in such cases, such as those involving Native American children receiving TANF benefits. American children receiving TANF benefits may face jurisdictional issues between state and tribal courts. Conflict over jurisdiction can arise, even in Public Law 280 states. For example, the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes sued Alaska's Child Support Services Division over the recognition of tribal child support orders. The disagreement centers on the tribal court's authority to issue its own child support orders. The Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes sued Alaska's Child Support Services Division for refusing to provide services based on tribal court child support orders. The lawsuit aims to resolve jurisdictional issues and ensure Native children receive necessary support services. In a 2011 ruling, the Juneau Superior Court recognized the tribe's jurisdiction over child support for enrolled or eligible children. Enrollment with the tribe is crucial for obtaining child support services. Jurisdictional issues between states and Indian tribes can complicate matters. Legally identifying the father is necessary for a child support order, especially in cases of nonmarital births. Nonmarital births are common across various demographics in the US. In 2010, 40.8% of 4.0 million births were to unmarried women, with 65.6% of births to American Indian or Alaska Native women being nonmarital. Establishing paternity is essential for child support, and tribes offer various methods for paternity determination, including DNA testing for accurate identification of fathers. DNA profiling is used to establish paternity by comparing the genetic material of a child to that of their biological parents. If the tested man's DNA contains the necessary genetic characteristics, the probability of him being the biological father can be calculated. Tribes may have different views on paternity compared to states. While DNA testing is commonly used by tribes to establish paternity, some tribes do not solely rely on scientific technology to confer tribal membership, viewing it as a political and cultural issue. Paternity tests can be seen as an affront to integrity and trust, especially in cases involving older children, leading to diminished chances for cooperative parenting. Some tribes may not fully trust DNA testing for paternity establishment, as they see it as a cultural and political matter. Critics argue that tribes should not have too much discretion in determining paternity, suggesting that some tribes may be motivated by financial reasons, such as not wanting to share casino revenue. Some argue that DNA testing for paternity should not be equated with tribal membership, as it is highly accurate. Federal regulations protect tribal status by clarifying that establishing paternity does not imply enrollment. Unlike federal CSE law, tribal programs do not require the father's name on the birth certificate without acknowledgment or court adjudication. In tribal CSE programs, if a man's name is on a child's birth certificate without contesting paternity, the child may be deemed his regardless of biological relation. Tribes must include collection/enforcement methods in their plans, with income withholding being the mandated method. According to OCSE data, income withholding is the most effective method for states to collect child support payments, accounting for about 67% of collections. However, if the noncustodial parent is unemployed or self-employed, income withholding may not be applicable. States are required by federal law to authorize various collection and enforcement methods, including intercepting tax refunds, placing liens on property, reporting to credit bureaus, and suspending licenses for those who owe child support. The federal law allows for various enforcement methods for child support, including seizing assets, passport restrictions, contempt-of-court procedures, and criminal penalties. Tribes argue for access to similar enforcement tools as states to ensure equitable service for Native American children. Despite limitations, many tribes have implemented innovative enforcement techniques. One child support collection method that tribes find beneficial is the federal income tax refund offset program. Noncustodial parents of Native American children are more willing to have their refunds withheld to pay past-due child support, as they see it as legitimate. This method is seen as a valuable tool by many child advocates. Some child advocates argue that tribes should have access to the federal income tax refund offset as an important enforcement tool for child support. Tribes are currently negotiating contracts with states to access the refund on behalf of Indian children, but direct access would require specific legislation from Congress. Tribes lack access to state child support collection tools but have the authority to allow noncustodial parents to use in-kind payments. Many tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) administrators see the advantage of allowing noncustodial parents to use in-kind payments instead of cash to satisfy child support debt, especially for low-income individuals. This allows noncustodial parents of Indian children to fulfill their child support obligation by providing a service to the custodial parent, such as providing firewood for home heating. Federal regulations require child support orders to clearly state a specific dollar amount for the obligation. The child support order allows noncustodial parents to make in-kind payments, such as providing firewood, to fulfill their child support obligation. Tribal CSE administrators view this as an effective strategy, but there are concerns about the administrative burden of valuing noncash payments. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 allows tribes direct access to the Federal Parent Locator Service, improving their ability to locate noncustodial parents. Despite challenges in predicting noncash payments for child support, tribal CSE programs collected only 16% of child support obligations in FY2014. Nonpayment of child support is a significant issue for tribal and state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs, with default judgments and high support orders being cited as contributing factors. If a noncustodial parent fails to appear in court for child support or paternity proceedings, a default judgment may be entered against them. Some tribes recognize default judgments, where the court may establish paternity or child support obligations if the noncustodial parent does not present their side of the case. A \"no show\" by the noncustodial parent in court may lead to the establishment of paternity and child support orders, regardless of the actual father's identity or income status. Default judgments, used by tribal and state courts, have raised concerns as they can impact putative fathers who claim they are not the biological father but did not appear in court to contest the allegations. Balancing the rights of putative fathers to proper notice and the child's right to timely support determination is crucial in default judgment cases. The right of the child to obtain paternity and support from a father who fails to appear in court is crucial. High child support orders and complex modification requirements worsen the issue of nonsupport. American Indians and Alaska Natives have a poverty rate twice that of their white counterparts. Setting child support orders too high can reduce payments due to the noncustodial parent's low income or belief that the system is unfair. Some argue that tribal child support policies are fairer and more realistic than state guidelines, as tribes are more aware of their people's circumstances. It is believed that tribal programs with realistic guidelines, swift modification processes, and effective cooperation with states can avoid the mistakes of state programs. Noncustodial parents claim that child support guidelines are unfair. Noncustodial parents claim child support guidelines are unfair as they do not consider affordability, leading to excessive payments for many. Some tribes have reduced child support debt they deemed inappropriate, but others face challenges modifying orders if the custodial parent does not reside on the reservation. Some tribes struggle to modify child support orders when the custodial parent does not live on the reservation. Tribal courts can adjust payments to avoid contempt of court rulings, recognizing the need for flexibility in developing their own CSE programs. Tribes are at an early stage of program development and should have the authority to tailor policies to better serve their community. In many tribes, the father's role varies, with some focusing on providing affection and support to children while others emphasize cultural survival. This impacts how paternity establishment and child support are viewed within the tribe. Some tribes may see establishing paternity and child support orders as disrupting tribal harmony. Child support enforcement methods like license suspension may be seen as harming fathers. Balancing historical tribal practices with present-day child needs is crucial for successful tribal CSE programs. Tribal CSE programs vary in their approaches, as outlined by the National Tribal Child Support Association. Some tribes have their own child support codes/laws, incorporating state statutes or creating their own. Various court systems are used, including CFR courts, tribal courts, and administrative processes. Some tribal programs use state automated systems, while others operate manually. Administrative hearings and paternity testing may vary among tribes. Default orders acceptance also varies. The Navajo Nation has an effective Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program with collaborative agreements with Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. They have access to the Child Support Enforcement System (CSES) through a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) with New Mexico since 1997. The program is credited for its effectiveness in caseloads, collections, and expenditures. The Navajo Nation has an effective Child Support Enforcement program with collaborative agreements with Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. They utilize the Child Support Enforcement System (CSES) through a Joint Powers Agreement with New Mexico. The system connects to case registries of other states and territories for locating and intercepting assets of individuals who owe child support. Two new regions (Region 8 and Region 9) were created within the CSED and CSES system for child support enforcement on Navajo Nation lands. Cooperative agreements between states and tribes facilitate child support services for Indian children, allowing for culturally relevant services based on tribal laws. Cases involving tribe members on reservations are referred to tribal courts. Incentive payment systems are integral to state CSE programs. The CSE program's incentive payment system rewards states for achieving program goals and objectives, motivating them to focus on providing essential CSE services. A penalty system also holds states accountable for poor performance. Tribal CSE programs do not have an incentive payment component but must submit performance targets. Tribes set performance targets for paternity and child support, with some concerns about low targets and lack of incentive due to federal funding. Tribal CSE programs are smaller but may be more motivated to operate effectively. The traditional extended family network in Indian culture was responsible for raising children, providing care, education, and preserving cultural traditions. However, this structure has diminished over the years, leading to Native American families drifting apart. Some Native American noncustodial parents may be residing on reservations, similar to noncustodial fathers in the early years of the state CSE system. Some Native American noncustodial parents may reside on reservations to avoid child support. Congress funded tribal CSE programs to support tribal self-determination and meet unique needs. Indian tribes can design programs tailored to their traditions. State CSE program faced early implementation challenges. Many tribal CSE programs face challenges related to implementation, data consistency, reporting, nonpayment of support, establishment of paternity and child support orders, distribution of support, and strained relationships with noncustodial parents. Additional issues include placement within tribal government, staff salaries, confidentiality, notice distribution, enforcement reciprocity, service of process, and communication. The effectiveness of the federal-state CSE program is measured by its impact on national child support payment rates. Child support payments improve the standard of living for poor families, constituting 14% of family income on average and 49% for poor households. The CSE program provides benefits beyond financial support, such as establishing paternity for children. The importance of fathers in their children's lives is crucial for their self-esteem and development. Fathers are often overlooked in social welfare programs, but tribal CSE programs can play a key role in recognizing and involving fathers. A cooperative relationship between noncustodial parents and CSE agencies is more effective in ensuring child support payments. Some observers suggest tribal CSE programs should coordinate with state programs to improve relationships with fathers and increase child support payments. Despite the limited number of tribal CSE programs, gaps in services for Native American children are likely to persist for years. Some question if tribal CSE programs can meet the needs of Native American children, while others believe it is too early to judge their effectiveness. Appendix A provides tables ranking tribes based on CSE program features for FY2014, but rankings do not indicate program effectiveness. Some tribal CSE programs may have higher child support collections and program expenditures due to factors like access to casino profits or mineral rights. Generalizations about program effectiveness based on data in tables may be inaccurate. Table A-1 displays child support collected by each tribe, but CSE administrators caution that it may not fully reflect program success. Some tribal CSE programs may have higher child support collections and program expenditures due to factors like access to casino profits or mineral rights. Generalizations about program effectiveness based on data in tables may be inaccurate. Tables in the appendix show CSE expenditures, caseload data, paternities established, child support orders established, and collections per dollar of expenditures for each tribe. Another appendix displays comprehensive tribal CSE programs. In FY2001 through FY2012, the number of tribes or tribal organizations operating comprehensive CSE programs increased from 9 to 45. In FY2013 and FY2014, the number of tribes operating comprehensive CSE programs increased to 51 and 57, respectively. Population figures for each of the 61 tribal CSE programs are provided in Table C-1, based on data from 2005 and 2010. The fourth and fifth columns in Table C-1 are based on 2010 census data, while tribal enrollment data is from 2005. Total figures for all tribes nationwide are from the 2010 census."
