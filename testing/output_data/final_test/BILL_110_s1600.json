Research should focus on well-defined problems requiring diverse technological solutions. Sharing information is crucial for advancing energy research. The Federal Government should facilitate the sharing of information from various industries to promote innovation in energy technologies while protecting intellectual property rights. Revisions to current methods are needed to accelerate the development and implementation of energy technologies. The Energy Technologies Innovation Network, established by the Secretary of Energy, conducts surveys every 5 years to determine the top energy-related research and development priorities for maximizing energy security, efficiency, and minimizing economic damage. The Energy Technologies Innovation Network, established by the Secretary of Energy, conducts surveys every 5 years to determine the top energy-related research and development priorities for maximizing energy security, efficiency, and minimizing economic damage. Each survey requests respondents to list the 10 highest-priority energy-related problems that need quick resolution to achieve the goals of minimizing damage to the economy and the environment of the United States. The Secretary announces the surveys through the Federal Register and the Department of Energy's website. The Department of Energy conducts surveys every 5 years to determine energy research priorities. Surveys are available on the DOE website for 21-30 days and require respondents to provide age and occupation information. The respondent is required to provide information such as the period of time in their current occupation and their State and country of residence. Additional information such as name, employer, email address, and other details may be requested but are not mandatory. The Secretary will seek responses to a survey from representatives of various industries, academia, research facilities, NGOs, Federal Government, and State/local government in a transparent and nonpolitical manner. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress and the public within 180 days of the survey's completion, detailing the results and listing the top 10 energy-related problems identified. During a 5-year period after receiving a report on energy-related problems, the Department of Energy will focus its research and development activities on resolving the top 10 issues identified in the report. Additional problems may also be addressed during this period. The Department of Energy may conduct energy-related research and development activities to address two additional high-priority energy-related problems not included in the report, using the same resources allocated for other energy-related issues. An \"Energy Technologies Innovation Network\" will be established for information sharing and collaboration. The Department of Energy will establish an \"Energy Technologies Innovation Network\" for sharing and collaborating on energy technology ideas. The network will provide a forum for interested parties to present and discuss information related to energy technologies. The Secretary will contract with a third party to operate the network, with requirements including experience in maintaining a searchable database of Federal research projects. The Energy Technologies Innovation Network will be easily searchable, open to the public, and capable of expansion. It will provide a secure electronic forum for collaboration among users and protect intellectual property rights. Research laboratories receiving Federal funding must share research results with the network. The Energy Technologies Innovation Network allows for funding from various contributors to address energy-related problems, with a focus on national security. Collaboration with third parties is required to operate the network effectively. The Energy Technologies Innovation Network requires expertise in intellectual property to monitor and protect information and ideas developed within the network in accordance with federal intellectual property law. The Energy Technologies Innovation Network requires expertise in intellectual property to protect information and ideas developed within the network in accordance with federal law, ensuring security and reliability. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums necessary for implementing this section are authorized to be appropriated."
