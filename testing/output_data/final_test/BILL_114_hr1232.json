    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act\". The Department of Defense provides excess military equipment to local law enforcement agencies through the Law Enforcement Support Office program. This includes mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and weapons. This equipment is acquired by police and sheriff's departments for their normal operations, stemming from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Approximately $4 billion worth of excess military equipment has been transferred to police organizations across the country. In 2011 alone, 12,000 police organizations procured nearly $500 million worth of military merchandise at no cost. However, in May 2012, the Defense Logistics Agency halted weapons transfers due to reports of missing equipment and inappropriate transfers. The moratorium on weapons transfers to police organizations was lifted in October 2013 without adequate safeguards, allowing them to acquire free \"military-grade\" equipment. This could lead to potentially dangerous use of such equipment during policing efforts, posing risks to citizens and taxpayers. The Defense Logistics Agency memorandum requires property obtained through the program to be used within one year of receipt, possibly incentivizing unnecessary use of military-grade equipment by local law enforcement. The Department of Defense categorizes equipment eligible for transfer under the 1033 program as \"controlled\" and \"un-controlled\" equipment, including weapons, explosives, vehicles, aircraft, and silencers among other military-grade items.

Additionally, recipients must notify the local community of the request for a period of at least 30 days.

Limitations also apply to the transfer of previously transferred property, including controlled vehicles, drones, controlled aircraft, silencers, long-range acoustic devices, and items in the Federal Supply Class of banned items.
