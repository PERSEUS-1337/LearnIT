    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge Protection Act of 1999\". It includes findings related to the protection of the refuge. The Congress finds that an agreement with the Metropolitan Airports Commission of Minnesota allows for a new runway at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, impacting the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge with over 5,000 monthly overflights at low altitudes. The refuge serves as an urban sanctuary amidst Minneapolis' urban sprawl. The agreement allowing jumbo jets to fly close to the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge violates the concept of providing wildlife sanctuaries. There is a disparity in treatment of activities affecting different national wildlife refuges, with low altitude overflights permitted over this refuge while other refuges in rural areas have stricter restrictions. Some refuges even deny access to emergency medical services. The environmental impact statement for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport expansion is inadequate as it fails to address the impacts of 5,000 overflights per month below 2,000 feet on endangered species in the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge. SEC. 3. MINNESOTA VALLEY NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE PROTECTION. The Secretary of the Interior and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service are prohibited from implementing any agreement that would allow expansion of the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport beyond its current capacity. An existing environmental impact statement from May 1998 regarding the airport expansion is deemed ineffective, and a new environmental impact statement is required. A new environmental impact statement is required for the expansion of the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The impacts on wildlife in the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge must be fully determined, including species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Secretary of the Interior must report to Congress within 60 days on whether the expansion of the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport or increased overflights over the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge may harm endangered species, as per the Endangered Species Act."
