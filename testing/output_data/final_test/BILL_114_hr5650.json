    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Recovering America's Wildlife Act of 2016\". Congress finds that a diverse array of fish and wildlife is of significant value to the United States for various reasons, including aesthetic, ecological, educational, cultural, recreational, economic, and scientific reasons. Over 90 million citizens participate in outdoor recreation activities like hunting, fishing, and birding, providing economic benefits to local communities. It is in the interest of the United States to preserve the opportunity for future generations to engage in wildlife-related activities and to recover species listed as endangered. The founding of the first conservation efforts by hunters and anglers in the 1880-90s was driven by concerns about the unsustainable harvest of game and sportfish, as well as the need to protect avifauna from commercial exploitation. In the early 20th century, States regulated the harvest of game and sportfish through hunting and angling licenses, establishing seasons, limits, and legal means of take. In 1937, an alliance between hunters, conservation organizations, State and Federal governments, and the shooting sports industry led to the transfer of Federal excise tax receipts on sporting arms and ammunition to the States for conservation efforts. In 1951, an alliance between anglers, conservation organizations, State governments, the Federal Government, and the sport-fishing industry convinced Congress to impose a Federal excise tax on fishing equipment under the Dingell-Johnson Sportfish Restoration Act. Receipts were transferred to the States to manage sport fish and conserve habitat. Fishing license revenues fund fish and wildlife conservation, benefiting all Americans with abundant wildlife, clean water, outdoor recreation, and a better quality of life. This user-pay system was brought to the Federal Government by sportsmen and sportswomen, ensuring dedicated funds for conservation efforts delivered by the States. State fish and wildlife agencies are responsible for managing fish and wildlife but are underfunded. Congress enacted the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account to provide funds for conservation efforts. The Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act aims to support fish and wildlife conservation needs, including non-hunted species, but lacks dedicated funds. This has led to a decline in fish and wildlife populations in the US, resulting in many species being listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Each state and territory faces challenges due to the unfunded Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account. The Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account requires each State and territory to create a State Wildlife Action Plan for the conservation of fish, wildlife, and habitats. Providing dedicated funding to this account will ensure sustainable populations of all species for citizens' use and enjoyment. States should secure non-Federal match funding from sources other than sportsmen revenue. The Federal wildlife and sport fish restoration accounts provide funding for various activities including wildlife restoration projects, hunter education, and range development efforts. The purpose of this Act is to ensure sustainable populations of fish and wildlife by supporting programs in each State and territory. The Act aims to support state programs for conservation of declining fish and wildlife species, provide federal funding for comprehensive conservation strategies, and promote collaborative actions to prevent species from being listed under the Endangered Species Act. SEC. 3. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION SUBACCOUNT. Section 3(a) of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to establish the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount within the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund. This subaccount provides funding for State Wildlife Conservation and Restoration programs to manage fish and wildlife species of greatest conservation need. The Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount was established within the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund to provide funding for State Wildlife Conservation and Restoration programs. Starting in fiscal year 2016, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer $650,000,000 from outer continental shelf revenues and mining revenues to the Subaccount."
