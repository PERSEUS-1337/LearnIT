The amendment to Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act mandates the detention of criminal aliens convicted of aggravated felonies upon release, without the possibility of release by the Attorney General. The amendment to Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires the detention of criminal aliens convicted of aggravated felonies, either before or after a determination of removability, unless certain conditions are met.

A term of imprisonment of at least 5 years is mandated for certain felonies, with an effective date of April 24, 1996. SEC. 7. RESTORATION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW PROVISIONS. Amends Section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow judicial review of orders of removal. Section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the exclusive procedure for judicial review of final removal orders against aliens in the United States. Petitions for review must be filed within specific timeframes, and venue is determined by the location of the administrative proceedings before an immigration judge. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the procedure for judicial review of removal orders. Petitions must be filed within specific timeframes and venue is determined by the petitioner's residence. The action is brought against the Immigration and Naturalization Service, with service made upon the Attorney General and the Service district official. Service of the petition stays the alien's removal pending court determination, except for aggravated felony convictions. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines the process for judicial review of removal orders. Petitions must be filed within specific timeframes, and venue is determined by the petitioner's residence. The petition stays the alien's removal pending court determination, except for aggravated felony convictions. The court determines the petition based on the administrative record and the Attorney General's findings of fact, which are conclusive if supported by evidence. If a petitioner claims to be a U.S. national and the claim is not frivolous, the court must address the issues presented. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for judicial review of removal orders. Petitions must be filed within specific timeframes, and venue is based on the petitioner's residence. The court reviews the petition based on the administrative record and the Attorney General's findings of fact. If a petitioner claims U.S. nationality, the court must address the issues presented, including transferring the proceedings to a district court for a de novo hearing. The validity of a removal order can be challenged in a criminal proceeding for violation of specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act. If a claim to U.S. nationality is made, a hearing de novo may be granted to determine the issue. Any alien subject to a removal order can challenge its validity in a criminal proceeding. If a claim to U.S. nationality is raised, a hearing de novo may be granted to determine the issue. The determination will be based on the administrative record and the Attorney General's findings, which must be supported by substantial evidence. If the removal order is found invalid, the indictment will be dismissed, and the U.S. can appeal within 30 days. No alien can file a petition for review during a criminal proceeding. During a criminal proceeding, an alien can challenge a removal order, but the Attorney General is not required to defer removal. The Attorney General can detain the alien at any time after the removal order is issued. Printing the record or briefs is not necessary for the court to review the case. An alien held in custody pursuant to a removal order can seek judicial review through habeas corpus proceedings. Any alien with a final removal order can also seek judicial review through habeas corpus. The court cannot review an order of removal if the alien has not exhausted administrative remedies or has left the United States after the order was issued. An alien with a final removal order can seek judicial review through habeas corpus proceedings. The petition must indicate if the order's validity has been upheld in prior judicial proceedings. A petition for review or habeas corpus will not be considered if the order's validity has already been determined, unless new grounds are presented or the prior remedy was inadequate. A petition on behalf of an alien challenging a removal order can only question if the alien matches the description in the order. The amendment limits court jurisdiction to review specific issues related to an alien's removal order, such as identity verification, aggravated felony convictions, and procedural requirements. The effective date of the amendment applies to pending determinations with final administrative decisions not rendered or not yet subject to judicial review. SEC. 8. POST-PROCEEDING RELIEF FOR AFFECTED ALIENS. The Attorney General will establish a process for aliens in removal proceedings before the enactment of this Act to apply for cancellation of removal. Additionally, the Attorney General should utilize parole authority for affected aliens. The Attorney General will utilize parole authority under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow aliens removed from the United States to participate in the established process."
