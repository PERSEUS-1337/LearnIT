    "content": "Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to exclude gain on the sale of a principal residence. Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code excludes gain from the sale of a principal residence. The exclusion limits the gain to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint returns) if the property has been owned and used as a principal residence for at least 2 years within a 5-year period. The Internal Revenue Code excludes gain from the sale of a principal residence up to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint returns) if the property has been owned and used as a principal residence for at least 2 years within a 5-year period. Special rules apply for property held jointly by husband and wife when making a joint return. If a husband and wife jointly own property and file a joint tax return, and one spouse meets the holding and use requirements, both spouses are considered to meet the requirements. In the case of an unmarried individual whose spouse is deceased, if the deceased spouse met the holding and use requirements within the 5-year period before the sale, special rules apply. For cooperative housing corporation stockholders, holding and use requirements apply to the stock and the property occupied. In cases of involuntary conversions, specific events trigger the application of this section. The section addresses the treatment of property in cases of destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation. It also specifies how the gain from the sale or exchange of property used partially as a principal residence is determined. Marital status is considered as of the date of the sale or exchange for tax purposes. The tax code specifies that marital status is determined as of the date of sale or exchange. In applying sections 1033 and 1034, the amount realized from property sale or exchange is calculated without considering this section. If property basis is determined under section 1033, then the taxpayer's holding and use of the property is taken into account. The tax code specifies that marital status is determined as of the date of sale or exchange. If a taxpayer becomes physically or mentally incapable of self-care and uses their property as their principal residence for at least 1 year during a 5-year period, they will be treated as using the property as their principal residence even while residing in a licensed facility. The tax code allows individuals who are physically or mentally incapable of self-care and reside in a licensed facility to still be treated as using their property as their principal residence. Taxpayers can elect to exclude the sale or exchange of their principal residence from certain tax provisions. The tax code allows individuals to exclude gain from the sale of their principal residence if they meet ownership and use requirements. Amendments are made to sections related to the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. Amendments to the tax code allow individuals to exclude gain from the sale of their principal residence. The amendments apply to sales and exchanges on or after the date of the enactment of this Act."
