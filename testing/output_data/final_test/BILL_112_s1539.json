    "content": "The Act titled \"Taiwan Airpower Modernization Act of 2011\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Department of Defense's 2011 report to Congress on China's military modernization highlights China's focus on Taiwan contingencies and its efforts to deter Taiwan independence. China is developing capabilities to deter U.S. support for Taiwan in the event of conflict, shifting the balance of military forces in its favor. China's air force will focus on posing a military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East Asia, deterring Taiwan independence, and influencing Taiwan to settle disputes on Beijing's terms. Taiwan's air force has nearly 400 combat aircraft, but many are not operationally capable due to age and maintenance issues. The retirement of Mirage and F-5 aircraft will reduce the total size of the Taiwan Air Force. Since 2006, Taiwan has requested to purchase 66 F-16C/D fighter aircraft from the US to modernize its air force and maintain self-defense capability. The sale would generate significant economic benefits for the US, creating jobs and sustaining high-skilled positions in manufacturing sectors. On August 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 House members and 45 Senate members expressed support for the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. Two other Senate members also supported the sale in separate communications to the President or Secretary of State in 2011. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of a strong Taiwan to maintain peace in Asia amidst China's military expansion, highlighting the need for Taiwan to deter aggression and develop peaceful relations with China. The shift in military balance in China's favor poses a threat to Taiwan and the US security obligations in the region. Taiwan needs advanced fighter aircraft to modernize its air force and fulfill its self-defense obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, in line with US national interests in East Asia. The proposed sale of F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft to Taiwan would benefit the United States economy. The President is mandated to sell at least 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft to Taiwan."
