    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Mitigation Fisheries Coordination Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the operation of dams and water diversion projects benefit the American public by providing energy, flood control, water storage, and recreational opportunities. These projects have impacted water systems and fish populations, necessitating the construction and operation of fish hatcheries to mitigate these effects. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has established policy to mitigate for fish, wildlife, and habitats from the effects of land and water developments. The Service operates fish hatcheries involved in mitigation fishery activities related to Federal water resources projects. Inconsistencies in authorities for these projects have led to various funding mechanisms for mitigation fishery activities. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service funds mitigation fishery costs for land and water developments. Water development agencies should bear the financial responsibility for these costs. SEC. 3. MITIGATION FISHERY ACTIVITIES. The Director of the Service imposes charges for mitigation fishery activities, to be paid by water development agencies according to approved fishery mitigation plans. These plans outline goals, targets, and charges for conducting the activities. The fishery mitigation plan must include terms for agency payments, involve states and tribes, and be renegotiated every 3 years. Charges for mitigation activities must be reasonable and paid on time. A water development agency must make annual payments to the Service as per a fishery mitigation plan. The funds will be credited to the Service's appropriation, available for expenditure specified in Acts, and remain available until spent. If no mitigation plan exists, the Service may carry out projects. The Service may conduct mitigation fishery activities and receive funding from a water development agency for the activities in the absence of a fishery mitigation plan. Mitigation fishery activities involve rearing and stocking fish to replace lost resources, and mitigation fishery costs refer to necessary expenditures for these activities. Mitigation fishery costs include expenses for operating, maintaining, and rehabilitating fishery facilities, conducting activities, personnel, transportation, utilities, supplies, equipment, maintenance, fish eggs, and more. A mitigation fishery facility is owned and operated by the Service for conducting these activities. The Service refers to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service defines a \"water development agency\" as the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, or the Tennessee Valley Authority. Mitigation fishery facilities listed include various national fish hatcheries and fish health centers in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, and North Dakota. The Fish and Wildlife Service lists various national fish hatcheries and fish health centers in different states, including North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."
