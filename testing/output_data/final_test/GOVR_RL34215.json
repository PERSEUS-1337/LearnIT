    "content": "According to the Mexican government, there are seven drug cartels operating in Mexico, with major cartels like Gulf, Sinaloa, and Ju\u00e1rez present in various states. The Gulf cartel operates in 13 states with its center in Tamaulipas, a key transit point for drug shipments to the US. The Ju\u00e1rez cartel is found in 21 states with its base in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, while the Sinaloa cartel operates in 17 states from Sinaloa. Other cartels like Tijuana, Colima, and Oaxaca are also active in different regions of Mexico. The major cartels in Mexico have formed alliances with each other, leading to rival alliances competing for turf. The Tijuana cartel allied with the Gulf cartel through prison negotiations, while several cartels formed \"The Federation\" led by representatives of the Sinaloa, Ju\u00e1rez, and Valencia cartels. This re-organization and increasing violence are attributed to Mexico's success in capturing cartel leadership. Mexico's success in capturing cartel leadership has led to a significant number of arrests related to drug trafficking. Over 79,000 people were arrested from January 2000 to September 2006, including 15 cartel leaders and numerous other key figures. The United States DEA and Coast Guard also played a role in apprehending cartel leaders, such as Francisco Javier Arellano Felix of the Tijuana cartel. Additionally, Mexico extradited several individuals to the United States for prosecution, including senior drug traffickers. In 2007, Mexico extradited four senior drug traffickers to the United States, including Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n of the Gulf cartel, Ismael Higuera Guerrero and Gilberto Higuera Guerrero of the Tijuana cartel, and Hector Palma Salazar of the Sinaloa cartel. This marked a record year with 73 suspected criminals extradited, highlighting Mexico's role as a major drug supplier to the United States. Mexican drug cartels dominate the U.S. illicit drug market, controlling transportation and wholesale distribution. They generate billions in drug earnings annually, with a significant share of heroin and cocaine entering the United States transiting through Mexico. The closure of the cocaine trafficking route through Florida has increased the role of Mexican cartels in cocaine trafficking. Mexican drug cartels control transportation and distribution of illicit drugs in the U.S., except the Northeast. They are forming alliances with other drug trafficking organizations in the Northeast. Colombian groups are still dominant in cocaine and heroin trafficking in the Northeast but are ceding control to Mexican cartels to avoid law enforcement. Mexican cartels are gaining command and control over the drug trade in the U.S., organizing into distinct cells with subordinate operations nationwide. Mexican cartels dominate the U.S. illicit drug market and launder drug money from the United States. They smuggle billions in drug proceeds into Mexico for laundering and produce methamphetamine and marijuana in the U.S. Mexican marijuana producers are expanding production to the Pacific northwest and eastern United States, maintaining affiliation with larger groups in California and Mexico. Mexican cartels have increased relationships with prison and street gangs in the United States to facilitate drug trafficking and distribution. They focus on wholesale distribution, leaving retail sales to street gangs, and work with multiple gangs without taking sides in gang conflicts. Mexican cartels are involved in various criminal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, auto theft, and kidnapping. They smuggle money back into Mexico in vehicles due to increased monitoring of electronic money transfers. The Tijuana cartel has been weakened by arrests and deaths of leaders, leading them to focus on controlling trafficking routes through corruption and intimidation. The Gulf Cartel, a powerful Mexican cartel, operates in Tamaulipas, bordering Texas, and is a key drug transit point to the US. Leader Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guillen was extradited to the US in 2007 for drug trafficking and violence. The cartel is known for its violence and paramilitary group, the Zetas. Mexican authorities plan to target cartel gunmen in safehouses in 2008. The Gulf Cartel is believed to be responsible for shootouts in Reynosa in early 2008. Mexican authorities believe the shootouts in Reynosa, Mexico, in early January 2008 were in reprisal for a confrontation between Mexican federal authorities and cartel members in Rio Bravo, Mexico. The Gulf cartel is branching out into other trafficking activities, including migrant smuggling, possibly due to decreased drug profits from recent enforcement efforts. The cartel is also involved in human smuggling along the Texas border. U.S. authorities report that drug cartels participate in human smuggling to evade law enforcement. The Sinaloa cartel, led by Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, is involved in human smuggling to divert attention from drug routes. Former leader Hector Palma Salazar was extradited to the US for cocaine distribution charges. The cartel is in a turf war with the Gulf cartel for trafficking routes into the US. Sandra \"Queen of the Pacific\" \u00c1vila Beltr\u00e1n, a senior member, was arrested for building ties with Colombian cartels. The Sinaloa cartel, known for its ties with Colombian cocaine traffickers, faces drug trafficking charges in Mexico and the US. Peruvian authorities arrested five cartel members in 2007, revealing their role as the largest purchaser of Peruvian cocaine for European markets. The cartel is expanding into human smuggling, controlling migrant routes into Arizona. The Tijuana cartel, led by the Arellano F\u00e9lix family, supplied 40% of US cocaine at its peak, but its current leadership is unclear. The Tijuana cartel, led by the Arellano F\u00e9lix family, supplied 40% of US cocaine at its peak. Despite being weaker now, the cartel still controls the Tijuana-San Diego corridor. Several members of the cartel have been sentenced to imprisonment in Mexico and the US for organized crime and drug trafficking charges. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was extradited to the US in 2006 and sentenced to six years in prison for drug-related charges. The Ju\u00e1rez cartel, led by Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, was dominant in the 1990s but weakened after the Maxiproceso effort targeted its members in the late 1990s. Despite being weakened, the cartel still has a presence in the region. The Ju\u00e1rez cartel, part of the Federation alliance, benefits from increased heroin sales in Texas. The Colima cartel, led by the Amezcua Contreras brothers, focuses on synthetic drugs and operates in seven Mexican states. The Colima cartel, led by the Amezcua Contreras brothers, continues to operate in seven Mexican states. Despite US extradition requests, Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Amezcua Contreras and Luis Amezcua Contreras have judicial orders blocking their extradition. The cartel is reconsolidating its position and gaining control of trafficking routes from other cartels. The Oaxaca cartel, led by Pedro D\u00edaz Parada, focuses on marijuana trafficking in southern Mexico and was arrested in January 2007. Pedro D\u00edaz Parada, a leading drug trafficker in southern Mexico, was sentenced to 33 years in prison in 1985 but escaped twice. He was involved in ordering the murder of a judge in 1987 and had ties with Colombian cocaine traffickers. D\u00edaz Parada was a key representative of the Tijuana cartel in southeastern Mexico and faces charges for drug possession and illegal firearm possession. The Valencia cartel, led by Luis and Armando Valencia, operates in central Mexico with a base in Michoac\u00e1n. The Valencia cartel, led by Luis and Armando Valencia, operates in central Mexico with a base in Michoac\u00e1n. The cartel is aligned with the Federation and is reported to operate in the state of Colima. Mexican cartels employ enforcers known as sicarios, with over 300 arrests made by the Mexican government from 2000 to 2006. The Gulf cartel lost enforcers to the Sinaloa and Oaxaca cartels, with speculation that their mobility led to greater exposure. The Gulf cartel recruits MS-13 gang members and Guatemalan Kaibiles, but officials deny significant ties. The Zetas operate as a private army under the Gulf cartel's orders. The Zetas, a group of former Mexican military members, operate as a paramilitary force for the Gulf cartel. They were instrumental in the cartel's dominance of the drug trade in Nuevo Laredo and have used sophisticated weaponry for complex operations. Reports suggest they may have received training in the United States, but this claim remains unconfirmed. The Zetas, a paramilitary force for the Gulf cartel, consist of former Mexican military members. They have expanded their ranks to include law enforcement personnel and civilians. The group has hired former Guatemalan special forces for training due to a shortage of Mexican recruits. The Zetas are involved in assassinations, arms trafficking, kidnapping, and collecting payments for the cartel. Mexican officials note their increasing sophistication as a three-tiered organization. The Zetas, a paramilitary force for the Gulf cartel, have evolved into a sophisticated three-tiered organization with leaders coordinating contracts with criminals. They control territory in northern Mexico and along the U.S.-Mexico border, expanding into southern Mexico. The group is involved in various criminal activities including kidnapping, drug dealing, and money laundering. The southern state of Tabasco mistakenly arrested Mateo D\u00edaz L\u00f3pez, believed to be a Zetas leader, leading to an assault on the police station that resulted in 4 deaths. The Zetas trained the Michoac\u00e1n-based \"La Familia\" enforcer gang, which has ties to them. In response, the Sinaloa cartel formed its own enforcer gangs, the Negros and Pelones, with Edgar \"La Barbie\" Vald\u00e9s Villarreal allegedly leading the Negros. The Negros are responsible for attacks against police officers in Nuevo Laredo to challenge the Zetas' control. The Zetas have alleged that the Sinaloa cartel and Negros leader \"La Barbie\" enjoy police protection in recent turf wars in various Mexican states. Mexican cartels corrupt or intimidate law enforcement officials to advance their operations, such as Nuevo Laredo police being involved in kidnapping Gulf cartel competitors for the Zetas. The Zetas hold people for ransom or torture for information about drug operations. Mexico has made efforts to reduce corruption, but it remains a serious problem. Some AFI agents are believed to work for the Sinaloa cartel, with a significant number under investigation for criminal activity. In late 2005, nearly 1,500 AFI agents were under investigation, and 457 were facing charges. In November 2005, a video showing Zetas revealing torture methods, ties to Mexican law enforcement, and recruitment was given to the Dallas Morning News. The Mexican government sent mixed signals about AFI agents' involvement in the Zetas' kidnapping, with reports suggesting AFI agents likely handed them over to the Sinaloa cartel for interrogation and execution. The Mexican federal government conducted purges and prosecution of police forces in Nuevo Laredo, Apatzingan, and Tijuana to combat drug violence and corruption. Operation Secure Mexico was launched in June 2005. In Nuevo Laredo, federal officers were fired on by municipal police, leading to arrests and suspensions. Despite efforts, the Zetas still influence Nuevo Laredo's police, and warring cartels are gaining control over law enforcement in the city. In 2006, Mexico launched the Northern Border initiative to combat violence in Nuevo Laredo, deploying 800 Federal Protective Police officers. Four officers were killed in a cartel safe house, with evidence pointing to municipal police involvement. President Calder\u00f3n initiated anti-cartel operations, including ballistic checks on police weapons in Tijuana. Over 100 state police officers in Nuevo Le\u00f3n were suspended for corruption concerns in April 2007. In June 2007, President Calder\u00f3n purged 284 federal police commanders across Mexico due to corruption concerns. The commanders were suspended and subjected to various tests to weed out corrupt officers. The arrests of cartel leaders in 2002 and 2003 led to a realignment of Mexican cartels and increased turf wars. Cartels are now largely aligned into two blocks in support of the Gulf cartel. The turf wars in Mexico involve the Sinaloa cartel contesting the Gulf cartel's dominance in Nuevo Laredo, Guerrero, and Michoac\u00e1n. Nuevo Laredo, near the US border, has seen intense violence with over 60 kidnapped US citizens and hundreds of Mexicans. The realignment of cartels in 2002 and 2003 led to increased violence and turf wars. Reports indicate that hundreds of Mexicans have been kidnapped in Nuevo Laredo, a city of 350,000 with 600 murders since 2003. The city has been without a police chief for nearly a year due to the violence, with the most recent chief resigning and his predecessor being murdered. Gunmen wounded a Mexican Congressman and killed his driver in Nuevo Laredo after President Calder\u00f3n announced the expansion of his counternarcotics operation into the city. The Gulf cartel is believed to be responsible for the attack, and drug cartels have threatened to kill an American journalist for reporting on them. The cartels compete for influence over law enforcement and the media, using intimidation and murder. In February 2006, gunmen attacked offices of El Ma\u00f1ana in Nuevo Laredo after it linked a federal police officer to the Sinaloa cartel, injuring a reporter. The paper reduced coverage of drug violence due to intimidation. U.S. Ambassador closed the consulate in Nuevo Laredo in 2005 over safety concerns. State Department warned Americans about drug violence in Mexico in 2007. The turf war in Mexico shifted from Nuevo Laredo to Nuevo Leon in 2007, possibly due to the Gulf cartel maintaining control or a truce with the Sinaloa cartel. Zihuatenejo and Acapulco saw increased drug violence, with a state police chief murdered in Acapulco in 2006. The Zetas interrogated in Acapulco were allegedly abducted, leading to beheadings in 2006 as retribution. The Colima cartel, once dominant in Michoac\u00e1n, was weakened by arrests, allowing the Millennium cartel to take control. Michoac\u00e1n now faces a turf war involving the Ju\u00e1rez, Gulf, Millennium, and Colima cartels, as well as the Gulf cartel's Zetas and the \"Familia\" enforcer gang. In Michoac\u00e1n, violent clashes between cartels have resulted in multiple deaths. The town of Apatzingan is a hotspot for cartel activity and has been a focal point of federal efforts against cartels since December 2006. President Calder\u00f3n has prioritized combating drug cartels and violence, deploying thousands of soldiers and federal police to nine states to address the issue. Human rights violations by military and police forces in the area have also been reported. Mexico's Attorney General, Eduardo Medina Mora, has sent 24,000 soldiers and federal police to combat cartels in nine states. The government's anti-cartel initiative includes institutional and operational reforms. Cooperation from the United States is crucial in combating arms trafficking and money laundering. President Calder\u00f3n aims to take back control of Mexico within two years. The Mexican government's anti-cartel initiative involves sending 24,000 soldiers and federal police to combat cartels in nine states. President Calder\u00f3n aims to take back control of Mexico within two years, despite ongoing drug violence. Reports show that cartels remain intact and violence has spread to new areas, with 1,800-1,900 deaths in cartel-related violence in the first nine months of 2007. President Calder\u00f3n has increased troops' salaries by 50%, unified federal police forces, and launched the \"Platform Mexico\" initiative to enhance law enforcement capacity. Mexico's anti-cartel initiative includes improving law enforcement capacity and creating a database to exchange information on drug cartels. President Calder\u00f3n uses extradition as a tool to combat drug traffickers, with 64 suspected criminals extradited to the US from January to August 2007. Mexico receives significant US counternarcotics assistance. The United States provides counternarcotics assistance to Mexico through the INCLE account, with a budget cut of 22% in FY2008 compared to FY2007 levels. Border security programs typically receive about 35% of INCLE assistance, along with aviation support and training for Mexican law enforcement. The United States and Mexico issued a joint statement in 2007 announcing a multi-year plan for $1.4 billion in U.S. assistance to combat drug trafficking and criminal organizations. The M\u00e9rida Initiative aims to disrupt drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, financial activities, currency smuggling, and human trafficking. The funding for the initiative is through the INCLE account. The proposed FY2008 funding for the Merida Initiative is through the INCLE account, administered by the Department of State. The $500 million funding for Mexico includes equipment and training for law enforcement agencies. Congress did not provide funding for the initiative in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Congressional interest in the proposed supplemental funding for the Merida Initiative is likely to continue. Congressional interest in the proposed supplemental funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative is likely to continue in the second session of the 110th Congress. The Administration requested $450 million for the initiative in Mexico in February 2008. Current U.S. counternarcotics policy focuses on interdiction and eradication of drug shipments, primarily through border security screening efforts along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Calder\u00f3n administration and critics call for expanded U.S. counternarcotics efforts beyond law enforcement. The President's National Drug Control Strategy focuses on prevention, treatment, and disrupting the drug market. Significant progress has been made in reducing youth drug use. U.S. assistance aims to counter drug trafficking organizations and their impact on societies and governments. U.S. assistance aims to counter drug trafficking organizations, improve security, increase economic development, and enhance the rule of law in countries. The Government Accountability Office found that cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico has improved, but further collaboration is needed, including allowing U.S. law enforcement to board Mexican vessels suspected of carrying drugs. In his recent book High Society, Joseph Califano advocates for more assertive international counternarcotics efforts, emphasizing the need for prevention of illicit drug flows into the United States as a foreign policy priority. He calls for strengthening United Nations drug treaties, increasing penalties for drug traffickers, and implementing stronger banking laws to prevent money laundering. The Washington Office on Latin America recommends a combination of U.S. domestic programs and targeted strategies. The Office on Latin America (WOLA) recommended a mix of U.S. domestic programs and targeted foreign aid to Mexico in its report on cartel violence. WOLA proposed reducing cartel revenue by decreasing U.S. demand for drugs through better education and treatment programs. They also suggested implementing background checks for U.S. gun purchases to reduce arms trafficking into Mexico. The Office on Latin America (WOLA) recommends measures to prevent the re-sale and trafficking of weapons purchased in the US to Mexican cartels. They also call for restoration of public order and support for judicial and police reforms in Mexico to combat police corruption. Additionally, Mexico is urged to improve its investigative capacity for drug crimes and extradite major criminals to the US for prosecution. Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue emphasizes the need for demand reduction and arms trafficking control, advocating for increased multilateral efforts in counternarcotics policy. Michael Shifter emphasizes the need for increased multilateral efforts in counternarcotics policy, addressing systemic issues that enable drug cartels to thrive in Latin America. Mexico seeks $1 billion in funding from the US to support counternarcotics efforts, highlighting the importance of reducing arms trafficking, stopping drug earnings flow, and decreasing American demand for illicit drugs. Requesting US assistance is a sensitive issue in Mexico, traditionally wary of intervention. The Director of the White House Office on National Drug Control Policy urged Congress to approve funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative to assist Mexico in combating drug cartels, particularly highlighting the impact of U.S. marijuana consumption on cartel profits. The United States funds alternative development programs in drug crop regions, but not in Mexico. Mexico does not receive funding for alternative development programs in marijuana and opium poppy growing regions, as officials believe there is a weaker correlation between poverty and drug crop cultivation in Mexico compared to other countries in the region."
