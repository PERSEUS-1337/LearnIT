    "content": "The USDA administers various agricultural conservation programs to assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These programs include working lands, land retirement, easement, watershed, and technical assistance programs. The NRCS and FSA are the lead agencies for agricultural conservation within USDA. Funding for most conservation programs is mandatory and obtained through the Commodity Credit Corporation, with about $6.4 billion budget authority for conservation in FY2020. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized most mandatory conservation programs through FY2023. The USDA administers agricultural conservation programs through NRCS and FSA. Funding for most programs is mandatory, with about $6.4 billion budget authority in FY2020. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized most programs through FY2023. Discretionary conservation programs operate with annual appropriations, including an increase in FY2020. The Administration's FY2020 request proposed a decrease in funding for discretionary conservation. NRCS administers all discretionary programs, with the largest being Conservation Operations (CO) funding Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA). The Conservation Operations (CO) program, administered by NRCS, provides conservation planning and assistance nationwide. CO includes Soil Survey, Snow Survey, Water Supply Forecasting, and Plant Materials Centers. Technical assistance is funded through mandatory and discretionary sources, with CO receiving discretionary funding. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposed a decrease in CO funding, aiming to consolidate mandatory and discretionary accounts. This approach has been proposed before but not adopted by Congress. The FY2020 appropriation increases CO funding by $10.1 million from FY2019 and directs funding for conservation programs. NRCS provides technical assistance for agriculture conservation through a network of federal staff. Funding supports salaries, technology development, compliance reviews, grants for additional assistance capacity, and resource assessment reports. Total funding for agricultural conservation has fluctuated in recent years due to various factors, including administration requests and national budget dynamics. Inflation-adjusted dollars for conservation have declined over the past 20 years. Financial assistance programs provide direct payments to landowners for conservation practices. Most programs are authorized through farm bills and receive funding from mandatory sources, not requiring annual appropriations. Technical assistance for farm bill conservation programs is funded through mandatory authorization, not requiring annual appropriations. It supports the delivery of financial assistance by providing designs and specifications for approved conservation practices. Prior to signing a financial assistance contract, technical assistance is considered part of CTA. Once the contract is signed, funding shifts from CTA to the individual mandatory program. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposed transferring funding from mandatory conservation programs to a consolidated account for technical assistance. This concept has been proposed in previous budget requests. A decline in funding for technical assistance could result in a decrease in NRCS staff positions. The number of NRCS staff has declined, with a reduction in funded positions through FY2018. Unfilled positions have further exacerbated this issue. The FPAC Business Center has also impacted staffing and funding levels. The FY2020 appropriation provides $206.5 million for the Business Center, $10 million less than FY2019. Funding realignment in FY2019 included funds from NRCS discretionary accounts and mandatory farm bill conservation program accounts. The FY2019 realignment of funds and staff included transferring approximately 882 staff years from NRCS to the Business Center, aiming to achieve efficiencies within the FPAC mission area. The impact of this transfer on NRCS operations and ability to provide technical assistance to farmers and ranchers remains unclear. Additionally, the realignment may have contributed to the decrease in NRCS staffing levels and increase in unfilled positions. The FY2020 appropriation includes funding for watershed activities, such as Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. The FY2020 appropriation includes $175 million for the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations program, an increase of $25 million from FY2019. Additionally, $10 million is allocated for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, the same as the previous year. The FY2020 appropriation includes $175 million for the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations program, an increase of $25 million from FY2019. The Watershed Rehabilitation Program repairs aging dams previously built by USDA under WFPO. The 2018 farm bill provides $50 million annually in permanent mandatory funding for WFPO and Watershed Rehabilitation activities. The FY2020 appropriation includes funding for the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program, which were reauthorized in the 2018 farm bill. The Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area, created in 2017, includes NRCS, FSA, RMA, and the FPAC Business Center. Funding for NRCS, FSA, and RMA was reduced in FY2019 to realign resources to the FPAC Business Center. The FY2020 appropriation includes $206.5 million for these agencies. The FY2020 appropriation includes $206.5 million for the Business Center, a reduction of $9.8 million from FY2019. The proposed cut is aimed at efficiency improvements, with concerns that it could impact conservation programs. USDA is required to report on efficiency gains, metrics, hiring plans, and vacancies within 60 days of enactment. The Senate committee report expresses concern over delays in filling vacancies at the Center, potentially affecting program deployment. Funds are being transferred to the FPAC Business Center from other accounts, raising worries about reduced funding for NRCS. The Business Center is set to receive $282.8 million in FY2020, with policy provisions in the Agriculture appropriations bill dictating executive branch actions. The FY2020 Agriculture appropriations bill includes policy provisions directing executive branch actions, such as waiving project limits for the WFPO program. These provisions have the force of law for the current fiscal year only and do not have long-standing effects. The FY2020 Agriculture appropriations bill includes policy provisions for the current fiscal year only, comparing provisions in the Farm Production and Conservation Programs and General Provisions titles. Explanatory statements and committee reports provide policy instructions but do not have the force of law. The FY2020 Agriculture appropriations bill includes policy provisions for the current fiscal year only, comparing provisions in the Farm Production and Conservation Programs and General Provisions titles. Explanatory statements and committee reports provide policy instructions but do not have the force of law. Many provisions in report language and bill text address conservation programs that are not authorized or funded within the annual appropriations. Table 4 is divided by the administering agency and by account according to the location of each provision within the two reports."
