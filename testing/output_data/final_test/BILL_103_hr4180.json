SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Federally Recognized Indian Tribe \nList Act of 1994''.\n\nSEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For the purposes of this title:\n        (1) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior.\n        (2) The term ``Indian tribe'' means any Indian or Alaska Native \n    tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village or community that the \n    Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe.\n        (3) The term ``list'' means the list of recognized tribes \n    published by the Secretary pursuant to section 104 of this title. The Congress has plenary authority over Indian Affairs, a trust responsibility to recognized Indian tribes, and recognizes their sovereignty. Indian tribes can be recognized by Act of Congress, administrative procedures, or a US court decision. Once recognized, a tribe cannot be terminated except by an Act of Congress. Congress has rejected the policy of termination. Congress has rejected the policy of terminating recognized Indian tribes and actively works to restore recognition to previously terminated tribes. The Secretary of the Interior maintains a list of federally recognized tribes, which must be accurate, regularly updated, and published for various departments and agencies to determine eligibility for services. The list should include all federally recognized Indian tribes eligible for special programs and services provided by the United States. SEC. 104. PUBLICATION OF LIST OF RECOGNIZED TRIBES. The Secretary will publish a list of recognized Indian tribes eligible for special programs and services. The list will be published within 60 days of enactment and annually thereafter. TITLE II--CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TLINGIT AND HAIDA INDIAN TRIBES OF ALASKA. This title is known as the \"Tlingit and Haida Status Clarification Act.\" The Congress acknowledges the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska as a federally recognized tribe. The Secretary of the Interior published a list of recognized tribes in 1993, omitting Tlingit and Haida. The Secretary cannot terminate tribal status without Congressional approval or diminish their privileges without consent. The Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska remains a federally recognized tribe without Congress's consent. SEC. 203 reaffirms the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska as a federally recognized tribe. SEC. 204 clarifies that this recognition does not affect the relationship with other Alaska Native tribes. SEC. 205 prohibits duplicative services. SEC. 205 prohibits duplicative services for federally recognized tribes in Southeast Alaska, prioritizing other tribes over the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes. For the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians of the Paskenta Rancheria of California, the Secretary of the Interior, the Interim Council, members, the State of California, reservation lands, and service area are defined terms. Federal recognition, rights, and privileges are restored. Federal recognition is extended to the Tribe, restoring all rights and privileges that were diminished or lost under previous laws. The Tribe and its members are eligible for federal services and benefits. The Tribe and its members are eligible for all Federal services and benefits available to federally recognized Indian tribes. This includes hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, and water rights, with the Indian Reorganization Act applicable to the Tribe. No property rights are altered except as specified in the Act. The title does not change any property rights, contractual obligations, or tax responsibilities. The Secretary is required to negotiate with the Tribe to establish an economic development plan, develop the plan within two years of the tribal constitution adoption, and submit it to Congress upon approval. Any real property transfer in the plan must comply with section 305 regarding land held in trust. SEC. 305. TRANSFER OF LAND TO BE HELD IN TRUST. The Secretary will accept real property in Tehama County, California for the Tribe's benefit if there are no legal claims at the time of transfer. Additional acreage may be accepted under the Secretary's authority. The land will be held in trust for the Tribe and become part of the reservation. Within a year of the Act's enactment, the Secretary will compile a membership roll for the Tribe based on specific criteria, including Nomlaki Indian ancestry and previous inclusion on the Paskenta Indian Rancheria distribution roll. The criteria for listing on the Paskenta Indian Rancheria list include being identified as an Indian from Paskenta in official or unofficial rolls prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or being a lineal descendant of a listed individual. After adopting a tribal constitution, membership in the Tribe will be governed by it. The Secretary will accept any available evidence establishing Paskenta Indian ancestry, including information from census records prepared by Special Indian Agent John J. Terrell. Indian Agent John J. Terrell is listed in various official documents related to the Paskenta Indian Rancheria, including census records and distribution lists compiled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1959. SEC. 307. INTERIM GOVERNMENT. The Tribe's governing body will be an Interim Council until a new tribal constitution is adopted. The initial Interim Council will consist of current Tribal Council members and operate under the existing tribal constitution. Any new members must meet membership criteria and be elected in the same manner as Tribal Council members. Upon completion of the tribal membership roll, the Secretary will conduct a secret ballot election for adopting a constitution and bylaws. Within 120 days of adopting the constitution, another secret ballot election will be held to elect tribal officials according to the new constitution. The Secretary has the authority to create regulations to implement the provisions of this title."
