The Social Security Act is amended to adjust state account earnings based on meeting or failing to meet funding goals. If a State account exceeds the funding goal, the amount credited will increase by the interest premium on the excess balance. Conversely, if the balance is below the funding goal, the credited amount will decrease by the interest penalty, with a limit of $2,500,000 per quarter. For any calendar quarter, the adjustment formula is as follows: one-half of one percent of the excess amount for the State with the largest percentage value over the funding goal, and a calculated product for each other State based on their excess balance and percentage value.
