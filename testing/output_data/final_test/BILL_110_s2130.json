The Senate acknowledges the honorable service of the US Armed Forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom. General Petraeus emphasized the need for a non-military solution in Iraq. President Bush highlighted the importance of national reconciliation for lasting security. Diplomatic engagement from Iraq's neighbors and international actors can aid in this process. The United States troop surge in 2007 lacked a diplomatic surge for Iraqi national reconciliation. The Iraq Study Group called for a new international consensus to stabilize Iraq and the region through robust diplomatic efforts. The United Nations Security Council expanded its mission in Iraq to assist with political reconciliation, border security, and humanitarian aid. The US Ambassador to Iraq emphasized the importance of engaging with Iraq's neighbors for stability. The United Nations is now positioned to play a more active role in Iraq, as General Petraeus highlighted the need for greater civilian activity in areas like agriculture and health. The US troop surge in 2007 has not been matched by a civilian surge to help strengthen Iraq's government services. The Senate emphasizes the need for comprehensive diplomatic efforts to assist Iraq in achieving national reconciliation and meeting key benchmarks. It is crucial for Iraq's stability to involve its neighbors in a constructive manner. The Senate calls for diplomatic efforts to stabilize Iraq by addressing outside flows of weapons, fighters, and funding. The President and Secretary of State should prioritize these efforts, appoint a high-level envoy to the Middle East, and establish a regional framework for stability. The Senate calls for diplomatic efforts to stabilize Iraq by establishing a regional framework and appointing an international mediator to engage leaders in national reconciliation efforts. The Senate urges the US to push Iraq's neighbors to establish embassies in Baghdad and support debt forgiveness for Iraq. Diplomatic efforts should focus on helping Iraqi refugees. The United States should provide humanitarian assistance to Iraqi refugees and develop a regional framework for long-term solutions. Diplomatic and civilian resources should be reallocated to stabilize Iraq and strengthen government services."
