    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Entities responsible for the Mokelumne Watershed Interregional Sustainability Evaluation Program may seek state funding for feasibility studies and assessments. Entities involved in the Mokelumne Watershed Interregional Sustainability Evaluation Program may seek state funding for feasibility studies and assessments. State and local government entities are allowed to participate in collaborative discussions regarding a pumped storage project in the upper Mokelumne River watershed, as long as the project does not harm the natural characteristics and values of the river segments. Prior to designating the Mokelumne River or its tributaries as additions to the system, a report analyzing the suitability of the designation must be submitted to the Governor and Legislature. The analysis will consider the impact on water supply development and future water requirements within the watershed. Feasible projects to meet foreseeable demands will be taken into account. The curr_chunk discusses the effects of climate change on river values, feasibility studies included in the Mokelumne Watershed Interregional Sustainability Evaluation, instances when water diversion facilities may be constructed, and State Water Resources Control Board approvals for water appropriation with any restrictions. The report required for potential addition of Mokelumne River segments to the system must include recommendations and proposals, public input, and compliance with Government Code Section 9795. It should be submitted to the Legislature and Governor by December 31, 2017. No dam, reservoir, diversion, or water impoundment facility can be built on designated study segments until December 31, 2021, or completion of recommendations. Exception for domestic water supply to county residents without impacting river's natural state. Excludes Amador Water Agency's pending water rights application 5647X03. The secretary will develop a cost estimate for a study and report, with the state paying up to 50% of the cost and the rest covered by the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority. Private donations can also be used. Certain segments of the North Fork and main stem Mokelumne River are designated for potential addition to the system. The North Fork and main stem of the Mokelumne River are designated for potential addition to the system, with specific segments outlined from various points downstream to upstream of dams and powerhouses. Public Resources Code Section 5093.56 is amended accordingly. Section 5093.56 of the Public Resources Code prohibits state departments from assisting in the planning or construction of water impoundment facilities that could harm designated rivers' free-flowing condition and natural character. The Mokelumne River segments designated for study as potential additions to the system are on hold until December 31, 2021. This does not affect Amador Water Agency's water rights application or the operation of the Mokelumne River Project by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the Mokelumne River due to its unique geographical features. No reimbursement is required for any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts as a result of this law."
