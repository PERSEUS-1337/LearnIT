The \"DRAIN the SWAMP Act\" imposes a 5-year ban on political appointees serving as lobbyists after leaving their government positions.

The \"DRAIN the SWAMP Act\" imposes a 5-year ban on political appointees serving as lobbyists after leaving their government positions, including those in confidential or policy-determining roles under schedule C of part 213 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics may waive these restrictions if it would create an undue hardship for the department or agency to fill the positions. The \"DRAIN the SWAMP Act\" includes a provision for a waiver of the 5-year lobbying ban for political appointees in certain positions if it is necessary to fill those roles with qualified personnel and does not create undue influence or unfair advantage. Amendments are made to Section 207 of the title to reflect these changes. The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 is amended to include a new section on registration as an agent. SEC. 12.
