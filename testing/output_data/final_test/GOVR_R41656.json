    "content": "The recent financial crisis has led to criticisms of the Federal Reserve's handling, with some Members of Congress questioning the need for legislative remedies to avoid similar problems in the future. Critics blame the Fed for policies that allowed the housing bubble to inflate, lax regulation of financial firms, \"bailing out\" financial firms, and engaging in quantitative easing. Some argue that the Fed's statutory mandate for monetary policy should be modified. The \"Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977\" mandates the Federal Reserve to maintain long-term growth of monetary and credit aggregates to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Some economists suggest removing the goals of maximum employment and moderate interest rates, leaving price stability as the sole mandate. This proposal is often paired with the idea of adopting an inflation target for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 mandates the Federal Reserve to maintain long-term growth of monetary and credit aggregates to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Bills have been introduced in Congress to switch the Federal Reserve to a single mandate of price stability by establishing an inflation target for promoting long-term price stability. Companion legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to replace the current mandate with a single mandate of long-term price stability. The proposed bill aims to replace the current mandate of the Federal Reserve with a single mandate of long-term price stability. This would involve establishing metrics, such as an inflation target, to evaluate the achievement of the mandate. The Fed would need to consider various price indices, asset prices, exchange rates, and gold prices in determining these metrics. Additionally, the bill would require the Fed to publicly disclose the metrics and report to Congress any alterations made. Reporting requirements to Congress would focus on whether the goal of long-term price stability is being met. The proposed bill aims to establish a single mandate of long-term price stability for the Federal Reserve. This includes reporting requirements on whether the goal is being met, the instruments and strategy used, and the impact of monetary policy on the dollar exchange rate. The bill aligns with international trends of central banks adopting price stability mandates or inflation targets. In January 2012, the Fed announced a voluntary inflation goal of 2%. The report analyzes the economic arguments for and against shifting to a single mandate of 2% inflation target. It discusses the effects of a mandate change on Fed policymaking and the advantages and disadvantages of different options for implementing an inflation target. The statutory mandate sets the ultimate goals of monetary policy and can be altered only through legislative action. Inflation targeting is a strategic approach to achieving mandated goals and could be codified through legislation or voluntarily adopted internally by the Fed. The discussion revolves around the possibility of implementing a single mandate of price stability, potentially with an inflation target. This could be achieved through legislation or voluntary adoption by the Fed, allowing for flexibility in policy-making while ensuring accountability in achieving the mandate. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, a former advocate of inflation targeting, has defended the current dual mandate of the Fed. He suggested that an inflation target could complement the dual mandate by providing transparency on the numerical inflation rate consistent with long-term price stability. This could reduce public uncertainty about monetary policy and anchor long-term inflation. The explicit statement of a long-run inflation objective can reduce public uncertainty about monetary policy and anchor long-term inflation expectations more effectively. It is debated whether an inflation target is compatible with the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, as it may unintentionally communicate a greater focus on inflation. However, the Federal Reserve's broad discretion over policy implementation means it would not need new authority to implement an inflation target. The Fed has the discretion to adopt an inflation target within its current mandate without needing new authority. In January 2012, the Fed set a 2 percent inflation goal based on monetary policy, stating that it aligns with its statutory mandate. The Fed chose not to set a numerical employment goal as maximum employment is influenced by nonmonetary factors. The Fed reaffirmed its commitment to the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. It follows a balanced approach in achieving these goals and aims to explain its monetary policy decisions clearly to the public. The announcement does not introduce an inflation target within the dual mandate. The Fed has not officially used the term inflation target in its announcement. Economist Edwin Truman identified four key elements of an inflation targeting regime, including mechanisms to determine if the target has been met. The Fed's current policy aligns with Edwin Truman's four key elements of an inflation targeting regime, with a focus on a numerical inflation target. The Fed's longer-run goals meet the essential criterion of price stability. However, critics argue that a single mandate of price stability may not necessarily lead to better economic outcomes compared to the current dual mandate system. The Fed has already delivered benefits under the current dual mandate and is seen as an \"implicit inflation targeter.\" This report considers arguments for a single mandate and inflation targeting as complementary. Critics argue that focusing on low unemployment for short-term political benefits may lead to higher inflation in the long term. The Fed has delivered benefits under the current dual mandate, but there are concerns about policymakers' bias towards overly stimulative policies for short-term political gains, potentially leading to high inflation. Proponents of a single mandate argue it would reduce this bias and result in lower, more stable inflation over time. Empirical evidence is needed to evaluate these claims. The Fed has delivered low and stable inflation, with the CPI consistently below 4% since 1991. In 2009, there was slight deflation, but inflation has generally been below the Fed's 2% goal since 2012. Core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, has been between 1% and 3% since 1995. The Fed has maintained low and stable inflation, with core inflation between 1% and 3% since 1995. Despite unconventional policies post-financial crisis, inflation has not significantly increased. Fed argues these policies are necessary to avoid deflation and its inflation record is comparable to major inflation targeters. In Australia and New Zealand, inflation is slightly higher than in the United States, while in the Euro Area, United Kingdom, and Canada, it is slightly lower. There is debate among economists on whether overall inflation or a core measure is a better benchmark for evaluating the Fed's performance. The European Central Bank is seen as more cautious in monetary stimulus compared to the Fed, but the UK has adopted similar unconventional policies like quantitative easing. Fed's record on price stability since 1995 has been strong, but not as good by other measures. The Fed's record on inflation may be good, despite potential policy bias, as its independence allows it to resist short-term benefits for long-term stability. A mandate change may not be necessary for the Fed to maintain its current effective policies. In the long run, money is neutral, and changes in monetary policy do not have permanent effects on employment levels. The Fed's mandate for \"maximum employment\" is interpreted as keeping unemployment near its natural rate. Some argue that the Fed should focus on price stability to contribute to economic efficiency in the long run. Monetary policy has a significant effect on the business cycle, driving total employment and unemployment in the short run. It can take years for the economy to return to full employment after a downturn, with the economy rarely staying at full employment for long. Economist Olivier Blanchard notes that while money is eventually neutral, monetary policy can impact the real interest rate and output or unemployment for a decade or more. This highlights the relevance of monetary policy on employment as a policy concern. Foreign central banks with single mandates have adjusted monetary policy in response to employment changes. The natural rate of unemployment concept suggests that prolonged periods of high unemployment can raise the natural rate. This could be due to skills erosion during long-term unemployment, making individuals less employable. If correct, monetary policy could influence employment in the long run by preventing hysteresis. Aggressively stimulative monetary policy could limit long-term unemployment post-recession, going beyond maintaining price stability. The dual mandate of the Fed involves balancing combating hysteresis and maintaining price stability, with criticism on conflicting goals and limited instruments. Policy responses for employment and inflation are similar in both single and dual mandate scenarios. Fed is currently concerned about low employment and inflation. In normal circumstances, policy reactions to changes in employment would be similar under a single or dual mandate. However, there are cases when employment and inflation do not move together, such as during \"supply shocks\" like a sharp increase in the price of oil leading to stagflation in the 1970s. High inflation persisted in the 1970s until a recession in 1981. Economists debate whether to adjust monetary policy during stagflation, with some arguing for a single mandate and others for a dual mandate. Policymakers weigh the short-term costs of high unemployment against the long-term benefits of lower inflation. Some economists argue for a dual mandate to balance short-term costs of high unemployment with long-term benefits of lower inflation. Proponents of a single mandate believe it would improve monetary policy by reducing discretion and excessive \"fine tuning,\" leading to more stable economic growth and prices. Some economists argue for a single mandate to improve monetary policy by reducing discretion and increasing transparency. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by providing clearer goals for market participants. Economists argue that economic volatility is caused by external shocks, not policy mistakes. They believe that policymakers need flexibility to respond quickly to these shocks to prevent deeper and more frequent downturns. For example, in 2008, the Fed's ability to introduce innovative policies helped mitigate the financial crisis, showing the importance of flexibility in monetary policy. The Fed's discretion is mainly derived from its independence from Congress and the lack of an outside arbiter to evaluate its decisions. Changing the mandate alone would not significantly affect this discretion, but other provisions in legislation could. For instance, an inflation target could limit policy options. The Fed's transparency is already high, with regular economic forecasts and FOMC members' rate forecasts released. Policy changes are typically hinted at before being announced, and market participants anticipate interest rate decisions. The current transparency practices of the Fed are largely voluntary and may not be affected by a mandate change. Critics argue that the current mandate's broad goals make effective Congressional oversight difficult and the Fed unaccountable for policy mistakes. Proponents suggest that a single mandate, possibly including an inflation target, would improve oversight and accountability by making it easier to evaluate the Fed's performance. Congress has the power to enhance Fed accountability through hearings, audits, and reports. The Federal Reserve's accountability may be hindered by the complexity of the economy and Congress's lack of expertise to assess its performance independently. Congress must be able to determine if bad economic outcomes are caused by the Fed or external factors for effective accountability. The Federal Reserve's accountability is hindered by institutional factors that make it less accountable than a typical executive branch agency. There are no consequences for missing mandated goals, officials do not answer to the President, and the Fed is self-funded and not subject to regular congressional budgetary review. These factors make the Fed less accountable but also more independent from Congress. The Federal Reserve's independence from Congress is seen as desirable for good policymaking. Economists argue that a single mandate would enhance the Fed's credibility, making monetary policy more effective. Despite pursuing quantitative easing, the Fed's credibility with market participants remains strong, as inflation expectations are low and long-term interest rates are at a minimum. The Fed's credibility remains strong with market participants despite criticism for not preventing the last recession. Switching to a single mandate may not provide additional credibility. The Fed's performance during the financial crisis has raised questions about the need for legislative action to improve its effectiveness. The Fed took aggressive steps to stimulate the economy and provide liquidity during the recession, including reducing interest rates to near zero and conducting quantitative easing. Critics argue about the long-term implications, but a less aggressive approach would have led to a deeper and longer recession. The Fed's unconventional policy initiatives during the recession were not required to be justified in terms of its mandate. Critics argue that the underlying cause of the recession was the housing bubble, leading to crippling losses in the financial sector. Critics argue that the Fed could have prevented the damaging effects of the housing bubble by implementing more aggressive interest rate increases earlier on. However, Chairman Bernanke has defended the Fed's actions, stating that it was not a practical policy option at the time due to uncertainty about whether the increase in housing prices was a bubble. The debate over the housing bubble and the Fed's role in it continues. Monetary policy is a blunt tool with potential side effects on the economy. Chairman Bernanke's quotes suggest that a single mandate or inflation target may have prompted the Fed to act sooner to prevent a bubble. Chairman Bernanke's quotes suggest that a single mandate or inflation target may have prompted the Fed to act sooner to prevent a bubble, but tightening policy to avoid a bubble is unlikely. Bernanke stated that monetary policy from 2002 to 2006 was consistent with the Fed's goals of employment and price stability. He also mentioned that a stock-market boom could indicate inflationary pressures, but policy tightening would be to contain inflation, not to stop the boom itself. The dot-com and housing bubbles did not lead to high overall price inflation, making a single mandate less effective in addressing such bubbles. The Fed's mandate does not currently include considering house prices in inflation targets. Asset bubbles are a policy concern for the future, with some suggesting the Fed should prevent them. H.R. 1174 / S. 238 requires the Fed to factor in asset prices in its inflation target. Critics argue that quantitative easing could lead to high inflation, but the Fed believes it is necessary for price stability. The Fed believes quantitative easing is necessary for a timely economic recovery, to reduce the threat of deflation, and to support mortgage markets and housing market recovery. The link between QE and price stability is direct, and the Fed's discretion in pursuing policies consistent with price stability would not have been hindered by a single mandate. The Federal Reserve expects inflation to remain low and sees a risk of it staying below optimal levels for economic growth. To support economic recovery and price stability, the Fed will use all available tools, including increasing its balance sheet by purchasing more mortgage-backed securities and agency debt. Additionally, the Fed will buy longer-term Treasury securities to improve private credit markets. The Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over six months and later expanded to $600 billion by mid-2011 to promote economic recovery and price stability. The Fed will adjust its asset-purchase program as needed to support maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve's decisions aim to avoid deflation and achieve price stability under the dual mandate. H.R. 1174 / S. 238 allows for the purchase or sale of government agency securities under specific circumstances with a two-thirds vote. Inflation, measured by the consumer price index, has been lower since 1992. There is a debate on whether the Fed should focus more on headline inflation than core inflation. Headline inflation has outpaced core inflation in recent years, leading to criticism of the Fed for being slow to respond to inflation above 3% before the last two recessions. The focus on core inflation excludes volatile components like food and energy to better represent underlying inflationary pressures and avoid false positives in interest rate changes. The Fed's focus on core inflation has led to criticism for being slow to respond to inflation above 3% before recessions. Switching to a single mandate may not solve the problem as long as the Fed retains discretion to define price stability. The Fed's longer-run inflation goal defined price stability in terms of headline inflation, raising questions about a shift away from core inflation emphasis. In 2008, the Fed intervened financially to prevent the failure of Bear Stearns and AIG, citing them as \"too big to fail.\" Critics argue that these interventions increase long-term risk in the financial system by creating moral hazard. The Fed also provided liquidity to non-bank financial firms through lending facilities, sparking debate over assisting firms it does not regulate for safety and soundness. The Fed provided assistance to firms it regulated for safety and soundness, primarily through emergency lending authority. The Dodd-Frank Act amended this authority to prevent future bailouts while allowing for emergency liquidity facilities. Critics debated repealing or restricting the Fed's emergency lending authority. Some economists believe excessive risk-taking by financial firms caused the financial crisis, leading to panic and government bailouts. Critics argue that the Fed failed to anticipate and address the crisis in time, with regulatory oversight over consumer products like mortgages being questioned. The housing bubble crisis could have been avoided if the Fed used its consumer protection powers to prevent people from taking out unsuitable mortgages. Non-traditional mortgage products with high default rates allowed borrowers to borrow more than they should have. Chairman Bernanke admitted that regulators should have done more to protect consumers. The Fed's failure to prevent the crisis was not unique among regulated firms. The Fed's regulatory powers, including consumer protection responsibilities, are not explicitly mentioned in its statutory mandate but are found in the Federal Reserve Act and other U.S. Code sections. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the Fed's consumer protection responsibilities. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the Fed's consumer protection responsibilities under the Federal Reserve Act. With the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, housed within the Fed, there are considerations for implementing an inflation target, which could impact economic and policy outcomes. Congress could mandate an inflation target in statute or leave it to the Fed's discretion, with parameters such as the level of inflation to target and the price index to use. The decision to set an inflation target involves considerations such as the level of inflation to target, the price index to use, whether to base the target on actual or forecasted outcomes, and whether to target a point estimate or a band. Setting the target in law would limit the Fed's discretion and accountability, with some policymakers seeing this as a benefit for reducing economic risks while others view it as a drawback for limiting flexibility in dealing with unexpected economic developments. The first question in setting an inflation target is determining the inflation rate consistent with price stability. Price stability, in the context of setting an inflation target, involves aiming for low and stable inflation over time to minimize the costs associated with inflation. A 0% inflation rate may not be feasible due to historical trends and the potential for deflation. Alan Greenspan suggests that price stability is best achieved when inflation is kept low and stable. The FOMC's long-run goal of 2% inflation may be considered price stability, as low but positive inflation is believed to be equivalent to true price stability. An alternative view suggests that a little inflation, like 4%, can benefit the labor market by overcoming \"money illusion\" where workers are less willing to accept nominal wage cuts. Workers may suffer from \"money illusion,\" leading to faster labor market clearing and lower real wages during high unemployment. Higher inflation rates could prevent price deflation in recessions and give more room for monetary policy. However, transitioning to higher inflation rates may be challenging and could destabilize public inflation expectations. Some economists suggest targeting price index values instead of inflation rates for better outcomes. Some economists suggest targeting price index values instead of inflation rates for better outcomes, arguing that it would lead to less uncertainty about future prices. However, targeting the price level could be destabilizing due to the need to compensate for unexpected price shocks. In practice, countries typically target inflation rather than the price level. The question of what data source should be used for the inflation target raises issues regarding which official measures of inflation to consider, such as the CPI, changes in asset prices, or wages. The CPI is a well-known measure but may overstate inflation due to methodological problems. The GDP deflator issued by BEA is the broadest measure of inflation, while the measures issued by BEA, including the PCE index selected by the Fed, are only released quarterly and subject to data revisions. There is a debate on whether the inflation target should be based on one single measure or consider several different measures. The Fed faces a tradeoff between maximizing accountability and transparency or taking a more holistic approach to decision making. The debate on inflation targeting includes considerations of using multiple measures or concepts to preserve drawbacks perceived in the dual mandate. Questions arise regarding whether volatile elements should be omitted from the target, such as in core inflation measurements that exclude food and energy prices. Economists have proposed alternative measures of core inflation with more desirable qualities. Targeting core inflation can help the Fed avoid missing its target due to volatile components, but may lead to suboptimal performance if headline inflation outpaces core for extended periods. The Fed's longer-run inflation goal is defined in terms of headline inflation, although core inflation is often referenced. Alternative approaches, such as targeting overall inflation with exceptions for unusual circumstances, could result in too much discretion and lack of transparency. The Fed's dilemma lies in whether to target actual or forecasted inflation. Targeting actual inflation may lead to frequent misses due to unexpected shocks and lags in monetary policy effects. This could result in raising rates when projections call for lower rates in the near future. The Fed faces a dilemma in choosing to target actual or forecasted inflation. Targeting future inflation could reduce transparency and accountability, making it challenging to penalize missed targets. Accountability may shift towards evaluating the accuracy of the Fed's forecasts rather than actual outcomes. The design of an inflation target, whether a point estimate or a range, is also a crucial decision. The Fed's dilemma lies in choosing between targeting actual or forecasted inflation. The decision on whether to set a point estimate or a range for the inflation target is crucial. A range would explicitly show tolerance for small deviations and make misses due to unexpected events less frequent, but if unexpected shocks are large, a wide range could render the target meaningless. The Fed's accountability to Congress in setting inflation targets raises questions about the need for tangible consequences for missing the target due to the challenges of creating effective penalties given the Fed's high degree of independence. The Fed's independence from Congress limits the ability to impose budget penalties for missed targets. Proposed penalties include automatic reports to Congress or removal of the Chairman for persistent or significant target misses. Concerns exist that external factors could unfairly impact the Fed's performance. The Fed's performance on price stability in the past two decades has been good, with inflation consistently below 4% since 1991. However, there have been concerns about lower-than-desired inflation since the financial crisis. Introducing an inflation target is seen as a way to ensure good policies are maintained, but past performance does not guarantee future results. Introducing an inflation target is a way to \"lock in\" good policies and potentially impact the Fed's discretion, depending on the characteristics of the inflation targeting regime. The dual mandate and other institutional factors contribute to the Fed's independence and discretion in setting monetary policy. The Fed's inflation target was designed to constrain discretion in policy decisions. In 2008, inflation rose to 3.8%, the highest since 1991. The Fed's announcement of a 2% inflation goal in 2012 aligns with Truman's framework for inflation targeting. This could reduce the importance of proposed statutory changes to the mandate. The Fed's inflation target was designed to constrain policy discretion. Countries with a single mandate or inflation target consider changes in unemployment when setting monetary policy. Arguments for an inflation target and single mandate include improved accountability and transparency, leading to better economic outcomes. Flexibility in interpreting an inflation target could diminish these benefits. The desire for legislative change regarding the Fed's performance stems from discontent, but it is unclear if a mandate change would address these issues. Criticisms of the Fed's performance, such as bailouts and lax supervision, are not directly related to its monetary policy mandate. The failure of monetary policy to prevent the housing bubble may support a mandate change, but a single mandate may not necessarily alter the Fed's behavior in the future. A single mandate focusing on price stability may not necessarily change the Fed's behavior in addressing future asset bubbles. Critics suggest that a mandate change to explicitly address bubbles or financial stability could be more effective. The Fed's focus on core inflation has been criticized for not ensuring price stability effectively. However, this does not imply that the Fed has neglected price stability or that a single mandate would result in more aggressive countercyclical policy. The Fed believes quantitative easing is necessary for price stability, even with a single mandate. Fed retains discretion on measures to focus on."
