    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries in the Pacific Act of 2012\" or the \"REFI Pacific Act of 2012\". In 2000, the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery was declared a Federal fisheries disaster due to low stock abundance and an overcapitalized fleet. In 2003, a buyback program was established to remove excess fishing capacity with a $35,700,000 loan authorized by Congress. The buyback program in 2003 removed limited entry trawl Federal fishing permits, representing 46% of total landings. $4,243,730 in interest accrued before fee collection procedures were established in 2005. The Pacific Coast groundfish fishery transitioned to a catch share program in 2011, with fishermen's expenses expected to include fees of approximately $450 per day by 2015. In the period from 2006 to 2011, the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery had an annual average ex-vessel revenue of $85,945,847, with $45,000,000 coming from the limited entry trawl fishery. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries currently administers industry-funded capacity reduction programs in the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands crab fishery. The reduction programs in various fisheries have long-term loan repayment periods based on fees for future landings. A fifth buyback program was implemented in 2012 for the Alaska Purse Seine Salmon Fishery. In the past, Federal disaster assistance grants have been issued to provide economic assistance to fishermen leaving the industry. In 1996 and 1997, a $23,000,000 Federal disaster assistance grant was issued for the New England Groundfish Fishery to remove permits and vessels. The purpose of the Act is to refinance the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Fishing Capacity Reduction Program to protect the fishery and fishermen's livelihood. REFINANCING OF WEST COAST GROUNDFISH FISHERY FISHING CAPACITY REDUCTION LOAN. The Secretary of Commerce will issue a loan to refinance the debt funding the fishing capacity reduction program for the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery. The loan will be issued in accordance with specific laws and must have a defined maturity term. The Secretary of Commerce will issue a loan for the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery with a maturity of 45 years. The fee for the loan cannot exceed 3% of the fish value, and funding for implementation is authorized at 1% of the loan amount."
