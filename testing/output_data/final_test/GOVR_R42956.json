    "content": "U.S. interests in the Western Hemisphere are diverse, including economic, political, security, and humanitarian concerns. The region has strong economic linkages with the United States, with the U.S. being a major trading partner and source of foreign investment. Free trade agreements have enhanced economic relations with 11 countries. Latin American nations, especially Mexico and Venezuela, supply almost one-third of U.S. imported crude oil. The region is a significant source of U.S. immigration, both legal and illegal, driven by geographic proximity and economic conditions. Curbing illicit drug flow from Latin America and the Caribbean has been a key focus of U.S. relations with the region for decades. The United States has had a major interest in the Western Hemisphere for decades, focusing on security cooperation, democratic development, and responding to natural disasters. The Obama Administration outlined four priorities for U.S. policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean: promoting economic and social opportunity, ensuring citizen security, strengthening democratic institutions, and securing a clean energy future. The State Department's policy priorities for Latin America and the Caribbean focus on promoting stable, prosperous, and democratic nations in the region. The Obama Administration emphasizes partnership, shared responsibility, and mutual respect in its approach towards the region. President Obama highlighted the theme of equal partnership at the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson reiterated these principles at the June 2012 Organization of American States General Assembly meeting in Bolivia. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson and Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the United States' commitment to working with hemispheric nations as equal partners to promote democracy, security, peace, development, poverty alleviation, social inclusion, and address climate change. Kerry stated that the relationship sought is not about US intervention in other American states' affairs. Assistant Secretary of State Jacobson reiterated the administration's commitment to productive engagement in the Americas, emphasizing partnership initiatives with Latin America. President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in December 2014, moving towards normalization of relations. President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in December 2014, emphasizing engagement and normalization of relations. The policy priority is to expand economic opportunity in Latin America to address poverty and inequality, with significant improvements seen since 2002. The Pathways to Prosperity Initiative, launched in 2008, aims to empower small businesses, facilitate trade, build a modern workforce, and promote green business practices. The Inter-American Social Protection Network, supported by the U.S., focuses on reducing social disparities and extreme poverty. The 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, started in 2011, aims to increase Latin American students studying in the U.S. The Obama Administration launched initiatives to increase Latin American students studying in the U.S. and promote economic opportunities in the Americas. This includes funding for development in Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras to combat hunger and poverty, as well as programs like the Small Business Network of the Americas and Women's Entrepreneurship in the Americas. The Americas (WEAmericas) program aims to boost women's economic participation and support small and medium enterprises. The Innovation Fund of the Americas, led by USAID, finances innovative solutions for development challenges. Citizen security is a top policy priority in Latin America due to high levels of crime and violence, often linked to drug trafficking. The Central America-Mexico corridor is a major route for illicit drugs entering the U.S., with high murder rates in some countries. U.S. support includes partnerships to combat these issues. U.S. support in combating drug trafficking and organized crime in Latin America includes partnerships like the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico, CARSI, CBSI, and CSDI. Plan Colombia, initiated in FY2000, was a significant program in this effort. The focus on strengthening democratic governance aims to build on progress made in the region. The policy priority in Latin America is to strengthen democratic governance by supporting the rule of law, human rights, good governance, and political competition. This includes improving state institutions and defending press freedoms and democratic rights. The U.S. officials have been addressing human rights abuses in countries like Cuba and Venezuela, as well as threats to political rights and civil liberties in the region. Assistant Secretary of State Jacobson has raised concerns about the erosion of freedom of expression in some countries and emphasized the importance of protecting the Inter-American human rights system. The Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) was introduced in 2009 to enhance collaboration on clean energy in Latin America and the Caribbean, where many countries face challenges with climate change and energy security. The Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) promotes clean energy, energy security, and greenhouse gas reduction through bilateral and multi-country initiatives involving international organizations and the private sector. President Obama and Colombia launched the Connecting the Americas 2022 initiative at the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012 to achieve universal access to reliable, clean, and affordable electricity in the hemisphere. The Latin American and Caribbean region has seen significant political and economic development over the past three decades, with increasing independence from the United States. The Latin American and Caribbean region has undergone significant political development over the past three decades, transitioning from authoritarian regimes to elected democracies. Most countries have moved towards centrist policies, with reduced threats from military coups. Colombia's peace negotiations with FARC offer hope for resolving the region's oldest civil conflict. In 2013 and 2014, several countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region held elections for head of government, with former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet winning a new term. Other countries like Costa Rica and El Salvador also saw new leaders elected, signaling a trend towards free and fair elections in the region. In El Salvador, the ruling leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front candidate Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n won the presidential election. In Panama, Juan Carlos Varela of the center-right Paname\u00f1ista Party became president, defeating the candidate from the ruling Democratic Change party. In Colombia, incumbent President Juan Manuel Santos won a runoff race focusing on peace negotiations with the FARC. In Antigua and Barbuda, the ruling United Progressive Party was ousted by the opposition Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party due to economic issues. In Antigua and Barbuda, the Labour Party led by Gaston Browne won due to economic issues. In Bolivia, Evo Morales of the Movement Toward Socialism party easily won a third term. In Brazil, Dilma Rouseff of the Workers Party narrowly won a second term. In Uruguay, Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez of the Broad Front coalition defeated Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou in a second round. Despite improvements in political rights, challenges remain in delivering public services and ensuring accountability in the region. Many street protests in Latin America in 2013 were sparked by new middle classes demanding better public services, leading to social turmoil and economic crises. The quality of democracy in the region has been eroded by factors such as organized crime and executive abuse of power, resulting in setbacks in liberal democratic practices. Abuse of power in several countries has led to setbacks in liberal democratic practices, with elected leaders consolidating power at the expense of minority rights. Media freedom has deteriorated due to organized crime-related violence and politically driven attempts to curb critical media. Leftist populism in countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Nicaragua is seen as a threat to democracy, with tough treatment of political opponents and dismantling of institutional checks and balances. Competitive authoritarianism is taking hold in these countries, where democratic institutions exist but are abused by the incumbent to skew the playing field against opponents. In January 2014, Nicaragua's National Assembly approved constitutional changes eliminating presidential term limits and the 35% threshold for election, paving the way for President Ortega to seek a fourth term in 2016. Freedom House's 2014 report categorized countries in the region as free, partly free, or not free, with only Cuba ranked as not free and 10 countries, including Nicaragua, as partly free. The region has undergone significant economic changes, with concerns about government corruption in Panama and improvements in political rights and civil liberties in Nicaragua. The evaluation by Freedom House highlighted these developments, although it was completed before Nicaragua's legislature eliminated presidential term limits in January 2014. In the 1990s, Latin America shifted towards export promotion, foreign capital attraction, and privatization of state enterprises. The region experienced economic downturns in 2002 and 2009 due to global crises, with varying impacts on different countries. Despite fluctuations, the region rebounded in 2010 and 2011 with strong growth rates, but growth rates declined to 2.5% in 2012. Economic growth rates in Latin America declined to a regional average of 3.1% in 2012 and 2.5% in 2013, with weak performances from Brazil and Mexico dragging down the average. The 2014 regional forecast by ECLAC was initially for a 3.2% growth rate but was later reduced to 1.1%, the lowest since 2009. Slow or negative growth rates in major economies like Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico, along with global economic conditions, impacted the region's growth. ECLAC forecasts a slightly faster growth rate of 2.2% for 2015. In 2014, Venezuela faced economic challenges with shortages, falling reserves, high inflation, and a decrease in oil prices, leading to a 3% contraction. Argentina's economy also contracted by 0.2% due to uncertainty from government creditor confrontations. Latin America has made progress in combating poverty and inequality through increasing per capita income levels and targeted public expenditures like conditional cash transfer programs. Brazil and Mexico were pioneers in these efforts. Latin America has seen a decline in inequality since 2002, with a clear downward trend in income concentration. The region's middle class has expanded by 50% over the past decade, with over 150 million people now considered part of it. Political stability and economic growth have boosted confidence in solving internal issues, reducing dependency on the United States. Latin American and Caribbean countries have diversified their economic and diplomatic ties with countries outside the region, including China, which has become a major trading partner. Total Chinese trade with the region grew significantly from 2002 to 2013. The region's increased independence from the United States is also influenced by growing ideological diversity and Brazil's rising global influence. Several Latin American regional integration organizations have been established in recent years. Several Latin American regional integration organizations have been established in the past few years, reflecting the region's increasing independence, growing internal cooperation, and ideological diversity. The Venezuelan-led Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA) was launched in 2004 by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez with the goals of promoting regional integration, socioeconomic reform, and alleviating poverty. ALBA currently includes nine member countries and is often associated with anti-American rhetoric, although some observers believe it has lost its initial energy. The Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA) was created in 2004 by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to promote regional integration and alleviate poverty. However, some observers believe ALBA has lost its initial energy. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was established in 2008 to promote political, economic, and security coordination in South America. It has played a role in resolving disputes between countries in the region. UNASUR, established in 2008, helped resolve tensions between Colombia and Venezuela, and internal conflicts in Bolivia and Ecuador. Questions have been raised about its efficacy and financial support. In 2014, UNASUR supported dialogue in Venezuela, but talks between the government and opposition broke down. The Pacific Alliance, formed in 2011, aims to promote trade integration among its members. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was established in December 2011 with the goal of boosting regional integration and cooperation among 33 hemispheric nations, excluding the United States and Canada. Some observers believe CELAC could diminish the role of the Organization of American States (OAS), while others argue that it lacks a permanent staff or secretariat to compete with the OAS. CELAC, established in 2011, aims to enhance regional cooperation among 33 nations. It lacks a permanent staff or secretariat to rival the OAS. The organization held summits in 2013 and 2014, declaring the region a \"zone of peace\" and committing to nonintervention. Despite efforts to reduce U.S. influence, the U.S. remains engaged through the OAS and affiliated organizations. The Summit of the Americas process, affiliated with the OAS, is crucial for U.S. engagement with Latin American nations. The sixth summit in Colombia in 2012 showed U.S. policy differences on Cuba and anti-drug strategy. The upcoming 2015 summit in Panama faced challenges due to Cuba's desire to attend, opposed by the U.S. and Canada. Many Latin American countries threatened to boycott the summit if Cuba was not invited. In 2015, Latin American countries insisted on Cuba's invitation to the Summit of the Americas, leading to a policy dilemma for the Obama Administration. Despite continuity in U.S. policy towards Latin America, there were significant changes under the Obama Administration, emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility. President Obama announced his participation in the summit, highlighting human rights and democracy as key themes. President Obama's new policy approach towards Cuba in 2014 shifted from sanctions to engagement, emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility in Latin America. The Obama Administration provided anti-drug and security support to Colombia, Mexico, and Central America through initiatives like M\u00e9rida and CARSI. Assistance to Mexico focused on rule of law programs and community resilience against crime. The CBSI was established to address potential drug trafficking shifts to the Caribbean region. The Obama Administration provided assistance to Colombia, focusing on rule of law, human rights, and economic development programs, as well as security and drug interdiction efforts. U.S. assistance levels to Colombia decreased as the country took over responsibility for programs once funded by the United States. Trade bills for FTAs with Colombia and Panama negotiated under the Bush Administration were enacted into law in October 2011 after efforts by the Obama Administration to address congressional concerns. Another trade initiative continued by the Obama Administration was formal trade negotiations. The Obama Administration continued trade negotiations with countries like Mexico, Chile, and Peru through the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement. In 2013, a bipartisan group of Senators developed a framework for comprehensive immigration reform legislation, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The House did not consider comprehensive immigration reform in the 113th Congress. The House did not address comprehensive immigration reform in the 113th Congress. In response to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, the House passed legislation to nullify them. Both houses focused on addressing the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Obama Administration made policy changes on Latin America, emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility. Development assistance to the region remained high despite overall U.S. assistance declining. Significant changes were made to Cuba policy by the Administration. The Obama Administration made significant changes to Cuba policy, lifting restrictions on family travel and engaging in various areas. The detention of Alan Gross hindered bilateral relations, but after his release in 2014, a new policy approach towards normalization was unveiled. Congress actively participated in Latin America and Caribbean policy during the 113th Congress, focusing on issues like U.S. support to countries in the region. During the 113th Congress, U.S. support to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean was a key focus. This included aid for drug trafficking and transnational crime, support for Colombia's peace agreement efforts, assistance to Haiti post-earthquake, and discussions on various topics like democracy challenges, energy issues, and relations with countries like Brazil and Mexico. Hearings also covered concerns about Iranian activities in the region and the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. Legislative actions during the 113th Congress included approval of various bills such as foreign aid appropriations for Latin America, the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act, the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, and modifications to the U.S. cotton program in the 2014 farm bill. During the 113th Congress, legislative actions included approval of foreign aid appropriations for Latin America, the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, and modifications to the U.S. cotton program in the 2014 farm bill. Additionally, there were omnibus appropriations for FY2014 and FY2015, the Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2014, and the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014. During the 113th Congress, legislative actions included approval of foreign aid appropriations for Latin America, the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, modifications to the U.S. cotton program in the 2014 farm bill, omnibus appropriations for FY2014 and FY2015, the Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2014, and the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014. Additionally, there were resolutions on comprehensive immigration reform, Haiti's recovery, and reconstruction, as well as political and human rights situations in Venezuela. The House approved an FY2014 supplemental appropriations bill for repatriation and reintegration activities in Central America, and a Senate bill was introduced to address the issue of unaccompanied minors. Foreign aid remains crucial for advancing U.S. policy priorities in Latin America and the Caribbean, with aid programs covering a range of areas such as democracy promotion, economic reform, education, health, and security. Despite declining assistance levels since FY2010, the U.S. provided an estimated $1.5 billion in aid to the region in FY2014 through USAID and the State Department. The 113th Congress focused on appropriations for foreign aid and other programs, with final actions on FY2013 and FY2014 appropriations delayed until March 2013 and January 2014, respectively. In July 2014, President Obama requested supplemental appropriations to address a surge in unaccompanied alien children arriving at the U.S. border from Central America. In response to a surge in unaccompanied alien children arriving at the U.S. border from Central America, President Obama requested $300 million for programs in Central America. Congress did not approve the request, but the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 provided funding exceeding the Administration's $1.3 billion request for the region. The legislation allocated at least $24 million more than requested for Colombia, $64 million more for Mexico, and $130 million more for the Central America Regional. Latin America is a major source of migration to the United States, with countries like Mexico, El Salvador, Cuba, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic being among the top 10 countries of birth for the U.S. foreign-born population. Factors driving this migration include family ties, poverty, political and economic instability, natural disasters, proximity, and crime and violence. Increased border enforcement since the mid-1990s has made unauthorized entry into the U.S. more difficult and expensive, leading to a \"caging effect.\" Increased border enforcement has unintentionally created a \"caging effect\" that encourages unauthorized immigrants to settle in the United States. This has led to more reliance on alien smugglers and increased vulnerability to kidnapping and human trafficking. Latin American governments support comprehensive immigration reform in the U.S. to normalize the status of illegal migrant workers and create guest worker programs. President Obama's temporary executive actions provide relief from deportation and work authorizations for certain unauthorized immigrants. Immigration reform was a major focus during the 113th Congress, with the Senate passing a bill that included increased border security and paths to legalization for unauthorized immigrants. The House also approved five immigration bills. Attention later shifted to addressing the surge in unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border and responding to President Obama's executive actions on immigration. El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua sought extensions for their temporary eligibility. Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua are seeking extensions for their temporary protected status (TPS), while Guatemala has requested inclusion in the program. TPS is granted to eligible nationals when a country is affected by armed conflict, natural disasters, or other extraordinary conditions. The eligibility for TPS expires for El Salvador in March 2015, Honduras and Nicaragua in March 2016, and Haiti in January 2016. The increase in deportations to Latin America and the Caribbean is also a significant issue in U.S. relations with the region. The increase in deportations to Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly those with criminal convictions, has raised concerns about the impact on border communities and the safety of deportees. Officials are calling on the United States to provide better information on deportees with criminal records and offer reintegration assistance to help governments support returning nationals. Illegal emigration from Central America's \"northern triangle countries\" has surged in recent years. Illegal emigration from America's \"northern triangle countries\" (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) has surged due to factors like poverty, violence, and smuggling networks. The push factors include family reunification and better economic opportunities. Analysts doubt the governments' ability to address these root causes. Mexico is also pressured to secure its southern border and combat transmigration. Key policy issues in 2014 focused on responding to the surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America apprehended at the U.S. Southwest border. The request to Congress to address increased migration from Central America included a $3.7 billion proposal, with $300 million allocated for programs in Central America. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 113-235) provided $430 million for Central America, including additional funds for CARSI aid and the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure included $79 million in additional M\u00e9rida Initiative funds for securing Mexico's southern border. The House passed H.R. 5759 in response to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, declaring them null and void. The 114th Congress will need to address FY2015 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, responsible for implementing the executive actions. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43320 and CRS Report R43798. The Latin America and Caribbean region is a fast-growing trading partner for the United States, with trade growth surpassing that of U.S. trade with Asia and the European Union since 1998. Despite challenges, the region shows significant potential for economic partnerships. The United States has strengthened economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean region through free trade agreements, with Mexico being a significant trading partner. Total U.S. exports to the region were valued at $407 billion in 2013, while imports were valued at $438 billion. In January 1994, the United States entered into six FTAs with 11 countries in the region, including Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru. Some South American economies like Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela have not formed trade agreements with the US. The US also extends trade preferences through programs like GSP and CBTPA to countries in the region. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) provided unilateral trade preferences to certain countries in the Andean region until its expiration in 2013. Analysts suggest using trade policy to enhance hemispheric cooperation and improve regional supply networks, with the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) potentially impacting U.S. trade and investment ties with Mexico, Chile, Peru, Canada, and other Pacific countries. This could raise issues related to NAFTA and offer updated trade opportunities. The proposed TPP may open issues related to NAFTA and update provisions in areas such as intellectual property rights, labor rights, and environmental protection. Key policy issues during the 113th Congress included services trade, IPR protection, worker rights, environmental issues, and regulatory cooperation. Questions arose about broadening trade policy efforts to Latin America as only three countries were part of the TPP negotiations. The Pacific Alliance, a trade initiative among Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, also garnered interest. The Pacific Alliance, consisting of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, is a trade initiative that has garnered interest. Latin America and the Caribbean play a significant role in U.S. counternarcotics policy due to drug trafficking. Energy reform in Mexico has implications for U.S. oil imports and business opportunities. Relevant reports include NAFTA at 20, TPP negotiations, trade preferences, and the Pacific Alliance trade integration initiative. Drug trafficking in Latin America has led to high levels of violence and homicides. Governments in the region struggle with overwhelmed law enforcement and border control agencies, as well as widespread corruption. Many believe that the ongoing demand for illicit drugs in the U.S. is a major factor contributing to crime and violence in the Western Hemisphere. The Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy advocated for drug decriminalization and treating addiction as a public health issue. Latin American presidents criticized international drug control efforts at the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012, leading to a call for alternative drug policies evaluation. The first of two OAS reports assessed the drug problem in the Americas, finding different manifestations in different countries. It suggests flexible policies tailored to individual country's needs, including potential decriminalization or legalization of marijuana. The second report presents four scenarios for the future of drug control in the region. The OAS reports suggest policy options for addressing the drug problem in the Americas, including building institutional capacity, exploring alternatives to prohibitionist drug control, engaging local communities to combat drug-related issues, and considering changes in marijuana-related crime policies. The Obama Administration remains opposed to these alternative approaches. Some Latin American countries have started to modify drug laws to decriminalize and reduce penalties for drug possession and consumption. Uruguay established a legal market for recreational cannabis, while Bolivia has shifted its counternarcotics policy. Obama Administration opposes national-level policies legalizing or decriminalizing controlled substances. Some view regional drug policy initiatives as overdue breakthroughs, while others fear a growing divide between U.S. and Latin American drug control policies could benefit criminal elements. The 113th Congress debated drug policy reform in the Western Hemisphere, including counternarcotics goals and foreign aid budget plans. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs marked up the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2014, H.R. 4640, on June 26, 2014, to establish a commission for reviewing and improving U.S. domestic and international drug policies. Congressional interest in the issue is evident through various reports on drug control policy and security cooperation in the region. The America Regional Security Initiative focuses on U.S. attention to terrorism in Latin America post-9/11, with a focus on cooperation and counterterrorism efforts. The State Department highlighted the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as the main perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the region. Despite some improvements in counterterrorism capabilities, challenges such as corruption, weak institutions, and lack of resources hinder progress. Policymakers are also concerned about Iran's increasing activities in the region. Iran's increasing activities in Latin America have raised concerns about its attempts to circumvent sanctions and ties to Hezbollah. A State Department report in June 2013 suggested that Iran's influence in the region is decreasing, but opinions vary on the level of threat posed by Iran. The State Department's 2013 terrorism report stated that there were no known operational cells of Al Qaeda in the region. The 2013 terrorism report stated that there were no known operational cells of Al Qaeda or Hezbollah in the hemisphere, but ideological sympathizers in South America and the Caribbean provided support to terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia. Cuba has been on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1982. In December 2014, President Obama called for a review of Cuba's designation on the state sponsors of terrorism list. Both Cuba and Venezuela are on the State Department's list of countries not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about Venezuela's lack of cooperation. Officials have expressed concerns about Venezuela's lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts, relations with Iran, and support for drug and weapons trafficking by senior officials. Improved Venezuelan-Colombian relations have led to closer cooperation on antiterrorism, counternarcotics efforts, and border security. The 113th Congress oversaw terrorism concerns in the Western Hemisphere, focusing on Iranian and Hezbollah activities. Two legislative initiatives related to Cuba were introduced but not acted upon. In the 113th Congress, two legislative initiatives related to Cuba were introduced but not acted upon. H.R. 1917 would have rescinded any determination that Cuba supports international terrorism, while H.Res. 262 called for the extradition of fugitives from justice in Cuba to the United States. Cuba's harboring of fugitives wanted in the U.S. has been a longstanding issue mentioned in the State Department's annual report on terrorism. The Organization of American States (OAS) has historically aligned with U.S. priorities in the Western Hemisphere, but as other members develop independent foreign policies, the OAS has become less receptive to U.S. initiatives. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the organization's direction, with some suggesting the U.S. should no longer fund it due to policies counter to U.S. interests. Others believe the OAS is still important but hindered by administrative and financial issues. Financial problems are hindering the Organization of American States (OAS) from effectively carrying out its core missions. The 113th Congress showed interest in the OAS and passed the OAS Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 to support the organization and implement management and programmatic reforms. President Obama signed the act into law, directing the Secretary of State to develop a strategy for the proposed changes and provide regular updates to Congress. The 113th Congress passed the OAS Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 to support the Organization of American States (OAS) and implement management and programmatic reforms. President Obama signed the act into law, directing the Secretary of State to develop a strategy for the proposed changes and provide regular updates to Congress. Additionally, funding was allocated for the U.S. assessed contribution to the OAS, as well as voluntary contributions for development assistance and democracy promotion programs. Argentina has maintained a democratic tradition since 1983, with President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner leading the country since 2007. President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, from the Peronist party, is in her final year of the second term as Argentina's president. She cannot run for re-election in 2015 due to term limits. The country has a diverse economy with a strong agricultural sector and a history of economic crises, including a default on significant foreign debt in 2001-2002. Argentina is now preparing for the upcoming presidential election with several candidates in the race. Argentina has resolved most of its debt with creditors, including the IMF and foreign governments. However, unresolved debt with private creditors is hindering the country's access to international credit markets and economic recovery. U.S.-Argentine relations are based on shared interests in peace, nuclear nonproliferation, human rights, education, and science and technology cooperation. Commercial relations between the two countries are strong. Key Policy Issues: The 113th Congress maintained an interest in Argentina due to defaulted debt owed to private creditors and the U.S. government, as well as concerns about the treatment of U.S. investors and alleged government influence over the media. The 113th Congress maintained interest in Argentina due to defaulted debt and concerns about government influence over the media. Congress also focused on the investigation of the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association, allegedly linked to Iran and Hezbollah. U.S. policy towards Brazil is evolving as the country's global influence grows, with increased engagement on international and bilateral issues. The evolving relationship between the United States and Brazil has occasionally frustrated U.S. policymakers due to differences in foreign policies and national interests. The countries can maintain a constructive partnership through transparent and respectful engagement, despite occasional disputes. However, relations were strained after reports of the NSA intercepting Brazilian communications, leading to the postponement of a state visit by President Dilma Rousseff in 2013. In October 2013, a state visit by President Dilma Rousseff was postponed, cooling U.S.-Brazil relations. The 113th Congress focused on U.S.-Brazil commercial ties, with a hearing highlighting opportunities for growth in trade and investment. Congress approved changes to the U.S. cotton program in the farm bill reauthorization, helping resolve a trade dispute with Brazil. In December 2014, Congress approved $10.5 million in foreign aid for conservation efforts in the Brazilian Amazon, despite no funding request from the Obama Administration for FY2015. The bill also supported the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination and Promote Equality. Many Caribbean nations serve as transit countries for illicit drugs from South America to the U.S. and European markets. The Caribbean region, including countries like the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica, are identified as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries. Homicide rates have increased due to gangs, organized crime, and drug trafficking competition. The Obama Administration initiated the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) in 2009 to reduce illicit trafficking, enhance public safety, and promote social justice in the region. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was established by the Obama Administration in 2009 to address drug trafficking, enhance public safety, and promote social justice in the Caribbean region. U.S. funding for the program totaled $327 million from FY2010 to FY2014, focusing on areas such as maritime security, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. In FY2015, the Obama Administration requested nearly $57 million for the CBSI, with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees proposing similar funding levels. The House bill directed at least $64 million for the CBSI and required a State Department report on funding distribution by country from FY2010 to FY2014. The Senate report (S.Rept. 113-195) did not specify funding for the CBSI but supported it, with a requirement for assistance only to governments committed to fighting corruption and reforming security forces. Congress approved funding of at least $64 million for the CBSI in the FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 113-235), with $28 million from the ESF foreign aid account. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure approved at least $64 million for the CBSI, with $28 million from the ESF foreign aid account. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs held hearings on the CBSI in 2013 and 2014 due to concerns about security and human rights conditions in Central America. Central America has struggled with rising crime and violence due to social exclusion and weak security institutions. Transnational criminal organizations exacerbate the situation by controlling territory for drug trafficking. The US government supports the region through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) with funding for law enforcement operations and addressing socioeconomic challenges. Congress allocated $803.6 million for CARSI between FY2008 and FY2014. Key Policy Issues: Security and human rights concerns in Central America were a focus during the 113th Congress. Hearings were held to assess the effectiveness of CARSI and the human rights situation in Honduras. Congressional attention was also given to the increasing number of Central American children apprehended at the U.S. border. Funding for security programs in Central America saw an increase in FY2015, with $260 million allocated for CARSI programs. In FY2015, funding for security programs in Central America increased by $100 million compared to FY2014. The additional resources aimed to improve prosperity, strengthen border security, combat trafficking and gangs, and support counternarcotics and law enforcement activities. The bill also allocated $5 million for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala and $3 million for Guatemalan police units addressing sexual assaults. Human rights conditions on security aid to Guatemala and Honduras were maintained with slight alterations. For more details, refer to CRS Report R41731 and CRS Report RL34112. Colombia, a key U.S. ally in Central America, has been in an internal armed conflict for fifty years fueled by drug trafficking. The U.S. and Colombia have a close partnership focused on counternarcotics and counterterrorism, which has expanded to include sustainable development, human rights, and trade. The partnership between the U.S. and Colombia has broadened to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, and regional security. Through Plan Colombia, the Colombian government has regained control over its territory, reduced poverty and homicide rates, and made progress in combating drug trafficking and terrorism. The U.S. Congress provided over $9.5 billion in assistance between FY2000 and FY2014, but support is now being gradually reduced as programs are transferred to Colombian control. Concerns remain about human rights conditions in Colombia. President Juan Manuel Santos shifted from a military approach to preparing for post-conflict, focusing on peace negotiations with FARC and ELN. Former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe won a Senate seat as a critic of Santos. Despite retaining a majority in Congress, Santos faces challenges in implementing his peace platform. Santos faces a divided Congress with Uribe leading the opposition. Peace talks with FARC are uncertain but have made progress on key issues. In mid-August 2014, negotiators grappled with reparation and justice for conflict victims, with victim representatives joining the talks. The final topic of how to end the conflict remains controversial. The 2014 elections showed Colombian ambivalence towards punishment, forgiveness for FARC crimes, extradition, disarmament, and reintegration. Talks were briefly suspended in November 2014 when the FARC captured a Colombian general, but resumed in December after the captives were released. The 113th Congress closely monitored Colombia's progress in security, counternarcotics, human rights, and trade, particularly focusing on the peace negotiations. In the future, Congress may consider shifting U.S. assistance to Colombia if a peace accord is signed. They are concerned about the U.S. role in Colombia's fight against drug trafficking and armed groups. Congress approved the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement in 2011, eliminating tariffs. The Obama Administration requested $281 million in foreign assistance for Colombia in FY2015, which Congress fully funded in various accounts. Cuba remains a one-party communist state with a poor human rights record. In 2006, Fidel Castro's brother Ra\u00fal succeeded him with stability. Ra\u00fal Castro was reappointed as President in 2013 for a second term, with Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel as his successor. Ra\u00fal Castro has implemented gradual economic policy changes, including expanding self-employment. The government has reduced political prisoners but increased short-term detentions and harassment. US policy towards Cuba includes economic sanctions and support for the Cuban people through broadcasting. The Obama Administration maintained a dual-track approach towards Cuba, lifting restrictions on family travel and remittances while keeping economic sanctions in place. They called for the release of Alan Gross, a U.S. government subcontractor detained in Cuba. However, on December 17, 2014, President Obama announced significant developments in U.S.-Cuban relations, including the release of Alan Gross by the Cuban government. President Obama announced the release of Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds by the Cuban government, along with the exchange of an imprisoned U.S. intelligence asset for three Cuban intelligence agents. He also declared a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards engagement rather than sanctions. The President outlined steps to normalize relations, including reestablishing diplomatic relations. The President outlined three major steps towards normalization with Cuba: reestablishing diplomatic relations, reviewing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and increasing travel, commerce, and information flow. He acknowledged that he cannot lift the embargo due to legislation but looks forward to engaging Congress in a debate about it, as the embargo is tied to conditions in Cuba. The embargo on Cuba cannot be lifted at this time due to legislation tied to conditions in Cuba, including the presence of a democratically elected government. Key policy issues in Congress include economic and political developments in Cuba, human rights concerns, and U.S. policy towards the island nation. The imprisonment of Alan Gross remains a significant concern for many Members. In 2014, Congress completed action on an omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 113-76) that continued funding for Cuba democracy and human rights projects, as well as Cuba broadcasting. The House and Senate versions of the FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure had provisions on travel restrictions, but these were not included in the final omnibus bill.

Some Members criticized the President for not obtaining concessions from Cuba to advance human rights, while others supported a better way to support change in Cuba. The direction of U.S.-Cuban relations is likely to be hotly debated in the 114th Congress. Haiti is also in a political crisis as the expiration date for terms of most of the Haitian legislature approaches. President Michel Martelly's commitment to the democratic process is being questioned due to his government's failure to hold legislative elections. Haiti is facing a political crisis as legislative elections are overdue, leading to protests and opposition boycotts. President Martelly's commitment to democracy is questioned, with the possibility of ruling by decree if elections are not held by January 12, 2015. Prime Minister Lamothe resigned after pressure from Martelly, who also called for a consensus government to be formed. Haiti faces challenges in its recovery efforts post-earthquake, with slow reconstruction aid and a cholera epidemic linked to U.N. peacekeepers' camp. Victims seek compensation, but the U.N. claims diplomatic immunity. The U.N. refuses to compensate cholera victims citing diplomatic immunity, while an independent expert calls for full reparation and punishment for those responsible. Donors urge Haiti to strengthen the National Police, with plans to increase officers to 15,000 by 2016. Despite opposition, President Martelly is working to re-establish the Haitian army, with 41 recruits trained by Ecuador for engineering projects. The Parliament would need to approve the army's reconstitution. The opposition-controlled Parliament would need to vote to reconstitute the abolished army in Haiti. U.S. policy priorities for Haiti include strengthening democracy, improving security, and promoting economic development. Other concerns involve the effectiveness of U.S. aid, human rights protection, and combating trafficking. The Obama Administration granted Temporary Protected Status to Haitians in the U.S. after the earthquake, and the DHS announced the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program for 2015. The Obama Administration granted Temporary Protected Status to Haitians in the U.S. after the earthquake, and the DHS announced the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program for 2015. The program will expedite reunification for those scheduled to receive entry visas within two years, benefiting only a small portion of approved Haitian residents. Key policy issues for the 113th Congress included Haiti's overdue elections and the impact of a court ruling in the Dominican Republic that could render some Dominicans, mostly of Haitian descent, stateless.

About 65 Members of Congress called on the U.N. to address the cholera outbreak in Haiti and criticized labor practices in Haitian factories. In July 2014, both houses approved the Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2014, signed into law in August 2014. The law directs the Secretary of State to coordinate and transmit a three-year strategy for Haiti to Congress, including specific steps and benchmarks for assistance. Aid to Haiti is conditioned on holding free and fair parliamentary elections, respecting judicial independence, combating corruption, and improving governance and financial transparency. The bill prohibits funds for Haiti until these conditions are met.

The government's inability to resolve the case of 43 abducted students in Guerrero has sparked ongoing protests and criticism. The federal mishandling of the investigation into the abduction of 43 students in Guerrero has sparked protests. U.S.-Mexican relations evolved during Mexico's presidential transition, with a focus on economic ties, education, and trade facilitation. Energy cooperation has accelerated with Mexico's historic energy reforms. Security cooperation under the M\u00e9rida Initiative continues, focusing on justice sector reform and securing Mexico's southern border. Mexico has increased efforts to combat illegal Central American migration and faces frustration from some U.S. stakeholders over water deliveries in the Rio Grande Valley. Key policy issues in U.S.-Mexican relations during the 113th Congress included immigration reform, border security funding, the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, and oversight of the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Congress provided $194 million in M\u00e9rida assistance to Mexico in FY2014. In FY2014, Congress provided $194 million in M\u00e9rida assistance to Mexico.

U.S.-Mexican energy cooperation and Mexico's participation in the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations were also of interest during the 113th Congress. The United States historically had close relations with Venezuela, a major oil supplier. However, friction in bilateral relations increased under the leftist populist government of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who passed away in March 2013. After Ch\u00e1vez's death, Venezuela held presidential elections.
