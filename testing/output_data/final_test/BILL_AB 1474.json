    "title": "AB 1474",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Part 53 is added to Division 7 of Title 3 of the Education Code, known as the Community College Career Technical Education Bond Act. It defines terms like \"Committee\" and \"Fund\" related to the Act. The proceeds from bonds issued will be deposited in the Community College Career Technical Education Bond Fund. The Chancellor of the California Community Colleges can issue grants from the fund for purchasing and maintaining career technical education facilities and equipment in regions that demonstrate a need for such resources to meet local employment demands. Community colleges specializing in various career technical education fields can charge tuition and fees, with fund money supplementing, not replacing, these costs. Article 4 of the Fiscal Provisions allows for the issuance of $500 million in bonds to fund the purposes outlined in the legislation, with the full faith and credit of the State of California pledged for repayment. The Treasurer shall sell the bonds authorized by the committee under specific terms and conditions. The bonds will be prepared, executed, issued, sold, paid, and redeemed according to the State General Obligation Bond Law, with all its provisions applying to this part. The Community College Career Technical Education Bond Act Finance Committee is created for issuing and selling bonds. The committee includes the Governor, Controller, Treasurer, Director of Finance, and Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, with the Chancellor serving as chairperson. Members can designate representatives to act on their behalf. The committee may act with a majority vote to determine the issuance of bonds for specified actions. Bonds can be issued progressively, and the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges is considered the \"board\" for bond law purposes. In addition to regular state revenue, a specific amount must be collected annually to pay off bonds. All officers responsible for revenue collection must take necessary actions. Funds from the General Fund are appropriated to pay off bond principal and interest, as well as for other specified purposes. The board may request a loan from the Pooled Money Investment Account for carrying out a specific purpose, not exceeding the unsold bonds amount authorized by the committee. The board must execute necessary documents for obtaining and repaying the loan, with the loaned amounts to be deposited in the fund for allocation according to this part. The Treasurer may maintain separate accounts for bond proceeds invested with federal tax advantages to pay required payments or take actions to maintain tax-exempt status and obtain federal advantages for state funds. The Director of Finance may authorize withdrawal from the General Fund of an amount not exceeding unsold authorized bonds for the purpose of this part. The withdrawn amounts shall be deposited in the fund and returned to the General Fund with interest from bond sale proceeds. All money deposited in the fund from bond premiums and interest is reserved for bond interest payments. The cost of bond issuance is covered by bond proceeds, with any remaining costs shared among programs funded by the bond sale. The bonds issued under this part may be refunded according to the State General Obligation Bond Law. Voter approval for bond issuance includes approval for refunding bonds. Proceeds from bond sales are not considered \"proceeds of taxes\" under the California Constitution. Section 1 of this act will take effect upon approval by voters of the Community College Career Technical Education Bond Act, to be voted on in the November 8, 2016, statewide general election."
