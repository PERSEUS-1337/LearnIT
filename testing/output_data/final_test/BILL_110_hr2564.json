    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2007\". Congress finds that some individuals plan to clone human beings using somatic cell nuclear transfer, a technique used in animals. Scientists warn of the risks of producing stillborn or unhealthy children through cloning, which they consider unethical. Cloning humans would turn reproduction into a manufacturing process, potentially creating children in laboratories to specific requirements. Cloning raises ethical concerns due to asexual reproduction, blurring parental roles, potential unauthorized reproduction, and the creation of cloned embryos for research or treatment purposes. The ethical concerns of human cloning include the creation of tissues for treatment, condemnation of creating life for exploitation, and the need for a ban on cloning to prevent the process at the beginning stages. The ethical concerns of human cloning include the creation of tissues for treatment and the need for a ban on cloning to prevent the process at the beginning stages. Cloning of DNA fragments, cell cloning, and embryo cloning of nonhuman animals are considered appropriate uses of medical technology. The Council of Europe acknowledged the ethical issues surrounding human cloning in the preamble to the 1998 Additional Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings. The creation of genetically identical human beings through human cloning is deemed contrary to human dignity and a misuse of biology and medicine. Collaborative efforts in human cloning impact international commerce, with at least 23 countries, including Canada, France, and Germany, banning all human cloning. The United Nations has called for a ban on all human cloning, and attempts to create cloned human embryos for stem cell research have been made. The development of embryonic stem cell lines has been unsuccessful, with a recent case in South Korea involving the exploitation of women to obtain human eggs without success. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING. Title 18, United States Code, amended to include CHAPTER 16--HUMAN CLONING. Sec. 301 defines human cloning as a form of asexual reproduction using human somatic cells. Sec. 302 prohibits human cloning in any form, making it illegal for any person or entity in interstate commerce. The legislation prohibits human cloning in any form, including performing or attempting it, participating in such attempts, or importing cloned products. Violators face fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. Civil penalties may apply for violations involving financial gain. The legislation prohibits human cloning in any form, with violators facing fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. Civil penalties may apply for violations involving financial gain. Scientific research in areas not prohibited by the section is allowed, including research in cloning techniques for non-human entities. The legislation prohibits human cloning in any form, with violators facing fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. Civil penalties may apply for violations involving financial gain. Scientific research in areas not prohibited by the section is allowed, including research in cloning techniques for non-human entities. Human Cloning is addressed on page 301."
