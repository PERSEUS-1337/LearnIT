    "content": "This report examines marketplace lending, a type of nonbank lending done by online companies using innovative technology. The industry has experienced rapid growth and increased scrutiny by regulators, media, and the public. Marketplace lending creates benefits and risks, raising policy questions. The report provides an overview, analyzes benefits and risks, discusses existing regulation, regulatory issues, and possible future developments in the industry. Marketplace lending is a rapidly growing industry with companies developing new business models. Incumbent lenders are adopting marketplace lending technologies. This report examines marketplace lenders' characteristics, comparing them to traditional lenders and discussing future performance and regulation. Loans are made to individuals and small businesses, operations are online, and underwriting is automated. Marketplace lending is a growing industry with online operations and automated underwriting. Lenders are funded through equity or selling loans to investors. Loans are unsecured, small, and short-term, sold as individual notes rather than pooled securities. These characteristics are common in marketplace lending but not universal. Marketplace lending involves online and automated processes, with loans typically being unsecured, small, and short-term. While traditional banks also offer online applications, they differ in their business models, including physical locations, loan officers, and deposit-taking. The distinction between marketplace lending and traditional lending is becoming blurred as lenders adopt each other's practices. Financial technology report focusing on marketplace lenders who offer unsecured small loans with high interest rates based on creditworthiness. Borrowers, usually individuals or small businesses, apply online, providing personal and financial information for automated processing. Marketplace lenders use algorithms to assess creditworthiness of borrowers, offering quick loan approval and funding within days. Direct lenders hold loans on their balance sheets, raise funds by issuing equity to investors, and face credit risk if borrowers default. Lenders increasingly resemble nonbank lenders by using new methods to raise funds. Indirect lenders match loans to investors, who select loans based on interest rates and risk profiles. Marketplace lenders partner with banks to originate loans, then sell them to investors using payment dependent notes. Marketplace lending involves payment dependent notes directing investor payments based on loan performance. Lenders earn fees without facing losses in defaults. In 2017, marketplace lenders originated $26 billion in loans, accounting for less than 1% of the total loan market. However, the industry has seen rapid growth with a 163% annual compounding growth rate. The marketplace lending industry has seen rapid growth, with a 163% annual compounding growth rate between 2011 and 2015. Predictions suggest originations could reach $90 billion by 2020, with potential for $386 billion to migrate from banks to marketplace lenders by 2025. There are 111 marketplace lenders in the US, with some originating billions of dollars in loans. For example, Lending Club focused on personal loans and originated $9.0 billion in 2017, while OnDeck, a small-business lender, originated $2.1 billion. OnDeck, a small-business lender, originated $2.1 billion in loans in 2017. Funding for the loans comes from individuals and large institutional investors, such as hedge funds and private investment firms. The industry initially relied on peer-to-peer lending but has shifted towards institutional funding, making it more similar to traditional nonbank lenders. Institutional investors now purchase whole loans, a trend driven by marketplace lenders establishing low delinquency rates. Some institutional loan owners have successfully securitized marketplace loans. Banks collaborate with marketplace lenders in various ways, with small and large banks purchasing loans. One marketplace lender finances nearly 10% of its loans with small banks, while another has an agreement allowing a bank to buy up to 25% of its loans. Specialized banks are currently the main participants in this business model. Banks collaborate with marketplace lenders by purchasing up to 25% of the lender's loans, using their own filters to select loans. This arrangement allows banks to benefit from low-cost underwriting without creating their own online platforms. However, borrowers may not be aware of the bank's involvement, limiting the bank's ability to build customer relationships or offer additional products. Banks also enter into referral partnerships to maintain closer relationships with borrowers. The bank refers customers to marketplace lenders, collecting a fee in return. White label partnerships allow banks to be associated with credit provision while benefiting from marketplace lenders' cost advantages. These partnerships show how traditional lenders are adopting marketplace-lending activities. In these partnerships, the bank sets underwriting standards and holds the loans, while the marketplace lender handles the online platform and automation. This type of lending differs from traditional marketplace lending. Marketplace lending, as defined in this report, involves a marketplace lending company acting as a third-party vendor for a bank. Proponents believe marketplace lending offers advantages over traditional lending, such as lower cost structures, more accurate underwriting, and faster application processes. They argue that these advantages will lead to growth and transformation in credit acquisition for individuals and small businesses, potentially making credit more affordable and accessible, especially for underserved market segments. Marketplace lenders may have cost advantages over banks due to online-only processes and automated underwriting, resulting in lower operating costs. However, it is unclear if they have a total cost advantage over other nonbank lenders. Some analysts question this advantage, citing lower funding and marketing costs for banks. Marketplace lenders may have cost advantages over banks due to online-only processes and automated underwriting, resulting in lower operating costs. Early analyses suggest that marketplace lenders' costs per loan may decrease as they grow and refine their business models. Automated underwriting used by marketplace lenders is argued to be more accurate than traditional processes. Marketplace lenders use various data points, including income, debt, and credit score information, to assess borrower repayment likelihood. They may analyze additional factors like utility bill payment history and social-network activity. This gives them a potential advantage over traditional lenders, but established lenders can adopt similar technologies. Additionally, marketplace lenders can better meet borrower preferences and reduce time costs. Marketplace lenders offer speed and convenience to borrowers by leveraging internet and mobile technology. Traditional lenders may need to update their systems to compete, but could potentially do so at a lower cost. The impact of marketplace lending on financial markets and the economy is not yet fully understood, but it could lead to lower rates for borrowers, better returns for investors, and increased credit availability. Marketplace lenders offer lower rates for borrowers, better returns for investors, and increased credit availability. Lower costs of originating and servicing loans could result in savings passed on to consumers through lower interest rates and fees. Accurate underwriting could extend credit to creditworthy borrowers who may not have been approved otherwise. Marketplace lenders can provide credit to borrowers who may be denied by traditional lenders, such as small businesses and individuals with a lack of credit history. Traditional lenders struggle to make small loans profitable due to high underwriting costs, while marketplace lenders with lower costs can profitably offer these loans. Assessing borrowers without credit history is a challenge for traditional lenders, but marketplace lenders can overcome this barrier. Marketplace lenders use innovative data to improve credit assessments compared to traditional lenders. Concerns exist about risks in the industry, including untested underwriting accuracy during economic downturns. Traditional banks could benefit from adopting similar data-driven methods to enhance credit availability. Some marketplace lenders generate revenue from origination fees without holding loans, potentially leading to risky lending practices. High funding availability and demand during economic expansion with low interest rates may not be sustainable in different economic conditions. The failure of a marketplace lender could disrupt loan servicing, posing risks to borrowers, investors, and the financial system. Adverse outcomes could include high delinquency rates, affecting borrowers' credit availability and causing losses for investors. The accuracy of data-driven algorithms used by marketplace lenders is difficult to determine without a long history of data for comparison. Marketplace lending has grown substantially during the current economic expansion, where most loans are expected to perform well. However, there are concerns that bad underwriting, large losses, or marketplace lender failures could create systemic stress in the future. Marketplace lending has grown significantly during the current economic expansion, with concerns about potential risks during the next economic downturn. Observers worry about the untested underwriting methods and the ability of marketplace lenders to attract borrowers and investors in changing economic conditions. Investors are funding high-interest-rate loans in marketplace lending, seeking higher returns in a low-rate environment. Banks and nonbank lenders may be more resilient to changing conditions due to diversified assets and stable funding sources like deposits. Finance companies, similar to marketplace lenders, rely on market funding rather than deposits. Marketplace lenders face potential risks due to their reliance on market funding instead of deposits. This can lead to incentives to weaken underwriting standards and originate bad loans, as lenders do not hold the loans on their balance sheets. Unlike traditional lenders subject to risk-retention rules, marketplace lenders are not bound by these regulations, potentially creating a higher risk of making bad loans. Marketplace lenders face risks due to their reliance on market funding and lack of regulatory oversight. The potential for lender failure creates uncertainty in loan servicing, especially for relatively inexperienced marketplace lenders. Borrowers could be harmed if marketplace lenders are unable to process payments or transfer servicing in the event of a failure. Borrowers face risks from faulty underwriting in marketplace lending, leading to potential harm such as higher interest rates or loans to unqualified borrowers. Automated underwriting algorithms may unintentionally discriminate based on protected characteristics, impacting credit access. Investors also face risks related to credit assessment accuracy. Investors in marketplace loans face risks due to the accuracy of credit assessment by proprietary underwriting systems. Uncertainty exists regarding the future performance of marketplace loans if underwriting proves to be inaccurate, leading to potential unexpected losses. The failure of marketplace lending firms is a normal part of a market economy, but widespread failure could result in a sharp contraction in credit availability. Marketplace lending poses risks to investors due to credit assessment accuracy and potential unexpected losses. The industry's growth and interconnectedness could threaten systemic stability in the future. Federal and state regulations govern marketplace lending. Marketplace lending is subject to various regulations and requirements, including securities registration, consumer protection, and state-level regulatory compliance. The existing regulatory system was not designed for online marketplace lending, leading to uncertainty in its application and effectiveness. Issues include potentially inconsistent state regulation, lack of supervisory oversight, and risk-retention requirements. Participating firms must adhere to federal and state regulations when making loans and selling to investors. The Securities Act of 1933 requires issuers of securities to register with the SEC and provide detailed information to investors to prevent fraud. Securities issuance, consumer protection, and fair lending are key issues in marketplace lending, which must comply with federal and state regulations. Marketplace lenders issuing securities must comply with registration and reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Exemptions from SEC registration are available for certain lenders based on criteria such as size and funding sources. Companies can also qualify for reduced reporting as an \"emerging growth company\" with annual revenues under $1.07 billion. Regardless of registration status, marketplace lenders are liable for investor losses. Marketplace lenders are liable for investor losses due to false or omitted information in offering materials. They verify some borrower-provided information but not all, stating unverified information in their materials. Securities issued by marketplace lenders backed by a single loan are not considered asset-backed securities subject to the risk-retention rule. This regulation aims to encourage responsible lending, with most marketplace lenders issuing notes backed by a single asset. Marketplace lenders issue notes backed by individual loans to avoid certain reporting requirements and risk-retention rules. They are subject to consumer-protection laws like the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibit discrimination in credit transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Trade Commission Act prohibit unfair practices in consumer lending, including discrimination based on certain characteristics. Marketplace lenders are subject to laws related to debt collection, privacy, and credit-reporting practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Trade Commission regulate marketplace lending to ensure compliance with consumer-protection laws. The CFPB and FTC enforce federal consumer-protection laws on nonbank lenders, including marketplace lenders. They have rulemaking authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. Marketplace lenders may also be subject to consumer compliance requirements and supervision by federal bank regulators. Additionally, they are subject to state-level laws. State laws and regulations impose obligations and costs on marketplace lenders, including registration with state securities commissions, obtaining licenses to operate, and limits on interest rates and fees. These raise questions about the extent to which marketplace lenders should be subject to federal or state laws. Policymakers and observers debate the extent to which marketplace lenders should be regulated at the federal or state level. Proponents argue that current regulations hinder growth, while some express concerns about the effectiveness of existing laws. Compliance with multiple state laws is seen as burdensome. Some observers question if current regulations adequately address risks in marketplace lending, including concerns about regulatory arbitrage. This section will cover uncertainties over federal or state regulation. The text discusses uncertainties surrounding federal and state regulations for marketplace lenders, including the debate over state-by-state versus federal regulations. Proponents argue for federal oversight to streamline regulations, while others advocate for state-level regulations for consumer protection. State regulators argue that state-level regulations provide oversight and consumer protections for marketplace lenders. Recent court rulings have created uncertainty about whether federal or state law will apply, leading to proposals for clarity. Bills in the 115th Congress aim to address legal issues, and the OCC is accepting applications for national bank charters from fintech companies. These proposals seek to ensure federal law preempts certain state regulations, supported by those who find state regulations burdensome. State regulations are a point of contention, with supporters of proposals aiming to preempt state laws that are seen as burdensome. Marketplace lenders may use an indirect lending model to bypass state usury laws, with FDIC-insured banks able to export their interest rates across states. Federal law preempts state usury laws for FDIC-insured banks, allowing them to operate under the laws of their incorporating state. Certain judicial decisions have created uncertainty over whether states may enforce their usury laws against nonbanks that purchase loans from FDIC-insured banks, affecting the \"valid when made\" principle. Nonbanks acquiring loans from FDIC-insured banks may not have the right to export maximum interest rates across states, leading to legal ambiguity. Several recent judicial decisions have raised doubts on whether nonbanks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws under the \"valid when made\" principle. Courts have ruled that nonbanks engaging in \"lender-like\" activities may not be able to avoid state usury laws, as they are considered the \"true lenders\" based on the economic realities of the transactions. Several recent judicial decisions have raised doubts on whether nonbanks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws under the \"valid when made\" principle. Courts have ruled that nonbanks engaging in \"lender-like\" activities may not be able to avoid state usury laws, as they are considered the \"true lenders\" based on the economic realities of the transactions. In 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that federal law did not preempt state-law usury claims brought against a nonbank debt collector that had purchased debt from a national bank. This legal uncertainty presents challenges for marketplace lenders who rely on the assumption that the banks they partner with are the \"true lenders.\" Marketplace lenders face uncertainty regarding the \"true lender\" status of banks they partner with, potentially leading to adjustments in their business models to comply with state usury laws. Proposed bills in Congress aim to clarify issues related to third-party loan arrangements, including establishing guidelines for determining when a bank is a \"true lender\" and codifying the \"valid when made\" principle. Proponents argue that proposed bills in Congress would clarify uncertainty around \"true lender\" questions and the \"valid when made\" principle, potentially increasing credit availability through third-party relationships. Opponents fear these bills could weaken state-level consumer protections. One solution to uncertainty for marketplace lenders and financial technology firms could be granting them national bank charters, subjecting them to all laws and regulations applicable to national banks. In 2016, the OCC began examining eligibility for special purpose national bank charters for certain financial technology companies. The OCC released a whitepaper calling for public comments on granting special purpose national bank charters to fintech companies engaged in banking without taking deposits. Marketplace lenders have the option to apply for these charters, but it is uncertain how many will choose to do so. Fintech firms granted the charter will be subject to the same high standards as national banks. The OCC stated that fintech firms granted the charter will be subject to high standards of safety and soundness, but may need to consider differences in business models and risks. Striking a balance in the specific parameters of the new charters will affect the outcomes of issuing fintech charters. If the OCC is too accommodating, marketplace lenders could gain advantages without sufficient safeguards, potentially creating risks and giving them an advantage over traditional banks. If too stringent, there may be no incentive for marketplace lenders to apply for a charter. The OCC's authority to grant charters to marketplace lenders may be challenged, as state regulators have expressed intent to file legal challenges. Previous lawsuits against the OCC were dismissed due to lack of standing and claims not being ripe for adjudication. State regulators may challenge the OCC's authority to grant charters to marketplace lenders. Observers have differing views on the advisability of a national bank charter for these companies. Proponents see it as a way to ease regulatory burden, while opponents question the OCC's authority and potential risks. Marketplace lenders, if granted special purpose national bank charters as proposed by the OCC, would be subject to the OCC's supervisory authority. Federal oversight for marketplace lenders is generally less active compared to banks, but partnering with banks could make them subject to supervision by the bank's regulator. The bank's regulator may indirectly supervise marketplace lenders through partner banks, who are ultimately responsible for overseeing third-party relationships. Concerns exist about potential harm to borrowers due to lack of federal oversight for direct lenders. One solution could be subjecting marketplace lenders to CFPB supervision if policymakers deem it necessary. The CFPB has authority to supervise nonbanks like marketplace lenders under certain circumstances, including those involved in mortgage loans, payday lending, and private education loans. Congress could direct the CFPB or another agency to provide closer federal supervision for marketplace lenders if deemed necessary. Marketplace lenders selling loans have not been required to adhere to risk-retention rules. Marketplace lenders generally have not been required to adhere to risk-retention rules, which were adopted after the financial crisis to prevent imprudent lending. These rules require institutions to hold a portion of the underlying assets on their balance sheet when securitizing loans. Some argue that marketplace lenders should be subject to these rules to maintain careful underwriting practices. The marketplace-lending industry is young and involves uncertainty. Key developments to watch include traditional lender responses to new innovations, marketplace lending performance during and after a recession, resolution of regulatory issues, and how incumbent lenders may adapt to marketplace lending. The future will reveal how marketplace lending integrates into traditional lending practices. The extent to which marketplace lending becomes part of traditional bank and nonbank practices may impact regulatory responses. Banks may choose not to compete directly with marketplace lenders due to low profit margins on small loans. Banks may avoid costs by not entering this market but risk losing market share to more profitable segments if marketplace lending grows. Alternatively, banks could start their own online platforms to compete with emergent companies. One option for banks is to independently start their own online platforms for automated lending, potentially matching loans with investors. Banks could also purchase existing online marketplace lenders. However, there are risks involved, such as large investments and potential weakening of underwriting standards to increase loan originations. Another common option for banks is to enter into collaborative relationships. Banks can also collaborate with marketplace lenders by investing in loans or creating online platforms together. Uncertainties in marketplace lending will be clarified during economic cycles, revealing the sustainability of business models. Comparing delinquency rates will provide insight for potential investors and analysts. The marketplace lending industry's performance during credit cycles will impact funding availability. Policymakers will monitor regulations' effects on industry growth. Special purpose charters for marketplace lenders will clarify regulatory parameters. Policymakers may consider assigning federal agencies to oversee marketplace lenders more closely, potentially requiring statutory changes. Risk-retention rules could be applied to marketplace lenders if their business models pose similar risks to traditional loan securitizers. Uncertainties regarding \"true lender\" and \"valid when made\" issues may be resolved through legal or legislative means. The rapidly growing marketplace lending industry involves various stakeholders and presents areas of uncertainty due to its lack of track record and interconnectedness. Opportunities for benefits exist for borrowers, investors, and underserved borrowers. The current regulatory system may not effectively regulate the marketplace lending industry, which poses potential risks and benefits for borrowers, investors, and the financial system. As the industry matures and regulatory issues are resolved, the impact of marketplace lending on the economy will become clearer."
