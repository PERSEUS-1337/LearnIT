    "content": "The Energy Innovation Hubs Authorization Act of 2010 may be cited as the \"Energy Innovation Hubs.\" The Energy Innovation Hubs program aims to enhance the nation's economic, environmental, and energy security by providing grants to consortia for establishing and operating hubs focused on advanced energy technology development. The Secretary of Energy will coordinate these activities to avoid duplication with other Department of Energy initiatives. The Energy Innovation Hubs program aims to coordinate activities with other Department of Energy research entities, industry, and consortia operating the Hubs to share research results and opportunities for collaboration. The Secretary will administer each Hub through the appropriate Department program office. The Hub's technology development focus is assigned under paragraph (2). Consortia eligible for grants must be composed of at least 2 qualifying entities and operate under a binding agreement documenting partnership details, cost-effective measures, and proposed budget contributions. A consortium seeking to establish and operate a Hub under this section must have financial contributions from non-Federal sources, conflict of interest procedures, an accounting structure for compliance, an external advisory committee, and operate as a nonprofit organization. The Secretary requires detailed applications for consortium agreements to establish Hubs for advanced energy technologies. Hubs are selected through competitive processes for grants lasting up to 5 years, with the possibility of renewal. Hubs conduct collaborative research and development within designated technology focuses. Each Hub established under consortium agreements for advanced energy technologies must encourage collaboration, publish proposed plans, submit annual reports, and monitor project implementation. Additionally, each Hub must establish an external advisory committee. Each Hub must establish an external advisory committee with expertise in scientific, technical, industry, financial, and research management matters. Conflict of interest procedures must be in place to ensure disclosure of all material conflicts, with the Secretary having the authority to disqualify applications or revoke funds. The Secretary may disqualify or revoke funds for Hubs not complying with conflict of interest procedures. Funds cannot be used for new construction, and an Oversight Board will monitor Hub progress. Advanced energy technology includes innovative methods like solar and wind energy production. The Energy Innovation Hub focuses on renewable energy resources like geothermal, biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, nuclear energy, carbon capture, and energy efficiency. Qualifying entities include institutions of higher education and State or Federal entities. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to appropriate funds for advanced energy technology research and development. The authorized amounts are $110 million for fiscal year 2011, $135 million for fiscal year 2012, $195 million for fiscal year 2013, $210 million for fiscal year 2014, and $210 million for fiscal year 2015."
