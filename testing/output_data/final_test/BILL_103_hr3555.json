    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Environmental Technology Research Integration and Coordination Act\". It aims to coordinate environmental technology research and development. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in coordination with other Federal agencies, is responsible for promoting research, development, and adoption of environmental technologies. They must also establish priorities for Federal environmental technology efforts and review current federally funded programs in this area. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, along with other Federal agencies, plays a key role in developing and promoting environmental technologies. They recommend specific responsibilities for each agency, funding levels, and ensure sustainable economic development principles are integrated into research programs. Coordination with State, local governments, and private organizations is also emphasized. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is responsible for assessing federal agency budgets for consistency with environmental technology plans and priorities. Recommendations for legislative or administrative action may be submitted to Congress, including the roles of Federal agencies in implementing these plans. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is responsible for assessing federal agency budgets for environmental technology plans and priorities. An annual report evaluating Federal efforts in advancing environmental technologies must be submitted to Congress. Mechanisms will be established to ensure non-Federal participation in carrying out these plans. Incorporation of information on environmental technologies into existing networks. The Administrator, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, will provide access to data on environmental technologies developed under this Act and other sources, including activities, performance standards, and international developments. The Administrator will provide access to data on environmental technologies, coordinating with other international technology information programs. Existing resources will be used to integrate data into technology databases maintained by various Federal agencies. The Administrator will conduct outreach efforts to promote information dissemination through networks and participation in Environmental Technology Transfer Alliances with various entities. Entities eligible for participation in an Alliance include US companies, non-profit organizations, Federal laboratories, institutions of higher education, sponsoring organizations, and other appropriate entities. An Alliance, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, can share information with other entities, promote efficient use of materials and energy, offer technical assistance to US companies, and engage in activities deemed appropriate by the Administrator to fulfill its goals. The Administrator may provide financial assistance to an Alliance for technical assistance and information dissemination, with limitations on construction funding and total amount. The Administrator may provide financial assistance to an Alliance for technical assistance and information dissemination, with limitations on construction funding and total amount, in an amount that exceeds a minority cost share of the activities carried out by the Alliance under this subsection. The federal government is required to use environmental technology products. The President must establish a program for evaluating and approving the purchase of environmental technology products by the Federal Government. This includes working with performance standards programs, creating a priority list of technologies, and implementing a procurement plan. Additionally, the President must submit an annual report to Congress on the progress and plans for the program. The Administrator, in collaboration with State regulatory agencies, will conduct a study on how current environmental regulations impact innovation in environmental technologies and new products. A report with recommendations for increasing regulatory incentives for new environmental technologies must be submitted to Congress within one year. Additionally, a study on the impact of tax incentives on innovation in environmental technologies will be conducted. The President will study tax incentives to promote environmental technology development, including reviewing existing incentives, exploring alternative options, and assessing the relationship between regulations and tax incentives. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. \"Environmental technology\" includes technologies aimed at improving the environment through pollution reduction or remediation, cost-effective replacements for existing products or processes that reduce pollution or improve energy/materials efficiency, and technologies that meet both criteria. The term \"sustainable economic development\" integrates environmental and economic concerns for long-term development with reduced pollution and efficient energy/materials use."
