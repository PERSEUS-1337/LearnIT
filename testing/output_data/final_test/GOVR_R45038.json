    "content": "The USTR's agriculture-related NAFTA negotiating objectives focus on market access, regulatory cooperation, SPS measures, GIs, and trade remedies for perishable products. Specific objectives target Canadian tariffs on dairy, poultry, and egg products, as well as technical barriers to U.S. grain and alcohol beverages. Opportunities for the U.S. food and agriculture industries in the NAFTA renegotiation include improving market access. The ongoing NAFTA renegotiation aims to improve agricultural market access, update SPS provisions, and address agricultural trade disputes between the United States and its NAFTA partners. One controversial proposal is to establish seasonal protections for U.S. agriculture in trade remedy cases. The proposal aims to protect U.S. fruit and vegetable producers by facilitating trade remedy cases against Mexican seasonal exports. This addresses complaints from producers in Southeastern states facing import competition from Mexico. Antidumping and countervailing duties provide relief to U.S. industries affected by unfair trade practices. The U.S. imposes additional duties on imported goods to offset unfair subsidies given to foreign manufacturers, as determined by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Antidumping and countervailing duty provisions are outlined in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. The U.S. imposes duties on imported goods to counter unfair subsidies from foreign governments, as outlined in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. Subsidies can include cash payments, export subsidies, tax credits, or below-market loans to benefit production or exportation. The amount of subsidies determines the subsidy rate used to offset the unfair advantage foreign manufacturers may have over U.S. producers. The U.S. imposes duties on imported goods to counter unfair subsidies from foreign governments. The subsidy rate is determined by the amount of subsidies received, offsetting the advantage foreign manufacturers may have over U.S. producers. If an AD/CVD investigation results in affirmative determinations, duties are collected on imported merchandise. Previous investigations have shown competitive pressures on U.S. fruit producers from lower-cost foreign producers and countries with subsidized production. Since the 1990s, dumping petitions filed by the U.S. fruit and vegetable sectors have led to higher tariffs on imports from countries like Canada, Mexico, Chile, China, Brazil, Argentina, and others. These petitions targeted products such as fresh tomatoes, frozen raspberries, apple juice concentrate, frozen orange juice, lemon juice, fresh garlic, preserved mushrooms, canned pineapple, table grapes, and tart cherry juice. The U.S. has imposed seasonal tariffs on certain fruits and vegetables during peak seasons to address concerns about unfair trade practices. The U.S. has imposed higher import tariffs on certain fruits and vegetables during peak seasons to address unfair trade practices. The proposal for NAFTA aims to establish new rules for seasonal and perishable products, ensuring producers have recourse to trade remedies and improving import relief mechanisms. The proposal seeks to modify U.S. AD/CVD laws by allowing growers to bring injury cases by domestic region and draw on seasonal data, making it easier for regional groups to initiate trade remedy cases. This change could deepen divisions in the fruit and vegetable industry. The USTR's proposal aims to change AD/CVD requirements, allowing regional producers to easily initiate injury cases using seasonal data. This could lead to higher tariffs on imported products. Mexico's increased production of fruits and vegetables has resulted in higher U.S. imports, particularly for tomatoes, avocados, peppers, and berries. Mexico's increased production and export of vegetables and fruits, supported by investments in greenhouse facilities and technological innovations, have made it the largest foreign supplier to the U.S. The USDA has conducted studies on greenhouse tomato production, which have led to anti-dumping cases among NAFTA countries. Rising imports of fruits and vegetables from Mexico support consumer demand by providing year-round supplies, especially during the U.S. off-season. Counter-seasonal imports complement U.S. production, lower costs, introduce new products, and stimulate additional demand. Technological advancements in greenhouse production and development of early- and late-maturing varieties have expanded U.S. production seasons for fruits and vegetables. Improvements in transportation and refrigeration have facilitated easier shipping of fresh horticultural products. The expanded U.S. production season has narrowed the winter window for some imports, leading to direct competition with imports for products like fresh tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, onions, cucumbers, melons, citrus, grapes, apples, and other tree fruits. Imports of processed fruit and vegetable products from Mexico are competing with U.S. products year-round, particularly for tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, raspberries, and blueberries. Rising imports are widening the trade deficit in U.S. fruit and vegetable trade, with imports accounting for 32% of all U.S. fresh fruit supplies in 2007. In 2007, U.S. suppliers accounted for 32% of fresh fruit supplies, rising to 38% in 2016. Fresh vegetable imports increased from 20% to 31% during the same period. Import shares for specific fruits and vegetables also rose significantly, with cucumbers at 74%, tomatoes at 57%, avocados at 86%, and asparagus dominating U.S. supplies. Concerns have been raised about Mexico's government subsidies supporting greenhouse production, particularly for tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. Mexico's agricultural ministry, SAGARPA, does not provide direct financial support to its produce growers. The primary agricultural support program, PROAGRO Productivo, comprises most of its agricultural budget. Mexico's farm programs support rural and entrepreneurial development, including production by new farmers and women, as well as domestic feeding programs. Producers of sugar, corn, and milk receive the highest level of support. Additional information on Mexican government support for agricultural sectors is available in the Appendix. FFVA claims that SAGARPA provided financial support for greenhouse and shade house investments in Mexico's horticultural sectors, totaling $50 million from 2001 to 2008 and $189.2 million from 2009 to 2010. The support covered various types of protected agriculture, with a focus on tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, berries, and other specialty products. The Alianza program also offered support for greenhouse tomatoes, which is still active. FFVA claims that SAGARPA has continued to provide support for its protected agriculture sectors in Mexico, with regulations allowing for greenhouse incentives of up to $48,000 per hectare and subsidies for new installations reaching $162,000 per project. These funds can cover 50% of investment costs for materials, equipment, infrastructure, and management of greenhouse products. Additionally, FFVA argues that Mexico's fruit and vegetable imports to the U.S. are sold below production costs, giving Mexico a competitive advantage due to lower labor costs in production. Vegetable production in Mexico provides a competitive advantage over U.S. growers. Opinions on NAFTA's impact on the fruit and vegetable industry are divided among producers and in Congress. Some claim import competition from Mexico is harming U.S. producers, while others argue that NAFTA benefits producers in California. Representative Jimmy Panetta highlighted the complementary relationship between California and Mexico in fruit and vegetable production. Some in Congress support USTR's seasonal proposal to address unfair trading practices by Mexican exporters of fresh fruits and vegetables, while others oppose it, fearing it could lead to more restrictions on U.S. exports. Most U.S. food and agricultural groups, including some producer groups, also oppose seasonal proposals, concerned about potential negative impacts on trade. Some worry that U.S. proposals for seasonal protections in NAFTA renegotiation could benefit a few wealthy agribusiness firms from Florida at the expense of others in the produce industry. The U.S. agricultural sectors are cautious about proposals that could harm existing export markets under NAFTA. Mexican trade officials and reports suggest resistance to seasonal proposals and limiting product access. Mexico may retaliate with its own list of protected products. Mexico is considering retaliation by creating a list of protected products in response to the U.S. proposal, including grain and pork products. Some U.S. agricultural groups are concerned about special treatment in NAFTA renegotiation. Former U.S. trade officials doubt that limiting imports would benefit U.S. producers. American food and agricultural producers fear the Trump Administration's threats to withdraw from the agreement. Agriculture groups warn that withdrawal from NAFTA would harm the U.S. economy and producers. Agriculture groups are concerned about uncertainty in U.S. trade policy and the impact of NAFTA renegotiation on U.S. export markets. Studies show that millions of jobs are connected to the food and agriculture industries. Congress supports maintaining U.S. agricultural export markets under preferential trade agreements like NAFTA. The U.S. food and agriculture industries have a lot at stake in the current NAFTA renegotiations, as Canada and Mexico are significant trading partners for the U.S. agricultural sector. Mexico's agricultural policies have undergone significant changes since the 1980s, including the elimination of state enterprises, price supports, and subsidies for staple commodities. Reforms to agrarian laws allowed for the privatization of lands distributed to rural community groups. These domestic reforms coincided with negotiations under NAFTA, leading to the abolishment of CONASUPO in 1999. Mexico introduced PROCAMPO in 1993, a domestic agricultural support program with a budget of about U.S. $1 billion. The program provides direct cash payments to growers of various crops to transition to more market-oriented policies under NAFTA. Initially set to end in 2008-2009, it was extended until 2012 by the Felipe Calderon administration. PROAGRO Productivo, the program's current iteration, aims to target rural development and poverty alleviation amidst lower trade protections and the removal of direct price supports. PROAGRO Productivo helps rural producers cope with lower trade protections and the removal of direct price supports through direct payments. It provides flat rate payments based on the size of production units: Subsistence growers with up to five hectares of non-irrigated land and 0.2 hectares of irrigated land, Transition growers with more than five hectares and up to 20 hectares of non-irrigated land, and Commercial growers with more than 20 hectares non-irrigated land. PROAGRO Productivo provides support payments based on the size of production units, with different payment amounts for subsistence, transition, and commercial growers. Subsistence growers in specific municipalities receive the highest payment at 1,500 pesos per hectare, while others receive 1,300 pesos per hectare. Transition and commercial growers receive 800 pesos and 700 pesos per hectare, respectively. The maximum subsidy amount per crop cycle is 100,000 pesos. The program mainly supports corn, sorghum, wheat, and rice production in Mexico, with sugar, corn, and milk producers receiving the highest level of support. Mexico, as a member of the WTO, abides by rules governing domestic farm policy. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture outlines guidelines for countries to assess potentially trade-distorting policies and report them transparently. Mexico's recent notification to the WTO lists agricultural support measures including the Food Support Programme, Rural Supply Programme, Milk Supply Programme, and PROMUSAG. Mexico's agricultural support programs focus on poverty alleviation, domestic feeding programs, and supporting new farmers and women entrepreneurs. These programs are considered non-trade-distorting and are not subject to spending limits under WTO rules. Mexico's agricultural support programs focus on poverty alleviation, domestic feeding programs, and supporting new farmers and women entrepreneurs. Mexico's producers of sugar, corn, and milk receive the highest level of support. There is no direct financial support for fruit and vegetable growers in Mexico, similar to the United States. Export subsidies cover maize, beans, wheat, sorghum, and sugar, but there is limited information on support for the fruit and vegetable sectors. Mexico does not provide direct financial support for fruit and vegetable growers, unlike the United States. Export subsidies in Mexico cover various crops, but information on support for the fruit and vegetable sectors is limited.
