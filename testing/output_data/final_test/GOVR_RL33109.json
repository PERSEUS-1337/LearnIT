    "content": "Expedited removal, an immigration enforcement strategy, has been expanded in certain border regions, sparking debate on whether it should be mandatory and extended into the country's interior. This provision allows for the removal of aliens without further hearings or review if they lack proper documentation or have committed fraud. Limited administrative and judicial review are available for those who receive negative \"credible fear\" determinations. The judge reviews cases under expedited removal, which is limited to certain aliens such as U.S. citizens or legal residents. Aliens under expedited removal must be detained until removal and are barred from returning for five years. Expedited removal was initially applied only to arriving aliens at ports of entry from 1997 to 2002. Expedited removal was extended to aliens arriving by sea in November 2002 and to those present without admission or parole within 100 air miles of the U.S. southwest land border in August 2004. Failure to have valid documents can lead to exclusion from the United States. The INA addresses fraudulent entry by aliens seeking visas or admission through misrepresentation. The policy option of expedited removal, initially proposed as \"summary exclusion\" in the early 1980s, was triggered by the mass migration of Cubans and Haitians to South Florida in 1980. This influx led to a shift in U.S. immigration policy, where aliens arriving without proper documents could be excluded without a hearing before an immigration judge. The concept of \"summary exclusion\" was initially proposed in the early 1980s to address unauthorized migration by restricting the hearing, review, and appeal process for aliens arriving without proper documents at ports of entry. It was included in legislation that became the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 but was later deleted. In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed \"summary exclusion\" in the \"Expedited Exclusion and Alien Smuggling Enhanced Penalties Act of 1993\" to target perceived abuses of the asylum process by aliens at ports of entry. The bill aimed to institute a procedure for aliens who did not articulate a plausible asylum claim. During the 104th Congress, the House approved H.R. 2602, a bill for summary exclusion of arriving aliens without inspection. The Senate later replaced the bill's provisions with a limited special exclusion process for extraordinary migration situations in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 established expedited removal for aliens without proper documentation or present in the US for less than two years. Immigration officers must ask protection questions to identify fear of return, leading to detention and interview by an asylum officer. Under the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, expedited removal was established for aliens without proper documentation or present in the US for less than two years. Immigration officers must ask protection questions to identify fear of return, leading to detention and interview by an asylum officer from DHS' USCIS. Those found to have a \"credible fear\" are referred to an EOIR immigration judge for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge may review the USCIS asylum officer's determination of no credible fear within 24 hours to 7 days. Expedited removals are not subject to administrative appeals, except for those claiming a legal right to reside in the US based on citizenship, legal permanent residence, asylee, or refugee status. Under the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, expedited removal was established for aliens without proper documentation or present in the US for less than two years. Aliens with revoked visas are subject to expedited removal, which provides limited administrative and judicial review. Expedited removal initially applied only to \"arriving aliens,\" but the process for aliens already in the US is more complex. The Department reserves the right to expand expedited removal procedures to additional classes of aliens if operationally warranted. Expansion may be driven by specific situations or a general need to increase enforcement effectiveness. Logistics at ports of entry are straightforward, with detained aliens pending removal. On November 13, 2002, INS expanded expedited removal to certain sea arrivals to address national security concerns. This was in response to a vessel entering Biscayne Bay, Florida on October 29, 2002. The Department of Homeland Security expanded expedited removal to include aliens lacking proper documents, encountered within 100 air miles of the U.S. border, and not able to prove continuous presence in the U.S. for 14 days. The Department of Homeland Security expanded expedited removal to include apprehensions made within border patrol sectors of various cities. This expansion is aimed at enhancing national security and public safety by dealing more effectively with individuals seeking illegal entry and ensuring the removal of those not granted relief. The Department of Homeland Security expanded expedited removal to include apprehensions made within border patrol sectors of various cities to enhance national security and public safety. However, the expansion may interfere with the operations of human trafficking and smuggling organizations. Currently, expedited removal cannot be applied to the nearly one million aliens apprehended annually on the southwest border, with Mexican nationals being \"voluntarily\" returned to Mexico without a formal removal hearing. Nationals from countries other than Mexico must be returned to their home country by aircraft or placed into removal proceedings. Although initially stated in August 2004, expedited removal was only expanded to all eligible southwest border patrol sections in September 2005. Expedited removal was piloted in Texas and Arizona sectors in August 2004, then expanded to other sectors. It was used for aliens who illegally reentered the US while subject to prior orders of exclusion. In September 2005, it was expanded to the entire southwest border by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Additional detention space was acquired to detain the increased number of aliens subject to expedited removal. The Secretary announced the expansion of expedited removal along the northern and coastal borders on January 30, 2006. Critics argue that immigration law distinguishes between aliens seeking admission and those already in the US, with the latter having more rights. Legal scholars question if the Constitution applies to aliens seeking entry at the border. Proponents of expedited removal claim it is necessary. Proponents of expedited removal argue that aliens seeking admission have no constitutional rights and cite court decisions to support this. They also mention the opportunity for a credible fear determination for those expressing fear of persecution or seeking asylum, with a high success rate in passing credible fear hearings. Critics of expedited removal argue that low-level immigration officers have unchecked authority to order removal, potentially leading to the loss of substantive rights for asylum seekers. Reports of abuse of the procedure have been noted since its implementation. Critics argue that expedited removal has led to abuse and erroneous removal of individuals with valid asylum claims. Under IIRIRA, asylum seekers in expedited removal are detained while their cases are pending, a departure from the previous practice of releasing them into the country. This change was made to deter fraudulent asylum claims. The practice of detaining asylum seekers to deter fraudulent claims has reduced numbers, but critics argue it is too harsh. The United Nations High Commission on Refugees opposes detention, citing psychological harm and confusion among detainees. Additionally, asylum seekers are often detained with criminal aliens. Concerns are arising about coordination across agencies involved in expedited removal, exacerbated by dispersal of immigration functions. One evaluation highlights communication and information sharing issues within DHS. Procedures were inconsistently applied, lacking effective quality assurance measures. Supporters of expedited removal point to evidence of agency cooperation and emphasize the importance of proper training. The Administration emphasizes the importance of proper training for immigration officers conducting expedited removal proceedings. They have developed detailed regulations to ensure fair application of the law, with input from various groups. Discussions are ongoing about expanding expedited removal to include all groups authorized under statute, detaining and removing aliens who cannot prove continuous presence for more than two years without hearings unless they claim asylum. Aliens in expedited removal face deportation without hearings unless they claim asylum. Proponents argue it's necessary for resource efficiency, while opponents suggest alternative methods like the Institutional Removal Program. Those in expedited removal have limited access to relief from deportation, excluding certain protections like VAWA or TPS. Aliens in full removal proceedings have more options for relief. Opponents of expanding expedited removal argue that it would deprive aliens of due process and constitutional protections, including the opportunity to apply for eligible immigration benefits. They express concerns about unchecked authority of immigration officers and reports of abuse in the expedited removal procedure. Proponents of expanding expedited removal argue that aliens subject to this process have not \"entered\" the United States and are not entitled to certain rights. They highlight the review of removal orders by supervisors and safeguards for those fearing persecution. Arguments for and against expansion consider resource implications, with uncertain impact on removal costs. The expansion of expedited removal can decrease removal costs by limiting access to judicial hearings and reviews, reducing DHS lawyer and detention expenses. It also deters illegal entry, evidenced by decreased apprehensions along the southwest border. Expanding expedited removal faces barriers due to limited detention bed space and transportation challenges for aliens. Mandatory detention for noncriminal aliens under expedited removal may increase detention costs and reduce beds for others in removal proceedings, as ICE has been at or above capacity for years. ICE has been consistently over capacity for years, making it challenging to expand expedited removal. Proponents argue that delays caused by immigration judges and appeals processes allow aliens to avoid deportation. They believe that streamlining the removal process can strengthen immigration law enforcement. Opponents fear that removing EOIR from removal proceedings violates alien rights and lacks oversight. Expanding expedited removal raises questions about implementation, such as access to documents and detention. Issues arise for aliens unable to return home due to lack of travel documents. The INS considered applying expedited removal to criminal aliens in Texas but the program was never implemented. Expedited removal for aliens already in the US is complex and challenging to manage. DHS has been using expedited removal for eight years. \"Expedited removal has been in practice for eight years, providing DHS with insight on the process. Proper training is necessary to expand expedited removal, as stated by DHS. When encountering an alien for removal, a Notice-to-Appear (NTA) is issued, outlining the charges against the alien.\" When an alien is charged with violating immigration laws, they may be released on their own recognizance if issued an NTA by border patrol. If ICE issues the NTA, a non-mandatory detainee may be released on bond. The alien can request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge to lower or obtain bond. Bond hearings require proof of no flight risk or danger to society. The first appearance in immigration court is at the master calendar hearing, where cases may be decided for relief from deportation. At the master calendar hearing, relief from deportation can be granted if both the government and the alien agree. Cases of detained aliens are often concluded at this hearing. A time is set for an individual merit hearing, where the government's attorney must prove charges, witnesses are presented, and the judge rules on removal eligibility. Appeals can be made to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then to a federal court. In court removal proceedings, DHS must establish the person is an alien, and the burden shifts if the alien proves admission.

In court removal proceedings, DHS must establish the person is an alien, and the burden shifts if the alien proves admission. If the alien establishes admission, the burden shifts back to DHS to prove deportability. The alien must prove eligibility for relief, and failure to appear for a removal hearing can result in removal in absentia and ineligibility for relief for 10 years. Deportation proceedings are considered civil, not criminal, with limited due process protections. Congress can impose new immigration consequences retroactively. IIRAIRA limited motions to reopen and reconsider removal cases for aliens. Legislation in the 110th Congress proposed expedited removal for certain aliens near the border. Bills like H.R. 2413, H.R. 2954, and H.R. 4065 aimed to codify this policy. H.R. 750, introduced by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee in 2007, aimed to eliminate mandatory detention of aliens in expedited removal. Other bills like H.R. 519 and H.R. 3638 proposed expanding expedited removal to include all eligible aliens, even those in the interior of the country without continuous presence for two years. On September 24, 2007, Representative Dan Burton introduced H.R. 3638, which aimed to establish standard procedures for questioning by DHS employees during expedited removal of unlawfully present aliens. S. 1639, introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy, was debated in the Senate but was pulled on June 28, 2007, when cloture was not invoked."
