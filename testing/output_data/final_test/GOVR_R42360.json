    "content": "U.S. interests in the Western Hemisphere are diverse, including economic, political, security, and humanitarian concerns. The region has strong economic ties with the United States through trade agreements and foreign investment. Latin American nations, especially Mexico and Venezuela, supply a significant amount of crude oil to the U.S. Immigration from the region is driven by geographic proximity and economic conditions. Curbing drug trafficking from Latin America and the Caribbean is a key focus of U.S. relations with the region. The United States has been closely involved in Latin America and the Caribbean for almost two decades, focusing on security cooperation with Mexico to combat drug trafficking. While the region has made progress in democratic development, concerns remain about undemocratic practices in countries like Venezuela. The U.S. has also played a leading role in responding to natural disasters in the region, such as Haiti's 2010 earthquake. The Obama Administration has outlined four priorities for U.S. policy towards the region: promoting economic and social opportunity, ensuring citizen security, strengthening democratic institutions, and promoting clean governance. The Obama Administration's policy priorities for Latin America include promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. These priorities aim to build stable, prosperous, and democratic nations in the region through partnership and shared responsibility. Expanding economic opportunity is crucial to addressing poverty and inequality in Latin America, where millions of people live in poverty and extreme poverty. The statistics show a significant improvement in poverty levels in Latin America, with 12.3% living in extreme poverty in 2010 compared to 44% in 2002. Economic opportunity programs like the Pathways to Prosperity Initiative and support for the Inter-American Social Protection Network aim to reduce social disparities and extreme poverty. Citizen safety is also a focus of U.S. development assistance programs in the region. The U.S. supports initiatives in Latin America to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, including the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico, CARSI, and CBSI. High levels of crime and violence, often linked to drug trafficking, are a major concern in the region. The Central America-Mexico corridor is a key route for South American cocaine entering the U.S., and murder rates in some countries are among the highest globally. The Civilian State Development Initiative (CSDI) in Colombia aims to increase the presence of state institutions in remote areas to support democratic governance and address citizens' needs. Despite progress in democratic development in Latin America, challenges remain, including the need to strengthen state institutions and defend democratic rights. Former Assistant Secretary Valenzuela emphasizes the importance of democratic institutions. Former Assistant Secretary Valenzuela stresses the importance of democratic institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean to prevent interruptions in elected democratic processes. The region faces vulnerability to climate change, impacting sustainable development and economic prosperity. Leaders have committed to collaborating on climate change challenges and enhancing energy security through initiatives like the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) launched in 2009. ECPA promotes clean energy, energy security, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction through voluntary bilateral and multi-country efforts. The Obama Administration continues U.S. policy in Latin America, providing anti-drug and security support to Colombia, Mexico, and Central America. Initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative and CARSI aim to combat drug trafficking and organized crime. The CBSI was established to address potential drug trafficking shifts to the Caribbean region. Bills for FTAs with Colombia and Panama were introduced in 2011. The Obama Administration, like the Bush Administration before it, supports comprehensive immigration reform and maintains a similar approach towards Venezuela by avoiding public conflicts with President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez while addressing concerns about undemocratic actions, drug trafficking, and terrorism. Despite some continuity, the Obama Administration has implemented changes that set its policy apart from its predecessor. The Obama Administration has implemented changes in Cuba policy, emphasizing partnership and multilateralism. They have lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances, restarted migration talks, and increased development assistance to the region. Despite continuity in some areas, there has been a change of emphasis in U.S. policy towards Latin America. Assistance to Mexico is shifting towards more support for rule of law programs and programs to combat crime and violence. In Colombia, assistance is now more balanced between rule of law, human rights, and economic development programs, and security and drug interdiction efforts. U.S. assistance levels to Colombia are decreasing as the country takes on more responsibility for funded programs. Assessments of U.S. policy towards Latin America during the Obama Administration are mixed, with some praising the emphasis on partnership and multilateralism. Some praise the Obama Administration's emphasis on partnership and multilateralism in Latin America, while others urge a clearer strategic vision. Critics call for stronger support for Mexico against organized crime and more focus on Venezuela. The region's increasing independence and U.S. domestic political polarization are seen as challenges to productive engagement. Latin America's increasing independence from the United States is evident in its diversified economic and diplomatic ties with countries like China. Strong regional economic growth rates and growing ideological diversity have boosted confidence in the region's ability to solve its own problems. The rise of Brazil as a regional and global power, along with the establishment of several regional integration organizations, reflects the region's growing independence and internal cooperation. In December 2011, 33 hemispheric nations established the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) to boost regional integration and cooperation. Some view CELAC as a potential challenge to the Organization of American States (OAS), but it lacks a permanent staff or secretariat. The organization aims to work in energy, science, technology, infrastructure, finance, and social development, reflecting a shift in regional dynamics and declining U.S. influence in Latin America. The United States remains engaged in Latin America through various organizations like the OAS and the Summit of the Americas. The region has also seen the establishment of new organizations like UNASUR for political coordination and dispute resolution. UNASUR has played a role in defusing tensions between countries in South America, but questions have been raised about its efficacy and financial support. Another regional grouping, ALBA, was launched by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2004 to promote regional integration and alleviate poverty. ALBA, a regional grouping launched by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2004 to promote integration and alleviate poverty, has faced criticism for losing energy. Legislative focus during the 112th Congress centered on drug trafficking violence in Mexico, U.S. assistance under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, and support for Central America, the Caribbean, and Colombia. Congressional attention also remained on Haiti post-earthquake and cholera outbreak. The fall of 2010 outbreak in Haiti continued to focus congressional attention on disaster recovery. Debate over U.S. sanctions on Cuba and immigration reform were ongoing issues. The U.S. government has spent billions on anti-drug assistance programs in Latin America since the mid-1970s. The U.S. government has spent billions on anti-drug assistance programs in Latin America since the mid-1970s, with Congress influencing policy through funding and oversight hearings on programs like the M\u00e9rida Initiative in Mexico, CARSI in Central America, and CBSI in the Caribbean. Traffickers adapt to avoid detection, leading to changes in cultivation patterns and trafficking methods. Congress also links counterdrug efforts with judicial reform, anti-corruption, and human rights programs. In the 112th Congress, congressional oversight focused on the deterioration of democracy in Latin American countries like Nicaragua and Venezuela. Concerns were raised about flawed elections, threats to democratic institutions, and freedom of speech. Despite improvements in political rights, weaknesses persist in delivering public services, ensuring accountability, and upholding the rule of law. The abuse of executive power in the region has set back liberal democratic practices, negatively impacting the quality of democracy in Latin America. The quality of democracy in Latin America is being affected by organized crime and violence, with concerns about declining oil production in the region, particularly in Mexico and Venezuela. Mexico's oil reserves are declining due to insufficient funds for maintenance and exploration, while Venezuela's production has been decreasing due to maintenance issues and natural decline of older fields. In recent years, Venezuela's oil exports to the United States have declined as the country diversified its trading partners and supplied oil at preferential prices to Caribbean and Central American nations. Concerns were raised about U.S. dependence on Venezuelan oil, as well as Cuba's development of its offshore oil sector and the potential impact of an oil spill on the United States. The 112th Congress conducted hearings on trade issues during the first session. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held on pending FTAs with Colombia and Panama, with implementing legislation approved in October 2011. The Colombia FTA took effect on May 15, 2012, and the Panama FTA on October 31, 2012. Congressional focus was on Colombia's commitments under an \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights\" and negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement with 10 Pacific rim countries. Other trade issues included Mexican truck safety in the U.S. and considerations for the TPP agreement with Chile, Mexico, and Peru. The United States resolved issues with Brazil in 2011 regarding U.S. cotton subsidies. U.S. attention to terrorism in Latin America increased after the September 2001 attacks, leading to more cooperation. The State Department notes that terrorism in the region is mainly from Colombia and radical leftist Andean groups. Cuba and Venezuela are on the State Department's list of countries not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. The State Department is concerned about Iran's relations with Venezuela and Hezbollah's activities in the region. There are no known operational cells of Al Qaeda or Hezbollah in the hemisphere, but fundraising activities are a concern. U.S. policy towards Brazil is evolving due to its growing economic influence globally. The evolving U.S.-Brazilian relationship involves regional and international issues, with shared values not always leading to common approaches to foreign affairs. Brazil's advocacy for engagement with isolated regimes like Iran, Libya, and Syria has raised concerns among U.S. officials. Despite differences, cooperation continues on various issues, with a focus on energy collaboration, particularly in biofuels development. The expiration of a 54-cent-per-gallon duty on imported ethanol in 2011 removed a barrier to cooperation between the U.S. and Brazil. In 2012, Congress showed interest in Brazil with proposed legislation related to energy and trade, but none advanced. Bills like H.R. 4621 and H.R. 6539 aimed to improve trade relations and address bilateral trade issues. The 2012 farm bills, S. 3240 and H.R. 6083, also addressed the U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute. In recent years, U.S. policymakers have become increasingly concerned about security conditions in Central America and the Caribbean due to rising crime and violence linked to social exclusion, corruption in security forces, and impunity for criminals. Traffickers exploit institutional weaknesses to transport narcotics from South America to the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. government has implemented initiatives like CARSI and CBSI to address security challenges in Central America and the Caribbean. Congress has allocated significant funding for these efforts, with a focus on providing equipment, training, and technical assistance to support law enforcement operations and strengthen governmental institutions. Key policy issues in 2012 included continued monitoring of security developments and support for U.S. assistance efforts in the region. The Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control held a hearing on U.S.-Caribbean security cooperation and issued a report. Congress expressed support for CARSI and CBSI in foreign aid appropriations measures but did not act on the bills, funding is provided through a continuing resolution until March 27, 2013. Congress also monitored human rights conditions and placed security assistance to Honduras on hold. Colombia, a key U.S. ally in the region, has made significant progress in combating drug trafficking and terrorism through the Plan Colombia strategy. The country has improved citizen security and economic stability, although concerns about human rights conditions persist. Congress provided over $8 billion in assistance to Colombia between FY2000-FY2012, with support gradually being reduced as programs are transitioned. Colombia has strengthened trade relations with the United States and neighboring countries under President Juan Manuel Santos. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement entered into force in May 2012, eliminating duties on 80% of U.S. exports to Colombia. Remaining tariffs and trade barriers will be phased out within 10 years. Most remaining tariffs and barriers to bilateral trade with Colombia will be eliminated within 10 years. Peace talks with leftist guerrilla organization started in Norway in 2012 and continue in Cuba. Congressional focus in 2012 was on trade, human rights, counternarcotics, and security in Colombia. Policymakers monitored compliance with labor rights agreements post U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Support for Colombian foreign assistance in FY2013 appropriations bills was broad. In FY2013, a $332 million request was made for Colombian foreign assistance. Members of Congress monitored peace negotiations between the government and leftist guerrilla forces in Colombia. US policy towards Cuba has included economic sanctions and support for democracy and human rights activists. After Fidel Castro's resignation in 2006 due to poor health, calls for a new approach towards Cuba were made to influence the government through increased engagement. Despite the release of political prisoners, human rights conditions remain poor with numerous detentions. The Obama Administration eased travel and remittance restrictions for Cuban families but expressed concerns about human rights. Cuba's imprisonment of U.S. Agency for International Development remains a key obstacle to improved relations. Key Policy Issues in 2012: Congressional interest in Cuba continued, focusing on human rights, offshore oil development, funding for democracy projects, and the imprisonment of Alan Gross. Legislative actions included resolutions condemning the Cuban government for the death of democracy activist Wilman Villar Mendoza and honoring Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1. In 2012, Congress focused on key policy issues in Cuba, including human rights, offshore oil development, funding for democracy projects, and the imprisonment of Alan Gross. Legislative actions honored Cuban dissident Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 and called for the release of Alan Gross. U.S. assistance in Haiti post-earthquake aimed to help the country \"build back better.\" U.S. assistance in Haiti post-earthquake aims to help the country \"build back better\" by focusing on infrastructure, governance, health, and food security. Despite achievements like faster rubble removal and election transitions, criticism remains over slow aid disbursement and reconstruction progress due to obstacles like urban damage concentration. The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHRC) faced criticism for delays in organizing and approving programs. Its term expired in October 2011, leading to a year-long gap before a new coordinating committee was established by the Haitian government in late 2012. The cholera epidemic in late 2010 further hindered the transition from emergency response to reconstruction efforts. Political instability and gridlock between President Michel Martelly and the legislature have also impeded aid distribution and development in Haiti. Development in Haiti has been difficult due to political instability and delays in holding elections. Former members of the Haitian army protested for its reestablishment, leading to disruptions in parliament. Key concerns in 2012 included the effectiveness of U.S. aid, corruption allegations against President Martelly, and improving security in the country. Despite promises by Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe, election dates have yet to be set. The Haitian government focused on strengthening the Haitian National Police to improve security, while plans to re-create an army were put on hold. Congress aimed to promote human rights, strengthen Haitian institutions, and ensure free and fair elections. President Martelly: Current Conditions and Congressional Concerns, by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report R41689, Haiti's National Elections: Issues, Concerns, and Outcome, by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R41023, Haiti Earthquake: Crisis and Response, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. Security issues have overshadowed immigration and trade in U.S. relations with Mexico, but President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto aims to refocus on economic matters. Congress has allocated $1.9 billion in anticrime and counterdrug assistance for Mexico since FY2008, with aid shifting towards institution-building. Cooperation with Mexico led to the arrest or killing of drug kingpins under the Calder\u00f3n Administration, but organized crime-related violence has resulted in an estimated 60,000 deaths. During its term, the Calder\u00f3n Administration in Mexico saw around 60,000 deaths due to organized crime-related violence. Border security became a top priority, while immigration reform efforts stalled in the U.S. Tough state laws against illegal immigration worried the Mexican government. Trade issues were resolved, and Mexico was invited to join TPP negotiations in 2012. The signing of a Trans-Boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement in February 2012 could lead to new opportunities for bilateral energy cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. Key policy issues in 2012 included Congress's focus on Mexico's security situation, the M\u00e9rida Initiative, human rights conditions, border security, economic issues, and the political transition in December 2012. The Obama Administration requested $269.5 million in assistance for Mexico in FY2013, with $234 million allocated for the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Congress also addressed organized crime's impact on human rights and democracy in Mexico. Drug trafficking-related violence in northern Mexico led to increased border security measures, including penalties for aviation smuggling and tightening sentencing guidelines for building illicit border tunnels. Congressional action on the Trans-Boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement may be required in 2013 for it to take effect. Mexico's accession to TPP negotiations has sparked congressional interest, and Congress is monitoring the policy positions of the incoming Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration, particularly in the security realm. Friction in bilateral relations between the United States and Venezuela has increased over the past decade under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's government. Concerns include human rights violations, Venezuela's military arms purchases, lack of cooperation on anti-terrorism efforts, limited anti-drug cooperation, and relations with Cuba and Iran. President Obama determined in September 2012 that Venezuela had \"failed demonstrably\" in the annual narcotics certification process. The United States has imposed financial sanctions on Venezuelan government and military officials for alleged drug trafficking activities, including General Henry Rangel Silva. Sanctions have also been imposed on Venezuelan companies and individuals for alleged support to Iran and Hezbollah. In 2012, Congressional oversight on Venezuela focused on human rights, drug trafficking, and terrorism concerns. President Ch\u00e1vez won reelection but announced his cancer had returned, supporting Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as his successor. Venezuela's political future appeared uncertain at year's end. At year's end, Venezuela's political future was uncertain. U.S. funding for democracy programs in Venezuela was extended through March 27, 2013. Concerns have been raised about Iran's growing interest in Latin America, particularly its relations with Venezuela driven by the personal relationship between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Iran's increased focus on Latin America is seen as a way to overcome international isolation. Iran has been making efforts to overcome international isolation by forming connections with Latin American countries, particularly Venezuela. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan companies in 2008 and 2011 for their ties to Iran. Venezuela has also facilitated Iran's relations with Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, although promises of significant investment have not been fully realized. President Ahmadinejad's visits to Latin American countries in 2012 raised concerns about Iran's intentions in the region. President Obama expressed ongoing concerns about Iran's activities in Latin America. President Obama expressed concerns about Iran's activities in Latin America, particularly its connections with Venezuela. Despite Iran's ties with Venezuela, the U.S. Southern Command does not view Venezuela as a national security threat. The U.S. is also worried about Iran's support for Hezbollah in Latin America, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization linked to bombings in Argentina. In recent years, U.S. concerns about Hezbollah in Latin America have focused on its fundraising activities in the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, as well as in Venezuela. Sanctions have been imposed on individuals and companies in the region for supporting Hezbollah. Congress took action in 2012 by passing H.R. 3783, requiring an assessment of Iran's presence in the Western Hemisphere and a strategy to address it. Since its establishment in 1948, the Organization of American States (OAS) has been a platform for U.S. influence in the region. However, in recent years, Latin American and Caribbean countries have become more independent from the U.S., leading to concerns from U.S. policymakers about the OAS's actions. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about the OAS's actions, such as repealing a resolution expelling Cuba and lack of support for democracy in countries like Nicaragua and Venezuela. There is debate over whether the OAS aligns with U.S. interests, with some calling for the U.S. to stop funding the organization while others argue for strengthening it to maintain regional ties. In 2012, Members of Congress debated Cuban participation in the OAS and opposed proposed reforms to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Concerns were raised about the OAS not fulfilling its obligations under the Inter-American Democratic Charter and calls were made for corrective measures to address administrative and financial challenges. Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in March 2012. Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in March 2012, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of Our Lady of Charity. He celebrated mass in Santiago and Havana, highlighting the Catholic Church's increased influence in Cuba. The Cuban Catholic Church became more openly critical of the government in 1993, with bishops opposing limitations on freedom and excessive surveillance. Archbishop of Havana Jaime Ortega was elevated to Cardinal in 1994, expanding the Church's role in Cuba. Ortega has been praised for revitalizing the Church, with Caritas Cuban's social assistance expanding. Cuban bishops continue to advocate for change, using Church publications to address social and economic issues in the country. The Cuban Catholic Church, led by Cardinal Ortega, played a key role in engaging with the government over political prisoners, resulting in the release of over 125 prisoners. Despite pardoning thousands of prisoners in 2011, there are still around 50 political prisoners in Cuba. The government continues to harass dissidents and human rights activists, with the death of hunger striker Wilman Villar Mendoza drawing global attention to the poor human rights situation. Pope Benedict's 2012 visit urged Cubans to work towards building a better future. During his March 2012 trip to Cuba, Pope Benedict urged Cubans to build a renewed and open society, emphasizing reconciliation and the need for change. He referenced Father Felix Varela as a path to true social transformation and criticized U.S. economic sanctions as unfair to the Cuban people. Some Cuban dissidents and Cuban Americans criticized the Pope for not doing more. Some Cuban dissidents and Cuban Americans criticized the Pope for not more forcefully confronting the Cuban government during his visit. The Pope did not meet with any dissidents or human rights activists or speak out about government harassment. This led to some feeling the church lost credibility. Others highlight the church's support for political prisoners and the Ladies in White, as well as its role in promoting public dialogue on economic and social issues. The visit could give the church more space to address significant issues in Cuba. The Catholic Church in Cuba plays a significant role in addressing economic, social, and political issues in the country. The Summit of the Americas in Cartagena focused on regional cooperation to tackle challenges like poverty, inequality, citizen security, and access to technology. The church's support for political prisoners and public dialogue on these issues could give it more influence in Cuba. The Summit of the Americas in Cartagena addressed issues such as inequality, citizen security, natural disasters, and access to technology. Leaders failed to produce a summit declaration due to contentious issues, including engagement with Cuba and U.S.-backed antidrug policies. Most leaders supported Cuba's inclusion at the next summit, and agreed to commission a study on drug policy effectiveness. A new regional body will be established to coordinate efforts to combat transnational issues. At the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, leaders agreed to establish a new regional body to combat transnational organized crime. They issued a list of 47 commitments to address poverty, inequality, citizen security, natural disasters, infrastructure, and technology access. President Obama's actions suggest continuity in U.S. policy towards the region, with a focus on partnerships of equality and mutual respect. His new initiatives, like the Small Business Network of the Americas, are relatively limited in scale. The initiatives discussed at the Summit of the Americas aim to strengthen business development centers, support women entrepreneurs, and fund innovative projects in the Americas. Mexico recently held federal elections with a high voter turnout of 63%. In Mexico's recent federal elections, the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) regained the presidency after 12 years, with candidate Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto winning with 38.2% of the vote. Observers noted some irregularities, but overall praised the handling of the elections by the Federal Electoral Tribunal. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto won the presidency in Mexico's recent federal elections with 38.2% of the vote. The narrow margin of his victory and challenges from L\u00f3pez Obrador could complicate the transition period. The PRI will have to form cross-party coalitions to pass key reforms in Congress. The PRI, supported by PANAL and possibly PAN, will need to form coalitions to pass key reforms in Congress. The PRD-led coalition, with more seats than PAN, could complicate reform efforts, including in the energy sector. The transition to PRI rule is not expected to cause significant shifts in U.S.-Mexican relations. Pe\u00f1a Nieto reassured U.S. policymakers during his campaign. During his campaign, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto reassured U.S. policymakers of his commitment to combat organized crime and reduce violence in Mexico. He also expressed support for increased economic and energy cooperation with the U.S. Since his election, Pe\u00f1a Nieto has emphasized the importance of effective security collaboration with the United States. President Obama congratulated Pe\u00f1a Nieto on his victory, and U.S. officials look forward to working with him. President Ch\u00e1vez won the election in Venezuela with 55.07% of the vote, defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles who received 44.31%. Ch\u00e1vez received almost 8.2 million votes, about 1.6 million more than Capriles. The election was monitored by domestic observer groups, and despite minor irregularities, it was considered relatively peaceful. The White House congratulated the Venezuelan people on their high participation levels, and a State Department official emphasized the importance of considering the views of the over 6 million people who voted for the opposition. Capriles accepted defeat in the Venezuelan election, acknowledging the increased support for the opposition. He emphasized the importance of working for all Venezuelans and stated his commitment to serving the people. If he had won, he would have faced challenges due to the National Assembly being dominated by Ch\u00e1vez supporters. President Ch\u00e1vez's fourth presidential victory affirmed his popular support and government's social programs. He pledged to work with the opposition while vowing to continue towards democratic socialism. There are concerns about deepening statist economic policies and erosion of democratic institutions. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela's relations with the United States will likely remain strained due to an anti-U.S. agenda and close ties with Iran. However, Venezuela's support for Colombia's peace process and increased cooperation in counternarcotics and security could ease tensions. President Ch\u00e1vez's announcement of his cancer's return and support for Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as his successor has created uncertainty about Venezuela's political future. Venezuela's Constitution calls for new elections within 30 days if Ch\u00e1vez died before being sworn into office in January 2013 or if he died or had to leave office permanently in the first four years of his new term. This could give Venezuela's opposition an advantage by not having Ch\u00e1vez on the ballot, but sympathy for Ch\u00e1vez could also support a Chavista candidate aiming to protect his legacy and programs."
