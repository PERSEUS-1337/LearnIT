Health plans cannot exclude benefits based on health conditions for qualifying children in all group and individual plans. Children could be denied coverage until 2014, but if offered, they would have access to all covered benefits for treating their health conditions. The ACA prohibits coverage exclusions for children with preexisting health conditions under age 19 starting on or after September 23, 2010. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has broad authority to implement insurance reforms, including regulations to ensure children with preexisting conditions can access their parents' health insurance and receive treatment. The Departments issued rules in 2010 to protect individuals under 19 with preexisting conditions from being denied coverage. Preexisting condition exclusion is defined as a limitation or denial of benefits based on the condition being present before coverage. On July 27, 2010, HHS clarified preexisting condition exclusions for children under 19 in the individual market. Issuers can restrict enrollment to specific open enrollment periods as allowed by state law. State-imposed open enrollment requirements are not preempted by federal regulations. The rules analyze the impact on children with preexisting conditions, estimating over 19 million affected. In 2010, an estimated 19 million children had preexisting conditions, with 540,000 uninsured. Half of these uninsured children had parents without private coverage. The Departments researched take-up rates to estimate the number of children with preexisting conditions who could gain coverage under the regulation. They assumed that 50% of uninsured children with parents having individual coverage will be newly insured, 15% of uninsured children with uninsured parents will be newly insured, and very few children with parents having employer-sponsored insurance will become covered. The interim final regulations estimate that 51,000 uninsured children with preexisting conditions could gain coverage, with most enrolling in the individual health insurance market. The requirement for coverage of children under age 26 will take effect for plan years starting on or after September 23, 2010, with plans required to offer coverage for children until they turn 26 years old. The requirement for dependent coverage includes unmarried children under 26 in group and individual health plans, excluding grandchildren. Grandfathered plans are mostly affected, with exceptions for adult children eligible for employer-sponsored plans. Plans are not mandated to offer dependent coverage, but if they do, it must adhere to the age requirement. The federal statute mandates that health plans offer dependent coverage to unmarried children under 26. The age requirement only applies to plans that choose to provide this coverage. The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury issued rules clarifying that eligibility for dependent coverage cannot be based on financial dependency, residency, student status, or employment. These federal requirements set a minimum standard for plans. The federal requirements for dependent coverage of children under age 26 set a minimum standard for health plans. States can impose more restrictive requirements, such as New Jersey's coverage up to age 31 for unmarried adult children with no dependents. The impact of the regulation on health insurance coverage was estimated by the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services. The Departments estimated that in 2010, there were approximately 29.5 million individuals aged 19-25. Of those, 9.3 million had no access to dependent coverage due to their parents' lack of insurance. This left 20.2 million adult children with parents covered by ESI or non-group insurance. Among them, 3.42 million were uninsured, 2.42 million had non-group coverage, 5.55 million had ESI, 5.73 million were on their parent's or spouse's ESI, and 3.01 million had other coverage. In 2010, out of 29.5 million individuals aged 19-25, 9.3 million had no access to dependent coverage. Among the 20.2 million with parents covered by ESI or non-group insurance, 3.42 million were uninsured, 2.42 million had non-group coverage, 5.55 million had ESI, 5.73 million were on their parent's or spouse's ESI, and 3.01 million had other coverage. The Departments estimated that 5.86 million individuals would be eligible for dependent coverage, with 3.49 million choosing not to enroll in their parent's plan for various reasons. The potential pool of 2.37 million individuals eligible for dependent coverage under their parent's plan is uncertain. National data shows a decline in the uninsured rate for 19- to 25-year-olds, with a decrease from 31.4% in 2009 to 29.7% in 2010. Young adults were the only age group to experience a decline in uninsured rates. The uninsured rate for young adults decreased from 2010 to the first half of 2011, possibly due to the ACA's dependent coverage requirements."
