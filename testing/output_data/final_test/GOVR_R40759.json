The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) extensively uses LRP, and it has been suggested as a cost-effective and time-saving tool for meeting emergency food needs. A proposal in food aid budget submissions from FY2006 to FY2009 recommended authorizing the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to allocate up to 25% of funds for U.S. food aid to local or regional purchases. This would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the U.S. response by eliminating the need for ocean transportation, resulting in cost savings. The proposal for local and regional procurement (LRP) of food aid aims to increase the efficiency of emergency food aid by allowing donors to purchase commodities locally or regionally, eliminating the need for ocean transportation and reducing costs. However, critics argue that this could undermine the coalition of commodity producers, agribusinesses, private voluntary organizations (PVOs), and shippers involved in the food aid program. Previous proposals for LRP in the 2008 farm bill and the fiscal 2010 budget were not adopted. The fiscal 2010 budget proposed using $300 million of International Disaster Assistance funds for local and regional procurement (LRP) to meet emergency food needs. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of LRP compared to traditional food aid, including concerns about cost, timeliness, and impact on agricultural development in developing countries. The Food for Peace Act authorizes the use of U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency food needs and nonemergency assistance, prohibiting local and regional purchase in developing countries. In FY2008, $2.9 billion of U.S.-produced food aid was provided to the WFP and PVOs. Critics question the effectiveness of U.S. food aid policy. Critics argue that U.S. food aid could be more cost-effective and timely with local and regional procurement (LRP). Section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act allows for international disaster assistance (IDA), some of which has been used for LRP of food. Since 2000, about $200 million worth of locally or regionally procured emergency food aid has been provided through IDA funds by USAID. The Office of Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration use IDA funding for emergency food aid. PEPFAR also provides locally or regionally purchased foods to people living with HIV/AIDS. The United States is the largest food aid provider, while the EU, Canada, and Australia are also donors. The EU primarily provides cash-based food aid, with most allocated to the WFP. The EU, Canada, and Australia provide food aid primarily in the form of cash grants to organizations like the WFP and PVOs. Unlike the United States, the EU has stopped providing commodities for development projects and instead focuses on cash financing for food security projects. Canada exclusively provides cash-based food aid, with most contributions going to the WFP. The WFP and PVOs have a long history of using donor funding to procure commodities in developing countries. In 2008, WFP purchased over $1 billion worth of commodities worldwide, with more than half from developing countries. The United States donated $2.1 billion in commodities to WFP. PVOs like Catholic Relief Services carried out smaller scale LRP purchases in 20 developing countries, totaling over $9.8 million in transactions. Funding for these purchases came from private donations, PEPFAR, and OFDA. The Emergency Fund for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), and other organizations like the World Bank and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints have been involved in the Local and Regional Procurement (LRP) program. Evaluations have shown that LRP is cost-effective and timely compared to U.S. commodity donations. Reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Michigan State University (MSU), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have examined issues related to LRP. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that WFP's local procurement in Sub-Saharan Africa cost 34% less than USAID's similar food aid. Delivery of locally procured commodities was more timely than U.S. donations, with delivery times of 35-41 days compared to 147 days. The MSU report also showed cost savings with LRP over in-kind food aid. The MSU report and OECD study found that using Local and Regional Procurement (LRP) instead of in-kind donations of maize in Sub-Saharan African countries saved $68 million over five years. LRP allowed 75% more food aid to be provided to beneficiaries. The cost savings of LRP were greatest for maize and corn/soy blend, with costs being 61% and 52% lower than in-kind food aid. However, factors limiting the efficiency of LRP include unreliable suppliers, poor infrastructure, weak legal systems, timing and funding restrictions, and quality considerations. According to GAO, WFP faces challenges in identifying reliable suppliers, delays in delivery due to limited infrastructure, and issues with weak legal systems affecting contract enforcement. Late or inadequate donor funding hinders WFP's ability to purchase food when needed. Quality concerns exist, but WFP has not analyzed if they are more severe for locally or regionally procured food. LRP has the potential to impact markets by increasing demand and driving up prices for consumers. The MSU report highlights risks associated with food aid operations, including the potential for in-kind aid to reduce production and trade incentives, create dependency, and push local prices above import parity. Improved intelligence on market prices, production levels, and trade patterns is recommended as an antidote to adverse market impacts. The MSU report identifies risks in WFP's LRP activities, including price surges in Uganda, Niger, and Ethiopia. MSU suggests more analysis on market risks and notes potential long-term effects like price instability and market unsustainability. The MSU report highlights risks in WFP's LRP activities, such as price surges in Uganda, Niger, and Ethiopia. Second-order risks can be managed through careful trader selection and competitive tenders. Larger market shares for LRP require well-designed contracting procedures. The OECD study focuses on the cost-effectiveness of LRP and suggests financial aid over food aid in most cases. Context-specific rationale is needed for choosing food aid in-kind over financial aid. The GAO identifies U.S. cargo preference requirements as a possible constraint to U.S. implementation of LRP activities. Cargo preference legislation requires that up to 75% of agricultural foreign assistance cargo be transported on U.S. flag vessels, supported by the U.S. maritime industry. However, GAO reports have found that cargo preference can increase the cost of shipping U.S. food aid and may not effectively support the U.S. merchant marine. According to GAO, cargo preference requirements could impact cost savings and timeliness of food aid deliveries for LRP activities funded by the U.S. government. GAO recommends renegotiating the 1985 memorandum of understanding to address this issue. The potential involvement of smallholders and low-income producers in developing countries in LRP has not been extensively explored in the reports reviewed. The 2008 farm bill authorized a five-year local and regional food aid procurement pilot project in developing countries, funded by $60 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The USDA pilot program aims to use LRP to quickly address food needs during crises and disasters. The USDA pilot program aims to use local and regional procurement to address food needs during crises and disasters. The project phases include developing guidelines, implementing field-based projects, and conducting an independent evaluation. The pilot program projects are set to be completed by the end of FY2011, with USDA contracting for an independent evaluation. Interim guidelines were published in September 2009, with public comment ending in October 2009. The next step is to publish final guidelines and announce requests for proposals for field-based projects. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act provided USAID with $125 million for the Local and Regional Procurement (LRP) program in developing countries. Disaster assistance funds are used for emergency food needs, while development assistance funds focus on food security and strengthening staple food markets. Evaluation criteria include procurement information, impact on markets, and beneficiary outcomes. Farmer organizations' participation, cost reduction in moving goods, financial market support, commodity exchange strengthening, and warehousing are key evaluation points for the program. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act provided USAID with $125 million for the Local and Regional Procurement (LRP) program in developing countries. The program aims to strengthen staple food markets by improving commodity exchanges, warehousing, communications, and finance systems. WFP's Purchase for Progress program (P4P) was established in 2008 to enable smallholders and low-income farmers to supply food to WFP's global operations, connecting them to local and regional markets. The Purchase for Progress (P4P) program, established in 2008, aims to purchase food aid commodities directly from farmers' associations using forward contracting. It creates incentives for farmers to improve crop management skills, produce quality foods, and promote local processing. The program bought 40,000 metric tons of food in its first year and is expected to benefit 350,000 farmers over five years with a total funding of $76 million from various sources including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United States. The P4P program received $20 million from WFP. The Technical Review Panel discussed challenges in implementing the program, such as defining commodity prices for smallholders in forward contracting and ensuring fair prices without market disruption. Other challenges included risk mitigation, quality standards, and ensuring female farmers benefit. Future work will focus on measuring impacts, involving traders, and replicating successful experiences. In the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to allow the U.S. government to use Local and Regional Procurement (LRP) in response to food emergencies without affecting funds for P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations. The President's FY2010 budget allocated $300 million for USAID's International Disaster Assistance program for LRP and cash transfers to address food security. The House-passed bill provided $200 million for these purposes, while the Senate committee bill allocated $1.5 billion for agricultural development. In the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to allocate $1.5 billion of USAID development assistance to agricultural development and food security efforts, including for local and regional purchase and distribution of food. The final Foreign Operations appropriations bill discussed local and regional purchase of food aid commodities under the heading of International Disaster Assistance. Additionally, separate House and Senate-passed agriculture appropriations bills increased funds for P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations from $1.2 billion in FY2009 to $1.7 billion in FY2010. In the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to allocate $1.5 billion of USAID development assistance to agricultural development and food security efforts. S. 384 and H.R. 3077 would establish a Rapid Response to Food Crises Fund for urgent food needs, allowing USAID to preempt crisis escalation with emergency food and non-food assistance. The proposed legislation S. 384 and H.R. 3077 would authorize $500 million for the Emergency Rapid Response to Food Crises Fund, allowing for the purchase and distribution of food, as well as other forms of food-security-related assistance. H.R. 2817 endorses a coordinated approach to addressing food security concerns, calling for over $50 billion to be allocated to global food security initiatives over a five-year period. The Roadmap proposals include $7.4 billion for local and regional purchase of food aid commodities and $9.8 billion for food commodity donations over five years through P.L. 480 Title II."
