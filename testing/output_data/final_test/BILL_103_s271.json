The credit is not available if another taxpayer claims a deduction for the same individual. The new section allows a 15% credit on interest paid on qualified education loans, up to $300, for the first 48 months. The credit is only available if the loan was used for someone else's education expenses and they are at least a half-time student.

This includes refinanced debt but excludes certain types of indebtedness. The term 'qualified education loan' excludes indebtedness owed to a related person. 'Qualified higher education expenses' cover the cost of attendance at an eligible educational institution for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependent. An internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, hospital, or health care facility. Definitions for terms like 'half-time student' and 'dependent' are provided. Special rules include denial of double benefit and determination of marital status.
