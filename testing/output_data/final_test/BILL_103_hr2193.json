    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NASA Aeronautics Research and Technology Act of 1993\". The Congress recognizes the significant economic impact of the aerospace industry in the United States, with a positive trade balance of over $28 billion in 1992 and providing over 1 million high-value jobs. They acknowledge the erosion of the industry's international market share due to foreign competition and reduced investment in national defense. To enhance the competitiveness of the aerospace industry, increased Federal investment in technology base research and development in aeronautics is crucial. Federal investment in aeronautics research and development includes maintaining experimental facilities and supporting pioneering projects like the National Aero-Space Plane. Collaboration with other nations is also considered for programmatic benefits while safeguarding the strategic advantage of the United States. The purposes of this Act are to enhance the competitiveness of the US aerospace industry, improve air safety, reduce noise and environmental damage, modernize aeronautics research facilities, advance technology, and promote technology transfer to US manufacturers. SEC. 4. DEFINITION. An \"independent organization\" is defined as an organization that does not receive significant funding or support from NASA, except under specific sections. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW. The Administrator is required to develop a plan for evaluating aeronautics research progress and NASA programs, including criteria for termination of programs not meeting goals. An independent organization will assist in creating the plan, which must be submitted to Congress within 6 months. The Administrator must submit an annual report to Congress on the evaluation of NASA's progress in aeronautics, conducted by an independent organization, using established criteria and procedures. SEC. 6. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER REVIEW. The Administrator is required to develop a plan for evaluating technology transfer from NASA's aeronautics programs to industry. An independent organization will assist in creating the plan, which must include clear measures of success. A report on the plan must be submitted to Congress within 6 months. Additionally, an annual report on the evaluation results must be submitted to Congress along with the President's annual budget request. Congress requires an annual report on the evaluation of NASA's technology transfer programs, conducted by an independent organization using established criteria and procedures. SEC. 7. JOINT AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Administrator and heads of Federal agencies establish a program for aeronautical research to enhance US competitiveness. Research areas include next-generation wind tunnel technology, advanced engine materials, general aviation, rotorcraft, and hypersonic research. Contracts and grants will be administered jointly. The program established for aeronautical research aims to enhance public and private technology development, involve private contractors in research, and transfer government-developed technologies to the private sector for economic strength and competitiveness. SEC. 8. NATIONAL AERO-SPACE PLANE. The Congress recognizes the importance of hypersonic flight for the economic and strategic interests of the United States. Rocket-based experiments alone are not enough to reduce risk for developing a single-stage-to-orbit plane. A study will be conducted to optimize the next phase of the National Aero-Space Plane. The National Aero-Space Plane program aims to develop a single-stage hypersonic research plane capable of speeds in the Mach 10 to Mach 15 range or greater to accelerate the development of a single-stage-to-orbit, air breathing plane. The Administrator will report the study results to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. The National Aero-Space Plane program aims to develop a hypersonic research plane capable of speeds in the Mach 10 to Mach 15 range or greater. SEC. 9 authorizes appropriations for the program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is authorized appropriations for Research and Development, including funding for Aeronautics Research and Technology Programs for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. This includes allocations for Research Operations Support, Research and Technology Base activities, High-Speed Research, and Advanced Subsonic Technology. For fiscal years 1994 and 1995, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is authorized appropriations for Research and Development, including funding for Aeronautics Research and Technology Programs. This includes allocations for Noise Reduction, Technology Integration for Reducing Environmental Pollution, Other Systems Technology Programs, and the National Aero-Space Plane Program. Additionally, funds are allocated for Construction of Facilities, including Phase I Facility Studies, Requirements Definition, Design, and Modification and Construction of National Aeronautics Facilities at Various Locations. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is authorized appropriations for Research and Development, including funding for Aeronautics Research and Technology Programs. This includes allocations for various projects such as modifications for Composite Technology Center, National Transonic Facility Productivity Enhancement, Performance Improvements in Wind Tunnels, Rehabilitation of Control Systems, Upgrade of Aerodynamic Research Facility, and Modernization of Wind Tunnel Complex. Total funding amounts to $211 million for various aeronautics facilities at different locations."
