    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2851 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to implement the California Solar Initiative. The commission authorizes monetary incentives for solar energy systems meeting eligibility criteria, declining annually after the California Solar Initiative, reaching zero by December 31, 2016. The commission will establish declining incentive levels for solar energy systems, reaching zero by December 31, 2016, with a schedule published at least 30 days in advance. The incentive levels for solar energy systems will decline, reaching zero by December 31, 2021. The commission will implement a performance-based incentive program for solar energy systems, with incentives based on actual electrical output. Incentives will decline by 7% annually and may be applied to customer classes designated by the commission. Customers may receive higher incentives than those based on installed capacity. By January 1, 2008, the commission will require energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings for eligible solar energy systems, with exemptions for low-income housing. Financing options are available to offset installation costs, to be repaid by consumers or through rebates. The commission may develop a time-variant tariff to incentivize ratepayers to install solar energy systems that align peak electricity production with California's peak demands. This tariff ensures fair compensation for ratepayers' contributions and encourages efficient electricity use. Customers with solar systems may be excluded from residential rate caps, but time-variant pricing is not mandatory for ratepayers without solar systems. The California Solar Initiative allows for monetary incentives totaling up to $100,800,000 for solar thermal and solar water heating devices. The California Solar Initiative allocates up to $50 million for research, development, and demonstration of solar technologies and distributed generation technologies. Collaboration with the Energy Commission is required to avoid duplication of efforts. Grants for research must be approved by the full commission at a public meeting. The curr_chunk focuses on funding for research, development, and demonstration under the self-generation incentive program for distributed generation resources. The Legislature recognizes that providing monetary incentives for solar energy systems will encourage private investment and make solar technologies cost-effective. The commission must annually report to the Legislature on the California Solar Initiative program's success, including details on installations, costs, benefits, grid impact, peak demand, goal progress, and recommendations for improvement. The commission must report annually to the Legislature on the California Solar Initiative program's progress, including details on installations, costs, benefits, grid impact, peak demand, goal progress, and recommendations for improvement. If additional funds are allocated to research solar technologies, the commission shall provide a description of the program, a summary of each award or project funded, and the results achieved. The commission will not charge natural gas ratepayers to fund the California Solar Initiative. Charges for the program will be imposed on all customers not in the CARE or FERA programs, including residential customers up to 130% of existing baseline electricity usage. The California Solar Initiative program costs will not be recovered from CARE program participants. The total cost of the program will not exceed $3,550,800,000. The California Solar Initiative program costs, funded by charges from specific utility companies, are capped at $2,366,800,000. Additionally, local publicly owned electric utilities will adopt programs financed at $784,000,000, with no jurisdiction granted to the commission over them or their customers. The Energy Commission administers the New Solar Homes Partnership Program funded by charges from specific utility companies. If funding is exhausted, the commission may require an electrical corporation to continue the program until the authorized funding limit is reached. The Energy Commission oversees the New Solar Homes Partnership Program and may require an electrical corporation to continue the program if funds are depleted. The commission can also have a third party administer the program. If funds run out, the Energy Commission must notify the Joint Legislative Budget Committee 30 days before the program continues. The changes made by Chapter 39 of the Statutes of 2012 do not allow for new charges or increases to existing charges by the Energy Commission. It does not affect the commission's authority to levy or increase charges. The commission authorizes continued collection of charges for low-income housing programs in an electrical corporation's service territory, capped at $108 million. Unspent funds from the California Solar Initiative can be used to reduce the corporation's portion of the total collected amount."
