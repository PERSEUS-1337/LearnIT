    "content": "The passage discusses the importance of addressing tainted water and unsanitary practices in the developing world, highlighting the passage of the Water for the Poor Act in 2005 as a significant step in making safe water and sanitation a U.S. foreign policy priority. Key provisions of the law direct agencies to work towards increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation in developing countries. The Water for the Poor Act in 2005 aimed to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation globally. The legislation required annual reporting on U.S. efforts in this area and urged increased resources and integration of water, sanitation, and hygiene activities within global health initiatives. Congressional support was driven by concerns over the lack of priority given to these programs and the need for alignment with foreign aid goals. The Obama Administration also showed commitment to advancing clean water access, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledging support on World Water Day in March 2010. In March 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to elevate water issues and tasked U.S. officials to address water challenges comprehensively. USAID joined the Sanitation and Water for All partnership in 2012 to improve access to clean water and sanitation. Water-related efforts focus on WASH activities, water resource management, and water productivity. Water productivity projects aim to make water use more efficient for preserving water reserves and protecting water supplies from pollution. Bilateral WASH schemes authorized by the Water for the Poor Act are monitored by the Department of State and implemented by USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. In FY2009, USAID and MCC accounted for 90% of U.S. spending on water issues. Other broader water-related efforts by U.S. agencies are not addressed in this report. The report highlights challenges faced by donors and U.S. agencies in global water and sanitation projects. Approximately 780 million lack clean drinking water and 2.5 billion lack adequate sanitation. WHO estimates 6.3% of deaths are due to water-related issues, with over 14,000 daily deaths from water-borne illnesses. The bulk of deaths related to infections include 2 billion cases of intestinal worms, 5 million cases of lymphatic filariasis and trachoma each, 1.4 million child diarrheal deaths, and 500,000 deaths from malaria. Children, especially those under 14, are more vulnerable to unsafe water and poor sanitation, with 5,000 children dying daily from preventable water- and sanitation-related diseases. WHO believes the impact of unclean water and unsanitary practices is underestimated due to weak data collection. Climate change is expected to worsen water-related diseases. Water advocates link inadequate access to clean water and sanitation with poverty. Several diseases, including diarrhea and neglected tropical diseases, are contracted through contact with bacteria-infested water and soil, causing millions of deaths annually. Good sewerage and drainage systems can eliminate breeding grounds for vectors like mosquitoes and flies. Parasitic worms afflict over 1 billion people annually, leading to various health issues. Worm eggs deposited in the soil can infect humans, leading to stunting, malnutrition, and anemia. Access to improved farming technology, sanitation facilities, clean water, and education can help prevent the transmission of diseases caused by contaminated soil and water. Conflict can exacerbate these issues. The United Nations adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, committing member states to support needy countries in reaching eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Progress is measured through 21 targets and 60 indicators, including Target 7C to provide access to safe drinking water and sanitation. In 2012, WHO announced that the world had met the MDG target for clean water, with over 2 billion people gaining access to improved water sources from 1990 to 2010. Despite global progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goal target for clean water from 1990 to 2010, disparities still exist, with 780 million people lacking access to clean drinking water. Sub-Saharan Africa faces challenges in reaching the target, with only 61% having access to clean water. Certain segments of the population in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the richest quintile in urban areas, have better access to improved water sources. In urban areas, the richest quintile has access to improved water sources and piped water on their premises, while the poorest rural quintile lacks piped water. Improved sanitation facilities are crucial for preventing diseases transmitted through human feces, but access is limited in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. South Asia has made significant progress in sanitation, with 69% having access to improved services in 2010. Sub-Saharan Africa has made the least progress in sanitation targets. In 2010, South Asia saw a slight increase in access to improved sanitation facilities, with 30% of the population having access. Open defecation rates were high at 41%, but had decreased from 67% in 1990. The region made more progress than sub-Saharan Africa in curbing open defecation. Global funding for water and sanitation efforts has been increasing since 1971, but pledges dropped in 2010 compared to 2009 levels. Global funding for water and sanitation has been increasing since 1971. In 2010, pledges dropped from 2009 levels, with $7.8 billion committed by OECD and multilateral agencies. The five largest donors were Japan, Germany, France, the United States, and Spain. The World Health Organization estimates that $72 billion annually is needed to meet water and sanitation targets, with current commitments enough to fund roughly half of that amount. Global funding for water and sanitation has been increasing since 1971, with donor countries pledging $7.8 billion in 2010. The World Health Organization estimates that $72 billion annually is needed to meet targets, but current commitments only cover about half of that amount. Congressional support for clean water and sanitation has grown, with funding increasing from $100 million in FY2003 to $300 million in FY2008. Congress has increased funding for WASH projects, allocating over $300 million for safe drinking water and sanitation supply projects, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Funding for water and sanitation programs has been consistently above $315 million in recent years. USAID has allocated significant amounts to the water sector, with obligations exceeding appropriated levels. The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 has driven budgetary increases for water and sanitation efforts. The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 made access to safe water and sanitation in developing countries a U.S. foreign policy priority. It set goals to halve the proportion of people without access to clean water and sanitation by 2015 and required the development of a strategy to increase affordable and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This strategy includes specific goals, benchmarks, funding assessments, and coordination with other U.S. programs. The Water for the World Act of 2011 calls for the U.S. to provide safe water and sanitation within six years. Senator Richard Durbin introduced the act in the 112th Congress, requiring annual reports on implementation progress and funding allocations. The Water for the World Act of 2011 aims for the U.S. to provide safe water and sanitation to 100 million people within six years. In FY2010, the U.S. spent $953 million on water and sanitation programs globally, with $898 million obligated by USAID and MCC. Other U.S. support includes contributions to international organizations and participation in development banks. In FY2012, the U.S. aimed to extend clean drinking water to over 5 million people but only reached 3 million, with most assistance going to Africa and Asia. Delays in projects in Pakistan, West Bank, Gaza, and Africa were attributed to shifts in program focus. In FY2012, the U.S. aimed to provide clean drinking water to over 5 million people but only reached 3 million, with most assistance going to Africa and Asia. Delays in projects in Pakistan, West Bank, and Gaza were caused by shifts in program focus. The Africa Regional program faced delays in launching a Global Water Development Alliance between Coca-Cola and USAID. However, progress was noted in Kenya, where a water treatment project exceeded its target by 252%. The State Department highlighted the success of the Coca-Cola partnership in leveraging $15 million in private funds to improve access to clean water for 500,000 people. The State Department, USAID, and MCC each have unique roles in achieving the goals of the Water for the Poor Act. The U.S. strategy for expanding access to potable water and sanitation is jointly developed by the State Department and USAID, with USAID and MCC as primary implementers. The State Department reports progress to Congress annually on water and sanitation activities, focusing on USAID-supported efforts. The most recent report covers activities from FY2006 to FY2010. The Department of State also plays a role in expanding access to water and sanitation through diplomatic channels. On World Water Day in March 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of addressing water issues early in the Obama Administration. She called for a five-pronged water strategy focusing on capacity building, water diplomacy, financial support, technology development, and partnerships. Clinton also pledged to elevate water issues within the Global Partnerships Initiative and signed a memorandum of understanding with the World Bank to enhance collaboration. USAID signed a memorandum of understanding with the World Bank to enhance collaboration on water efforts. USAID leads U.S. clean drinking water and sanitation programs, focusing on water supply and sanitation, water resource management, and water productivity. Roughly 70% of USAID's budget is allocated to water supply and sanitation projects, including water purification, public taps, small-scale piped water, and hygiene education programs. In FY2011, USAID obligated $596.7 million for water activities, including $343.8 million for WASH. Congress appropriated $315 million for global water and sanitation programs in FY2012, slightly more than the requested amount. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report analyzing U.S. global water and sanitation efforts from FY2004 to FY2009. USAID invested heavily in water and sanitation in the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa during FY2006 to FY2009. However, delayed projects in the Middle East and North Africa led to lower obligation levels in FY2010. Investments in Asia & Pacific rose significantly in FY2010. In 2010, over half of all funds for water and sanitation programs were obligated in 10 countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 as an alternative approach. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 as an alternative approach to traditional foreign aid. MCC awards aid to countries demonstrating good governance, economic freedom, and investment in their people. MCC-funded programs are country-driven, giving flexibility in resource allocation, unlike USAID programs which are often shaped by congressional directives. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has approved multi-year grant agreements worth over $8 billion in various sectors such as agriculture, transportation, water supply, health, finance, and education. Approximately $803 million is allocated to water and sanitation projects in seven countries. These projects range from improving water networks and wastewater systems to drilling wells and boreholes. The Water for the Poor Act aimed to halve the number of people without clean water and sanitation by 2015, with a focus on increasing investments in sub-Saharan African countries. Key issues raised include clarifying roles of implementing agencies and balancing funding between WASH and other water areas. The Water for the Poor Act directs the Secretary of State to develop a water strategy with USAID, submit progress reports to Congress, and allocate more resources to water and sanitation programs. However, it does not specify authority over funding and implementation. The State Department oversees U.S. progress in international HIV/AIDS programs and is tasked with developing targets for global water access under the Water for the Poor Act and proposed Water for the World Act. However, the State Department lacks budgetary authority to enforce implementation and coordinate program implementation across agencies. Concerns arise that USAID may reduce budgets for non-WASH activities to meet statutory requirements, as seen with decreased spending on water management after the enactment of the Water for the Poor Act. USAID's spending on water management and productivity has decreased while funding for WASH activities has increased. Approximately 70% of investments are now focused on improving water supply and sanitation. There is debate over whether the allocation of funds for water-related projects is appropriate, with some advocating for more support for water management. Congressional language does not prohibit investments in operations and management. The Water for the Poor Act specifies that U.S. assistance should support various aspects of water delivery and sanitation systems, improve water supply safety and reliability, and enhance the capacity of recipient governments and local communities. There is a debate on whether legislative directives should be removed to allow USAID to allocate funds more flexibly across water sectors and other development priorities. In FY2009, USAID allocated $482 million for water and sanitation, with investments focused on five countries: West Bank & Gaza, Jordan, Pakistan, Sudan, and Afghanistan. GAO questioned the selection of \"high priority\" countries, noting discrepancies with UN data on countries in greatest need of improved water sources and sanitation. The Water for the Poor Act specifies that water and sanitation assistance should be focused on countries with the greatest need. However, some high priority countries identified by USAID had high access to improved water and sanitation facilities. Jordan and West Bank & Gaza, among the top recipients of WASH resources, received a significant portion of USAID funding in 2010. Some argue that USAID's allocation of WASH resources to Middle Eastern countries may be driven by geopolitical reasons rather than need. Calls are made to adjust resource distribution to focus on countries in sub-Saharan Africa with greater need. Congressional directives may limit USAID's flexibility in adjusting resource allocation. The U.S. considers various factors, including leveraging resources and sustaining programs, when determining investments. Debate centers on whether need should take precedence over other factors like political will and program success. Water and sanitation projects are considered a \"cross-cutting issue\" by USAID and funded through various accounts managed jointly with the Department of State. The bulk of spending comes from the Development Assistance (DA) and Economic Support Fund (ESF) accounts, each with different objectives and funding levels. This approach aims to address the impacts of limited access to clean water through diverse programs and budgetary sources. Water activities are part of the overarching account's goals and objectives. A government-wide water and sanitation strategy could enhance U.S. international responses. U.N. agencies express skepticism about water and sanitation data. WHO advises against comparing data from different reports due to ongoing data collection improvements. Uncertainty about data raises questions about water and sanitation programs, including how project goals will be met and reaching those most in need. The GAO highlighted the challenge of assessing progress in reaching those in need under the Water for the Poor Act. Governments and donors are urged to improve data collection and research efforts. Congress could allocate resources for rigorous field surveys by USAID and other agencies. WHO suggests developing cost-effective tools for measuring water quality. Ensuring adequate funding for operation and maintenance is crucial for sustaining access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Despite increasing investments in water and sanitation systems, little budget is allocated for operation and maintenance, leading to premature facility failures and compromised service quality. This underfunding creates a cyclical effect as countries expand services through new investments, highlighting the need for proper funding for O&M. Governments struggle to cover costs for operation and maintenance of water and sanitation services, despite new investments from donors. Poorly defined agreements between donors and recipient countries contribute to system failures. The proposed Water for the World Act aims to address concerns raised by the Water for the Poor Act, but challenges remain in achieving water and sanitation goals. The Water for the Poor Act aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation, but lacks specific measures for progress. Congress could consider defining outcomes, duration of tools' functionality, and the link between WASH outcomes and health improvements. There is a perception that congressional support for water and sanitation overshadows other efforts like water management and productivity. The Water for the Poor Act focuses on improving access to clean water and sanitation, lacking specific measures for progress. The proposed Water for the World Act aims to address this ambiguity by emphasizing capacity building and water resource management. Congress may need to clarify how water and sanitation resources should be spent in light of reduced investments in water resource management. Some advocates suggest removing statutory language directing fund allocation. Both acts outline goals for improving global access to clean water and sanitation but do not authorize funds for these efforts. Congress may need to consider authorizing additional funds to support the goals outlined in the Water for the Poor Act and the proposed Water for the World Act. Multi-year funding authority could help agencies like USAID develop long-term plans and achieve program goals more effectively. Funding security is crucial for agencies to plan and implement actions to improve global access to clean water and sanitation. The Water for the Poor Act and proposed Water for the World Act may require additional funding for agencies like USAID to achieve program goals effectively. Congress could direct the State Department to include more details on USG water and sanitation efforts, such as those by the Army Corps of Engineers. The report should cover all implementing agencies and address incomplete compliance with reporting requirements. The State Department has not developed a budget or specific goals for the Water for the Poor Act. GAO reports show a lack of performance measures in annual reports to Congress. The proposed Water for the World Act could cost $1.3 billion annually. Some argue that limited access to clean water should not be the main factor for aid allocation. Some analysts suggest investing aid in countries committed to improving access to clean water and sanitation, sustaining U.S. investments, and forming public-private partnerships. They believe resources should focus on creating an enabling environment, encouraging policy reforms, and monitoring ongoing efforts. U.S. participation in the SWA partnership may help advance these goals, emphasizing country ownership and accurate data collection on water and sanitation issues. The United States faces challenges in accurately measuring progress in reaching those in need of water resources and ensuring efficient use of resources. The Water for the Poor Act and proposed Water for the World Act do not adequately address data accuracy concerns. Congress may need to allocate a separate budget for monitoring and evaluation to ensure data collection across agencies and harmonize efforts. Coordination among U.S. agencies and donors is crucial in improving water and sanitation conditions. The annual report to Congress highlights the need for better coordination among U.S. agencies on water and sanitation efforts. The proposed Water for the World Act suggests creating high-level positions at the Department of State for this purpose. Coordination could involve Ambassadors ensuring cooperation between implementing agencies, developing joint indicators, and illustrating how investments in WASH activities complement each other. The proposed Water for the World Act suggests creating high-level positions at the Department of State and for USAID Mission Directors to coordinate U.S. water and sanitation efforts in high priority countries. Congress should consider the oversight and budgetary duties of these officials, as well as the importance of coordination with other donors. In many developing countries, water and sanitation efforts are primarily funded by foreign donors and the private sector, leading to disjointed management and weak oversight. The Water for the Poor Act calls for 25% of all spending on water and sanitation activities to be allocated. The Water for the World Act of 2011, introduced by Senator Richard Durbin, aims to provide safe water and sanitation to 100 million people within six years. It addresses issues raised regarding the implementation of the Water for the Poor Act, calling for non-federal actors to contribute 25% of funding for water and sanitation activities. The Water for the World Act of 2011 aims to provide safe water and sanitation to those in need on a sustainable basis. It includes creating a Senior Advisor for Water at USAID to oversee water and sanitation efforts in priority countries, integrate water strategies with food security strategies, and ensure at least 25% of funding comes from non-federal sources. The Water for the World Act of 2011 proposes creating a Special Coordinator for International Water at the Department of State to oversee and coordinate US diplomatic policy on global freshwater issues. This coordinator would ensure representation of international freshwater issues in US government efforts and collaborations with other nations and organizations. Additionally, the Act would amend the Water for the Poor Act to enhance development initiatives. The World Act would amend the Water for the Poor Act to integrate the U.S. water and sanitation strategy into global development, health, and food security strategies. It would also assess U.S. foreign assistance for water and sanitation over three fiscal years to support the goal of providing safe water and sanitation to 100 million people. The World Act aims to provide first-time access to safe water and sanitation for 100 million people in high priority countries. It also calls for the United States Government to recommend actions needed to reach this goal and identify best practices for forming public-private partnerships. Additionally, the act includes reporting requirements for USAID Mission Directors to report annually to Congress on the status of safe drinking water and sanitation as a strategic objective. The in-country water and sanitation manager coordinates implementation with host country officials and relevant US government agencies. They conduct research, monitor program effectiveness, and integrate efforts with existing foreign assistance programs. The U.S. Comptroller General submits reports to Congress on these activities. The report to Congress discusses the effectiveness and efficiency of US efforts in providing safe water and sanitation to developing countries. USAID manages various budget accounts for this purpose, including the Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States account, which promotes stability and transition in the region. The Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States account, managed by USAID, supports post-conflict, health, and environment programs, reduces organized crime and HIV/AIDS threats, and promotes economic stabilization and peace negotiations. It also includes programs like Support for East European Democracy (SEED), Development Assistance (DA), Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS), and Economic Support Fund (ESF) to enhance development, health services, and economic and political interests. USAID implements economic stabilization programs, peace negotiations, and democracy transitions. P.L. 480 Title II (Food for Peace) enhances food security in developing countries. Clean water and sanitation efforts involve various actors. The Sanitation and Water for All partnership aims to coordinate international water and sanitation efforts, but there is no central coordinating body yet. Challenges include ensuring accurate data, measuring program impact, and resource management. Municipal or district assemblies may oversee water and sanitation services in some countries. In water and sanitation services, data can be disjointed and inconsistent due to fragmented responsibilities among authorities. National statistics offices and municipal governments maintain separate data, leading to discrepancies in coverage figures. Donors often rely on national data for WASH projects, but this may not align with municipal records, as seen in Mozambique where government records overstated clean water access in certain areas. Debate is intensifying around revising indicators for measuring access to clean water and sanitation. Donors often use the number of beneficiaries as a proxy for impact, but some suggest monitoring sustained access instead of just initial access. Counting the proportion of people with access in a given year may not consider factors like population growth. In measuring access to clean water and sanitation, factors like population growth must be considered. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, open defecation decreased by 11% since 2010, but due to population growth, the number of people practicing it increased by 33 million. Metrics like \"water person years\" (WPY) and functional latrines are advocated to assess the impact and sustainability of investments. The UNICEF and WHO 2012 Water and Sanitation Report now reports the increase in access as a proportion of the current population, rather than just the number of people gaining access. Inadequate investment in clean water and sanitation impacts sustained access, with reports indicating donors focus on expanding coverage but neglect operation and maintenance. Handpump failure rates in sub-Saharan Africa range between 15% and 50%, often due to poorly constructed wells, disagreements on operation costs, and caretakers' inability to maintain operations. Research on water pump sustainability is limited, and reasons for pump failure vary. Debates arise over the sustainability of foreign aid programs, including water and sanitation systems. WHO sets standards for drinking water safety, with compliance rates varying for different water sources. Challenges also exist in maintaining accurate sanitation data. The Chinese government reported an increase in rural use of \"sanitary latrines\" from 1991 to 2008, but there is uncertainty about whether these facilities meet the standards of improved sanitation. Ambiguity in water and sanitation data in China is significant, as the country accounts for a large proportion of those who gained access to improved sanitation."
