    "content": "Synthetic drugs, chemically produced in a laboratory, mimic or enhance the effects of natural drugs. Designer drugs modify molecular structures to bypass drug laws. National attention on synthetic drug abuse began in the 1980s due to concerns about health and safety effects. The focus has shifted to synthetic stimulants and cannabinoids, with concerns over their effects and potential dangers. Congress passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 to address the increase in use of these substances. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted in 1970 to regulate controlled substances. Congress passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 to address synthetic stimulants and cannabinoids. The act aims to schedule and control these substances, with ongoing debates on additional scheduling and regulation measures. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 regulates the manufacture, possession, use, importation, and distribution of drugs. Substances are classified into five schedules based on their potential for abuse and other factors. The Attorney General, through the DEA, is responsible for scheduling substances. The Controlled Substances Act allows the DEA to place drugs on Schedule I based on criteria including high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and lack of safety. The Analogue Enforcement Act treats controlled substance analogues as Schedule I substances if their chemical structure is similar to a controlled substance in Schedule I or II. The Controlled Substances Act allows the DEA to classify drugs based on abuse potential, medical use, and safety. The Analogue Enforcement Act treats substances with similar chemical structures to Schedule I or II drugs as Schedule I substances. Synthetic cathinones marketed as \"bath salts\" or \"plant food\" try to avoid regulation by claiming they are not for human consumption. The Attorney General has the authority to temporarily place a substance on Schedule I of the CSA to prevent imminent hazards to public safety. Factors considered include the drug's abuse history, risk to public health, and duration of abuse. The substance can remain on Schedule I for two years, with a possible one-year extension before permanent scheduling. The Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 extended the DEA's authority in this regard. The DEA's temporary scheduling authority was extended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Since 2002, the DEA has used this authority on 37 synthetic substances. In recent years, the DEA has taken multiple temporary scheduling actions on various synthetic drugs. The DEA has placed multiple synthetic substances on Schedule I, including cathinones, cannabinoids, and acetyl fentanyl. Synthetic drugs have been a focus for law enforcement and policymakers due to their unpredictable effects and unknown chemical makeups. The global emergence of synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids has been noted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Synthetic drugs like \"flakka\" and cannabinoids mimic the effects of stimulants and hallucinogens, as well as THC in marijuana. These substances are often sold as herbal incense and are popular among youth who purchase them online or in stores. The DEA has classified synthetic substances like cathinones and cannabinoids as Schedule I drugs due to their unpredictable effects and unknown chemical compositions. Synthetic cannabinoids, sold as herbal incense under brand names like \"Spice\" and \"K2,\" were first synthesized by Clemson University Professor John Huffman. These substances, such as JWH-018, can be 10 times stronger than THC and have unknown effects. Huffman warns of their dangers, stating they were never intended for human consumption. Reported effects include relaxation, reduced blood pressure, nausea, and increased agitation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted links between synthetic cannabinoid use and acute kidney injury, with reported cases of fatalities and severe adverse reactions. In response, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health issued a warning about the dangers of synthetic cannabinoid use, leading to emergency regulations by Governor Cuomo in New York State (NYS) to combat the issue. In 2014, Governor Cuomo announced emergency regulations to combat the sale of synthetic cannabinoid substances, adding two classes of compounds to the banned list. Poison control centers received a significant increase in calls about these substances in 2015. Youth are the primary users of synthetic cannabinoids. The Monitoring the Future survey reported a rise in synthetic cannabinoid use among 12th graders in 2011, with a prevalence rate of 11.4%. By 2015, the rate had decreased to 5.2%. In 2012, 8th and 10th graders had rates of 4.4% and 8.8%, respectively, which decreased to 3% and 4% by 2015. The DEA placed five synthetic cannabinoids on the controlled substances list in 2011, with a temporary extension in 2012. Congress later passed legislation to permanently schedule these substances in 2012. The Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 permanently added five synthetic cannabinoids to Schedule I of the CSA. Since then, the DEA has temporarily scheduled 10 additional synthetic cannabinoids under the expanded authority of the act. Synthetic stimulants, including methamphetamine, cocaine, and Ecstasy, are chemically produced substances that affect the central nervous system. The DEA has identified methamphetamine as a continuing problem in the United States, with approximately 569,000 current users aged 12 or older. These substances are banned in at least 50 states, Puerto Rico, and by the U.S. military. The percentage of the population using methamphetamine (0.2%) has remained stable over the past decade. Methamphetamine production is a long-standing issue, with most being produced in Mexico and smuggled into the United States. Small-scale, one-pot methamphetamine labs have emerged, allowing for quick production in various locations. In 2010, law enforcement agencies nationwide saw an increase in one-pot methamphetamine production. Domestic meth lab seizures decreased from 10,520 in 2010 to 5,935 in 2014 due to restrictions on precursor chemicals and the availability of Mexico-produced methamphetamine. Congress has enacted legislation over 30 years to combat meth abuse, including stricter regulations on precursor chemicals and increased funding for law enforcement assistance. MDMA, also known as ecstasy, is a psychoactive substance that can induce feelings of increased energy, euphoria, empathy, and distortions in sensory perception. Users may also experience physical effects like increased heart rate, muscle tension, and nausea. It gained popularity in the 1980s and was placed on Schedule I of the CSA by the DEA. In the 1990s, it resurfaced as a popular drug in the nightclub and rave scene. The Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003 targeted producers of raves where MDMA was used, shifting focus from punishing drug users to those who knowingly facilitate drug consumption. The Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003 targeted those who establish places for drug use and authorized appropriations for DEA education on club drugs. In 2013, \"molly\" gained popularity among youth, leading to overdoses and deaths in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The DEA has noted that the market for MDMA in the United States is relatively small compared to other illicit drugs. MDMA seized domestically is produced clandestinely in Canada and smuggled across the U.S. Northern border. Synthetic cathinones, labeled as \"bath salts,\" are a trend in synthetic stimulants. These drugs are sold in powder form under various brand names. Reports suggest that youth may be the primary consumers of bath salts. While population information is limited, reports indicate that youth are the main consumers of bath salts, which contain amphetamine-like chemicals like MDPV, methylone, and mephedrone. These substances pose a high risk for abuse and addiction, with reported side effects including chest pains, elevated blood pressure, hallucinations, and paranoia. Poison control centers received 304 calls about bath salts in 2010, which increased to 6,137 calls in 2011 and has since declined. In 2015, there were 520 reported calls to poison control centers about exposure to bath salts. The decline in calls since 2011 may be related to scheduling actions and the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012. Flakka, a chemically similar designer drug, emerged in 2014 and can cause 'excited delirium' with hyperstimulation, paranoia, and hallucinations leading to violent aggression and self-injury. It is linked to increased body temperature and potential kidney damage. Flakka, a designer drug similar to bath salts, surged in South Florida in 2014-2015, causing hyperstimulation, paranoia, and violent behavior. It is linked to increased body temperature and kidney damage. China's ban on synthetic drugs, including flakka, led to a decline in its use. Congress passed legislation in 2012 to schedule synthetic stimulants. The Act of 2012 added synthetic stimulants and hallucinogens to Schedule I of the CSA. Attorney General Holder placed methylone on Schedule I, and the DEA placed alpha-PVP on Schedule I. All 50 states have banned synthetic stimulants like bath salts. There has been a rise in opioid abuse in the US, including nonmedical use of prescription drugs and illicitly manufactured heroin. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is 50-100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl, a potent opioid used to treat advanced cancer pain, is often abused in non-pharmaceutical forms, leading to a rise in overdoses. Illicitly produced fentanyl, primarily sourced from Mexico, has contributed to a significant increase in drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids. Additionally, analogs of fentanyl, like acetyl fentanyl, are manufactured in China. Pharmaceutical fentanyl has also been diverted from healthcare facilities, pharmacies, and manufacturing plants. W-18, a synthetic opioid developed in Canada in the 1980s, is 100 times more potent than fentanyl. It is being produced in China and has recently surfaced in the United States as a legal substance. Law enforcement has labeled it as the next deadly synthetic street drug due to its potency. Its effects on the body and trends in use are not well understood as it is a new substance on the street market. The Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 added \"cannabimimetic agents\" to Schedule I of the CSA, defining them as five structural classes of synthetic cannabinoids. It also listed 15 specific examples of cannabimimetic substances. The Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 added several synthetic cannabinoids to Schedule I of the CSA, including JWH-019, JWH-200, JWH-250, JWH-081, JWH-122, JWH-398, AM2201, AM694, SR-19, RCS-4, SR-18, RCS-8, and JWH-203. Five of these substances were temporarily placed on Schedule I by the DEA in 2011 and the temporary scheduling was extended in 2012. Congress legislatively scheduled these substances to prevent their removal from Schedule I. The Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 added 11 synthetic stimulants and hallucinogens to Schedule I of the CSA, including Mephedrone, MDPV, 2C-E, 2C-D, 2C-C, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-4, 2C-H, 2C-N, and 2C-P. This act also extended the Attorney General's temporary scheduling authority. The Attorney General can temporarily place a substance on Schedule I of the CSA for up to two years, with a potential extension of one year. Congress faces various issues when deciding to schedule synthetic substances, including impacts on the criminal justice system and medical research. The scheduling of controlled substances affects violators of the CSA and the federal criminal justice system. Penalties for trafficking, manufacturing, and possession of Schedule I controlled substances in the federal criminal justice system can range from fines to life in prison. Factors considered in sentencing include the amount of drugs, number of offenders, type of drug, prior offenses, and aggravating factors. Congress has placed MDPV on Schedule I, leading to fines and potential imprisonment. Nearly half of federal inmates are serving sentences for drug offenses. In FY2014, 6,304 federal drug offenders were sentenced for methamphetamine-related offenses. The federal prison population has been declining but remains high, with nearly half incarcerated for drug-related offenses. Concerns about prison crowding persist, with the Bureau of Prisons operating at 23% over capacity in 2015. The impact of scheduling additional substances on prison population and crowding is uncertain. The Bureau of Prisons is facing challenges with prison overcrowding, especially with the uncertain impact of scheduling additional substances. Consideration of drug research and data is crucial when adding substances to the CSA schedules. Synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids are understudied, which may affect their permanent scheduling under the CSA. Congress has scheduled some \"bath salts\" substances but not all, like methylone. The DEA permanently scheduled methylone in 2013 and may consider scheduling other substances. Unlike HHS and the DEA, Congress is not required to consider research when scheduling drugs under the CSA. Congress has added drugs to the controlled substances list in the past for public safety reasons, such as emergency scheduling of GHB in 2000. Congress may debate whether to pass legislation to permanently schedule certain synthetic drugs under the CSA, considering the imminent threat posed by substances like GHB. Policymakers may also evaluate the effectiveness of the DEA and HHS in scheduling synthetic substances and consider oversight actions in this area. Policymakers may consider the effectiveness of DEA and HHS in evaluating synthetic drugs and potential hindrances to medical research if certain substances are placed on Schedule I. The Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 treats analogues as Schedule I substances. The Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 treats analogues as Schedule I substances under the CSA, but only if intended for human consumption. Proving that synthetic substances like \"bath salts\" are intended for consumption despite being labeled otherwise can be a challenge. The Act requires a substance to be chemically similar to a controlled substance to be considered an analogue, but manipulations in chemical structure can produce similar effects without similarity. DEA warns that these manipulations can evade detection by law enforcement and researchers. The DEA faces challenges in prosecuting drug cases under the Analogue Enforcement Act due to the need for additional investigation to determine if a substance is intended for human consumption and qualifies as an analogue. Expert testimony from various disciplines is required to establish a substance's chemical similarity to a Schedule I controlled substance. The subjective nature of determining \"substantially similar\" compounds adds complexity to these cases. The Analogue Enforcement Act presents challenges in prosecuting drug cases as experts differ on establishing substances as analogues. Scheduling each analogue substance under the CSA could aid prosecution efficiency, but the constant manipulation of chemical structures creates new analogues not covered by the CSA. Policymakers must consider the adequacy of scientific research, drug scheduling, and legislative actions in addressing this issue. The DEA has led major enforcement efforts against the synthetic drug industry, targeting dangerous designer synthetic drug trafficking organizations. Enforcement actions involved retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers, exposing the flow of drug-related proceeds back to countries in the Middle East. In May 2014, the DEA arrested over 150 individuals as part of \"Project Synergy Phase II.\" In \"Synergy Phase II,\" the DEA arrested over 150 individuals and seized hundreds of thousands of synthetic drugs and raw products. Project Synergy III concluded in October 2015 with 151 arrests in 16 states, seizing over $15 million in cash and assets, 4,000 kilograms of synthetic drugs, and revealing money flow to the Middle East. Some cases will be prosecuted under the Analogue Enforcement Act, and Congress may consider amending the CSA to better enforce against the synthetic drug industry. Congress may consider amending the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to better enforce against the illicit synthetic drug industry by adding factors to determine human consumption intent, altering substance definitions, or enhancing criminal penalties for false advertisement. Additionally, legislative options outside of the CSA could be explored to address the importation of dangerous analogue substances."
