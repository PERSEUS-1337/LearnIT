    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act of 2017\" or the \"TAILOR Act of 2017.\" It focuses on tailoring regulation to business model and risk. The \"TAILOR Act of 2017\" defines Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies and regulatory actions, excluding actions specific to individual institutions. It aims to tailor regulations based on business model and risk. Each Federal financial institutions regulatory agency must consider the risk profile and business models of institutions subject to regulatory action, tailoring the action to limit regulatory impact on the institution. Factors to consider include the necessity of applying regulatory action. When considering regulatory action, federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must assess the impact on institutions' ability to serve customers and local markets, as well as the aggregate effect of all regulatory actions. Efforts to implement the action should not undermine tailoring efforts. Each Federal financial institutions regulatory agency must disclose and document how they have applied specific subsections in every notice of proposed and final rulemaking. Additionally, each agency is required to submit reports to Congress annually regarding their regulatory actions. The Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must report to Congress on the actions taken to tailor regulatory actions, and the FFIEC must report on differences in treatment of institutions based on charter type. The Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies are required to review regulations issued after July 21, 2010, and apply certain requirements to them. Any revised regulations must be updated within 3 years of the enactment of the Act."
