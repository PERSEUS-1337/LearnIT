    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"JCPOA Enforcement Transparency Act of 2016\". The United States entered into the JCPOA on July 14, 2015, establishing the Joint Commission. Detailed limitations on Iran's nuclear agreement were set, with a cap on low enriched uranium at 300 kg. Iran was granted an exemption to retain more than 300 kg by the Joint Commission. The JCPOA required Iranian uranium oxide enriched between 5% and 20% to be used for fuel plates, transferred out of Iran, or diluted. The Joint Commission found 20% LEU as unrecoverable lab contaminant. Iran committed to restrictions on hot cell dimensions for 15 years. Iran was allowed to operate 19 large hot cells exceeding the size limit. The Joint Commission established a Technical Working Group in July 2016 to evaluate Iranian stocks of 3.67 percent LEU. Ensuring Iranian compliance with the JCPOA is crucial for preventing the development of a nuclear weapon. The current Administration's policy of secrecy on Joint Commission decisions hinders congressional and public oversight of the JCPOA. SEC. 3. Notification and justification requirement for decisions made by the Joint Commission and Technical Working Group. The President, in consultation with relevant agencies, must notify congressional committees of past and future decisions made by the Joint Commission or working groups, providing a description, justification, and summary of each decision. SEC. 4. PUBLICATION OF DECISIONS. The Secretary of State will publish decision-making process details and summaries of decisions by the Joint Commission or related working groups on a public website. SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS. SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress believes the US representative should oppose any exemptions for Iran under the JCPOA and that evaluations of Iranian compliance should be transparent. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The \"Joint Commission\" is a group representing Iran and the E3/EU+3. The terms \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" and \"JCPOA\" are defined. The terms \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" and \"JCPOA\" refer to the agreement signed in Vienna on July 14, 2015, by Iran and several other countries. The Technical Working Group was established in July 2016 to consider exemptions under the JCPOA related to Iran's low enriched uranium stock."
