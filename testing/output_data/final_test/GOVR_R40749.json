    "content": "The U.S. health care system has significant quality problems, as highlighted by reports from the IOM. These problems include high rates of medical errors, amenable mortality, overuse, underuse, and misuse of services, and a lack of evidence-based guidelines. The system has made efforts to improve, but concerning trends persist. Between 44,000 and 98,000 people die annually due to preventable medical errors, costing $17-29 billion. Serious adverse medication events affect up to 15% of hospitalized patients, with over 100,000 deaths attributed to such reactions each year. The U.S. has a high amenable mortality rate compared to other industrialized countries, ranking last out of 19 surveyed nations. Studies show that 30% of healthcare costs result from poor-quality care, including overuse, misuse, and waste. Studies have shown significant shortfalls in the quality of care in the United States, with up to 30% of patients receiving contraindicated care. Only around half of children and adults receive care recommended by evidence-based guidelines. It takes an average of 17 years for findings from clinical trials to be implemented into practice. Despite experts agreeing on the seriousness of the issue, a precise definition for health care quality remains elusive. The IOM's definition of quality of care is the degree to which health services increase desired outcomes and align with professional knowledge. Quality of care is further defined in six domains: Effective, Efficient, Equitable, Patient-centered, Safe, and Timely. The effort to improve health care quality involves various activities grouped into research, quality measurement, quality reporting, and patient safety. Reliable quality information is essential for these activities to deliver the right care to the right person at the right time. Quality information is crucial for health care quality activities like quality reporting and evidence syntheses. Different types of information, such as clinical practice guidelines and medical error reports, are interrelated and used for various purposes like educating providers and informing consumers. Quality information is essential for various healthcare quality activities, including educating providers, informing consumers, creating payment incentives, and improving safety. This report specifically focuses on quality measurement processes, which assess healthcare processes, structures, and outcomes through the development, endorsement, selection, and implementation of quality measures. Quality measures in healthcare are categorized as structural, process, or outcome measures. Structural measures assess resources and organizational arrangements, process measures evaluate provider activities, and outcome measures look at results like mortality rates. These measures aim to ensure that a sound structure supports appropriate care processes leading to positive outcomes. Composite measures, like 30-day mortality rates post-hospitalization for pneumonia, summarize performance across quality measures in healthcare. These measures are useful for policy makers and the general public. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) include Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-developed composite measures in its Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program. Quality measures may also collect patients' reports of system performance through surveys like Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), funded by AHRQ. Quality measures in healthcare, such as those in the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey funded by AHRQ, evaluate both clinical care delivery and the human aspects of care. These measures aim to address overuse, misuse, and underuse of healthcare services, highlighting variations and disparities in care quality. Development of quality measures can be evidence-based or consensus-based, with a preference for evidence-based guidelines when available. However, consensus-based guidelines are often used due to gaps in the evidence base. Quality measures in healthcare are essential for assessing performance at various levels, including hospitals, healthcare providers, and health plans. Data sources for quality measures include administrative claims data, medical records, registries, and patients' reports. The development of structural and process quality measures is less complicated than outcomes measures, which require complex risk-adjustment manipulations. These measures serve multiple purposes and are utilized by payers, purchasers, consumers, regulators, researchers, and healthcare providers. Quality measures in healthcare are crucial for assessing performance at different levels and are used by various stakeholders. The life cycle of a quality measure involves creation, endorsement, and implementation. This process may not always be linear, but it generally follows these ordered steps. In healthcare, quality measures are essential for assessing performance. Various stakeholders are involved in developing, endorsing, selecting, and implementing these measures. The National Quality Forum aims to coordinate performance measurement and quality activities to avoid conflicting measures. The National Quality Forum (NQF) convened the National Priorities Partnership (NPP) in 2008 with 28 key healthcare stakeholders to improve quality in six priority areas. The NPP focuses on patient engagement, population health, safety, care coordination, overuse, and end-of-life care. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 emphasized the need for a national strategy for healthcare performance measurement. The National Quality Forum (NQF) entered into a contract with a consensus-based entity to strengthen the nation's performance-measurement infrastructure. The NQF recently released its first report, Improving Healthcare Performance, fulfilling this requirement. Quality measures go through a development stage where they are created, refined, and field tested by various measure developers. Quality measures are developed by various organizations like The Joint Commission, NCQA, and AMA's PCPI for use in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and health plans. Measures can be created de novo or adapted from existing ones. Developers typically focus on process measures over outcomes, targeting specific clinical areas or settings. Gaps exist in measure development for services spanning multiple providers or lacking a single responsible entity. Quality measures are developed by organizations like The Joint Commission, NCQA, and AMA's PCPI for evaluating hospitals, physicians, and health plans. The development process includes public input, guidance from technical/clinical specialists, and field testing. Both overuse/cost and improved outcomes guide measure development, with a focus on process measures over outcomes. Gaps exist in developing measures for services involving multiple providers or lacking a single responsible entity. The Joint Commission and NCQA use specific attributes to assess quality measures. NQF endorses measures for 12-24 months without field testing if they meet standards. The Joint Commission has a well-developed process for developing performance measures since 1986. Reporting quality data became a requirement for Joint Commission hospital accreditation in 1998. The Joint Commission, formerly known as JCAHO, accredits healthcare organizations for federal health insurance programs by assessing compliance with quality and safety standards. They focus on patient rights, infection control, medical staffing ratios, and data collection processes to improve care quality. The Joint Commission shifted its focus from developing new quality measures to adapting existing ones in the mid-1990s. This change led to the creation of a standardized process for adapting measures, including the development of core measure sets. Initial measure development involves significant preliminary work, such as reviewing literature. The Joint Commission's measure development process involves reviewing literature to identify existing measures in a specific area. An expert advisory panel is then empanelled with representation from various professionals and stakeholders. The panel issues a \"call for measures\" to solicit input from measure developers, which are vetted against core performance attributes. The Joint Commission's measure development process involves vetting measures against core performance attributes, including target improvement in population health, reliability, validity, interpretability, and accessibility of data. There is overlap with NQF and NCQA criteria. Final candidate measures undergo a 30-day comment period on The Joint Commission's website. The Joint Commission's measure development process involves a 30-day comment period for feedback on final candidate measures. Field testing includes alpha testing for feasibility and utility, and beta testing for reliability, validity, and cost. The expert advisory panel recommends implementation of final measures, which are integrated into ORYX for accreditation. The Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement leads in quality measure development. The Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) is a multi-stakeholder group led by the AMA and composed of national and state medical societies, experts, AHRQ, and CMS. They have developed over 250 measures in 40 clinical areas, used by CMS's Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. These measures are integrated into electronic health records, used for Maintenance of Certification, and quality improvement purposes. The PCPI, established in 2000, develops physician-level measures for quality improvement and accountability. While younger than The Joint Commission and NCQA, PCPI quickly developed a robust process for measure development by drawing on existing work in the field. Strategic changes in emphasis are being made by PCPI. PCPI has refocused its measure-development efforts on high-impact topics with criteria including high variation in care and adequate evidence base. They aim to generate measures in care coordination, patient safety, appropriateness/overuse, and quality improvement collaboratives. The Consortium now focuses on developing a comprehensive \"core\" measure set with topic-specific expert work groups. The PCPI's measure-development process involves a diverse work group, including co-chairs, clinicians, methodologists, guideline experts, patients, and coding experts. The group conducts a literature review, identifies desired outcomes, and drafts measures through in-person meetings and conference calls. Public comments are solicited and incorporated before final submission. The PCPI's measure-development process involves a diverse work group that conducts a literature review, drafts measures, and incorporates public comments before final submission. The revised measures are then submitted for approval to PCPI, undergo testing for reliability and feasibility, and are submitted to NQF for potential endorsement. NCQA plays a key role in developing quality measures for health plans, including the widely used HEDIS tool. HEDIS 2009 is a set of standardized measures used by health plans to assess clinical performance in various areas. It consists of quality measures in eight health care domains and is developed by NCQA with input from stakeholders. Technical Advisory Groups and the Committee on Performance Measurement are key groups involved in the process. The process of developing measures for HEDIS involves identifying a topic, conducting a literature review, and evaluating measures based on relevance, scientific soundness, and feasibility. A Measurement Advisory Panel guides the development process, with initial specifications drafted by a Technical Advisory Group. Measures are field tested, revised, and then presented to the Committee on Performance Measurement for final adoption after a public comment period. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides guidance for developing measures for HEDIS. The process involves CMS, a measure developer, and a Technical Expert Panel. This standardized approach ensures quality measures are used in various initiatives and programs. The CMS-funded measure development process involves defining a topic, forming a TEP, developing a measure framework, identifying candidate measures, reviewing by TEP and CMS, specification development, testing for reliability and feasibility, public feedback, final approval. Based on public feedback, quality measures developed by CMS will undergo final approval and be submitted for consensus endorsement. While CMS does not specify quality measures, it plays a critical role in the process at various points, as outlined in the Roadmap for Quality Measurement in the Traditional Medicare Fee-for-Service Program. The CMS plays a crucial role in the development and approval of quality measures, guiding the process and making final decisions on measure advancement. The AHRQ also plays an important role in supporting research and evaluations for quality measures. AHRQ supports research, evaluations, demonstration projects, and dissemination of information on health care. This includes areas such as quality measurement, cost-effectiveness, clinical practice, health promotion, and medical liability. AHRQ supports various measure-development activities, including the CAHPS survey, AHRQ Quality Indicators, and National Healthcare Quality and Disparities reports. These measures track quality at national and institutional levels, focusing on prevention, inpatient care, patient safety, and pediatric care. CMS has incorporated some of AHRQ's Patient Safety Indicators and Inpatient Quality Indicators into its RHQDAPU program. The National Quality Forum endorses quality measures submitted by various organizations like NCQA, PCPI, and The Joint Commission. These endorsed measures are used by entities such as CMS, Hospital Quality Alliance, and medical boards for quality activities. The endorsement process ensures the measures meet certain standards and are valid and reliable. The National Quality Forum endorses quality measures for use in quality activities by entities like CMS and medical boards. CMS's programs, such as PQRI and RHQDAPU, require the use of NQF-endorsed measures to ensure validity and reliability. The National Quality Forum (NQF) endorses quality measures for healthcare improvement, established in 1999 based on recommendations from the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. NQF collaborates with national consensus building entities to set goals, endorse measures, and promote quality improvement in healthcare. The National Quality Forum (NQF) was established in 1999 to provide national leadership in health care quality improvement. It recommends the creation of an Advisory Council for Health Care Quality and a Forum for Health Care Quality Measurement and Reporting. NQF is the only body that meets the criteria as a voluntary consensus standards-setting organization for health quality measures. Federal agencies are required to use voluntary consensus standards in their activities, as per the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act. The National Quality Forum (NQF) endorses over 500 quality measures, with decisions highly respected by stakeholders. The endorsement process is methodical and lengthy, leading to a lag in keeping pace with measure development. NQF emphasizes harmonizing measures and setting neutrality and common conventions. The consensus development process (CDP) is used to review and judge quality measures for potential endorsement. The National Quality Forum (NQF) uses the consensus development process (CDP) to endorse quality measures. The process involves forming a steering committee, calling for measures, evaluating them against criteria, and member voting. Developers can submit measures for consideration, which are then reviewed for quality and health outcomes. The National Quality Forum (NQF) uses a consensus development process (CDP) to endorse quality measures. Measures are evaluated based on their link to quality and health outcomes, reliability, usability, and feasibility. If a measure passes the initial evaluation, it is then reviewed against the remaining criteria. Measures that survive this process undergo a 30-day public comment period before being voted on by NQF members. The AQA Alliance, formerly known as the Ambulatory Care Quality Alliance, was established in 2004 and is co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). AQA is a consensus organization with broad stakeholder representation that evaluates physician-quality measures for implementation. AQA considered NQF-endorsed measures for adoption, rescinding adoption if NQF endorsement failed. Key goal is consensus on physician-level quality measures for government purchasers and private health insurance plans. AQA now focuses on measure implementation and identifying gaps. AQA-adopted measures may be used in CMS's Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. For the 2009 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI), measures used must meet specific criteria: selected from 2008 set, NQF-endorsed, AQA-adopted, or endorsed by August 31, 2008. AQA adoption allowed measures to be implemented by CMS without NQF endorsement due to AQA's recognized status as a consensus organization. The AQA adoption for the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative allowed for expedited implementation of physician measures. The selection stage for quality measures is critical, especially for accountability purposes. The processes used by CMS and other stakeholders in selecting measures for pay-for-reporting programs are important. The AQA plays a significant role in selecting quality measures for programs like PQRI and RHQDAPU, collaborating with health plans and physicians. This helps prioritize measures for implementation in value-based purchasing initiatives. The Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) was established in response to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, requiring a quality reporting system for physicians. PQRI, unlike its predecessor PVRP, offers financial incentives for reporting quality data to CMS. The PQRI program, established in response to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, offers incentive payments to physicians for reporting quality measures. It was extended through 2010 and contains over 150 measures. Physicians can receive a bonus payment of 2.0% of total charges for meeting quality-reporting requirements. Reporting can be claims-based or registry-based, with options to report on specific measure groups or individual measures. The 2009 PQRI program included quality measures that met specific criteria set by CMS, such as statutory requirements, usability, increasing participation opportunities, alignment with healthcare goals, and support for CMS priorities. The CMS considers public comments and informal requests when selecting measures for the PQRI program. The RHQDAPU program, mandated by the MMA in 2003, was an early step in value-based purchasing for hospitals. Participation in the program is voluntary, and hospitals must report specific quality data to receive a full annual payment update. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 mandated the continuation of reporting requirements for hospitals, increasing the at-risk percentage of annual payment updates. The 2009 RHQDAPU measure set includes over 40 measures, such as process measures, patient perspectives through surveys, outcomes measures, and patient safety indicators. The data collected covers various conditions common in Medicare. The data collected covers common conditions in the Medicare population, including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, as well as surgical care improvement. CMS has expanded its measure set in the RHQDAPU program, guided by the IOM's baseline set of measures and the Hospital Quality Alliance (HQA) recommendations. HQA, established in 2002, works with CMS to collect and publish quality information. The HQA collaborates with CMS to collect and publish quality information, adopting hospital quality measures ahead of CMS. The selection of measures for the RHQDAPU program is guided by specific goals, including expanding measures to outcome and patient perspectives, considering burden on hospitals, harmonizing with other CMS programs, and using currently reported data. CMS prioritizes measures for the RHQDAPU program based on reported data, high-burden conditions, and wide treatment variation. Public comments are considered in measure selection. Quality measurement complexity raises policy and technical issues, relevant for healthcare reform. The lack of harmonization in reporting requirements for quality measures in healthcare remains a significant issue, leading to high burden and costs for reporting entities. Efforts to streamline requirements have been initiated but challenges persist, including complicated and costly reporting processes and inadequate feedback on performance. Standardized quality measures and a uniform approach to generating them are needed to address these issues. The lack of uniformity in quality measures has led to challenges and opportunities in healthcare. Stakeholder diversity has fostered innovation in measuring quality, but also created difficulties in developing uniform measures. This has resulted in gaps in certain areas like end-of-life care due to a lack of evidence-based guidelines. In order to meet policy goals, quality measures may be developed based on consensus guidelines, which can lead to less robust measures. Validity and reliability are key issues in achieving a strong quality measurement system. Validity concerns include the proliferation of similar but slightly different quality measures. The National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) identifies 10 quality measures related to receiving mammograms, leading to challenges in drawing valid comparisons. Issues with accurate attribution of services to specific physicians or group practices make assessing quality of care challenging. Patient reports on care received may help alleviate attribution issues. Difficulty linking performance on outcome measures directly to provider actions is also a challenge. Health outcomes are influenced by various variables not directly controlled by healthcare providers or systems, including environmental factors, access to services, and genetics. Recent concerns have been raised about the relationship between process of care measures and mortality rates, with evidence suggesting a weaker link than previously thought. Ensuring reliability in measurements can be technically challenging, requiring appropriate and comparable data sources. Sample size is crucial for accurate results. The quality of health care is multifaceted, with policy makers proposing various approaches to address the issue. Standardization of quality measures is essential for accurate comparisons across settings. Sample size must be sufficient for valid inferences, and data quality depends on measurement activities. The quality of health care relies on the development and use of quality measures. Congress should consider the issues outlined in the report when creating policies that rely on quality measurement. Relevance of data depends on measurement activities and the measure development process. Key organizations involved in healthcare quality measurement include NCQA, NPP, NQF, PCPI, PQRI, and RHQDAPU."
