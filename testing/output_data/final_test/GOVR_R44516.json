    "content": "The 115th Congress is interested in evaluating support for federal research and development (R&D) activities. The federal government has historically supported R&D efforts leading to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. However, concerns about federal debt and budget deficits have led to difficult decisions regarding the prioritization of R&D within the federal budget. The U.S. government supports a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D for purposes such as national defense, health, safety, environment, energy security, knowledge advancement, workforce development, and U.S. innovation. The federal R&D budget is an aggregation of the R&D components of each federal agency, developed internally as part of each agency's budget process and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Congress plays a central role in the approval of the federal R&D budget. Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities and making decisions about funding allocation. Concerns have been raised about federal spending levels, especially in light of the current deficit and debt. Budget caps may limit R&D funding, leading to the need for resource reallocation across programs and agencies. President Obama's FY2017 R&D budget request is analyzed in this report, including funding from various perspectives and for multiagency initiatives. The report also discusses the budget requests of federal departments and agencies that make up the majority of federal R&D funding. The proposed budget was released on February 9, 2016, and this report provides analyses of government-wide, multiagency, and individual agency funding related to R&D activities. President Obama's FY2017 budget request included discretionary and mandatory funding for R&D activities. The Department of Energy's change in reporting led to a $2 to $3 billion increase in R&D investments annually. Obama proposed $152.333 billion for R&D in FY2017, a 4.2% increase from FY2016. President Obama's FY2017 budget request included a $152.333 billion funding for R&D, representing a 4.2% increase from FY2016. The request covered existing single-agency and multiagency programs, as well as new initiatives. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complex due to inconsistencies in reporting among agencies and the inclusion of R&D activities in non-R&D accounts. The FY2017 budget request for R&D under President Obama included $152.333 billion, a 4.2% increase from FY2016. Federal R&D funding analysis is complex due to reporting inconsistencies among agencies and the inclusion of R&D activities in non-R&D accounts. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) provides data on R&D by agency for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017. Congress makes R&D funding decisions primarily based on individual agency and program perspectives. Seven federal agencies would have received over 95% of total federal R&D funding under the FY2017 budget request. The FY2017 R&D budget request under President Obama included $152.333 billion, a 4.2% increase from FY2016. The largest agency R&D increases were for DOE, DOD, HHS, NSF, and USDA. These 12 agencies accounted for over 98% of current and requested federal R&D funding. In FY2017, President Obama's R&D budget request included increases for DOE, DOD, HHS, NSF, and USDA. NASA would see a decrease in funding, while DOC funding would also drop. The budget included allocations for basic research, applied research, development, and facilities/equipment. The private sector may underinvest in basic research due to factors like long time horizons, technical risk, and shareholder demands for short-term returns. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research in the US, funding 47.0% in 2013, with industry funding 26.4% and other sources funding the remaining 26.7%. In the United States, industry is the main funder of applied research, accounting for 51.1% in 2013, while the federal government funded 36.8%. Industry also provides the majority of funding for development, with 80.6% in 2013, compared to the federal government's 17.8%. Federal R&D funding reflects national priorities such as spaceflight, energy sources, and counterterrorism efforts, with each agency contributing to basic research, applied research, development, and facilities/equipment. In President Obama's FY2017 budget request, Department of Health and Human Services, mainly NIH, accounted for nearly half (47.3%) of federal funding for basic research and about 42.1% of applied research. Department of Defense was the primary funder of development, with 85.6% of total federal development funding. Defense-related R&D is mainly provided by DOD, with some activities at DOE and FBI. Defense-related R&D funding has fluctuated between 50% and 70% of total federal R&D funding for over three decades. In President Obama's FY2017 budget, $80.0 billion was allocated for defense-related R&D, accounting for 52.5% of the total R&D request. The budget also included $72.4 billion for non-defense R&D. The NITRD program, established in 1991, coordinates unclassified networking and information technology research and development across federal agencies. The NITRD program coordinates federal investments in unclassified networking and information technology R&D. President Obama requested $4.542 billion for NITRD funding in FY2017, with increases for DOE and NIST. DOD's funding would have decreased, but DARPA's funding would have increased. The USGCRP integrates federal research on global change processes. The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims to assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change. It seeks to advance climate change science and inform human responses through coordinated federal programs. The program involves thirteen departments and agencies, with a funding request of $2.8 billion for FY2017. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was launched in FY2001 to advance understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale. Federal nanotechnology efforts are coordinated by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering. President Obama requested $1.443 billion in funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in FY2017, with the Department of Energy receiving the largest increase in funding. NNI funding in FY2017 was down $469.4 million from its peak in FY2010. In June 2011, President Obama launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) to invest in emerging technologies for manufacturing jobs and global competitiveness. The National Robotics Initiative (NRI) and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) are key components of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) launched by President Obama to invest in emerging technologies for manufacturing jobs and global competitiveness. The NRI aims to develop robots that enhance human capabilities in various sectors such as manufacturing, space missions, drug discovery, and food safety. The FY2016 funding for NRI is $225 million, with President Obama requesting $221 million for FY2017 across various agencies. President Obama proposed the establishment of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) with $1 billion in funding to support up to 15 institutes. These institutes would focus on developing new manufacturing technologies and bridging the gap from the laboratory to the market. The NNMI aims to support manufacturing technology commercialization and address core gaps in scaling manufacturing process technologies. The Obama Administration awarded manufacturing innovation institutes using DOD and DOE funds before Congress passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act in 2014. The Act established a Network for Manufacturing Innovation program within NIST. President Obama requested over $250 million for manufacturing institutes in FY2017. In FY2017, President Obama requested $1.9 billion for 27 manufacturing institutes over 10 years. He also proposed a $755 million increase in federal spending for cancer research, with $680 million going to NIH and $75 million to FDA. The focus was on cancer immunotherapy. In April 2013, President Obama launched the BRAIN Initiative to give scientists tools to better understand how the brain works. Agencies like DARPA, NIH, NSF, and FDA are participating in this research to uncover how the brain processes and stores information. President Obama requested over $439 million in FY2017 for the BRAIN Initiative, a significant increase from the previous year. The funding included allocations for various agencies such as NIH, DARPA, NSF, DOE Office of Science, and IARPA. Additionally, in his 2015 State of the Union address, President Obama introduced the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) to advance research in healthcare. The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) aims to tailor medical treatments based on individual characteristics like genetic makeup. Total funding for PMI in FY2016 was $200 million, with a request of $309 million for FY2017. The Department of Veterans Affairs is also investing $50 million in genomic sequencing for precision medicine research. President Obama introduced the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) in June 2011 to create new knowledge and tools. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) aims to accelerate the discovery, manufacture, and deployment of advanced materials by creating new knowledge, tools, and infrastructure. It focuses on creating a materials innovation infrastructure, achieving national goals with advanced materials, and equipping the next generation materials workforce. The initiative aims to speed up understanding of materials science to provide practical information for American entrepreneurs and innovators to develop new products and processes, similar to how the Human Genome Project advanced biological sciences. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) aims to accelerate the discovery, manufacture, and deployment of advanced materials by creating new knowledge, tools, and infrastructure. The FY2017 budget did not include a table of agency funding for MGI, which is coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on the Materials Genome Initiative (SMGI). Participating agencies in MGI R&D include DOE, DOD, U.S. Geological Survey, NSF, NIST, NASA, and NIH. The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) collaborates with various agencies like U.S. Geological Survey, NSF, NIST, NASA, and NIH. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed doubling federal clean energy R&D funding over five years, involving 12 federal agencies. This initiative aimed to increase the federal investment in clean energy to $7.7 billion. The remainder of the report provides an in-depth analysis of R&D in 12 federal departments and agencies receiving nearly 99% of total federal R&D funding. Agencies are listed by the size of their R&D budgets, with the largest first. Congress had not completed action on any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2017 as of September 28, 2016. The House Committee on Appropriations reported all nine regular appropriations bills providing R&D funding, with the House passing three. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also reported all nine regular appropriations bills for R&D. President Obama signed the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 into law on December 10 (P.L. 114-254). The Act provides continuing appropriations for federal agencies at 99.8% of FY2016 funding through April 28, 2017. It also includes additional funding for DOD RDT&E designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided FY2017 funding for most federal agencies, except those already covered in previous acts. R&D funding under this act is specified. R&D funding provided under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) is identified in the report. However, it is challenging to determine the exact allocation of funding for R&D in appropriations laws. R&D funding levels are typically known after departments and agencies allocate their appropriations. CRS produces individual reports on each appropriations bill, which can be accessed on their website. The status of each appropriations bill is also available on the CRS web page. Funding for R&D is often difficult to identify in agency budget reports to Congress, as it is usually included in appropriations line items with non-R&D activities. R&D funding levels are determined after departments allocate their appropriations. Congress primarily supports R&D in the Department of Defense through the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriation, which funds the development of military hardware and software. The Department of Defense (DOD) primarily funds Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) in Title IV of the defense appropriations bill. However, RDT&E funds are also allocated in other parts of the bill, such as the Defense Health Program and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The Defense Health Program supports healthcare for DOD personnel and their families, with RDT&E funds used for research on various medical conditions. Congress appropriates funds for these programs in different sections of the defense appropriations bill. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program in the defense appropriations bill supports the destruction of lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. Funds for this program are requested through Defensewide Procurement appropriations. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports the procurement, operation, and maintenance of the naval reserve fleet and a U.S. flagged merchant fleet. RDT&E funding for these efforts is requested in the Navy's Procurement request. The Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund (JIDF) also contains RDT&E monies. The Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO) administers the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund (JIDF), which includes RDT&E funding. This funding is not reported but tracked by JIDO separately from other programs. RDT&E funds are also requested and appropriated for efforts in the Global War on Terror (GWOT) or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), with the funds going to specified Program Elements (PEs) in Title IV. The Bush Administration requested these funds through separate GWOT emergency supplemental requests, while the Obama Administration includes them as OCO requests. The Obama Administration has included OCO funds in the regular budget, not emergency supplementals. Additional OCO funds may be requested if needed. The OCO budget decreased due to reduced operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. GWOT/OCO-related requests include funds for transfer funds like the Iraqi Freedom Fund and Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into these funds and authorizes transfers at the Secretary's discretion. The Obama Administration requested $71.392 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E in FY2017, which is $1.423 billion above the FY2016 level. Additional RDT&E funding was requested for the Defense Health Program and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. No RDT&E funding was requested for the National Defense Sealift Fund in FY2017. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments and DOD agencies, categorized by budget activity. The DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) includes budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 for basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on specific weapon systems development, while 6.6 provides management support. Congressional policymakers are interested in S&T funding for new technology development. President Obama's FY2017 request for Title IV baseline S&T funding was $12.501 billion, $495 million below the FY2016 enacted baseline level. DOD's basic research budget is $2.102 billion for FY2017, with over half of it spent at universities. Basic research (6.1) receives special attention within the S&T program. The Administration is requesting $2.102 billion for DOD basic research for FY2017, which is $207 million less than FY2016. President Obama signed the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 into law, providing continuing appropriations for most DOD activities at 99.8% of FY2016 funding through April 28, 2017. Additional funding for DOD RDT&E, designated as GWOT/OCO funding, includes $78.7 million for Army RDT&E and $3.0 million for Defense-wide RDT&E, as well as $87.8 million for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund. The House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 5293) on June 16, 2016, providing funding for baseline RDT&E and GWOT/OCO requirements. The bill includes $70.293 billion for baseline RDT&E, $325 million more than FY2016, and $1.099 billion less than the FY2017 request. Additionally, $497 million in GWOT/OCO funding is allocated, with $163 million for baseline requirements. The bill also includes $1.467 billion for RDT&E for the Defense Health Program for FY2017. The House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 5293) on June 16, 2016, providing funding for baseline RDT&E and GWOT/OCO requirements. The bill includes $70.293 billion for baseline RDT&E, $325 million more than FY2016, and $1.099 billion less than the FY2017 request. Additionally, $497 million in GWOT/OCO funding is allocated, with $163 million for baseline requirements. The bill also includes $1.467 billion for RDT&E for the Defense Health Program for FY2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017 (S. 3000) on May 26, 2016, providing $70.801 billion in funding for baseline RDT&E, $833 million more than the FY2016 baseline funding. The Senate-reported bill for FY2017 includes $70.801 billion in funding for baseline RDT&E, $833 million more than FY2016, $591 million less than the request, and $508 million more than the House-passed bill. It also provides $374 million in GWOT/OCO funding, $143 million more than FY2016. Additionally, it allocates $1.730 billion for RDT&E for the Defense Health Program, $389 million for RDT&E for Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction, and $3 million for RDT&E work of the Inspector General. The bill includes $13.364 billion for S&T funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provides funding for the Department of Defense for FY2017, including $72.302 billion in baseline RDT&E funding, $2.102 billion for the Defense Health Program, and $389 million for Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction. Additionally, $1.397 billion is allocated for OCO/GWOT RDT&E funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provides $1.397 billion for OCO/GWOT RDT&E funding for FY2017, a significant increase from the FY2016 funding level. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the primary agency for protecting the health of Americans, with the National Institutes of Health receiving over 95% of total HHS R&D funding. Other HHS agencies funding R&D include the CDC, FDA, AHRQ, HRSA. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary federal agency for biomedical and behavioral research, training researchers, and disseminating health information. It consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers, supporting basic and clinical research, research training, and health information dissemination. About 81% of NIH's budget goes to grants, contracts, and research activities. Approximately 81% of NIH's budget is allocated to extramural research through grants, contracts, and awards, supporting over 30,000 non-federal scientists at various research institutions. The NIH Office of the Director oversees overall policy and coordinates programs across the 27 institutes and centers, each focusing on specific diseases or research areas. Separate appropriations are provided to 24 ICs, OD, and intramural Buildings and Facilities account, with three centers funded through assessments on the IC. Funding for NIH primarily comes from the annual Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill, with additional funding for Superfund-related activities. The total funding available for NIH activities is known as the NIH program level, with President Obama's FY2017 budget requesting $33.136 billion, an increase of $825 million over FY2016. The FY2017 NIH budget request included $77 million for Superfund-related research, $150 million for type 1 diabetes research, and $1.825 billion in additional mandatory funds. This included $680 million for the National Cancer Moonshot, $100 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and $45 million for the BRAIN Initiative. The remaining budget request was at the same overall program level as FY2016, with $1 billion from mandatory funds. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside, also known as the evaluation tap, proposed transferring $847 million in funding to the NIH. This tap allows the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study the effectiveness of federal health programs. Despite a limit of 1% of eligible appropriations, recent LHHS appropriations acts have specified higher amounts, like 2.5% in FY2016, for this purpose. This set-aside redistributes funds among PHS and other HHS agencies, with NIH historically being the largest contributor of program evaluation funds. Under President Obama's FY2017 budget request, the ICs would not have received an increase compared to FY2016 except for the $680 million (13%) increase for the National Cancer Institute and a $145 million (9.2%) increase for OD. The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill would have provided NIH with a total of $33.334 billion, including funds from the evaluation tap. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version would have brought the FY2017 NIH program level to $33.561 billion. The FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill would have provided NIH with a total of $34.084 billion, including funds from the evaluation tap and new funding from the HHS Non-recurring Expenses Fund. This amount represents a $2 billion (6.2%) increase over FY2016, with additional funding for Superfund-related activities and the mandatory type 1 diabetes program bringing the total NIH program level to $34.311 billion. The FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill allocated $34.311 billion to NIH, including funds for Superfund-related activities and the mandatory type 1 diabetes program. Congress typically appropriates specific amounts to each IC, allowing NIH to allocate funding to different research areas for maximum flexibility. This pattern has changed in recent years, particularly with Alzheimer's disease research. The FY2017 LHHS appropriations bill allocated $34.311 billion to NIH, including funds for Superfund-related activities and the mandatory type 1 diabetes program. This pattern has changed in recent years, notably with Alzheimer's disease research. The FY2017 NIH budget request highlighted research priorities, with 52% targeted for basic biomedical and behavioral research, including the BRAIN Initiative collaboration. Insights gained from the BRAIN Initiative are expected to aid in understanding brain disorders and developing therapeutic approaches for neurological and psychiatric conditions. The FY2017 NIH budget allocated $195 million to the BRAIN Initiative, with the House and Senate recommending $195 million and $250 million respectively. Funding for Alzheimer's disease research was estimated at $910 million, with the House recommending an increase to at least $1.26 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $400 million for Alzheimer's disease research in FY2017, bringing the total available to approximately $1.391 billion. NIH would target $413 million in FY2017 for antimicrobial resistance bacteria. Additionally, there was a $50 million increase in funding for antibiotic resistance research. NIH planned to spend $6.3 billion on cancer research in FY2017, with $5.894 billion allocated to the National Cancer Institute. In FY2017, $195 million was allocated for the Cancer Moonshot initiative, with no recommended amount from the Senate Appropriations Committees. The House Appropriations Committee supports the initiative and looks forward to spending details from the taskforce. Additionally, $309 million was proposed for the Precision Medicine Initiative, with $4 million allocated to the Food and Drug Administration. In FY2017, funding was allocated for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), including $4 million to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory approaches, $5 million to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology for data privacy requirements, and a $100 million increase to support research at NIH. This increase would scale up the national research cohort to 1 million or more volunteers for research on novel therapeutics and prevention strategies. Funding would also continue for the National Cancer Institute's genetics research on cancer. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommend a $100 million increase for PMI at NIH in FY2017. In FY2017, NIH estimated spending $849 million to support 16,421 individuals in the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards program with a stipend increase. The House Appropriations Committee expects NIH to increase the number of training grants in proportion to funding levels and provide stipend raises consistent with federal pay raises. In FY2017, NIH planned to allocate grants in proportion to the general IC level funding increase of 3% and provide stipend raises consistent with federal pay raises. Research Project Grants (RPGs) are the main funding mechanism, with a proposed budget of $18.2 billion supporting approximately 36,440 RPG awards, including 9,946 new and competing grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee estimated supporting over 11,200 new and competing grants in FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee recommended supporting at least 11,175 new RPGs in FY2017, urging NIH to restore extramural support to 90% of all funding. Currently, 81% of NIH's budget goes to extramural research. The agreement expects a 6.2% increase in funds to support more new and competing Research Project Grants. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977 by the Department of Energy Organization Act, conducting basic scientific research in various fields. The Department of Energy (DOE) conducts basic scientific research in various fields, including nuclear physics and energy production. It has 17 national laboratories operated by contractors, accounting for 40% of DOE expenditures. The Administration requested $14.705 billion for FY2017 for DOE R&D and related activities, with programs in science, national security, and energy. The request included $750 million for mandatory funding, totaling $13.955 billion in discretionary funding. The House and Senate bills for the Department of Energy Office of Science funding for FY2017 were $5.400 billion each, while the final appropriation was $5.392 billion, all discretionary. The request included $100 million in mandatory funding for grants to universities, with a total request of $5.572 billion without the mandatory funding. The final appropriation for DOE R&D and related activities was $13.140 billion, with no authorized funding level for the Office of Science for FY2017. The Office of Science for FY2017 had a final appropriation of $5.392 billion, with no authorized funding level. The largest program, Basic Energy Sciences, received a requested increase of $1.937 billion, including funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers and computational chemical sciences. Funding for the Linac Coherent Light Source II construction was to decrease by $10 million. The House bill proposed $1.860 billion for the Office of Science. The final appropriation for the Department of Energy in FY2017 was $1.872 billion, slightly lower than the Senate bill's proposed $1.913 billion. The request for High Energy Physics saw a 2.9% increase to $818 million. Construction funding for the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (LBNF/DUNE) was set to increase by $19 million. The total project cost for LBNF/DUNE is now estimated to be between $1.260 billion to $1.860 billion, with operations starting in FY2030. The House bill proposed $823 million, while the Senate bill proposed $833 million. The final appropriation for LBNF was $825 million, slightly lower than the Senate bill's proposed $833 million. The request for Biological and Environmental Research (BER) was $662 million, with funding increases for Genomic Science and Climate and Earth System Modeling. The final appropriation for BER was $612 million. The final appropriation for Nuclear Physics was $622 million, with a 3.1% increase in funding. The request for Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) was $663 million, showing a 6.8% increase. A new Exascale Computing program was to receive $154 million as part of the DOE-wide Exascale Computing Initiative. The Exascale Computing Initiative received $154 million, consolidating ongoing activities funded through other ASCR programs. The final appropriation was $647 million, with $164 million allocated for the exascale initiative. Funding for Fusion Energy Sciences decreased by 9.1%, except for U.S. contributions to ITER, which increased to $125 million. The House bill allocated $450 million, including $50 million for ITER, while the Senate bill allocated $280 million with no funds for ITER. The final appropriation was $380 million, with $50 million for ITER and reprogramming authority for an additional $50 million. The cost of U.S. participation in ITER has been controversial due to project delays and funding impacts on domestic fusion research. The Secretary of Energy submitted a report in May 2016 recommending continued U.S. partnership in the ITER project through FY2018. A follow-up report was requested by December 1, 2016, and DOE was directed to hold workshops and report on long-term planning efforts in the fusion energy science community. The DOE requested $3.702 billion for national security R&D, a 1.8% increase from the previous year. Proposed changes included a decrease in Component Manufacturing Development funding, offset by increases in Advanced Simulation and Computing. The Naval Reactors program saw an overall increase, with funding for Ohio class submarines. Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation R&D funding was set to decrease by $25 million. The House bill proposed $3.753 billion for national security R&D, including additional funding for reducing highly enriched uranium use in research reactors. The Senate bill provided $3.760 billion for activities to reduce the use of highly enriched uranium in research reactors and molybdenum-99 production. The FY2017 request for DOE energy R&D was $5.332 billion, with increases in discretionary funding for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs, including Vehicle Technologies. The FY2017 request for DOE energy R&D included increases for Vehicle Technologies and a new Crosscutting Innovation Initiatives program. The request also included funding for clean transportation, biofuels, and smart mobility, as well as a proposed increase in discretionary funding for ARPA-E. The FY2017 DOE energy R&D funding request aimed at reaching a total ARPA-E funding of $1 billion per year. The House and Senate bills proposed different amounts for energy R&D, with the final appropriation totaling $3.988 billion. Both bills provided less funding for EERE compared to FY2016, a smaller increase for ARPA-E, and more funding for fossil energy R&D. The House bill allocated $25 million for natural gas technologies, while the Senate bill allocated $46 million. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created in 1958 to conduct space and aeronautics activities. NASA has research programs in various fields and requested $15.890 billion for R&D in FY2017, which was slightly less than the previous year. The House and Senate bills proposed different funding amounts for NASA, with the House bill providing about $16.483 billion and the Senate bill providing about $16.274 billion. The final appropriation for NASA R&D funding in FY2017 was about $16.657 billion, with no mandatory funds provided. The funding comes through five accounts: Science, Aeronautics, Space Technology, Exploration, and the International Space Station and Commercial Crew portions of Space Operations. The House bill proposed $4 million less than the requested $5.601 billion for Science, while the Senate bill proposed $206 million less. The House bill would have shifted over $300 million from Earth Science to Planetary Science, in contrast to the Senate bill. The final appropriation for NASA R&D funding in FY2017 was $16.657 billion, with no mandatory funds provided. The House bill proposed shifting over $300 million from Earth Science to Planetary Science, while the Senate bill proposed a decrease in Planetary Science funding. The final appropriation included funding for Landsat-9 and rejected funding for the Thermal Infrared Free Flyer. Launch for Landsat-9 is anticipated in 2021. The Senate report recommended the requested amount for Landsat-9 and directed NASA to provide a plan for a 2020 launch date. The request included $50 million for a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, despite reservations about its cost. Congress has consistently appropriated more for a Europa mission than NASA has requested. NASA's FY2017 budget justification included a five-year estimate for funding assuming a 2022 launch. The House and Senate reports recommended funding for Europa orbiter and lander missions, with the orbiter launch no later than 2022 and the lander launch no later than 2024. The Senate called for an expeditious launch to maximize scientific return but did not specify a funding level or launch date. The final statement provided $275 million for the mission as outlined by the House. The House recommended funding for Aeronautics at $790 million, including New Aviation Horizons projects. The House bill allocated $78 million less than the request, while the Senate bill allocated $189 million less. Both committees directed NASA to collaborate with the FAA on unmanned aerial systems integration research. The final appropriation for NASA's Space Technology in FY2017 was $660 million, with a requested increase of 20.4% from FY2016. Congress has consistently provided less funding than the Administration's requests, with proposed mandatory funding of $136 million for technology demonstration missions. This included support for the Restore-L satellite servicing mission. The FY2017 appropriation for NASA's Space Technology was $660 million, with the House bill providing $88 million less than the request and the Senate bill providing the FY2016 amount. Funding priorities included nuclear propulsion research and small launch technology. The FY2017 request for Exploration was $3.337 billion, a 16.5% decrease from FY2016, primarily for the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and the Space Launch System. The FY2017 request for Exploration included funding for the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with a budget of $2.860 billion, a decrease of 21.5% from FY2016. The majority of the reduction was for SLS development, with a target launch date for the first test flight slipping from November 2018 to 2019. The launch readiness date for the first crewed flight of Orion and the SLS (EM-2) is set for FY2023. The House and Senate bills proposed funding increases for Exploration, with the final appropriation being $3.324 billion. Funding for the SLS Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) was recommended in both bills, with the House specifying no funds for the Asteroid Redirect Mission. The FY2017 budget for NASA included funding for the ISS and Commercial Crew, with decreases in both areas. Commercial Crew funding was now part of the Space Transportation budget, which also covered U.S. commercial cargo flights to the ISS and payments to Russia for Soyuz flights. The House and Senate bills proposed less funding for Space Operations than the requested amount. The committee reports did not specify how the recommended funding should be allocated. The Senate report noted $1.185 billion for Commercial Crew, same as the request. The enacted bill provided the same amount for Space Operations and Commercial Crew. The National Science Foundation supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering, established in 1950 by Congress. It is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research, especially in mathematics and computer science, and STEM education programs. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has a STEM education program portfolio and federal student aid support. NSF has six major appropriations accounts including Research and Related Activities (RRA) and Education and Human Resources (EHR). The Obama Administration requested $7.964 billion for NSF in FY2017, a $501 million increase over FY2016. The FY2017 budget request for the National Science Foundation (NSF) was $7.964 billion, an increase of $501 million from FY2016. The request would have increased budget authority in three accounts: RRA by $392 million (6.5%), EHR by $73 million (8.3%), and AOAM by $43 million (13%). The Senate and House proposed budgets differed slightly, with the Senate allocating $7.510 billion (0.6% above FY2016) and the House allocating $7.406 billion (0.8% below FY2016). The final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) signed by the President on May 5, 2017, did not include mandatory funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provides $7.472 billion in discretionary funding to NSF, with a focus on Clean Energy R&D and core activities. The budget justification also includes cross-foundation investments and NSF-wide priorities, such as Understanding the Brain with $142 million allocated. NSF's FY2017 budget includes cross-disciplinary activities like Understanding the Brain, Risk and Resilience, INFEWS, and NSF INCLUDES. Foundation-wide priorities for FY2017 include CEMMSS, CIF21, I-Corps, BioMaPS, and Science, Engineering, and Education. The FY2017 budget for NSF includes funding requests for various programs such as BioMaPS, SEES, and SaTC, with differing percentage changes. The I-Corps program received varying levels of support from different reports, with a final directive for $30 million in funding. The Obama Administration sought a $392 million increase in funding for RRA in FY2017. The FY2017 budget for NSF requested increases for all RRA subaccounts except USARC. The largest percentage increase would go to ENG (9.4%) and the largest dollar increase to MPS ($87.3 million). EPSCoR funding would increase to $171 million (6.7%), with $8.56 million as new mandatory funding. Policymakers have debated funding directives within RRA. Some analysts argue that legislators should determine funding priorities by scientific field within RRA, while others believe scientists at NSF should decide based on their expertise. Funding allocations within RRA were not specified for FY2016 and FY2017, except for limiting Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences to its FY2015 level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provides $6.033 billion overall for RRA, with $544 million allocated for polar research and operations support, including activities for the U.S. Antarctic program. The FY2017 request included an $73 million increase for EHR, totaling $953 million, with the largest increase for EHR Core Research (ECR): STEM Learning at $52 million. The FY2017 request for ECR: STEM Learning in EHR was $52 million, double the FY2016 estimate. Congress did not fund a similar increase for FY2016. EHR programs tracked include GRF and NRT. The FY2017 request for GRF was $332 million, the same as FY2016. NRT funding request was $59 million, an 8.3% increase from FY2016. Funding split between EHR and RRA, not equally. EHR contribution for NRT was $35 million, $6 million above FY2016 estimate. The FY2016 estimate for various EHR programs includes no change in funding for programs like Advanced Technological Education, Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program. However, there is a 40.0% increase in funding for Cybercorps: Scholarships for Service and mandatory funding requests for programs like Advancing Informal STEM Learning and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics + Computing Partnerships. The Senate recommended a 10% increase for the CyberCorps program. The Senate and House reports recommended $55 million for the CyberCorps program, with additional funding for broadening participation in STEM fields at Hispanic Serving Institutions. The explanatory statement directed NSF to provide funding levels for various programs at requested levels, including the HBCU Program and STEM+C Partnerships. The CyberCorps: Scholarships for Service program received $55 million, equal to the Senate report recommendation and 10% above the FY2016 funding level. Additionally, NSF was directed to establish a specific HSI program with no less than $15 million. The NSF was directed to establish a specific HSI program with at least $15 million to build capacity at institutions of higher education that do not typically receive high levels of NSF grant funding. The MREFC account funds R&D at NSF, supporting large construction projects and scientific instruments. The Obama Administration requested just over $193 million for MREFC in FY2017, with funding for projects like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. The Senate report recommended increasing MREFC funding to $247 million. The Senate report recommended increasing MREFC funding to $247 million, including $159 million for three ships in the RCRV program. The House report suggested decreasing funding to $87 million and did not mention the RCRV program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, provides $209 million, with $122 million allocated for building three RCRVs at $41 million per ship. The historical trend shows MREFC typically supports four to six projects, but recent requests for three projects may indicate delays in valuable projects. The Obama Administration sought increased funding for AOAM, with a majority going towards relocating NSF headquarters. Difficult choices may arise between funding for research and funding for research facilities due to operational costs of large projects like NEON. Funding for NSB and OIG remained relatively stable between FY2016 and FY2017. P.L. 115-31 provides approximately the same levels of funding as in FY2016 for AOAM, NSB, and OIG. The FY2017 NSF budget request included funding for three multiagency initiatives, with increases for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, Networking and Information Technology Research and Development, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The House and Senate reports did not include recommendations for these initiatives. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts research to support agriculture, including traditional techniques, organic farming, bioenergy, nutrition, food safety, and social sciences. USDA's research is carried out by four agencies under the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area. The U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts research through four agencies under the Research, Education, and Economics mission area. The enacted FY2017 Agriculture appropriation provides $2.891 billion for agricultural research, with a decrease of $45 million from FY2016. The enacted FY2017 Agriculture appropriation provides $112 million less for buildings and facilities than in FY2016. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) receives $1.170 billion for salaries and expenses, operating 90 laboratories nationwide with 6,600 employees. ARS focuses on food and fiber production, pest management, and regulatory programs. The FY2017 enacted appropriation provides $1.170 billion for ARS salaries and expenses, a $26 million increase from FY2016. The House and Senate bills proposed additional increases. The enacted appropriation rejects proposed reductions in funding for research projects and facilities. APHIS is instructed to continue inspections of ARS facilities. The ARS buildings and facilities account receives $99.6 million in FY2017. The enacted appropriation for FY2017 provides $99.6 million for ARS facilities, a decrease from the previous year. Funding is directed towards priorities like the completion of research units in Fort Detrick, MD and Salinas, CA. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture partners with various institutions for research and education projects. The 1862 land-grant institutions, 1890 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), 1994 tribal land-grant colleges, and Hispanic-serving institutions receive federal funds through statutory formula funding, competitive awards, and grants. For FY2017, NIFA's enacted appropriation is $1.363 billion, a $36 million increase from FY2016. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) received a $25 million increase to reach a $375 million appropriation, with a request for an additional $325 million in mandatory funding to fully fund AFRI at $700 million. The FY2017 appropriation for NIFA is $1.363 billion, with AFRI receiving a $25 million increase. The farm bill did not include the requested $700 million in mandatory funding. The Evans-Allen program for historically black colleges did not receive an increase. The President's request aimed to consolidate STEM education funding, eliminating certain grants. The enacted FY2017 appropriation provides funding for various STEM programs in USDA, including the Higher Education Multicultural Scholars Program and Women and Minorities in STEM Program. An additional $500,000 was allocated to Rural Development for increasing access to STEM education in rural areas. NASS received $171 million for conducting the Census of Agriculture. The FY2017 enacted appropriation provides NASS with $171 million, an increase of $2.8 million over FY2016. The increase is mainly for expanding a feed cost survey. ERS received $86.8 million for economic and social science analysis on agriculture, rural development, and the environment, with a focus on groundwater modeling and drought resilience. The National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have major R&D programs. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aims to promote U.S. innovation and competitiveness through measurement science and technology. NIST research supports U.S. commerce, technological progress, product reliability, and public safety. President Obama requested $1.015 billion in funding for NIST in FY2017, an increase of $50.5 million from FY2016. President Obama requested $2.0 billion in funding for NIST in FY2017, including $1.9 billion for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation and $100.0 million for facility renovations. The discretionary request included $730.5 million for R&D, an increase of $40.5 million from FY2016. President Obama requested $33.5 million increase for programs, $4.0 million for corporate services, and $3.0 million for standards coordination and special programs in FY2017. The ITS account was requested $189.0 million, including $142.0 million for the MEP program and $47 million for the NNMI. NIST received $25.0 million for the NNMI in FY2016 and President Obama requested $95.0 million for the NIST CRF account in FY2017. In FY2017, funding for STRS, ITS, and CRF decreased compared to FY2016 levels. The House and Senate Committees' on Appropriations reported their respective Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bills with differing funding levels. The House-reported funding levels were lower than the request, while the Senate-reported levels were higher for some programs. In FY2017, Congress provided $954.0 million in discretionary funding for NIST, a decrease of $10.0 million from FY2016. Funding for STRS, ITS, and CRF was allocated at different levels compared to the previous year. In FY2017, Congress allocated $155.0 million for the ITS account, including $130.0 million for the MEP program and $25.0 million for the NNMI. $109.0 million was provided for the CRF account, with $60.0 million designated for renovating NIST's radiation physics infrastructure. NOAA conducts research on ecosystems, climate, weather, and oceans. NOAA, created in 1970, focuses on climate, global climate change, weather, and oceans. It manages coastal and marine environments and collects data. One of its main challenges is connecting research programs to broader science needs. NOAA's Research Council has a five-year plan to guide R&D efforts supporting long-term goals. NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan focuses on climate adaptation, weather readiness, healthy oceans, and resilient coastal communities. The plan includes stakeholder engagement, data and observations, and integrated environmental modeling as key objectives. To address gaps in knowledge and capabilities, NOAA's R&D plan asks key questions to frame objectives and prioritize tasks based on available funding. Priorities are set annually during the planning season. The NOAA R&D plan for FY2017 highlights challenges in setting priorities and integrating diverse perspectives for understanding the earth system. Funding for NOAA R&D increased to $848.0 million, with $497.8 million allocated for research. In FY2017, NOAA allocated $814.8 million for R&D funding, with $497.8 million for research, $86.9 million for development, and $263.3 million for R&D equipment. R&D accounted for 14.9% of NOAA's total enacted discretionary budget. NOAA's administrative structure includes seven line offices, such as NOS, NMFS, NESDIS, NWS, OAR, OMAO, and Mission Support. In FY2017, NOAA allocated $814.8 million for R&D funding, with $497.8 million for research, $86.9 million for development, and $263.3 million for R&D equipment. R&D accounted for 14.9% of NOAA's total enacted discretionary budget. OMAO is responsible for the agency's ships and aircraft collecting data for NOAA's missions. Mission Support funds education and administrative functions. Funding for NOAA R&D is included in budget line items with non-R&D activities, making it hard to pinpoint exact R&D allocations. In FY2017, NOAA allocated $814.8 million for R&D funding, with $497.8 million for research, $86.9 million for development, and $263.3 million for R&D equipment. OAR conducts research in weather, climate, and oceans through partnerships with cooperative research institutes. The President's FY2017 request would have provided $171.0 million for laboratories and cooperative institutes, $3.0 million more than the FY2016 enacted funding level. In FY2017, NOAA allocated $814.8 million for R&D funding, with $497.8 million for research, $86.9 million for development, and $263.3 million for R&D equipment. The House committee-reported bill proposed $155.0 million for laboratories and cooperative institutes, while the Senate committee-reported bill suggested $164.7 million. However, P.L. 115-31 ultimately funded the cooperative institutes with $172.0 million. The National Sea Grant College Program consists of 33 university-based state programs supporting research and problem-solving for coastal communities. The FY2017 funding request was $68.9 million, with variations in funding levels from the House and Senate committee-reported bills. Ultimately, P.L. 115-31 allocated $72.5 million for the Sea Grant program. The Sea Grant program was allocated $72.5 million under P.L. 115-31, which is $1.5 million less than the Senate committee-reported bill and $6.5 million more than the House committee-reported bill. Climate research funding includes support for laboratories, cooperative institutes, regional climate data, and competitive research. The President's FY2017 request proposed $189.9 million for climate research, $31.9 million more than the FY2016 enacted funding level. The House committee-reported bill allocated $128.0 million for climate research, $61.9 million less than the FY2017 request. The Senate committee-reported bill provided $158.0 million for climate research, $30.0 million more than the House. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates programs to provide medical care, benefits, and support to veterans. VA funds climate research with $158.0 million, equal to the Senate committee-reported bill. Funding for VA R&D is included in line items that address diseases affecting veterans. President Obama proposed $1.252 billion for VA R&D in FY2017, with $663 million for Medical and Prosthetic Research and $589 million for research supported by Medical Services. Funding levels are determined after the VA allocates appropriations to specific activities. Research and Development at the VA consists of four main services: Biomedical laboratory R&D, Clinical science R&D, Health services R&D, and Rehabilitation R&D. Each service oversees research centers of excellence and is headed by a director who reports to the Chief Research and Development Officer. The directors of the four main Research and Development services at the VA report to the Chief Research and Development Officer. The House-passed Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2017 would have funded Medical and Prosthetic Research at $663 million, $33 million more than FY2016. The Senate-passed bill included $675.4 million for the same account, $45 million more than FY2016 and $12 million more than the House-passed level. The bill H.R. 2577 provided $675.4 million in FY2017 funding for the Medical and Prosthetic Research account. The Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act (P.L. 114-223) was passed by the House and Senate on September 28, 2016, and signed into law by President Obama on September 29, 2016. Division A of the act allocated $675.4 million for the Medical and Prosthetic Research account within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Funding for VA's R&D programs in the Medical and Prosthetic Research account and Medical Services account is summarized in Table 15, with Table 16 detailing amounts for Designated Research Areas (DRAs) important to veteran patients. The Department of the Interior (DOI) was created to protect and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage. President Obama requested $1.048 billion in DOI R&D funding for FY2017, $84.5 million above its FY2016 enacted level. Activities supported include scientific analysis of natural systems. Activities supported by DOI include scientific analysis of natural systems and applied field research to address specific problems like thawing permafrost, invasive species, and flooding. President Obama's FY2017 DOI R&D funding request allocated 5.7% for basic research, 79.0% for applied research, and 15.4% for development. The U.S. Geological Survey conducts basic research within DOI. Funding for DOI R&D is generally included in appropriations line items that also cover non-R&D activities, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact allocation for R&D without precise funding levels. The House passed H.R. 5538, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations act for FY2017 on July 14, 2016. President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-31, providing FY2017 funding for the Department of the Interior and other departments and agencies on May 5, 2017. USGS accounts for over two-thirds of all DOI R&D funding, with funding allocated under seven SIR activity/program areas. The FY2017 budget request for USGS was $1.168 billion, with $736.3 million allocated for R&D, an increase of $59.4 million (8.8%) from FY2016. Funding was distributed across various areas including Ecosystems, Climate and Land Use Change, Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health, Natural Hazards, Water Resources, Core Science Systems, and Science Support. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided $1.085 billion for USGS, which was essentially the same as FY2016 funding. President Obama's FY2017 request included R&D funding for various DOI components, with increases in applied research and development funding for agencies such as BOR, BOEM, FWS, BLM, and NPS. Total FY2017 funding for USGS was $1.085 billion, similar to FY2016 levels. In FY2017, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) received $26.7 million in applied research funding, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) received $11.0 million, Wildland Fire Management (WFM) received $6.0 million, and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) received $5.0 million for R&D. Funding details for DOI components in FY2016 and President Obama's FY2017 R&D funding request are summarized in Table 17. The Department of Transportation (DOT) aims to improve transportation safety, infrastructure, economic benefits, livable communities, and environmental sustainability through R&D activities. President Obama requested $1,188.8 million for DOT R&D and R&D facilities in FY2017, an increase of $305.7 million. In FY2017, the Department of Transportation requested $1,188.8 million for R&D, a $305.7 million increase from FY2016. The Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would account for 88% of the R&D funding. Funding levels are determined after DOT agencies allocate appropriations to specific activities. The President requested $367.1 million for R&D and R&D facilities funding in FY2017 for the Federal Aviation Administration, a decrease of $12.1 million (3.2%) from the FY2016 enacted level. The FY2017 request included $334.9 million for R&D, a decrease of $12.0 million (3.5%), and $32.2 million for R&D facilities, essentially the same as in FY2016. President Obama's FY2017 request included $167.5 million for the FAA's Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account (up $1.5 million, 0.9%). The RE&D funding seeks to improve aviation safety, efficiency, and reduce environmental impact through research in various fields. The Senate passed H.R. 2577 on May 19, 2016, providing $176.5 million for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's R&D account in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. This amount is an increase of $10.5 million (6.3%) from the FY2016 level and $9.0 million (5.4%) above the request. NHTSA R&D focuses on crashworthiness, crash avoidance, regulatory analysis, alternative fuels vehicle safety, vehicle electronics, and emerging technologies. The President requested $344.7 million in R&D and R&D facilities funding in FY2017 for NHTSA, a significant increase from the FY2016 enacted level. The FY2017 budget request included $200 million for an autonomous vehicle development pilot, with a total anticipated funding of $3.9 billion over 10 years. The pilot aims to deploy safe and climate smart autonomous vehicles for urban and corridor transportation networks. Additionally, there was a $52.2 million increase in funding for vehicle electronics and emerging technology R&D in NHTSA's FY2017 budget request. The President also requested $329.8 million for R&D and R&D facilities funding for the Federal Highway Administration in FY2017. In FY2017, the Federal Highway Administration received an increase of $7.4 million for highway safety R&D, $80.0 million for Intelligent Transportation Systems R&D, $149.9 million for State Planning and Research, and $14.9 million for R&D-related administrative expenses. The President also requested increased R&D funding for the Federal Railroad Administration, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation in FY2017. In FY2017, the Department of Transportation (DOT) received increased R&D funding for various components, including the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has core missions related to security and technology, with the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) overseeing R&D activities. In FY2017, DHS proposed incorporating DNDO's R&D responsibilities into a new CBRNE Office, but Congress did not accept this. The President's budget request included $654 million for R&D activities, a 4.5% reduction from FY2016. The S&T Directorate received $470 million, the proposed CBRNE Office $152 million, and smaller amounts went to five other DHS components. The House bill would have provided $665 million for these activities. The final appropriation for R&D activities in the S&T Directorate was $678 million, with the Senate bill proposing $703 million and the House bill proposing $665 million. The S&T Directorate conducts R&D in its own laboratories and funds R&D by other entities. The FY2017 budget request for the S&T Directorate was $470 million, with increases in border security R&D by 71% and decreases in detection of explosives and bioagents R&D by 31% and 28% respectively. The House bill proposed a $9 million increase for the S&T Directorate R&D account, with the additional funding allocated to university centers of excellence. The Senate bill used the FY2016 account structure, resulting in $31 million more than the requested amount for S&T Directorate R&D activities, including $22 million more for Research. The S&T Directorate R&D account received a final appropriation of $471 million, with $22 million more for Research, Development, and Innovation and $9 million more for University Programs. DNDO is responsible for nuclear detection research, development, testing, and operational support. The proposed CBRNE Office had a $152 million request for R&D activities, a 3.2% decrease from FY2016. The request for the CBRNE Office R&D account showed few changes from FY2016, with priorities shifting towards international rail and aerial detection. The House bill supported the requested amount, while the Senate bill did not establish the CBRNE Office. The final appropriation did not support the CBRNE Office but funded DNDO R&D at the same level as the request after adjustments for account structure differences. The House bill supported the requested amount for DNDO R&D programs, including Architecture Planning and Analysis. DHS lacked department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, as highlighted by a 2012 GAO report. DHS has made progress in developing policies and guidance for coordinating R&D activities, including defining R&D and tracking projects. GAO's concerns about DHS R&D have been partially addressed, but the department still lacks a mechanism for understanding research and development. The Department lacks a mechanism for capturing and coordinating research and development activities across DHS, despite progress in defining and tracking R&D projects. The FY2017 budget request established a Common Appropriations Structure for DHS components, but some R&D-related activities may not be fully captured under the Research and Development account title. The FY2017 DHS budget documents showed $300 million in FY2015 funds for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility construction under the S&T Directorate account, not the Research and Development account. Appropriations bills in the FY2017 cycle did not address DHS R&D coordination explicitly. Congress directed DHS in 2013 to review programs related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats for potential improvements and cost savings through consolidation of organizations and missions. In June 2015, a review was completed on the consolidation of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into a new office for DHS-wide coordination of CBRNE strategy. A provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 prohibited the establishment of an Office of CBRNE Defense using FY2016 funds without congressional authorization. The House passed the Department of Homeland Security CBRNE Defense Act of 2015 to establish a CBRNE Office, but the Senate did not take up the bill. The FY2017 budget assumed the office's establishment, but it was not authorized by Congress. The EPA was also involved in these activities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds a broad range of R&D activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control. Congress has funded EPA through appropriations since FY2006, but it is challenging to determine the exact allocation for R&D alone. EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account funds much of its R&D efforts. The EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account funds scientific research activities, including R&D conducted by the agency and external entities receiving EPA grants. The account receives base appropriations and transfers from the Hazardous Substance Superfund for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. The EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) manages R&D at headquarters, laboratories, and external research. The S&T account funds EPA R&D activities, including research grants and programs implemented by other EPA offices with a research component. The EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account receives funding for research activities, including R&D conducted by the agency and external entities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provides $721.9 million for the EPA S&T account for FY2017, representing 9.0% of the agency's overall appropriations. The Act includes a $7.4 million rescission within the S&T account and transfers from the Superfund account. The rescission is to be applied to program project areas to reflect changes in funding projections due to routine attrition. The House Committee on Appropriations included rescissions in the S&T and EPM accounts of H.R. 244 to capture expected savings. The Act specifies that the rescission should not affect \"Research: National Priorities\" in the S&T account. The President's FY2017 budget did not fund these national priorities, which are for high-priority water quality research grants. The FY2017 appropriations did not include an additional $10.0 million for EPA research on oil and gas development. In FY2016, $10.0 million was allocated for EPA research on oil and gas development in the Appalachian Basin and for certification and compliance activities related to vehicle emissions. Congress did not complete action on most appropriations bills for FY2017. The House passed H.R. 5538 for EPA funding, including the S&T account. The FY2017 appropriations for EPA's S&T account decreased compared to FY2016 levels and the President's FY2017 budget request. The House-passed H.R. 5538 proposed funding levels higher than the enacted amount, while the Senate Committee-reported S. 3068 proposed lower levels. Variability exists in funding levels for individual EPA program activities. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Explanatory Statement provides guidance for EPA's S&T account, including directives for the National Center for Computational Toxicology and research efforts for Enhanced Aquifer Recharge. The statement also recommends contracting with the National Academy of Sciences for peer review of the agency's draft Integrated Risk Information System assessment of formaldehyde.
