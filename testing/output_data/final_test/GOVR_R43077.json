    "content": "In 2015, over 68,000 wildfires burned 10.1 million acres, with 7.4 million on federal lands, the largest acreage burned on record. Acreage burned is not always indicative of wildfire severity or impact on human development. Other indicators like severity of wildfires should also be considered. In 2015, wildfires burned 10.1 million acres, with 4,636 structures destroyed and 13 firefighter fatalities reported. Wildfire management involves coordinated activities by authorities to prepare for, resolve, and recover from wildfire events. Activities include fuel reduction, preparedness, suppression, and site rehabilitation. Fuel reduction reduces ignition likelihood and potential damage, while preparedness ensures safe and cost-effective fire management. Wildfire management involves tasks to protect against, respond to, and recover from incidents. Suppression is extinguishing fires, and site rehabilitation repairs fire-damaged lands. Federal, state, and local agencies respond to wildfires based on land ownership. Federal government responds to fires on federal lands, while states respond to fires on nonfederal lands. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service handles wildfire response. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and the Department of the Interior manage wildfire response and management across national forests, grasslands, parks, wildlife refuges, Indian reservations, and other public lands. The National Interagency Fire Center coordinates resources for wildfires nationwide. DOI and FS receive annual funding for wildfire management activities through appropriations bills. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and the Department of the Interior manage wildfire response and management across national forests, grasslands, parks, wildlife refuges, Indian reservations, and other public lands. DOI and FS receive annual funding for wildfire management activities through appropriations bills. Funding is allocated to four DOI agencies\u2014Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), National Park Service (NPS), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for wildfire-related activities. DOI and FS each have two accounts for wildfire: a Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and a Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) account. FLAME is a reserve fund for wildfire suppression that requires certain conditions be met to transfer funding from FLAME to the WFM account. The Fire Operations program receives the majority of the WFM appropriation and funds preparedness and suppression activities. The Other Fire Operations program funds hazardous fuels reduction activities, joint fire research programs, and financial assistance for wildfire management. Annual total wildfire management appropriations from FY2007 to FY2016 are shown in Table 1. Wildfire management appropriations have increased significantly since the late 1990s, with variations between $3.8 billion in FY2001 and nearly $5.0 billion in FY2008 and FY2016. From FY2007 to FY2016, combined FS and DOI wildfire management appropriations averaged $3.8 billion, with FS receiving 76% and DOI receiving 24% of the total appropriations. FS wildfire management appropriations also make up a large portion of total FS discretionary funding. In FY2016, FS wildfire management appropriations accounted for approximately 61% of the agency's discretionary funds. Fire Operations receives the largest share of funding from both agencies' WFM accounts, with 78% of the combined WFM appropriation on average over the last five years. The Other Fire Operations program funds different activities in FS and DOI, including hazardous fuels management and fire assistance for FS, and fuels management for DOI. Fire Operations appropriations for fuels management, joint fire science activities, and burned area rehabilitation. Preparedness funds support fire prevention, detection, equipment, training, and personnel. FS uses funds for decision support tools, aviation assets, and predictive services analysis. DOI uses funds for fire management plans, cooperative agreements, infrastructure support, firefighting assets, and NIFC. $1.41 billion appropriated for preparedness activities in FY2016, a decrease from FY2015. The funding level for DOI preparedness activities decreased in FY2016 to $1.41 billion from $1.46 billion in FY2015. FS preparedness funding has averaged $1.0 billion annually over the past five years, with a significant increase from $673.7 million in FY2011 to $1,004.4 million in FY2012 due to restructuring activities. Suppression funds are typically provided through the WFM and FLAME accounts in Interior appropriations laws, with additional funds sometimes provided through supplemental appropriations laws. Suppression funding data is presented in three sections based on different funding sources. Wildfire suppression spending covers firefighter salaries, aviation operations, incident support, and resources for DOI incidents. DOI suppression activity includes personnel expenses not covered by the preparedness subaccount. The suppression activity received $1,102.7 million in FY2016, a 10% increase over FY2015 levels. Appropriations for hazardous fuels reduction are used to decrease fuel loads on federal lands to make fires less intense and more controllable. In FY2016, Congress appropriated $545.0 million for hazardous fuels reduction activities on federal lands, with $375.0 million allocated to FS and $170.0 million to DOI. The hazardous fuels reduction appropriation has averaged $492.2 million annually over the last five years. Congress established a FLAME account to cover costs of large fires when suppression funds are exhausted. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior can transfer funds from their agency's FLAME account to their WFM account for fire suppression activities upon a secretarial declaration. The conferees of the FY2010 Interior appropriations bill intended for FLAME account funds to fully cover wildfire suppression needs and prevent borrowing from non-fire programs. In FY2016, DOI and FS exhausted their FLAME appropriations and transferred all FLAME funds. Table 2 shows FLAME account funds from FY2007 to FY2016. In FY2016, Congress appropriated $1.0 billion to the FLAME accounts ($823.0 million to FS; $177.0 million for DOI). If funding in the WFM suppression activity and FLAME account are exhausted, FS and DOI can transfer funds from other accounts for continued suppression activities, known as \"fire borrowing.\" Agencies must request supplemental appropriations to repay borrowed funds, which Congress may provide through legislation. Congress has provided additional wildfire funds in 6 of the 10 fiscal years since FY2007, with funds designated as emergency spending and not subject to certain discretionary budgetary constraints. Additional funds are typically specified for wildfire suppression, fire transfer reimbursement, and emergency rehabilitation. Since FY2007, Congress has allocated additional wildfire funds in 6 out of 10 fiscal years. The FLAME account was established in FY2010, with extra funds provided in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2016. Total suppression appropriations for DOI and FS in a fiscal year may come from WFM suppression activity, the FLAME account, and supplemental appropriations. In FY2016, the total combined suppression appropriation was $2,802.7 million, with a $700.0 million supplemental appropriation. This was more than double the FY2015 total. The highest appropriation was in FY2008 at $2,845.4 million. The Administration requested $4.4 billion for wildfire management in FY2017, a decrease from the previous year. The proposed funding mechanism includes changes to the FLAME reserve account. The House passed H.R. 5538, which would provide $3.9 billion for wildfire management. H.R. 5538 would provide $3.9 billion for wildfire management in FY2017, fully funding the 10-year suppression obligation average and including additional funds for hazardous fuel management. The bill does not adopt the Administration's proposal to eliminate the FLAME account or provide a budgetary adjustment mechanism for wildfire suppression funding. The House Committee on Appropriations supports the proposal but declines to make a recommendation on the budgetary adjustment mechanism due to jurisdictional issues. The bill would make the FS WFM appropriation available for three fiscal years. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3068, the FY2017 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, providing $4.4 billion for wildland fire management. $661.3 million is designated for wildfire suppression as emergency spending. The bill does not allocate funds to the FLAME reserve accounts and includes a recommendation to adopt the Administration's proposed new funding mechanism for wildfire suppression activities. The Administration proposed a new funding mechanism for wildfire suppression activities in FY2016 and FY2017, which includes eliminating the FLAME reserve account. Congress did not adopt the proposal in previous years. Wildfire suppression is currently funded by appropriations subject to spending limits. The proposal would maintain funding for most operations but establish a new adjustment to the limits for emergency situations, with a maximum adjustment of $1.4 billion in FY2017. The Administration is requesting an adjustment of up to $1.2 billion for FY2017, with the maximum adjustment amount increasing each fiscal year until FY2022. This adjustment would allow for additional wildfire suppression funds that would not be subject to discretionary budget limits. Congress is debating federal funding for wildfire management, including the level and direction of spending and the effectiveness of that spending. Wildfire spending has more than tripled since the 1990s. Wildfire spending has more than tripled since the 1990s, increasing to $4.9 billion in FY2016. Congress is debating the allocation of funds for wildfire management activities, including the impact of rising suppression costs and the need for investing in hazardous fuel reduction to reduce future costs. When wildfire suppression funding is depleted, agencies may have to transfer funds from non-wildfire management accounts, leading to potential performance impacts. Congress must decide whether to reimburse these accounts. Congress has provided additional funding for wildfire management in 6 of the last 10 years, leading to questions about wildfire funding structure and estimation methods. Wildfire suppression funding estimates depend on various factors, complicating discussions during the appropriations process. Wildfire suppression estimates often underestimate costs due to various factors like weather, fuel load, and access to wildfire sites. Analyzing trends in wildfire management could provide valuable insights for Congress. However, analyzing funding trends before FY2001 is challenging due to changes in account structures and the creation of new programs like the FLAME account in FY2010. In FY2010, appropriations previously allocated solely to wildfire suppression were split between two accounts. Costs for one wildfire season may span two fiscal years, with appropriations sometimes covering costs from previous fiscal years."
