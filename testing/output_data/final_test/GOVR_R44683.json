Individual congressional career length is not aggregated in the report, and there are variations in job titles and duties across committees.

However, the data does not include information on education, age, pay, or other factors that may influence staff tenure. Tables in this section offer tenure data for selected positions in House committees. The Appendix provides tenure data for various positions in congressional offices, focusing on staff tenure in House committees. Tables summarize staff tenure for selected positions since 2006, including job titles, average and median years of service, and trends in staff tenure. Average and median length of tenure columns offer different measures of central tendency, with the average representing how long staff remain in a position on average. The average tenure in a job position can be influenced by outliers, with some individuals staying for many years and others for a brief period. The median, representing the middle value, is less affected by extreme observations. Generalizations about staff tenure are limited due to the availability of reliable data and the unique nature of congressional positions. The lack of demographic information about congressional staff may limit the assessment of tenure data. Variations in job duties and work settings across House committees can affect staff tenure. Additional data on age, education, and other elements are needed for a comprehensive analysis. Between 2006 and 2016, staff tenure in House committees increased by six months or more for nine position titles, while remaining unchanged for four positions. Pay influences staff retention, with lower-paying positions typically having shorter tenures. This trend aligns with national workforce patterns, suggesting that entry-level roles in House committees follow similar retention trends. Between October 2000 and March 2016, House and Senate staff had varying tenures based on job titles, with some positions requiring specific experience leading to longer stays. There were 1,884 unique titles categorized into 33 job titles used in congressional offices, with some titles specific to Member or committee offices. Office type sometimes influenced the job titles used. Some job titles in congressional offices reflect specific roles, duties, seniority, or location. Titles may vary between staff members carrying out similar activities, with examples like Administrative Director and Administrative Manager, or Caseworker and Constituent Advocate. Job titles can also be modified by policy or subject area, such as Domestic Policy Counsel or Energy. The report includes various job titles in congressional offices, modified by policy, party affiliation, or committee subdivision. The titles reflect specific roles and duties, such as Majority or Minority Professional Staff Member, Full Committee Staff Member, or Subcommittee Staff Member. The list of titles used by most House committees is provided in Table A-1, with additional variations included for completeness. Congressional offices can request a full list of titles by category."
