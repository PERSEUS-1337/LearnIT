    "content": "The policy of the United States aims to end animal suffering caused by leghold traps by banning their import, export, and interstate shipment, along with fur from animals trapped in such traps. In this Act, the term \"article of fur\" includes any furskin, whether raw or tanned, and any article made in whole or part of furskin. The term \"customs laws of the United States\" refers to laws enforced by the Customs Service. \"Interstate commerce\" has the same meaning as in section 10 of title 18, United States Code. The United States Code defines terms such as \"import,\" \"person,\" and \"Secretary.\" It also defines a \"conventional steel-jawed leghold trap\" as a specific type of trap. The United States Code defines terms like \"import,\" \"person,\" and \"Secretary,\" as well as a \"conventional steel-jawed leghold trap\" as a spring-powered device with steel jaws designed to capture an animal by closing on its limb. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED ACTS AND PENALTIES. It is illegal to import, export, or sell fur or steel-jawed leghold traps in interstate commerce if derived from trapped animals. Violators face penalties under title 18, United States Code. For each subsequent violation, the offender may face imprisonment for up to 2 years, a fine under title 18, United States Code, or both. SEC. 4. REWARDS. The Secretary will pay half of the fine to anyone providing information leading to a conviction under this Act. Government officials are not eligible for rewards. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary enforces this Act and its regulations, utilizing personnel and facilities from other agencies if needed. Import violations are treated as customs law violations, while export violations are enforced under the Export Administration Act of 1979. The district courts of the United States have the authority to issue warrants for enforcing the prohibition on exporting articles under this Act. Enforcement authorities can detain, search, and seize packages if there is reasonable cause to suspect a violation of the Act. Enforcement authorities have the power to make arrests without a warrant for violations of the Act in their presence or with probable cause. They can also execute warrants issued by a judge for enforcement purposes. Additionally, forfeiture of items is possible under certain circumstances. Forfeiture of fur articles or steel-jawed leghold traps in violation of the Act results in forfeiture to the United States, following applicable laws for seizure, forfeiture, and disposition of such property. The Export Administration Act of 1979 and customs laws of the United States apply to seizures and forfeitures of fur articles or steel-jawed leghold traps in violation of the Act. The Secretary or designated officers may perform duties related to seizures and forfeitures under this subsection. The Attorney General of the United States may seek injunctions. The Attorney General may seek injunctions against violators of the Export Administration Act of 1979 and customs laws. The Secretary of Commerce, Treasury, and other relevant agencies must cooperate to enforce the Act effectively. The Secretary will create regulations to implement the Act, and it will become effective one year after enactment."
