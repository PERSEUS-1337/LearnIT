Rights for Amazigh (Berber) culture, women, decentralization, and judicial independence have expanded under the 2011 constitution. Some question Morocco's stability going forward. Protests in Morocco since 2016 reflect grievances over the economy, governance, and police brutality. Anger at cronyism and corruption led to a boycott movement in 2018. Economic growth has not always outpaced population growth, leading to high unemployment and regional disparities. The king's human rights initiatives have received international praise. In recent years, Morocco has received international praise for political reforms such as ending military trials for civilians and allowing registration for critical civil society organizations in Western Sahara. However, activists and journalists investigating sensitive issues like transparency, human rights abuses, and protests in the Rif region face harassment and prosecution. The crackdown on protests in the north and east has involved serious abuses like excessive force and torture. The country is navigating political power, economic opportunities, and freedom of expression amidst a changing regional and international landscape. Morocco's foreign relations focus on Western partners, Arab Gulf states, and friendly countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Morocco's main Islamist political party, the Party for Justice and Democracy (PJD), holds a plurality of seats in the Chamber of Representatives and has led coalition governments since 2011. The palace and its allies have tried to limit the PJD's influence over policymaking, with the PJD leader unable to form a majority coalition in 2016. The king dismissed Benkirane in early 2017 in favor of former Foreign Minister Saad Eddine al Othmani, who formed a coalition with parties opposed by Benkirane. This included the secularist USFP party, leading to a decline in the PJD's political influence. The PJD, founded by top royal advisor Fouad Ali el Himma, has gained control of more regional councils. Despite advocating for anti-corruption, the party's influence is limited by Morocco's political system. With a shift in focus towards counterterrorism, the palace may intervene more directly in politics to check the PJD. In response, the PJD members voted against Benkirane remaining as party leader in 2017. In 2017, PJD members voted to replace Benkirane as party leader with Al Othmani, who has pursued a less populist approach.

In 2018, a boycott protest movement emerged due to high prices. Morocco is heavily reliant on fossil fuel imports for electricity, but is investing in renewable energy. The World Bank criticized Morocco's subsidies for fuel and electricity in 2014. Morocco ended most fuel subsidies in 2015, except for butane gas used for cooking, following criticism from the World Bank.
