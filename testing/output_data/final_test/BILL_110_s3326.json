    "content": "The \"Pathways to College Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. Congress recognizes the importance of higher education for the economy, stating that 80% of future jobs will require postsecondary education. Workers with bachelor's degrees earn significantly more than those with high school diplomas. The ACT recommends schools provide guidance for college and career awareness. The Department of Education reports a high student-to-counselor ratio in high schools, with counselors spending varying amounts of time on postsecondary education counseling. There is a disparity in college enrollment rates between students from different income quartiles. According to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, there is a significant disparity in bachelor's degree attainment between low-income and high-income students. A report by the Consortium on Chicago School Research highlights that only 41% of Chicago public school students aspiring to attend college take the necessary steps to enroll in a 4-year institution. Additionally, only a third of these students end up in a school that matches their qualifications, with 29% of qualified students opting for community college or not enrolling at all. The Consortium found that many Chicago public school students do not complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, leading to a lack of knowledge about financial aid. Low-income and first-generation families often overestimate tuition costs and underestimate available aid, resulting in fewer resources for college applications and postsecondary plans. College preparation intervention programs can help address these disparities. College preparation intervention programs can significantly increase college-going rates for at-risk youth, expand students' educational aspirations, and improve college enrollment and graduation rates. The grant program outlined in Section 3 aims to support college preparation intervention programs for at-risk youth to increase college-going rates and improve educational aspirations, enrollment, and graduation rates. The Act defines terms like \"local educational agency\" and \"Secretary\" according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An \"eligible local educational agency\" is one where most secondary schools are high-need schools, defined as having at least 50% of students eligible for the school lunch program or counted under a specific section. The Secretary can award competitive grants to eligible local educational agencies for 5 years to carry out specified activities. Grants must be distributed across different regions and types of agencies. Applications are required for grant consideration. Each eligible local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this section, detailing the program to be implemented with grant funds, objectives for increasing college access, and resources available to meet the needs of the targeted secondary school population. The local educational agency must detail goals for increasing college applications, FAFSA completion rates, and school-wide college enrollment rates. They should also describe plans to collaborate with programs funded under chapters 1 and 2 of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The program must provide activities, services, and training for college search and application process, evaluate outcomes, ensure funds supplement other available funds, and calculate college enrollment rates based on verified data for each secondary school served. The program must include activities, services, and training for college search and application process, evaluate outcomes, ensure funds supplement other available funds, and calculate college enrollment rates based on verified data. The method of calculating enrollment rates should track students' first-time enrollment in higher education institutions and may track progress towards degree completion. In awarding grants, the Secretary gives special consideration to local educational agencies serving high-poverty schools. Recipients must develop programs to increase low-income students' enrollment in postsecondary institutions, including those with competitive admissions. Each program funded under this section must provide professional development to secondary school teachers and counselors in postsecondary education advising. It also requires each student to have at least one meeting, by the first semester of the first year of secondary school, with a school counselor, college access personnel, trained teacher, or approved organization to discuss postsecondary options. The program funded under this section requires professional development for teachers and counselors in postsecondary education advising. Students must meet with a counselor or approved organization in the first year of secondary school to discuss postsecondary goals, college expenses, and financial aid options. The program funded under this section aims to strengthen the college-going culture in secondary schools by providing financial aid information, postsecondary planning classes, training for postsecondary coaches, and increasing the number of counselors. The program aims to increase the number of counselors specializing in college-going processes, train student leaders to create a college-going culture, provide opportunities for exploring postsecondary options, assist with test preparation and applications, and establish partnerships with relevant programs. The program aims to increase college-going rates at secondary schools by providing postsecondary follow-up with graduates, creating a postsecondary access center, and increasing alumni involvement in mentoring and advising roles. The program aims to increase college-going rates at secondary schools by providing postsecondary follow-up with graduates, creating a postsecondary access center, and increasing alumni involvement in mentoring and advising roles. Financial aid options are available for professionals working in programs funded under chapters 1 and 2 of subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Funds under this section should supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, and local funds for the described activities. Technical assistance may be provided by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to grantees to raise school-wide college enrollment rates, including assistance in data analysis, best practices recommendations, and annual conferences. Evaluation and reporting requirements are also outlined. Evaluation and reporting requirements for eligible local educational agencies receiving grants include measuring school-wide college enrollment, tracking data for increased college-going rates, conducting periodic evaluations of grant activities, and using evaluations to improve effectiveness. The Secretary must conduct evaluations of grant activities, refine them based on the evaluations, and make the results public. A report on the evaluations must be submitted to Congress within 3 years, including an analysis of the effectiveness of the activities conducted with the grants."
