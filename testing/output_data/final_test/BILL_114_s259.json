The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include additional standards for grid-enabled water heaters, defining an activation lock as a control mechanism that must be activated with a key to operate at its designed specifications. The term 'grid-enabled water heater' refers to an electric resistance water heater with a storage tank volume of over 75 gallons, manufactured after April 16, 2015, and an energy factor of at least 1.061 minus the. The term 'grid-enabled water heater' refers to an electric resistance water heater with a storage tank volume of over 75 gallons, manufactured after April 16, 2015, and an energy factor of not less than 1.061 minus the product obtained by multiplying. The rated storage volume of the tank is expressed in gallons and is 0.00168. The tank's rated storage volume is 0.00168 gallons and must meet specific manufacturer requirements for activation lock and labeling. The water heater is intended for use in an electric thermal storage or demand response program. It requires activation by the utility company or program operator to provide hot water. Manufacturers must provide the activation key for grid operation. The labeler must provide the activation key for a grid-enabled water heater to a utility or company operating an electric thermal storage or demand response program. Manufacturers and program operators are required to report annually on the quantity of grid-enabled water heaters shipped or used. The Secretary will annually analyze data on grid-enabled water heaters activated for programs, with confidentiality requirements for manufacturers' shipment data. In 2017 and 2019, the Secretary will publish an analysis of shipped products placement. The Secretary will establish procedures to prevent product diversion if sales of grid-enabled water heaters exceed activation for demand response and thermal storage programs by 15% annually. Compliance with these measures will remain in effect until specified conditions are met. The Secretary will establish procedures to prevent product diversion for grid-enabled water heaters if sales exceed activation for demand response and thermal storage programs by 15% annually. Compliance with these measures will continue until specific conditions are met. The Secretary will consider the impact on thermal storage and demand response programs, energy savings, electric bills, peak load reduction, electric reliability, integration of renewable resources, and the environment when carrying out this section with respect to electric water heaters. The Secretary will require grid-enabled water heaters to have communication capability for ancillary services programs if deemed practical and cost-effective. The Secretary will require grid-enabled water heaters to have communication capability for ancillary services programs if practical and cost-effective. It is prohibited for any person to activate an activation lock or distribute an activation key for a grid-enabled water heater not used in specific programs. The legislation requires grid-enabled water heaters to have communication capability for ancillary services programs and prohibits tampering with the label of such water heaters. The legislation mandates communication capability for grid-enabled water heaters and prohibits tampering with their labels. Amendments are made to sections 334 and 332(a) of the U.S. Code."
