    "title": "AB 628",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 25250.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define \"used oil\" as oil that has been refined from crude oil or synthetic oil, used, and contaminated with impurities. Examples of used oil include spent lubricating fluids removed from various types of vehicles and machinery, industrial oils like compressor and turbine oil, hydraulic oil, metalworking oil, refrigeration oil, and railroad drainings. Used oil does not include oil with a flashpoint below 100 degrees Fahrenheit or mixed with hazardous waste, except for minimal amounts of vehicle fuel. It also does not include wastewater subject to regulation under the federal Clean Water Act. The exception for \"de minimis quantities of used oil\" applies to small spills or leaks during normal operations, not from abnormal manufacturing operations. It also excludes oil with PCBs at 5 ppm or higher and re-refining distillation bottoms used for making asphalt products. Oil with PCBs at 5 ppm or higher and oil containing over 1000 ppm total halogens are considered hazardous waste, but the presumption can be rebutted by proving the absence of hazardous waste. The presumption that oil with over 1000 ppm total halogens is hazardous waste can be rebutted if it is household waste or collected from small quantity generators. \"Board\" refers to the California Integrated Waste Management Board. \"Recycled oil\" is defined as oil meeting specific requirements. Recycled oil is produced from used oil mixed with contaminated petroleum products or oily wastes, managed as hazardous waste if necessary, and must meet specific requirements. The recycled oil must meet specific requirements, including being produced by a generator lawfully recycling its oil or at a used oil recycling facility authorized by the department. Mixing used oil with contaminated petroleum products or oily wastes is only allowed if it does not impact compliance with specifications. The recycled oil must meet purity standards, not be hazardous, not be mixed with hazardous waste, and not be subject to regulation as hazardous waste under federal law. The oil produced at a used oil recycling facility in the state is not hazardous if it meets purity standards for flashpoint, total lead, arsenic, and chromium. It is not subject to federal hazardous waste regulation. The oil produced at a used oil recycling facility in the state is not hazardous if it meets purity standards for total arsenic, chromium, cadmium, halogens, and PCBs. Total arsenic should be 5 mg/kg or less, total chromium 10 mg/kg or less, total cadmium 2 mg/kg or less, total halogens 3000 mg/kg or less, and total PCBs less than 2 mg/kg. Recycled oil must contain not more than 1000 mg/kg total halogens. Compliance with purity standards for total arsenic, chromium, cadmium, halogens, and PCBs is required for recycled oil at a facility. Blending or diluting used oil with other substances is not allowed. Records of incoming and outgoing oil volumes and characteristics must be maintained to demonstrate compliance with regulations. The paragraph defines terms related to used oil facilities, including recycling, storage, and transfer facilities. It also specifies the conditions for a contaminated petroleum product. Used oil that has not been treated by the generator and meets specific conditions is not subject to regulation by the department. This exemption also applies to contaminated petroleum products that are not hazardous waste. The used oil must meet specific criteria to be exempt from regulation by the department, including not being hazardous, not mixed with hazardous waste, not subject to federal regulation, compliance with notification and testing requirements, not disposed of improperly, and meeting all requirements for recycled oil. Used oil recycling facilities and generators must maintain operating logs and certification forms if they claim their recycled oil meets requirements. Those claiming exemption from regulation must notify the department in writing and comply with testing and recordkeeping requirements before reuse. The burden of proof lies with the generator or recycling facility, transporter, or user to demonstrate compliance with standards and criteria. Used oil must be managed according to this chapter and Part 279 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations."
