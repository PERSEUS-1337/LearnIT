They will also evaluate Federal research programs and aim to improve coordination among agencies. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2004 requires the Task Force to develop a national research program to address harmful algal blooms' impacts on coastal ecosystems, public health, and the economy. The plan includes establishing priorities for research, improving coordination among federal agencies, and promoting diverse participation. The Secretary of Commerce, along with other federal agencies, will establish a research program to address harmful algal blooms' impacts. The program will prioritize diverse participation, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and institutions serving underrepresented populations. The Secretary will ensure that program results are communicated to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as the general public. SEC. 105. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
