    "content": "The \"Natural Gas Competitiveness Act of 1995\" may be cited as the short title. Associations of independent producers of natural gas are addressed in the Act. Independent producers of natural gas can collaborate in associations to collectively produce, transport, and market natural gas in the United States, subject to certain regulations. Associations must operate for the mutual benefit of their members and comply with specified requirements. Associations of independent natural gas producers must adhere to regulations limiting the volume of nonmember-produced gas they can handle. They are restricted to dealing with a maximum of 20% of the total US natural gas production from the previous year. The text chunk states \"SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF ACTIVITY.\" The Attorney General may serve a complaint on an association if there is reason to believe they are monopolizing or restraining trade in natural gas, leading to price increases. The complaint must state the claim, set a hearing date, and require the association to show cause why they should not cease their activities. The Attorney General may issue an order to an association if they are found to monopolize or restrain trade in natural gas, causing price increases. The order will direct the association to cease and desist from such activities after a hearing where evidence is presented and recorded. The Attorney General can file a petition in court to enforce an order against an association found to monopolize or restrain trade in natural gas. The court has the authority to affirm, modify, or set aside the order based on the evidence presented. The facts found by the Attorney General are considered prima facie evidence, but both parties can present additional evidence during the proceedings. During the petition process, the court can issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the association from violating the order. SEC. 4. LIMITATION. This Act does not limit the right to assert claims against an association under antitrust laws or State laws. SEC. 5. DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENT PRODUCER OF NATURAL GAS. The term \"independent producer of natural gas\" refers to a person who produces natural gas, excluding those to whom certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are inapplicable."
