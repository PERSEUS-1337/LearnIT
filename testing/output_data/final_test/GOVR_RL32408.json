    "content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates wireless transmissions to prevent interference by allocating radio frequencies. Interference at 800 MHz was caused by commercial cell phone towers, particularly Sprint Nextel's \"push to talk\" network. The FCC did not anticipate this when assigning frequencies for short messages over commercial mobile radio. The FCC announced a rebanding plan in 2004 to consolidate public safety frequencies and move some commercial users to prevent interference at 800 MHz. This decision aimed to eliminate interference caused by the close proximity of commercial and public safety channels. The FCC supported a rebanding plan proposed by Nextel to consolidate public safety frequencies and prevent interference at 800 MHz. The conversion process was delayed due to disputes over cost reimbursement, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis. The final completion date for the transition remained uncertain until the FCC ruled to establish December 9, 2013, as the deadline for resolving all cost-sharing obligations. Key provisions negotiated with Nextel apply to Sprint Nextel after the merger. The FCC supported a rebanding plan proposed by Nextel to consolidate public safety frequencies and prevent interference at 800 MHz. The plan involves relocating various users to different channels within the 800 MHz band and Nextel giving up some licenses. The transition deadline was set for December 9, 2013, with cost-sharing obligations to be resolved by then. Key provisions negotiated with Nextel apply to Sprint Nextel after the merger. The FCC decision values the 1.9 GHz spectrum rights for Nextel at nearly $4.9 billion, minus relocation costs for incumbent users. Nextel will receive credits for relinquishing spectrum rights at 700 MHz and 800 MHz, as well as for relocation costs in the 800 MHz band. An \"anti-windfall payment\" to the Treasury will be made by Nextel, and they must provide comparable facilities to public safety and incumbent users. Escrow accounts and a letter of credit totaling $2.5 billion will ensure completion of the band reconfiguration process, overseen by an independent Transition Administrator. The FCC rebanding plan requires Sprint Nextel to pledge $2.5 billion for relocation costs, with an additional potential windfall of $2.8 billion. If costs reach $2.5 billion, a $300 million \"anti-windfall payment\" is due to the U.S. Treasury. If costs exceed $2.8 billion, the Treasury receives nothing. Sprint Nextel may be obligated to pay the Treasury if costs are no more than $850 million. The Transition Administrator (TA) must document all relocation costs reimbursed by Sprint Nextel to potentially apply towards an anti-windfall payment to the Treasury, which could reach $2 billion if costs are no more than $850 million. The final determination, known as a true-up, has been extended due to rebanding deadline extensions. The TA must provide regular reports to the FCC on rebanding costs to calculate any payment owed by Sprint Nextel. The TA is an independent organization facilitating a smooth transition in accordance with FCC rules. The Transition Administrator (TA) oversees the administration and financial management of the rebanding plan in accordance with FCC rules. The TA monitors progress, enforces deadlines, and requests cost estimates from public safety and private wireless networks. Disputes unresolved by the TA may be referred to the FCC. The TA team includes members from Deloitte Consulting LLP, Squire, Sanders, & Dempsey LLP, and Baseline Wireless Services, LLC."
