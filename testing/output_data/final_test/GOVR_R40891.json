    "content": "Prior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), the amount a debtor could exempt as equity in a homestead was limited by state exemptions. BAPCPA added a new factor for debtors who purchased property shortly before filing for bankruptcy. It also restricted debtors' options for choosing state exemptions. This prevented individuals from moving to a state with more favorable exemptions before filing for bankruptcy. The report discusses the federal homestead exemption and the impact of BAPCPA on a debtor's homestead exemption. It includes a survey of current homestead exemptions in the fifty states and the District of Columbia, with details on state and federal exemptions. Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code allows individuals to exempt equity in certain property from the bankruptcy estate, with federal exemptions including a $21,625 homestead exemption and a $1,150 \"wildcard\" exemption that can be applied to the homestead. The Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to choose between federal or state exemptions for their homestead, with some restrictions on mixing and matching. In some states, federal exemptions are not allowed, but when available, they can be used in addition to state exemptions. Despite some states offering higher homestead exemptions than federal law, BAPCPA introduced provisions that limit this. BAPCPA imposed limitations on debtors' ability to use state homestead exemptions if their equity interest in the property exceeds a certain value acquired within 1215 days before filing for bankruptcy. The maximum exemption is $146,450 unless specific conditions apply, such as felony convictions or certain financial violations. Additionally, any value in the residence from property disposed of within the previous 10 years may also be restricted. BAPCPA limits debtors' ability to use state homestead exemptions if their equity interest in the property exceeds a certain value acquired within 1215 days before filing for bankruptcy. The debtor's value in the residence must be reduced if all or part of the value in previously owned property could not have been exempted in bankruptcy. Debtors must have lived in their current state for at least two years before being eligible for that state's exemptions, with restrictions on determining their domiciliary state. BAPCPA limits debtors' ability to maximize exempt assets by restricting the use of state homestead exemptions based on the debtor's equity interest in the property acquired within a specific timeframe. To qualify for a homestead exemption exceeding $146,450, debtors must acquire the interest approximately three years and four months before filing for bankruptcy. State laws regarding exemptions were reviewed on Westlaw and LEXIS databases to determine eligibility criteria for debtors. The survey provides relevant excerpts of state statutory language regarding homestead exemptions, but it is not comprehensive and may not include exemptions for proceeds after the sale of a homestead or exemptions established by case law for tenancies by the entirety. Exceptions to the homestead exemption are not addressed in the survey."
