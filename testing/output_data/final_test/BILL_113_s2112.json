    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Natural Gas Gathering Enhancement Act\". Congress acknowledges the record levels of natural gas production in the United States, which have led to various benefits such as reducing the need for gas imports, creating new jobs, and boosting the country's GDP. This production also strengthens trade relationships with Canada and Mexico and opens up opportunities for the U.S. to participate in the global gas trade through LNG exports. Large quantities of natural gas are lost due to venting and flaring in areas with insufficient infrastructure, hindering development. Additional authority for the Secretary of the Interior to approve pipelines on Federal and Indian land would help bring gas to market. The Secretary of the Interior can approve pipelines on Federal and Indian land to bring gas to market, reducing venting and flaring and increasing royalties collected by the government. SEC. 3 amends the Act of February 15, 1901 to include approval authority for natural gas pipelines. SEC. 4 adds regulations for natural gas gathering lines on Federal and Indian land. The term 'gas gathering line and associated field compression unit' refers to a pipeline used to transport natural gas production from wells drilled for crude oil, along with a compressor to increase gas pressure for pipeline flow. The term 'gas gathering line and associated field compression unit' excludes pipelines transporting gas to common carrier pipelines or facilities. Federal land excludes National Park, Wildlife Refuge, and Wilderness Preservation System units. Indian land refers to land owned by Native American tribes. The issuance of a sundry notice or right-of-way for a gas gathering line on Federal or Indian land servicing an oil well is categorically excluded from the National Environmental Policy Act requirements. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 exempts gas gathering lines and field compression units from certain requirements if they are within a field with an approved land use plan or environmental document and located adjacent to an existing disturbed area for road or pad construction. This exemption does not apply to Federal land without approval from the State Governor. The Governor of the State can request exemption for Federal land from certain requirements, while Indian land falls under the requirements unless the tribe requests otherwise. This section does not affect prior consent requirements under specific laws. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include provisions regarding tribal consent for rights-of-way across Indian land under Federal law. \"SEC. 1841. NATURAL GAS GATHERING SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS.\" The Natural Gas Gathering Enhancement Act requires a study to identify ways to expedite permitting for gas gathering lines and field compression units on Federal or Indian land for transporting natural gas associated with crude oil production. The Natural Gas Gathering Enhancement Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report every 180 days on the progress made in expediting permits for gas gathering lines and field compression units on Federal or Indian land for transporting natural gas associated with crude oil production. The Natural Gas Gathering Enhancement Act mandates regular reports on expediting permits for gas gathering lines on Federal or Indian land for transporting natural gas associated with crude oil production. Technical amendments are made to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to address any issues hindering progress. The Natural Gas Gathering Enhancement Act mandates reports on expediting permits for gas gathering lines on Federal or Indian land. Amendments to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 address hindrances to progress. New sections are added for natural gas gathering lines and system assessments. Deadlines for permitting natural gas gathering lines are established under the Mineral Leasing Act. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to establish deadlines for permitting natural gas gathering lines on Federal lands, with specific timelines for different types of projects. SEC. 6. Deadlines for permitting natural gas gathering lines on Federal lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Section 504 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to include deadlines for permitting natural gas gathering lines on public lands. The Secretary concerned must issue a sundry notice or right-of-way for gas gathering lines within specific timeframes after receiving the request for issuance."
