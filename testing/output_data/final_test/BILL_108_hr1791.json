    "content": "The text introduces a new section, SEC. 1364, regarding the election for special tax treatment of certain S corporation conversions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A qualified electing S corporation may elect special tax treatment for an eligible corporate conversion by transferring to a partnership without recognizing gain or loss for shareholders. Other distributions of money or property by the corporation are treated as payment in exchange for stock. A qualified electing S corporation can elect special tax treatment for an eligible corporate conversion by transferring assets to a partnership without recognizing gain or loss for shareholders. The term 'qualified electing S corporation' refers to a domestic corporation with a valid S election for 10 consecutive taxable years before making the election under this section. The qualified electing S corporation can transfer assets to a partnership without recognizing gain or loss for shareholders if certain requirements are met. These requirements include maintaining continuity of the S corporation's business for 5 consecutive taxable years following the corporate conversion. The qualified electing S corporation must maintain continuity of its business for 5 consecutive taxable years following a corporate conversion. This includes either continuing historic lines of business or using a significant portion of historic business assets in an active trade. The corporate conversion recapture tax is a recomputation of the tax under this subtitle for the partnership and partners as if the partnership were an S corporation, with its stock owned in the same manner as the partnership's capital, and the S corporation dissolved with its assets distributed. The corporate conversion recapture tax involves the dissolution of an S corporation partnership and distribution of assets to shareholders. The tax is calculated based on a fraction that considers the number of years the partnership maintained continuity of the business. Basis rules apply to property in the partnership's hands during an eligible corporate conversion. The special tax treatment for an eligible corporate conversion involves the partnership's property having the same basis as in the hands of the qualified electing S corporation before the conversion. To elect this treatment, the S corporation must file a written election with its information return for the taxable year of the conversion. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for this part. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
