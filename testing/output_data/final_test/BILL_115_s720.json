The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has systematically targeted Israel with politically motivated assaults on its legitimacy, including calls for a commercial boycott and the establishment of a blacklist of companies operating beyond Israel's 1949 Armistice lines.

Businesses operating in these areas could face legal action. Congress has a history of combating anti-Israel boycotts under various acts and agreements.
