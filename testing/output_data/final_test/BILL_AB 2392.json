    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44559.11 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to ensure efficient use of capital access programs by the state. The authority may establish alternate provisions to participate in alternative funding sources when contributions are funded by a public entity other than the authority. The Legislature intends to create a program to assist residential property owners and small business owners in seismically retrofitting their properties, without supporting the physical expansion of small businesses and residences. The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program is established by the Legislature to cover losses on qualified loans for seismic retrofit construction. The program is administered by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority and includes specific requirements for eligible projects. The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program covers costs for seismic retrofit construction, including anchoring structures, bracing walls and heaters, installing gas shutoff valves, and reinforcing foundations. Eligible costs exclude maintenance and violations unrelated to the retrofit construction. The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program covers costs for seismic retrofit construction, including repair of earthquake damage, seismic retrofit construction required by local building codes, other work required by local codes, rent reductions, replacement of building components, bracing nonpermanent contents, and cost offsets. The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program defines \"eligible project\" as seismic retrofit construction necessary for mitigating seismic damage, \"qualified building\" as one certified as hazardous and in danger of collapse, and \"qualified loan\" as a loan limited to eligible project costs up to $250,000. A \"qualified small business\" is defined as a business that owns and occupies, or plans to occupy, a qualified building for its operations. A \"qualified residential property owner\" is either an owner and occupant of a residential building that is a qualified building or a qualified small business that owns one or more residential buildings that are qualified buildings. The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program Fund is established and administered by the authority for small businesses and qualified residential property owners. All funds in the program are continuously appropriated for program expenses. Program expenditures include contributions for qualified loans, costs for validation by an expert, and expenses for educating the small business community. Administrative expenditures are limited to 5% of the initial appropriation and include personnel costs, service contracts, and other administrative costs. The authority can direct the Treasurer to invest excess funds in eligible securities or interest-bearing accounts in state financial institutions. Alternatively, funds can be transferred to the Surplus Money Investment Fund for investment. Interest earned from investments will be deposited back into the fund. Investment of excess funds can be directed by the authority under specific provisions, excluding the Surplus Money Investment Fund. The authority will implement a program with regulations to establish a new loss reserve account for each lender, require certification for loan usage, provide incentives for loans in severely affected communities, restrict enrollment in other loan programs, and limit loss coverage term to 10 years. (5) Limit loss coverage term for each qualified loan to a maximum of 10 years. (6) Recapture authority's contribution for each enrolled loan after 10 years or loan maturation, deposit in fund for future program expenses. The authority can enact emergency regulations for residential property owner or small business financing under Chapter 3.5 of the Government Code, deemed necessary for public safety. These regulations will expire after 180 days unless compliance is met."
