The Indian Dams Safety Act of 1994 identifies 53 dams on Indian lands that pose a threat to human life due to structural deficiencies and lack of maintenance. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining safe dams for various purposes such as irrigation, flood control, and wildlife habitats. The Indian Dams Safety Act of 1994 highlights the need for regular dam maintenance and repair to ensure safety for human life, irrigation, flood control, and wildlife habitats. The Act defines key terms such as \"Bureau,\" \"dam,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Indian tribe.\" It also establishes a Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program. The Secretary will establish a dam safety maintenance and repair program within the Bureau to ensure the long-term maintenance of identified dams. All functions and personnel from the previous Dam Safety Program are transferred to this new program. Any references to the old program now apply to the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program. The Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program, established by the Secretary, aims to rehabilitate dams on Indian lands to ensure their satisfactory condition. A maintenance action plan will be developed for high or significant risk hazard rated dams. The Secretary will create a comprehensive list of dams on Indian lands with safety condition classifications. The Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program, established by the Secretary, aims to rehabilitate dams on Indian lands to ensure their satisfactory condition. The program includes the classification of dam safety conditions and risk hazard classifications for each dam, as well as addressing maintenance deficiencies. The dam safety condition classifications range from Satisfactory to Conditionally poor based on potential deficiencies under various loading conditions. The risk hazard classification system for dams includes categories such as High and Significant, based on the potential risks to lives and property in case of failure. Poor and Unsatisfactory conditions require immediate action to resolve deficiencies under normal loading conditions. The risk hazard classification system for dams includes categories like High and Significant, indicating the potential risks to lives and property in case of failure. The Act authorizes dam safety maintenance and repair, with the possibility of additional conservation storage capacity. Technical assistance can be obtained nonreimbursable to fulfill the Act's purposes. The Secretary can receive nonreimbursable technical assistance from other departments and agencies for the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program. The Bureau will oversee this program. The Secretary is authorized to contract with Indian tribes to implement the program. An annual report on the Act's implementation must be submitted, including a list of dams, their maintenance status, projected costs, and schedule. The annual report on the Dam Safety Maintenance and Repair Program must include the projected total cost and schedule of rehabilitation for each dam. It is to be submitted alongside the budget to the Subcommittee on Native American Affairs and the Committee on Indian Affairs. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the implementation of this Act, with funds being nonreimbursable."
