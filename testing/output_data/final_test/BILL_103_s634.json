The Act defines key terms such as community-based organizations, developmentally appropriate, home-based, and limited or unsuccessful formal schooling. The term \"limited or unsuccessful formal schooling\" refers to low achievement in high school or lack of a general education degree. \"Local educational agencies\" are defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \"Near poor families\" are those with an income around 130 percent of the poverty line. Parent education includes support activities, resource materials on child development, educational guidance, and learning experiences for parents and children to improve learning at home. Working poor families are defined as those with family members who are working or actively seeking employment. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary can award grants to local agencies and organizations for home-based parent and early childhood education programs. Grants are divided equally between new programs and existing ones.
