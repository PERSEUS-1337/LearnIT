FPI operates independently within prisons to manage, train, and rehabilitate inmates. Federal agencies are required to procure FPI products unless authorized to seek bids elsewhere, known as the \"mandatory source clause.\" The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) operates within federal prisons, employing inmates to manufacture products primarily for government agencies. Federal agencies are mandated to procure FPI products unless granted waivers due to pricing. The FPI's operations, statutory authority, history, sales, earnings, and inmate workforce trends are outlined in this report, with controversies surrounding its mandatory source clause. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) originated from an act passed in 1930 by the 71st Congress (P.L. 71-271), expanding inmate labor to all federal prisons. The act required work opportunities for physically fit inmates for rehabilitation, with goods produced helping offset incarceration costs. It aimed to diversify industries in federal prisons to minimize competition with private businesses and allowed inmate labor for federal public works projects. The 1930 act expanded inmate labor to all federal prisons, allowing inmates to work on federal public works projects and produce goods for federal prisons or other agencies. Inmate-made goods were prohibited from being sold on the open market, and federal agencies were required to purchase inmate-made products if they met certain criteria. The act aimed to reduce inmate idleness, provide rehabilitation, and equip inmates with skills for reintegration into society after release. The BOP faced challenges in expanding prison industries to provide work for inmates, as existing industries resisted diversification. The House Judiciary Committee highlighted the need for the BOP to enter new industries to create employment opportunities for all physically fit inmates. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was established in 1934 under P.L. 73-461 to address these issues. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed P.L. 73-461, granting him the authority to establish the Federal Prison Industries. Executive Order 6917 was signed to implement the provisions of P.L. 73-461. The FPI was governed by a board of directors representing various sectors and the Attorney General. The board determined industrial operations in federal prisons and aimed to prevent unfair competition by diversifying industries. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt through P.L. 73-461, with the board of directors overseeing operations in federal prisons to prevent unfair competition. The FPI's authorizing legislation, P.L. 80-772, required the FPI to provide employment for physically fit inmates, diversify its industries, and sell goods only to the federal government. Inmates working for the FPI were to gain skills for future employment upon release. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was established to provide employment for inmates and prevent unfair competition. Federal agencies were required to purchase goods from the FPI if they met certain criteria. The FPI's industrial production grew significantly during wartime, with sales increasing from $7 million in 1941 to nearly $19 million in 1943. Capital investments in the 1950s focused on building new factories, renovating existing ones, and expanding vocational training. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) expanded its production in the 1950s by opening new factories for repairing furniture, office equipment, and other government property. Sales spiked during the Vietnam War but declined in the late 1960s due to reduced purchases from civilian federal agencies. In 1974, FPI reorganized into seven divisions to manage resource, production, and sales. Regional market positions were established, and a program to improve product quality was implemented since the mid-1970s. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) focused on increasing sales through marketing and customer service. In response to the growing federal prison population, FPI expanded its factories to employ more inmates and implemented new production techniques to create work opportunities and prepare inmates for post-release. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) implemented new production techniques to better prepare inmates for post-release employment. Inmates are now required to have a high school diploma or GED to advance beyond entry-level pay status. The FPI operates 80 factories and three farms in 62 federal prisons across six business segments. It is economically self-sustaining and uses revenue to purchase materials, pay wages, and invest in facility expansion. 72% of revenue from FPI's products and services is reinvested. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) uses 72% of its revenues to purchase raw materials and equipment, 23% for staff salaries, and 5% for inmate salaries. Inmates can earn between $0.23 to $1.15 per hour based on various factors and can receive bonuses for good performance. The FPI's sales increased from $404.9 million to $885.3 million between FY1993 and FY2009, with profits generated in most fiscal years except for FY1998 and FY2000. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) reported losses in FY1998 and FY2000, with declining sales in the past four fiscal years. Sales in FY2014 were the lowest since FY1994, but increased to $471.9 million in FY2015. Despite the sales increase, FPI operated at a loss for the seventh consecutive year. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) has been operating at a loss for several fiscal years but is able to draw funds from a revolving account to make up for it. Inmates who are not employed by FPI have other labor assignments in the prison, but FPI work assignments are more desirable due to higher wages and trade learning opportunities. Regular and FPI work assignments both provide inmates with valuable skills. The availability of Federal Prison Industries (FPI) work assignments is more volatile compared to regular prison work assignments. Data shows a decrease in the number of inmates working for FPI since FY2007, despite an overall increase in the number of inmates employed by FPI between FY1970 and FY2001. The number of inmates working for the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) has decreased significantly since FY2007, with approximately 12,300 inmates employed in FY2015 compared to 23,200 in FY2007. This decline in inmate employment has led to the closure of some FPI factories. The debate over the FPI revolves around its dual role as either a business seeking federal contracts or a rehabilitative program for prisoners, with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) viewing it primarily as a correctional program focused on providing meaningful work opportunities for federal offenders. Former BOP Director Harley Lappin emphasized that the FPI's purpose is not revenue generation but rather rehabilitation. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program aims to provide work opportunities for Federal offenders, focusing on job skills training and work experience to help inmates reintegrate into society. Critics argue that the FPI competes with businesses for federal contracts, producing goods and services sold to the government with advantages over the private sector. They also claim that inmate labor displacing private sector workers could impact government revenues. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program has drawn controversy over its mandatory source clause, requiring federal agencies to purchase products from the FPI. Critics argue that this competition with private sector workers could impact government revenues and limit job opportunities for inmates post-release. Congress has made changes to the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program's mandatory source clause in response to concerns about monopolizing the federal procurement market. Critics argue that the clause creates a monopoly-like environment and limits job opportunities for law-abiding citizens. The FPI's mandatory source clause has been criticized for creating a monopoly-like environment in federal procurement. Critics argue that the clause should be eliminated to allow private businesses to compete equally. However, proponents state that changes have been made to allow federal agencies to purchase from private vendors, and many FPI products are offered as non-mandatory items. Former Director Lappin clarifies that the clause does not prohibit Federal customers from buying from private vendors. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program's products are offered as \"non-mandatory\" items, subject to competitive procurement procedures. Recent legislation and FPI Board resolutions have reduced the impact of mandatory source requirements. Critics argue that FPI has a competitive advantage due to lower labor costs, with inmate workers earning below minimum wage. FPI also benefits from tax exemptions and BOP-covered healthcare costs for federal inmates. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program covers healthcare costs for inmates and pays for factory space and utilities. Despite lower inmate wages, the FPI faces competitive disadvantages like lower productivity and operational inefficiencies. Statutory constraints drive up costs, requiring the FPI to employ inmates, focus on labor-intensive products, provide skills training, diversify production, and minimize competition with private industry. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program aims to minimize competition with private industry, reduce burden on any one industry, and sell products only to the federal government. However, the FPI faces challenges such as lower productivity of inmate workers, additional training costs, and expenses for supervision and security. Despite these drawbacks, the FPI argues that its operations benefit private businesses. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program uses revenue from sales to purchase materials from private vendors. In FY2015, 72% of revenue was spent on private sector purchases. Research shows FPI participation reduces recidivism rates and increases employment opportunities for inmates. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program reduces recidivism rates by providing inmates with work assignments that keep them occupied and teach them valuable skills. Proponents argue that FPI is crucial for managing the growing federal prison population and promoting good behavior among inmates. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) program provides inmates with \"soft skills\" and work assignments to reduce recidivism rates. Studies show that vocational education programs are more effective in reducing re-incarceration than FPI. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) argues that vocational and apprenticeship programs complement, rather than substitute, FPI work assignments. The BOP argues that vocational training programs are a complement to FPI work assignments, providing inmates with job skills training and work experience. Vocational education programs run part-time for a limited time and are funded through appropriations. Future deliberations on FPI activities will focus on balancing work opportunities for inmates while minimizing impact on the private sector. The FPI has a work-sharing initiative where two inmates share a full-time position to expand employment opportunities with minimal effect on private sector workers. The FPI has a work-sharing initiative where two inmates share a full-time position to increase inmate workers while minimizing impact on factory efficiency and costs. This initiative aims to expand employment opportunities without the need to enter new markets. The duration of exposure to the program and its effect on recidivism outcomes is not clearly addressed in the literature. Working part-time may have a minimal effect on reducing recidivism if inmates spend enough time in the program to internalize skills. The FPI work-sharing program aims to increase inmate workers by having two inmates share a full-time position. The program's effectiveness in reducing recidivism depends on inmates internalizing skills and discipline. Congress granted the FPI authority to participate in the PIECP to provide meaningful work opportunities for inmates. Congress acknowledged the importance of inmates having access to meaningful work opportunities and recognized the potential benefits of allowing the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) to partner with private businesses. The Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) permits private businesses to use inmate labor under certain conditions, with safeguards in place to prevent unfair competition and ensure inmates are paid prevailing wages. The DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) notes challenges with expanding inmate work assignments through repatriation and the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP). FPI officials see PIECP as less viable due to higher inmate wages, limiting new business development. FPI's assessment suggests regional or nationwide programs are unlikely due to market rate wage variability. One downside of the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) is that its prevailing wage requirement can make inmate labor less attractive to private companies. This, combined with additional costs of operating in a prison environment, can erode profit margins for businesses. Policymakers may need to explore other alternatives to increase work opportunities for inmates beyond current options. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate the FPI's mandatory source clause, allowing them to compete for federal contracts. The proposal also includes funding for vocational education programs and authorizes appropriations to pay inmate wages for work with nonprofit organizations. This would address tensions around the FPI's mandatory source clause while acknowledging its importance in providing work opportunities for inmates. The FPI's mandatory source clause is crucial for providing work opportunities for inmates. If Congress requires the FPI to compete for all federal contracts, policymakers may need to amend the FPI's authorizing legislation to improve its efficiency. The current law mandates the FPI to employ as many inmates as possible and diversify its product line to minimize impact on the private sector. The BOP argues that the mandatory source clause is necessary due to these requirements, which private sector businesses do not have to follow. Businesses can adjust their workforce and product offerings based on demand, unlike the FPI. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) argues that even without certain requirements, it would still face competitive disadvantages like a lower-skilled workforce and high turnover. However, it would still have advantages such as paying inmates lower wages and having some labor costs covered by the Bureau of Prisons. There is concern that lifting restrictions on FPI could lead to market control, but specializing in a few products could improve efficiency. Inmates can learn to operate products/services efficiently, leading to increased sales and work opportunities. However, this may impact jobs for non-incarcerated individuals. Vocational education programs can reduce inmate labor's impact on the private market and lower recidivism rates. Congress may allow inmate labor for nonprofit services, funded separately from Federal Prison Industries. Inmates could provide products and services for nonprofit and religious organizations, potentially decreasing competition with private businesses. Work opportunities for inmates would need to be subsidized through direct appropriations. There may be limited demand in this market, as some organizations do not want to be associated with inmate labor. Repealing federal laws prohibiting the sale of prisoner-made goods could create more work opportunities for inmates. The Federal Prison Industries and PIECP-certified business ventures employ only a small proportion of prisoners. The Federal Prison Industries and PIECP-certified business ventures employ a small proportion of prisoners. To increase work opportunities for inmates, policymakers could consider removing minimum wage requirements and allowing the market to determine wages. Inmates are generally lower skilled and less productive, making inmate labor less attractive with prevailing wage requirements. In order to increase work opportunities for inmates, policymakers could consider offering a subsidy to make inmate labor attractive to private businesses. Despite concerns about the impact on private workers, research suggests that the economic impact of inmate labor is likely to be minor due to their low productivity levels. If every federal inmate worked full-time, their output would only equal approximately 0.04% of the United States' 2015 gross domestic product. Increased inmate workforce participation may have minimal impact on wages and unemployment for low-skilled workers. However, certain groups may be disproportionately affected by changes in restrictions on inmate labor, similar to increased competition from foreign low-skilled laborers. The potential expansion of inmate labor could result in job losses for workers in industries that move to prisons, leading to severe impacts in concentrated sectors. Any economic benefits from increased inmate labor are likely to be small, such as lower prices for consumers or a larger workforce willing to work for lower wages. Increased inmate labor force participation could have economic costs that exceed benefits, but policymakers should consider potential social benefits like reduced recidivism and prison costs. Inmates earning wages could support dependents, offset incarceration costs, or save money. Inmates earning wages could support dependents, offset incarceration costs, or save money. However, concerns arise about potential abuses and corruption associated with businesses using inmate labor. The inmate lease system in the past allowed for exploitation of inmates as \"slaves of the state\" with little oversight. Developments in the 20th century have reduced these abuses, but concerns remain about possible exploitation if Congress expands the use of inmate labor in private markets. Suggestions include allowing inmates to unionize for protection and ensuring they have the choice not to work to prevent exploitation. The Federal Prison Industries (FPI) was established in 1934 to prevent exploitation of inmate labor by private businesses. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 required the FPI to meet specific requirements to ease its impact on the private sector. Congress has modified legislation to address concerns about the FPI's mandatory source clause affecting private businesses competing for federal contracts. The Crime Control Act of 1990 required federal departments to report acquisitions from Federal Prison Industries to the General Services Administration for entry into the Federal Procurement Data System. The Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-564) and the General Accounting Office Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-316) modified reporting requirements for federal departments, agencies, and institutions regarding acquisitions from Federal Prison Industries. Disputes regarding FPI products are now arbitrated by the Attorney General, the Administrator of General Services, and the President or their representatives. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 required the Secretary of Defense to use competitive procedures for procurement if FPI's product was not comparable in price, quality, and delivery time to private sector products. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for FY2003 amended 10 U.S.C. \u00a72410n. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 amended 10 U.S.C. \u00a72410n to require competitive procurement if FPI's product is not comparable to private sector products. Market research determinations are final and not subject to review. The act prohibits requiring contractors to use FPI as a subcontractor or supplier, and restricts access to sensitive information for inmate workers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-199) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 (P.L. 108-447) modified the FPI's mandatory source clause, prohibiting federal agencies from using appropriated funds to purchase products or services from the FPI unless they provide the best value according to government-wide procurement regulations. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2004 and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 require government agencies to determine if products or services from the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) provide the best value before making purchases. The Secretary of Defense must conduct market research to assess FPI's market share before procuring products from them. If FPI has a significant market share, competitive procedures or multiple award contracts must be used for procurement. The DOD must determine if products from the Federal Prison Industries meet its needs in terms of price, quality, and delivery time. If not, competitive procedures must be used for procurement. Congress expressed concern in the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2011 about inmates' lack of meaningful work opportunities. Congress acknowledged the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) as a means of preparing inmates for reentry and allowing partnerships with private businesses to bring manufacturing back to the US. The Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) was amended to allow FPI participation in manufacturing goods for the commercial market."
