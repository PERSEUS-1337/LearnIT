    "content": "Some states have enacted \"Amazon laws\" to collect use taxes from Internet sales, potentially raising constitutional issues under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the dormant Commerce Clause. These clauses require a nexus between the state and remote seller before imposing tax obligations, with due process focusing on fairness and the Commerce Clause on preventing undue burden on interstate commerce. Congress has the authority to authorize state action that complies with the Constitution, including imposing tax obligations on out-of-state sellers. A sufficient nexus is required between the state and the seller for tax liability, as mandated by the Due Process Clause and the dormant Commerce Clause. Due process necessitates a benefit to the state and fair warning to the seller, while the dormant Commerce Clause aims to prevent undue burden on interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause requires a nexus to avoid burdening interstate commerce. In Quill v. North Dakota, the Supreme Court established that physical presence is needed for sales tax collection under the dormant Commerce Clause. Due process requires purposeful contact with the state's residents. The Court evolved its jurisprudence on physical presence for due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court found physical presence necessary for due process, but evolved to allow sufficient action directed towards the state's residents. Congress has the authority to change the \"physical presence\" standard if consistent with the Constitution. Legislation has been introduced in Congress regarding taxation of internet sales. The Supreme Court has not revisited the issue of when states may impose use tax obligations on remote sellers since Quill. Pre-Quill cases provide guidance on when a state can impose tax collection responsibilities on out-of-state retailers, such as those with a physical presence like a retail store or offices in the state. For example, a state could require a company to collect use taxes on mail order sales to in-state customers if the company maintained offices in the state that generated significant revenue, even if unrelated to the sales giving rise to the tax liability. The Court rejected the argument that a nexus was needed between the company and the state for tax collection. It found a sufficient connection between the state and company through in-state offices enjoying municipal services. In cases before Quill, the Court upheld states imposing tax collection liabilities on remote sellers with in-state salespeople or agents. The Court upheld a state's ability to impose use tax collection duties on an out-of-state company with independent contractors soliciting business locally, despite their status as non-employees. This case represented the furthest reach of a state's authority to require tax collection from a remote seller. The Commerce Clause prohibits state laws that discriminate against interstate commerce. A state law that discriminates against out-of-state sellers is invalid unless it serves a legitimate local purpose that cannot be achieved by non-discriminatory means. Laws imposing tax burdens on remote sellers not imposed on in-state sellers are likely to be considered discriminatory and face judicial scrutiny. Some states have enacted laws to collect uncollected use taxes from online sales, using approaches like \"click-through nexus\" and notification requirements. New York's click-through nexus statute and Colorado's notification law are examples. These laws are scrutinized for potential violations of the U.S. Constitution. \"Click-through nexus statutes require online retailers to collect use taxes based on the physical presence of their associates or affiliates in a taxing state. New York's 2008 law defines vendors as entities that solicit business through representatives, requiring them to collect sales and use taxes.\" Colorado's law, enacted in 2010, requires remote retailers to provide information to the state and customers instead of collecting use taxes themselves. The law imposes three duties on retailers, including rebutting the presumption of nexus if a resident refers potential customers for a commission. The state tax agency's guidance clarifies that placing an advertisement does not trigger the presumption. Colorado's law, enacted in 2010, imposes duties on retailers not collecting Colorado sales tax. Retailers must inform customers of tax obligations, send year-end purchase notices, and provide annual statements to the revenue department. Penalties apply for failures to notify customers or fulfill duties. State \"Amazon laws\" may raise concerns under the dormant Commerce Clause. State \"Amazon laws\" like those in New York and Colorado have faced challenges under the dormant Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Colorado's notification law is seen as more constitutionally problematic. New York's click-through nexus law targets Internet retailers with affiliate programs that create physical presence in the state. This approach is similar to the one upheld in Scripto, where the state required use tax collection by a remote seller with local independent contractors forwarding orders to the company's out-of-state headquarters. The Court's decision in Scripto emphasized the importance of continuous local solicitation by affiliates in the state, rather than their title or authority over sales. New York's law targeting affiliates with sufficient solicitation activities may align with Scripto, but the comparison to online linking raises questions about the similarity of activities. The Scripto case highlighted the distinction between ongoing sales activities and one-time website links. The constitutionality of click-through nexus laws, requiring remote sellers to monitor affiliates, remains a question. In 2012, New York's highest court upheld such a law against challenges by Amazon and Overstock.com, which were later declined by the U.S. Supreme Court. The New York court upheld a law requiring remote sellers to collect taxes, stating that a physical presence did not have to be substantial, but rather demonstrably more than a slightest presence. The law was deemed constitutional based on active, in-state solicitation that generated significant revenue. Sellers collect taxes that are difficult to collect from individual purchasers. The court upheld a law requiring remote sellers to collect taxes based on active, in-state solicitation that generated significant revenue. The law deemed constitutional as it was difficult to collect taxes from individual purchasers and did not risk multiple taxation. The court found that a brigade of affiliated websites compensated by commission met the standard of continuous and widespread solicitation of business within a State. The court also rejected the argument that the law violated due process, stating that the presumption of retailers collecting use tax through online referral agreements was reasonable and rebuttable. The Colorado notification requirements raise constitutional concerns as they target companies without physical presence in the state. The law applies to retailers doing business in the state, but it may still violate due process for some retailers. The Colorado statute raises Commerce Clause issues as it applies to companies without physical presence in the state, potentially violating due process for some retailers. The notification requirements may be as burdensome as tax collection obligations, both requiring similar recordkeeping. The Colorado law imposes burdensome notification duties on out-of-state businesses without physical presence, potentially violating the Commerce Clause. It may be considered facially discriminatory and subject to strict scrutiny for not advancing a legitimate local purpose. In 2012, a federal district court struck down Colorado's law imposing notification requirements on out-of-state vendors. The court found the law discriminatory and failing to meet the physical presence standard, suggesting alternative methods for tax collection. In August 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a case challenging Colorado's notification requirements for out-of-state vendors, citing the Tax Injunction Act. However, in March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the TIA does not apply to the suit, stating that the requirements did not constitute tax assessment, levy, or collection. The Supreme Court ruled that the Tax Injunction Act did not apply to a case challenging Colorado's notification requirements for out-of-state vendors. Justice Kennedy raised the possibility of reconsidering the Quill decision due to technological advances and the development of the Internet. Justice Kennedy suggested reconsidering the Quill decision only if a strong argument can be made for its continued validity."
