President Uribe continued the plan with a focus on security. The United States has been the main contributor to Plan Colombia through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative and other programs. The United States has provided significant financial support to Colombia through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and other programs, totaling $4.5 billion including FMF and DOD assistance. Additional funding was requested for Plan Colombia beyond FY2005, with $463 million in ACI funds and $90 million in FMF for FY2006. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act provided $469.5 million in assistance to Colombia for eradication of coca and opium poppy crops, narcotic trafficking interdiction, and infrastructure protection through training and material support for security forces. The United States has provided significant financial support to Colombia through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and other programs, totaling $4.5 billion. U.S. programs support alternative crop development, infrastructure, and institution building to give farmers alternative sources of income. Congress has been assessing the progress of Plan Colombia, which expired in 2005, and continues to provide funding with no statutory end-date. The House expressed concern over increased funding levels for Colombia in FY2005 despite the plan's conclusion, expecting a decrease in FY2006, but funding essentially remained the same at $463 million. The FY2006 request for Colombia maintained funding at $463 million, with a focus on alternative development and interdiction. The House directed the Secretary of State to report on a multiyear strategy and suggested a more balanced ratio between alternative development and interdiction. The FY2006 appropriation increased funding for alternative development to $131.2 million. Members also discussed the need for an exit strategy for Colombia to take over operations. The House appropriation bill expressed concern about Colombia's ability to take over operational and maintenance functions of Plan Colombia, as the US and Colombia have differing primary objectives for the plan. The US aims to prevent drug flow and promote peace, while Colombia focuses on peace, economic development, and security, with drug trafficking being a key aspect. President Uribe's election marked an evolution in the objectives of each country. President Uribe's election marked an evolution in Colombia's approach to armed groups involved in drug trafficking. He implemented tougher measures, refused to negotiate until cease-fire and disarmament, increased security forces' powers, and initiated Plan Patriota to recapture guerrilla-controlled territory. US policy also shifted to support Colombia's fight against armed groups, expanding authority to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign. The three main armed organizations in Colombia - FARC, ELN, and AUC - are designated as foreign terrorist organizations. In 2003, FARC and AUC were also designated as Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers. Prices for cocaine and heroin in the United States have increased in 2005, while purity and availability have decreased. In 2005, the supply of drugs from Colombia to the United States showed a favorable effect from Plan Colombia, with prices for cocaine increasing by 19% and purity decreasing by 15%. Colombia produces most of the world's cocaine supply, with 90% entering the US from Colombia. Additionally, the availability of South American heroin also decreased, with prices increasing by 30%. The availability of South American heroin has decreased, leading to a 30% price increase and a 22% purity decrease. Despite rising heroin prices, drug use among young people has declined by 11% from 2001 to 2003 and by 6% from 2003 to 2004. However, cocaine and heroin use has remained stable, with 2.3 million cocaine users and 119,000 heroin users reported between 2002 and 2003. Some critics question the reliability of self-reported surveys on drug use. The ONDCP figures on price, purity, and availability are cautioned against due to short-term fluctuations. Interdiction efforts take time to impact prices and supply, with an expected increase in the next 12 months. Despite potential decreases in coca leaf and opium poppies availability, traffickers can absorb increased costs due to large profit margins. The DEA reported an increase in domestic seizures of heroin and cocaine from 1999 to 2003. Maritime seizures of cocaine also increased in the South Atlantic and Caribbean regions. Operation Panama Express targeted Colombian cocaine trafficking, resulting in significant seizures since 2000. In Colombia, there was a 30% increase in cocaine seizures and a 43.9% increase in heroin seizures in 2004. The State Department's International Narcotics Strategy Report 2005 credited the Air Bridge Denial program with significant seizures of cocaine in 2004. The U.S.-funded Special Reconnaissance and Assault Unit of the Colombian Navy seized a large amount of drugs and assets, while the Colombian Police Anti-Narcotics Directorate destroyed labs and seized a substantial amount of cocaine and precursors. The State Department and United Nations report decreases in drug crop acreage since 2001. Plan Colombia includes manual and aerial eradication of coca and poppy crops. Colombia reduced coca cultivation by 47% since 2000, with 212,506 acres under cultivation in 2003. ONDCP reported spraying 337,000 acres of coca in 2004. ONDCP reports stable coca cultivation in 2004, with 282,000 acres of existing crops. Cocaine production decreased to 430 metric tons due to less productive newly-planted crops. Opium poppy cultivation decreased by 52% between 2003 and 2004. ACI funding supports alternative development programs to encourage growers to switch to licit crops, benefiting 12,845 families in 2004 and a total of 44,015 families since 2001. The USAID program supported the development of 136,000 acres of licit crops since 2001. In 2004, 244 infrastructure projects were completed, totaling 874 since 2001. The eradication program, including aerial fumigation of crops, has faced criticism for environmental and health effects, with calls for more resources to be devoted to development programs as a sustainable method to reduce drug crop cultivation in the long run. Some observers argue that counternarcotics efforts focusing on coca cultivation cause issues for growers who depend on illicit crops for their livelihoods. They mention concerns about spray drift destroying legal crops and growers being denied compensation. Additionally, there are claims that eradicating crops in one area leads to their relocation to other areas, with examples of coca production increases in Bolivia and decreases in Peru. This challenges predictions of increased coca cultivation in Peru in 2004 and potential further increases in 2005. Some observers believe that reporting the acreage of crops sprayed may not accurately reflect cultivation due to technology limitations. Fumigation causes defoliation but does not always kill the plant, and spraying may not prevent replanting of illicit crops. Discrepancies exist between U.S. and UN surveys on coca cultivation acreage, with indications of growers using smaller plots interspersed with legitimate crops to evade detection. The UNODC reported a decrease in the size of single plots, with most being 7.4 acres or less. Most observers agree that public safety conditions in Colombia have improved, with police redeployed to areas previously controlled by armed groups. A greater security presence has significantly benefited Colombians. The Colombian National Police has increased its presence in rural areas, major roadways, and petroleum pipelines to improve security. Despite a decrease in kidnappings, Colombia still has the highest kidnapping rate globally. The government aims to end the armed conflict involving various armed groups profiting from the drug trade. The leftist guerrilla groups FARC and ELN, along with rightist paramilitary groups like AUC, are involved in the drug trade in Colombia. AUC has agreed to demobilize by the end of 2005, with legislation for conditional sentencing and reintegration into society approved. The Peace and Justice Law, controversial in Colombia and the US, aims to end paramilitary activities. About half of AUC members have demobilized. Negotiations with the FARC have not taken place under the Uribe Administration, as the FARC controls vast territory in the country. There is conflicting evidence of FARC resources, with estimates of their annual income ranging from $77.16 million to $342 million, mostly from the drug trade. The Colombian military's Plan Patriota began operations in mid-2003 to recapture FARC-held territory. The Colombian military's Plan Patriota, launched in mid-2003, aimed to recapture FARC-held territory. Operations were successful in securing Bogot\u00e1 and reducing kidnappings. Military efforts in 2004 focused on regaining FARC territory in southern and eastern regions, forcing FARC to change tactics. Despite a decrease in FARC ranks, renewed attacks in 2005 showed their offensive capability. The campaign reclaimed 11 FARC-run villages and destroyed over 400 structures. The Colombian military's Plan Patriota successfully recaptured FARC-held territory, destroying camps, capturing explosives and combatants, and seizing weapons. They also targeted FARC drug trafficking activities, locating and destroying supplies and cocaine. The ELN, a smaller rebel group, engaged in talks with the government but faced setbacks in negotiations. The ELN agreed to begin discussions with the government in 2005, with meetings in Cuba and plans for more talks in January. Critics of Plan Patriota argue that complete defeat of the FARC may be impossible due to rugged terrain. There are conflicting reports on the number of internally displaced persons (IDP) in Colombia, with government and human rights groups providing different figures. Southern Command is supporting the development of civil affairs capability in the Colombian military to mitigate negative impacts of military operations. Critics of U.S. policy argue that assistance to the Colombian military may increase its autonomy from civilian authority and shift its focus from external threats to internal enemies like drug traffickers. They believe that expanding the role of foreign militaries in this way goes against U.S. laws and democratic principles. The economy of Colombia has seen an increase in confidence due to improved security, with GDP growth at 3.5% in 2004. The country is classified as a middle-income nation with a per capita GDP of $7,040 in 2003. The drug trade contributes around 2.0% to 2.5% of Colombia's annual GDP, and the country had the best performing stock market in the world in 2004. Colombian exports, aided by trade agreements, play a significant role in the economy. Colombia is negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States. Oil exports account for a significant portion of its revenue, but production has decreased due to armed conflict. The FARC and ELN have targeted energy infrastructure, including the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n Cove\u00f1as oil pipeline. Attacks on the pipeline have decreased since 2001. The armed conflict in Colombia has hindered aggressive exploration of new oil reserves, leading to a decrease in attacks on oil pipelines since 2001. Colombian officials warn of becoming a net oil importer if no significant new fields are found. Progress has been made in promoting democracy and human rights, but challenges remain, with thousands of civilian deaths in 2004 due to the conflict. The State Department report highlighted issues within Colombia's security forces, including human rights violations and cooperation with paramilitary groups. Labor union leaders were targeted by armed groups, impacting trade union activities. However, killings of union leaders decreased by 25% in 2004. USAID supports programs to modernize the criminal justice system, promote human rights, and increase transparency, including the establishment of \"justice houses\" and oral trial courtrooms. USAID helped establish 35 oral trial courtrooms in Colombia to transition the judicial system. Transparency International reported a 17% improvement in Colombia's ranking on corruption. Non-governmental organizations criticized the State Department for certifying progress on human rights in Colombia. Critics point to ongoing collusion between paramilitaries and Colombia's security forces, despite government efforts to sever ties and dismantle paramilitary networks. Concerns also arise over increased powers granted to security forces under anti-terrorism legislation, later ruled unconstitutional by the country's constitutional court. The U.S. policy in the region focuses on the destabilizing effects of drug trafficking, armed insurgencies in Colombia, and porous borders. Colombia shares borders with Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, and Panama. Venezuela's lack of control over its border with Colombia has allowed groups like FARC and ELN to operate, leading to tensions between Colombia and Venezuela. Tensions have escalated between Colombia and Ecuador due to accusations of incursions by Colombian troops chasing FARC units across the border. Ecuador is also affected by a flow of displaced Colombians fleeing the fighting in the south of Colombia. Despite progress made under Plan Colombia, U.S. and Colombian officials argue that more needs to be done, with Colombia developing a follow-up plan for continued international support. There has been measurable progress in Colombia's internal security, with decreases in violence. Recent price increases for heroin and cocaine in the United States suggest that supply is being affected in Colombia. Military operations against armed groups have intensified, but the main leftist guerrilla group remains unconquered. The demobilization of rightist paramilitary fighters is ongoing, but the Peace and Justice Law is criticized for leniency towards AUC members. Congress is concerned about ensuring the dismantling of armed groups, preventing members from returning to illegal activities, and holding violators accountable. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act recommended that the State Department not fund demobilization until it complies with U.S. anti-terrorism laws. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act provided $20 million for demobilization, conditioned on certification that assistance is only for individuals who have left terrorist organizations and are following Colombia's demobilization law. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act recommended withholding funding for demobilization until compliance with U.S. anti-terrorism laws. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act allocated $20 million for demobilization, contingent on certification that assistance is for ex-members of terrorist groups following Colombia's demobilization law. U.S. funds are designated for verification, reintegration, vetting, asset recovery for victim reparations, and investigations/prosecutions. Some lawmakers advocate for Colombian security forces to take over current U.S. functions, citing improved Colombian military capabilities under Plan Patriota. However, a 2003 Government Accountability Office report questioned Colombia's readiness for increased responsibilities. The Colombian government is spending more on security forces, but doubts remain about sustainability without fiscal reforms. Concerns were raised in the House about Colombia's ability to take on more responsibilities under Plan Colombia. Some argue for increased international support, especially as cocaine abuse rates rise in Europe. The European Union and its member states spent $120 million in Colombia in 2003. At an international donors conference in 2005, the Colombian government presented its demobilization plan, estimating a cost of $160 million. Donors supported the process but emphasized the need for a legal framework to ensure demobilized fighters are prosecuted for crimes before aid is committed."
