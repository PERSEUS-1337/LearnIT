    "content": "The \"Nuclear Power Plant Safety Act of 2011\" is the short title of this Act, which focuses on ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Power Plant Safety Act of 2011 amends the Atomic Energy Act to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to revise regulations for nuclear power plants to withstand and respond to various threats, including natural disasters and power source failures. The Nuclear Power Plant Safety Act of 2011 requires regulations for nuclear power plants to have resilient containment, safety, and diagnostic systems to withstand power source failures for at least 72 hours and have 14 days worth of emergency power system fuel onsite. The Nuclear Power Plant Safety Act of 2011 mandates that licensees must have secondary emergency power to operate the facility for 72 hours in case of power source failure. Licensees also need to have a plan approved by the Commission for obtaining additional fuel or batteries during a prolonged power outage. Additionally, licensees must amend any guidance to maintain core cooling capabilities during power loss scenarios. The Nuclear Power Plant Safety Act of 2011 requires licensees to have secondary emergency power for 72 hours in case of power failure. It also mandates moving spent nuclear fuel rods to certified dry cask storage within one year and configuring fuel rods in pools to minimize fire risk. Emergency response exercises must include scenarios based on simultaneous catastrophic events. The Nuclear Power Plant Safety Act of 2011 mandates secondary emergency power for 72 hours, moving spent fuel rods to dry cask storage, and minimizing fire risk. The Act also requires emergency response exercises to include scenarios of simultaneous catastrophic events. The Commission cannot approve any permits or licenses until regulations are revised under this section. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include loan guarantees for advanced nuclear energy facilities, with consideration given to the Tohoku earthquake of 2011 for risk assessment."
