    "content": "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigned specific duties to the Department of Homeland Security to protect critical infrastructure. The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate was tasked with integrating threat and vulnerability assessments to manage the risk of terrorist attacks. This report aims to support congressional oversight by discussing the systematic analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and risks in protecting the nation's critical infrastructure. The report discusses the systematic analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and risks in protecting critical infrastructure, including processes and techniques used for assessment. It also addresses the coordination of these activities among different agencies and the private sector. The National Strategy for Homeland Security emphasizes the importance of maintaining accurate assessments to guide resource allocation and policy decisions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 delegates specific tasks to the Directorate's Undersecretary, including identifying terrorist threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and conducting risk assessments to guide resource allocation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 delegates tasks to the Directorate's Undersecretary, including identifying terrorist threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and conducting risk assessments. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets aims to develop a comprehensive national plan for securing key resources and critical infrastructure in the United States. DHS will collaborate with stakeholders to establish protection priorities and build a database of critical facilities, systems, and functions. Homeland Security Presidential Directive Number 7 (HSPD-7) mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to recommend measures for protecting key resources and critical infrastructure. Security Presidential Directive Number 7 (HSPD-7) assigned the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate efforts to protect critical infrastructure and key resources. Sector Specific Agencies were tasked with conducting vulnerability assessments and promoting risk management strategies. The Directive required the Secretary to develop a National Plan for Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Protection, focusing on defining, prioritizing, and coordinating protection efforts. Key terms such as \"vulnerabilities,\" \"threats,\" \"risk,\" \"integrated,\" and \"prioritize\" were emphasized throughout. The terms \"vulnerabilities,\" \"threats,\" \"risk,\" \"integrated,\" and \"prioritize\" are frequently mentioned in documents and public discourse, but often without clear definitions or integration. Different definitions can impact policy and implementation. Various models exist for assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to allocate resources effectively for risk reduction. The report discusses various models and methods used in sectors like electric power, ports, and oil and gas for risk management. These models involve assessments to identify critical assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. The information is drawn from a book by Carl Roper and may offer guidance for overseeing DHS's methodology. The curr_chunk discusses identifying and prioritizing risk reduction activities for infrastructure assets in various sectors. It emphasizes the importance of assessing specific threats to determine risk and characterizing ways to reduce those risks based on a risk reduction strategy. The focus is on assets necessary for economic and social activities, public health, and welfare. The curr_chunk discusses the broad definition of assets in the U.S. Chemistry Industry, including people, property, and information. It also mentions the various assets defined by Roper's Risk Management and DOE's Energy Infrastructure Risk Management, such as people, activities, operations, facilities, equipment, and materials. The methodologies reviewed suggest different assets that should be considered, such as employees, customers, physical assets, and information like product designs and operational data. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of assessing critical assets, focusing on those judged to be most critical based on the consequences associated with their loss. Criticality is defined by the threat to survival or viability, with consequences categorized as economic or financial. The curr_chunk emphasizes the critical consequences of asset loss, including economic, financial, environmental, health and safety, technological, operational, and time-related impacts. Loss of assets can lead to disruptions in production, revenue loss, property damage, environmental harm, and loss of competitive advantage. Reputation damage is also a concern for firms. The loss of assets can have significant consequences, including economic, financial, environmental, health, safety, and operational impacts. Firms also need to consider the potential damage to their reputation. The time and resources required to replace lost assets are crucial factors to assess the overall impact. The loss of assets can have significant consequences, including economic, financial, environmental, health, safety, and operational impacts. Decision makers may also consider cascading effects on other infrastructures. Assets are categorized by criticality, typically assessed as high, medium, or low. Being specific about consequences qualifying assets for each category is recommended. The electric utility sector methodology categorizes assets based on criticality, considering factors like immediate board response, off-site fatalities, property damage, and operational interruptions. Ownership of infrastructure assets may span multiple firms or industries. Transmission assets may not be owned by the same firms producing the commodity being transmitted. The interdependency of production and transmission assets is crucial in infrastructure analysis. Analysts should also consider vulnerabilities in assets owned by others that are critical to the system. This includes inter-sector dependencies like water systems relying on electric power. Addressing these interdependencies is both technical and involves political/legal considerations. Threats are defined as any indication, circumstance, or event with the potential to cause loss or damage to an asset. They need to be characterized by type, intent, triggers, capability, methods, and trends to assess vulnerability and risk. Information from the intelligence community and law enforcement can help in characterizing threats. Threat assessment involves gathering information from various sources like the intelligence community, law enforcement, specialists, news reports, and past incidents to identify and characterize potential threats. This process also includes making assumptions and speculations due to limited information. The assessment estimates the likelihood of adversary activity based on the attractiveness of the target to the attacker and the attacker's capability to carry out an attack. The threat assessment process considers the likelihood of adversary activity based on the target's attractiveness and the attacker's capability. Factors include past attacks, asset vulnerability, and attack methods. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard evaluated 12 attack modes against 50 potential targets. The Coast Guard evaluated various scenarios involving potential targets such as vessels, container facilities, and utility pipelines. Each scenario was assessed for credibility and assigned a threat level based on probability of occurrence. Military vessels transporting terrorists was deemed not credible, but external attacks on military targets were considered credible. Threat levels were determined by considering hostile group intent, capabilities, prior incidents, and intelligence. The Electricity Sector's methodology involves identifying likely targets for different attack scenarios and assessing the likelihood of an attack quantitatively or qualitatively. Threat assessments can be dynamic and consider factors like hostile intent, capabilities, prior incidents, and intelligence. Threat assessments are not static and can change based on events, capabilities, or explicit threats. Vulnerability is defined as a weakness that can be exploited to access and potentially destroy or steal assets. Weaknesses can be categorized as physical, technical, or operational. A vulnerability assessment evaluates weaknesses that can be exploited, such as physical, technical, or operational vulnerabilities. Existing countermeasures should be assessed for reliability and effectiveness. Specific questions need to be asked to determine the effectiveness of security guards in deterring unauthorized access. Vulnerabilities are assessed against specific attacks in three steps according to API/NPRA. The Coast Guard uses a three-step process to assess vulnerabilities against specific attacks, including evaluating countermeasures and estimating vulnerability levels. They consider factors like target availability, accessibility, existing security measures, and potential threats. The Coast Guard assesses vulnerabilities by evaluating factors like target availability, accessibility, security measures, and potential threats. Vulnerability is measured on four vectors: target attractiveness, accessibility, existing security measures, and target hardness. Vulnerability can be quantitatively measured as a probability of successful attack or qualitatively assessed based on countermeasures against credible threats. Risk is defined as uncertain consequences. Risk is defined as the probability of loss or damage, determined by multiplying estimated adverse impact with probabilities associated with threat and vulnerability. It is a discounted measure of consequence. The Coast Guard categorized impact into six categories: death/injury, economic, environmental, national defense, symbolic effect, and secondary national security issues. Each scenario was measured on a severity scale from 1 to 5, based on benchmarks. The severity of death and injury varied depending on whether they occurred off-site. The severity of death and injury varied based on location and certainty. Environmental damage severity depended on scale. Financial losses were assessed quantitatively. Risk analysis determined probabilities of attack scenarios. Risk analysis determined that there is a 30% chance of a successful attack on the building, with potential consequences of 500 people killed and $300 million in property damage. The expected risk would be 56 deaths and $33.8 million in damages. Risk is often measured qualitatively as high, medium, or low based on various factors. Qualitative risk measures must integrate different criteria for assessing threats against vulnerable targets. Risks can be reduced by addressing threats, vulnerabilities, or consequences. Countermeasures should be evaluated for their effectiveness in risk reduction. Countermeasures for asset protection should be assessed together to determine their net effects and feasibility. Costs, including upfront financial costs, operational costs, and opportunity costs, must be considered. Once countermeasures are characterized by their impact on risk, decisions can be made on implementation. After assessing countermeasures for asset protection based on risk, feasibility, and cost, decision makers prioritize strategies. Cost-effective selection processes are recommended, ensuring that the benefits of risk reduction outweigh the implementation costs. Cost-effectiveness may involve investing in protections that maximize benefits within a fixed budget. Focusing on assets with the highest risks can lead to the most effective risk reduction. Decision makers may prioritize strategies based on risk, feasibility, and cost. While cost-effectiveness is usually recommended, decision makers may be risk averse and willing to bear additional protection costs. Protection costs should not exceed a reasonable percentage of the asset's total value. Another measure could be to maximize the number or distribution of assets with reduced risks or focus on specific threat scenarios. The ultimate goal of risk management is to achieve an \"acceptable level of risk\" at a reasonable cost by selecting and implementing security improvements. Decision makers need to determine what constitutes acceptable risk and establish programs, responsibilities, and mechanisms for implementing protective measures. Post-9/11, critical infrastructure owners/operators began identifying assets, assessing vulnerabilities, and enhancing security measures. Regular analysis reviews are recommended in various methodologies. After 9/11, critical infrastructure owners/operators assessed vulnerabilities and implemented security measures. Various industries conducted vulnerability assessments and developed security plans in response to threats identified by DHS. Coordination of these activities by DHS was slow to develop. DHS's coordination of critical infrastructure protection activities developed slowly after 9/11. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan was released in June 2006, outlining a risk management methodology for setting national priorities. The Directorate identified critical assets and sites vulnerable to attack, expanding the list over time. In April 2004, DHS identified 1700 high priority sites for Site Assistance Visits (SAVs) to discuss vulnerabilities and protective measures. These visits are voluntary and focus on security measures inside and outside the site. DHS also assists law enforcement in developing Buffer Zone Protection Plans (BZPPs) and provides training for state and local entities. The number of sites visited by DHS officials is unclear. The Department of Homeland Security identified 1700 high-priority sites for Site Assistance Visits (SAVs) to discuss vulnerabilities and protective measures. However, it is unclear how many sites have been visited, vulnerability assessments conducted, security plans developed, or implemented. The Directorate lacks transparency in its processes for identifying and prioritizing high-priority sites and selecting protective measures. The original list of sites received criticism for including inactive or questionable sites, leading to the development of a revised list of over 600 high-priority sites. The Department of Homeland Security has a list of approximately 2000 sites considered important, but it is unclear how they relate to the original list of 1700 or the 600 high-priority sites. DHS grants support various counter-terrorism activities, including funding for law enforcement, fire fighters, emergency response, and critical infrastructure protection. Funding for critical infrastructure protection is provided through grants like the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative. These grants allow for the purchase of surveillance equipment, detectors, fences, and cybersecurity hardware. DHS also funds grants specific to port, rail, mass transit, trucking, and inter-city bus security. Allocation of funds is based on risk assessments and formulas determined by Congress. The FY2006 Urban Areas Security Initiative grant program guidelines outline the risk assessment process used by DHS, focusing on cities with a population over 100,000 and those with reported threat data. Candidate urban areas were identified based on shared boundaries and a 10-mile buffer was used for evaluation. The guidance distinguished between asset-based and geographically-based risk assessments. The FY2006 guidance distinguished between asset-based risk, focusing on specific types of attacks and consequences, and geographically-based risk, which expanded upon the assessment process for urban areas eligible for grants. Threat was defined as the likelihood of an attack, including types of attacks and vulnerabilities, while vulnerability was defined as the likelihood of attack success. Geographically-based risk considers area attributes like proximity to national boundaries and population density. Threat calculations include FBI investigations, suspicious incidents, and visitors from countries of interest. The analysis is more rigorous with quantitative data on specific assets and attack scenarios. Over 120,000 assets in 38 types were included in the analysis. In FY2006, urban areas needed to develop security strategies, needs assessments, and investment plans to be eligible for grants. DHS assessed capabilities to determine funding priorities competitively based on investment programs submitted. In FY2006, urban areas competed for grant awards based on investment programs submitted. Some areas saw grant awards decline, leading to concerns about DHS methodology. Secretary Chertoff introduced a new process for FY2007, dividing urban areas into two tiers based on risk levels. Tier 1 areas will receive 55% of funds, while the remaining areas will receive the balance. The analysis now includes a focus on infrastructure assets. The analysis for FY2007 grant awards focuses on reducing the number of infrastructure assets considered, prioritizing those with national or regional economic impact. Assets like office buildings and monuments are excluded, with funds allocated competitively based on urban areas' alignment with identified needs and return on investment. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) aims to integrate critical infrastructure protection efforts and guide protection investments across sectors. It uses sector-level plans developed cooperatively to identify critical assets, conduct risk assessments, and direct resources towards activities that reduce risks. The risk management process in the NIPP sets specific goals for investment. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) sets specific goals for security and recovery posture, identifies critical assets, and assesses risks based on consequences, vulnerability, and threat. Consequences include negative effects on public health, economy, public confidence, and government functioning from asset damage or disruption by terrorist attacks or natural disasters. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) focuses on the economic impact, public confidence, and government ability to provide essential services in worst-case scenarios. Vulnerability is the susceptibility of assets to destruction or exploitation, assessed through scenario-based evaluations. Threat is the likelihood of an attack based on adversary intent or natural events. The NIPP emphasizes assessing vulnerability and threat to calculate a numerical risk score. Protective measures should focus on high-risk assets and aim to reduce risk through prevention, deterrence, and mitigation. Considerations for estimating risk reduction measures include adversary intent, methods, and tactics, as well as insider and external threats. The NIPP emphasizes assessing vulnerability and threat to calculate a risk score and implementing protective measures to reduce risk. Cost-effectiveness considerations include coordination costs, stakeholder roles, market incentives, and public interests. Metrics should track performance of protective measures. The National Asset Database, initiated by DHS, includes over 77,000 infrastructure assets as of January 2006. Many questions remain regarding process, methodology, and criteria. The National Asset Database, established by DHS, contains over 77,000 entries covering critical infrastructure sectors. Concerns have been raised about the inclusion of non-significant entries and the exclusion of assets deemed important. Issues also arise regarding data accuracy, quality, and consistency across different regions. DHS has taken steps to address these concerns. The National Asset Database, established by DHS, contains over 77,000 entries covering critical infrastructure sectors. Concerns have been raised about the inclusion of non-significant entries and the exclusion of assets deemed important. DHS asserts that the Database is an inventory of assets, not a list of critical assets, and critics feel it should be purged of assets not of national significance. DHS has rejected this idea and selected 1,700 high priority assets based on credible potential for loss of life and citizen confidence. The National Asset Database, established by DHS, contains over 77,000 entries covering critical infrastructure sectors. Concerns have been raised about the inclusion of non-significant entries and the exclusion of assets deemed important. DHS asserts that the Database is an inventory of assets, not a list of critical assets, and critics feel it should be purged of assets not of national significance. DHS has selected 1,700 high priority assets based on credible potential for loss of life and citizen confidence, which are considered assets that cannot be afford to lose. Roper recommended specific criteria for assessing the level of criticality, such as the national impact of an attack and the level of casualties or economic impact that would rank an asset as nationally critical. An example of detailed analysis on nationally critical assets can be found in the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System. The white paper by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Security Exchange Commission, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency identified systemic risk in the financial system as the potential for disruptions in core clearing and settlement organizations to cause liquidity or credit problems. Firms above a certain market share threshold would have their backup capacity and recovery plans reviewed by the appropriate agency. In a detailed request to states for data to populate the National Asset Database, the DHS provided specific guidance for identifying \"national level\" critical infrastructure, including criteria for producers, chemical sites, power generation facilities, refineries, cruise ports/terminals, and seaports. The Homeland Security Act assigned the Directorate the responsibility of integrating all-source information to identify and assess terrorist threats against the US. The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) assumed similar responsibilities shortly after the act was passed in January 2003. The Homeland Security Act designated DHS as a member of the intelligence community with a seat at the TTIC. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act raised questions about the division of labor. Despite organizational changes, the key question is the consistency of threat characterization throughout the intelligence community. The Homeland Security Act designated DHS as a member of the intelligence community with a seat at the TTIC. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act raised questions about the consistency of threat characterization used by the intelligence community. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan outlines three types of threat analysis developed by HITRAC for risk assessments in different sectors. These include Common Threat Scenarios, General Threat Environment, and Specific Threat Information. The NIPP outlines sector-specific environment analysis, cross-referencing attack methods with potential targets to create a Terrorist Strategic Target Selection Matrix. Blank cells indicate unlikely or unsuccessful attack scenarios. Specific Threat Information is real-time intelligence on explicit threats, updating the General Threat Environment. The Directorate's risk management activities may not have benefitted from analyzing Specific Threat Information. Questions arise about how the Directorate values different threats, such as Al Qaeda's varied attack capabilities. The Government Accountability Office notes the Directorate's use of \"benchmark scenarios\" but struggles to assess their relative likelihood. The NIPP's Matrix may address this issue. Directorate officials plan to conduct vulnerability assessments in the field. The Directorate plans to conduct vulnerability assessments in the field, with early efforts being performed by contractors or details from other agencies. It is unclear if the Directorate used assessments from other agencies or stakeholders. The NIPP sets standards for vulnerability assessments, accepting alternative methodologies if they meet baseline criteria. Assessments should consider physical, personnel, cyber, and operational security, as well as dependencies and interdependencies. The Directorate considers consequences such as loss of life, loss of citizen confidence, national security, economic implications, and public safety when assessing risk for critical infrastructure. HSPD-7 outlines types of attacks that could have catastrophic health effects, impair federal agencies, disrupt state and local governments, harm the economy, or affect public morale. The Directorate assesses risk for critical infrastructure by considering consequences like loss of life, citizen confidence, national security, economic implications, and public safety. HSPD-7 emphasizes protecting infrastructures that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. The NIPP states that assessments should focus on human and direct economic impacts, but it's unclear how different consequences are integrated into an overall risk rating. The Directorate assesses risk for critical infrastructure by considering consequences like loss of life, citizen confidence, national security, economic implications, and public safety. HSPD-7 emphasizes protecting infrastructures that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. Questions arise about prioritizing security measures and measuring consequences, such as potential deaths, economic impact, and cascading effects due to interdependencies. The complexity of estimating these consequences is acknowledged in the NIPP. The NIPP acknowledges the complexity of estimating consequences for critical infrastructure and emphasizes the need for assessment methodologies and standards. It mentions reducing threat levels, vulnerability, and consequences to mitigate risks, aligning with the Bush Administration's homeland security strategy. The Department of Defense, CIA, and FBI are involved in this risk assessment process. The Department of Defense, CIA, FBI, DHS, and other agencies work to reduce threats by disrupting, detaining, or eliminating individuals. DHS focuses on emergency response and critical infrastructure protection to mitigate consequences of an attack. Efforts aim to prevent threats, protect assets, and reduce vulnerability. The Department of Defense, CIA, FBI, DHS, and other agencies collaborate to reduce threats by disrupting individuals. DHS focuses on emergency response and critical infrastructure protection to mitigate consequences of an attack. Efforts aim to prevent threats, protect assets, and reduce vulnerability. Coordination within DHS and with other agencies is crucial for effective risk reduction strategies. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) prioritizes critical assets based on risk levels and allocates resources to maximize risk reduction. DHS uses a tiered approach to allocate funds in programs like Homeland Security Grants and Urban Areas Security Initiative. DHS allocates funds based on risk levels and entities compete for them. Proposals are ranked on factors like risk reduction contribution. Challenges may arise in distributing resources politically and prorating risk reduction if proposals are only partially funded. The Directorate of DHS faces a complex task of assessing national security risks at thousands of sites. They must consider economic impacts, loss of life, national morale, and government functionality. Balancing these factors is challenging, especially when determining the economic impact of asset loss. The Directorate of DHS is tasked with assessing national security risks, including economic impacts, loss of life, national morale, and government functionality. Determining the economic impact of asset loss is challenging, especially when comparing the importance of different assets. The decision-making process is not perfect or objective, with resource allocation decisions being made implicitly by the Bush Administration and Congress. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for transparent processes in selecting assets of national importance for security measures. Congress should be informed by the Transportation Security Administration about potential terrorist threats, security layers in place, and their effectiveness. The Directorate should provide criteria for asset selection, risk assessment, and cost of additional protective measures to Congress. There is a lack of consistent systematic approach in identifying critical assets and assessing risks by the Directorate. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) outlines a systematic approach for identifying critical assets, assessing risks, and allocating resources for protective action. While the NIPP provides a clear process, transparency in plan implementation is uncertain. Congress may provide guidance on criteria and tradeoffs, and coordination among committees overseeing different infrastructures is recommended. The text chunk discusses various sources providing guidance on security vulnerability assessments for different infrastructures, such as maritime, petroleum, electric power, and wastewater utilities. Coordination among committees overseeing different infrastructures is recommended for effective risk management. The text chunk includes vulnerability checklists and guidelines from various sources such as the Government Accountability Office, American Chemistry Council, Argonne National Laboratory, and the Department of Homeland Security. These resources aim to assist in assessing security risks for different infrastructures."
