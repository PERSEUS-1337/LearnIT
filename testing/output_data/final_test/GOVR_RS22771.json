    "content": "The franking privilege, originating in 17th century Great Britain, allows Members of Congress to send mail without postage. It was established in 1660 by the British House of Commons and later extended to colonial officials. In 1775, the First Continental Congress granted mailing privileges to Members to communicate with constituents and soldiers. This privilege is used to facilitate official communications such as responding to constituent requests, sharing legislative updates, and announcing government activities. Members of Congress have the franking privilege to send mail without postage. The U.S. Postal Service is paid for franked mail through annual appropriations. Each chamber uses a formula to allocate funds to Members. In the Senate, each Senator's franked mail postage allowance is determined by a formula that gives a maximum allowance equal to the cost of one first-class mailing to every address in the Senator's state. If the total Senate appropriation for official mail is less than the amount required for the maximum allowance, each Senator's allowance is proportionally reduced. Senators are limited to $50,000 for mass mailings. The franking privilege for Members of Congress allows them to send mail without postage, funded through annual appropriations. In the House, the mail allowance is based on the number of addresses in each district and combined with other office expenses. House Members can spend any portion of their allowance on franked mail, with no total spending restrictions on mass mailings within their allowance limits. The franking privilege is regulated by federal law, House and Senate rules, and committees' regulations. The franking privilege allows Members of Congress to send mail without postage, funded through annual appropriations. It can only be used for public concern or service, not for political campaigns or personal greetings. Regulations specify limitations on size and formatting, and official funds must be used for preparation. Mass mailings are further restricted by law and chamber rules, with a notice required on each mailing. Senators are prohibited from sending mass mailings close to elections. During FY2015, Congress spent $8.3 million on official mail, with House official mail costs at $6.8 million and Senate official mail costs at $1.5 million. Costs are reported quarterly in the House and biannually in the Senate. The franking privilege allows Members of Congress to send mail without postage for public concern or service, not for political campaigns. Regulations restrict mass mailings close to elections. During FY2015, Congress spent $8.3 million on official mail, with House official mail costs at $6.8 million and Senate official mail costs at $1.5 million. In FY2014, Congress spent $16.9 million on official mail, with House costs at $15.1 million and Senate costs at $1.8 million. In FY2013, Congress spent $7.6 million on official mail, with House costs at $6.2 million and Senate costs at $1.4 million. In FY2012, Congress spent $24.8 million on official mail, with House costs at $23.3 million and Senate costs at $1.5 million. This trend shows lower spending on official mail during non-election years compared to election years. Reform efforts in the past 30 years have significantly reduced franking expenditures in Congress. Even-numbered-year franking costs decreased by over 85% from $113.4 million in FY1988 to $16.9 million in FY2014, while odd-numbered-year costs decreased by over 90% from $89.5 million in FY1989 to $8.3 million in FY2015. House mail costs dropped from $77.9 million in FY1988 to $6.8 million in FY2015, and Senate costs decreased from $43.6 million in FY1984 to $1.5 million in FY2015. H.R. 1873, the Ending Special Mail Privileges for Congress Act, aims to eliminate these costs. H.R. 1873, the Ending Special Mail Privileges for Congress Act, would eliminate the franking privilege of Members of Congress, but allow the use of official funds for official communications. Introduced in 2015, the bill has not seen further action. H.R. 4872, introduced in 2014, aimed to end special mail privileges for Congress. S. 3528 sought to repeal franking privileges for former Speakers of the House. Two bills in the 111th Congress, H.R. 2056 and H.R. 5151, proposed changes to the congressional franking privilege. H.R. 2056, the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act of 2009, aimed to amend election-year mass-mailing restrictions by changing the period during which Members are prohibited from franking mass mailings. If passed, Members of both the House and Senate would have been banned from mailing mass mailings 90 days before a primary election in which they are a candidate for reelection to any federal office until the day of the general election. This would have altered the current law and chamber rules regarding the timing of mass mailings that can be franked by Senators and House Members before primary and general elections. H.R. 2056 aimed to amend election-year mass-mailing restrictions by prohibiting Senators from franking mass mailings 60 days before the general election, regardless of candidacy. It would also have restricted congressional committees from mailing mass mailings during this period if the chair or ranking member is a candidate. Introduced by Rep. John Tierney in 2009, the bill did not progress in committees. No further action was taken on legislation introduced in the 110th Congress to amend election-year mass-mailing restrictions on Members. H.R. 1614, S. 936, and S. 1285 were introduced but did not progress in committees. H.R. 5151, the Congressional Oversight and Spending Transparency Act of 2010, aimed to prohibit the use of funds of the House for certain purposes. H.R. 5151, introduced by Representative Jeff Flake in 2010, aimed to amend existing statutes to restrict the use of House funds for official mail to documents transmitted under official letterhead. It also required quarterly reports to disclose costs for each category of mass mailing. The bill was referred to the Committee on House Administration but did not progress further. In the 110th Congress, bills H.R. 2687 and H.R. 2788 were introduced to alter the congressional franking privilege. H.R. 2687 aimed to prohibit Representatives from mass mailing newsletters, questionnaires, or congratulatory notices, but not federal documents or voter registration information. The legislation would have only applied to Representatives and not Senators. H.R. 2687, introduced in the 110th Congress, aimed to restrict mass mailing privileges for Representatives, while H.R. 2788 would have required cost disclosure on franked mail. H.R. 2788, introduced by Representative Jeff Flake, aimed to disclose the total cost of producing and mailing mass mailings by Members of the House. The legislation would not have affected mass mailings made by Senators and did not amend the current law requiring mailings to bear the notice \"Prepared, Published, and Mailed at Taxpayer Expense.\" No further action was taken after the bill was referred to the Committee on House Administration."
