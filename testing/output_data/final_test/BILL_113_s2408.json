The Act, titled \"No Surface Occupancy Western Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act,\" defines key terms such as Coastal Plain, Final Statement, Map, and Secretary. The \"Western Coastal Plain\" borders the land of Alaska to the west and offshore waters of the Beaufort Sea to the north. Oil and gas can be extracted using horizontal drilling or other subsurface technology from sites outside or underneath the surface of the Coastal Plain. The leasing program for land within the Western Coastal Plain allows for oil and gas extraction using horizontal drilling technology. Authorization is given for oil and gas exploration, leasing, development, and production in the Western Coastal Plain. The Secretary is required to establish a competitive leasing program and administer it through regulations to ensure environmentally sound activities. The authorization for oil and gas activities on the Western Coastal Plain includes prohibiting surface occupancy, using best technology, and ensuring fair market value. The authorization for oil and gas activities on the Western Coastal Plain ensures fair market value and compliance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The Final Statement from the Department of the Interior satisfies the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act for preleasing activities and exploration programs before the first lease sale. The Secretary must prepare an environmental impact statement before conducting the first lease sale under this Act. The Secretary must identify a preferred action and a single leasing alternative for the first lease sale under this Act within one year of its enactment. Nonleasing alternative courses of action and their environmental effects will not be analyzed in this process. Failure to comply with these requirements will have consequences. The Act requires compliance with environmental analysis for leasing, satisfying other legal requirements. It does not expand or limit state and local regulatory authority. The Secretary must establish regulations within one year in consultation with relevant parties. SEC. 4. LEASE SALES. The Act allows qualified individuals to lease land for oil and gas deposits. The Secretary will establish procedures for receiving nominations, holding lease sales, and public notice. Lease sales will be through sealed competitive cash bonus bids. The Secretary will offer tracts with high potential in the first lease sale. The Secretary will prioritize areas with high hydrocarbon potential for lease sales, with a minimum of 200,000 acres. Lease sales will occur within specific timeframes, starting 18 months after the Act's enactment, with additional sales based on interest in exploration or development. SEC. 5. GRANT OF LEASES BY THE SECRETARY. The Secretary will grant leases for land on the Western Coastal Plain to the highest bidder in a lease sale, with approval required for any subsequent transfers. SEC. 6. LEASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. An oil or gas lease issued under this Act must include a royalty payment of at least 12.5% of production value, allow for seasonal closures to protect wildlife, and hold lessees responsible for land reclamation in the Western Coastal Plain. The oil or gas lease in the Western Coastal Plain must include provisions for land reclamation, protection of wildlife and the environment, and ensure that the lessee cannot delegate reclamation responsibility without approval. The lessee must make efforts to provide fair employment and contracting opportunities for Alaska Natives and Native Corporations as agreed in the Federal Agreement. The Secretary must require project labor agreements for laborers and mechanics on production, maintenance, and construction under the lease. SEC. 7 of the Act states that 50% of oil and gas revenues will go to Alaska, with the rest going to the US Treasury. Payments to Alaska will be monthly. SEC. 8 deals with conveyance. The Secretary shall convey the surface estate of land to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation to clarify land ownership patterns in the Coastal Plain. The Secretary will convey the remaining subsurface estate to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation as per the agreement dated August 9, 1983."
