    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nursing Facility Fire Safety Act of 2007\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that multiple deadly fires in nursing facilities without automatic fire sprinkler systems have resulted in significant loss of life. A large percentage of nursing facilities nationwide lack these crucial safety measures, leading to a high risk of fire-related tragedies. Many facilities struggle financially to install sprinkler systems, potentially facing closure as a result. In a July 2004 report, the GAO found that the presence of automatic sprinkler systems could have reduced or eliminated the substantial loss of life in fires in nursing homes. Federal oversight of nursing home compliance with fire safety standards was deemed inadequate. The National Fire Protection Association recently adopted requirements for automatic sprinklers in all existing nursing facilities to improve survival chances in case of a fire. Congress believes that within five years, all nursing facilities in America should have automatic fire sprinklers for safety. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should require all nursing facilities to be fully sprinklered and ensure compliance with fire safety standards for Medicare participating skilled nursing facilities. The National Fire Protection Association developed safety standards in the 2006 Life Safety Code. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to provide direct loans for nursing facilities to retrofit with fire sprinkler systems. Appropriations of $200 million for 2008, $100 million for 2009, $75 million for 2010, $50 million for 2011, and $25 million for 2012 are authorized. Additionally, there will be sprinkler retrofit assistance grants available. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to award grants to nursing facilities for retrofitting with automatic fire sprinkler systems. Grants will prioritize applications demonstrating need or hardship, considering factors like patient numbers and facility conditions. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will consult with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to explore additional funding options for retrofitting nursing facilities with fire sprinkler systems. In cases where retrofitting the entire facility is not feasible, alternative remedial actions will be evaluated, such as retrofitting a majority of the facility or constructing a new facility."
