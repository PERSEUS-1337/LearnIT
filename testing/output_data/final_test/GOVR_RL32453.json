    "content": "Social Security spousal and survivor benefits are paid to spouses of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Spousal benefit is 50% of the worker's benefit, while survivor benefit is 100%. Congress created spousal benefits in 1939 for financially dependent spouses. The \"dual entitlement\" rule caps total benefits at the higher of worker's own benefit or spousal benefit. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) serves a similar purpose. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces Social Security spousal benefits for individuals who receive their own non-Social Security pension or benefits. Workers need 40 earnings credits for Social Security retired-worker benefits. Disabled workers need 40 earnings credits for Social Security benefits, with the requirement varying based on age of disability onset. Around 94% of workers are covered by Social Security, with most non-covered positions held by government employees. Coverage among state and local government employees varies by state, with New York having the highest coverage at 96% and Ohio and Massachusetts having lower coverage rates. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) aims to reduce Social Security benefits for spouses or widow(er)s who receive their own non-Social Security pension or benefits. The Social Security dual entitlement rule reduces benefits for spouses or widow(er)s who receive their own retirement benefits. It ensures that beneficiaries receive the higher of their worker benefit or spousal benefit, but not both simultaneously. This rule prevents couples with two earners from receiving multiple full benefits. The Social Security dual entitlement rule reduces benefits for spouses or widow(er)s who receive their own retirement benefits. It ensures that beneficiaries receive the higher of their worker benefit or spousal benefit, but not both simultaneously. In cases where the worker's own benefit is higher than the spousal benefit, the worker receives only his or her own benefit. John and Mary both qualify for Social Security retirement benefits based on their work history. John's worker benefit is $2,000, while Mary's is $900. They are also eligible for spousal benefits. Mary will receive a total of $1,000 monthly from Social Security - $900 as a worker benefit and $100 as a spousal benefit. John will not receive a spousal benefit due to his higher worker benefit of $2,000. If John predeceases Mary, she would receive a widow's benefit of $1,100, consisting of her own benefit and John's remaining benefit. In dual entitlement scenarios, individuals can receive both a worker benefit and a spousal or widow(er)'s benefit from Social Security. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces spousal or widow(er)'s benefits by two-thirds of the pension from non-covered government employment. This reduction can potentially eliminate the entire Social Security spousal benefit. About 17% of Social Security retired worker beneficiaries are dually entitled. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) can eliminate the entire Social Security spousal or widow(er)'s benefit by reducing it based on pension from non-covered government employment. In December 2017, around 1% of Social Security beneficiaries had their spousal or widow(er)'s benefits reduced fully or partially by the GPO. This offset does not affect the worker's own Social Security benefit but limits the amount paid to their spouse or widow(er) who worked in non-Social Security-covered employment. Mary, who worked in a non-Social Security-covered government position, is eligible for a $900 government pension. She can also receive a Social Security spousal benefit of up to $1,000 based on her husband John's work history. Due to the Government Pension Offset (GPO), Mary's spousal benefit is reduced by two-thirds of her government pension ($600), resulting in a total retirement benefit of $1,300 per month. Mary will receive retirement benefits of $1,300 per month: $900 from her non-covered pension and $400 as a Social Security spousal benefit. If John predeceases Mary, she would receive a $1,400 monthly widow's benefit from Social Security in addition to her $900 monthly non-covered pension benefit. The dual entitlement rule and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) are compared in Table 3, with the aim of supporting financially dependent spouses. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) was enacted in 1977 to equalize benefits for spouses and widow(er)s with government employment not covered by Social Security. It aimed to prevent individuals from receiving full Social Security benefits while also receiving pensions from non-covered government jobs. Table 4 illustrates how benefits for an individual named Mary would change under different scenarios, showing the impact of the GPO on Social Security spousal benefits. After the GPO was enacted in 1977, Mary's Social Security spousal benefit is reduced in different scenarios. In one scenario, her spousal benefit is reduced to $100, in another scenario, she receives a full spousal benefit of $1,000 plus a non-covered pension of $900, and in the third scenario, her spousal benefit is reduced. After the GPO was enacted in 1977, Mary's Social Security spousal benefit is reduced by two-thirds of her $900 non-covered government pension, leaving her with a net Social Security spousal benefit of $400 and a total monthly pension benefit of $1,300. The reduction to Social Security spousal benefits is smaller under the GPO compared to the dual entitlement rule. Under the dual entitlement rule, Mary receives $100 in spousal benefits, while under the GPO, she receives $400. Her total monthly retirement benefits are $1,000 under the dual entitlement rule and $1,300 under the GPO. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces Social Security spousal benefits by approximately 67 cents for every dollar of a pension from non-covered government employment. The GPO was established in 1977 (P.L. 95-216) to replace an earlier dependency test for spousal benefits. The offset rule was set at two-thirds of the non-covered government pension by the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21). The Government Pension Offset (GPO) was established in 1983 by the Social Security Amendments (P.L. 98-21) to reduce spousal benefits by two-thirds of a non-covered government pension. In 2015, around 6.4 million state and local government workers were in non-Social Security-covered positions, potentially affected by the GPO if they receive a Social Security spousal benefit. Employees of the federal government hired before 1984 may be subject to the Government Pension Offset (GPO) if they are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and not by Social Security. Those hired after 1983 are covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) and may be subject to the Social Security dual entitlement rule. As of December 2017, about 1% of Social Security beneficiaries had spousal or widow(er)'s benefits reduced by the GPO. In December 2017, the Government Pension Offset (GPO) affected 55% spouses and 45% widows/widowers, with 82% being women. The average non-covered government pension amount was $2,396 per month. The average reduction caused by the GPO was $674 per month, with 73% having their Social Security benefits fully offset. In 2017, the dual entitlement rule affected approximately 7.2 million beneficiaries, with 97% being women. Among dually-entitled workers, the average total Social Security benefit received was $1,261, with the spousal benefit component comprising about 43% of the total payment. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) is a provision that reduces the Social Security spousal benefit for individuals who receive a government pension. Critics argue that the GPO is not well understood and harms lower-income workers, while supporters maintain that it ensures only financially dependent spouses receive the benefit. The GPO has been in effect since 1977, giving people ample time to adjust their retirement plans. Employers inform individuals about the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) through SSA mailings. Despite the suspension of universal mailings in 2011, an online version with GPO and WEP information is available for those with online accounts. Congress directed SSA to resume targeted mailings in 2014. The GPO reduces spousal benefits less than the dual entitlement rule. Under the dual entitlement rule, individuals face a 100% offset to spousal benefits for every dollar received from a Social Security retired-worker benefit. Those under the GPO face an offset to spousal and widow(er)'s benefits equal to two-thirds of a non-Social Security-covered pension. In an example where comparable spouses each receive a $900 retirement benefit based on their own work histories, the application of the dual entitlement provision results in a $100 monthly Social Security spousal benefit for Mary, while the GPO qualifies her for a $400 spousal benefit. Eliminating the GPO could be seen as unfair to government employees in Social Security-covered positions subject to the dual entitlement provision. The Social Security spousal benefit is reduced for those under dual entitlement by one dollar for every dollar of their own Social Security retirement benefits. For those under the GPO, the reduction is about 67 cents for every dollar of a non-covered government pension. The original intention of the GPO, enacted in 1977, is debated. Some believe it aimed to prevent higher-paid workers from receiving excessive spousal benefits, while others argue it was not income-specific. Critics claim the GPO harms lower- and middle-income workers, like teachers, potentially pushing them into poverty. Opponents argue that the Government Pension Offset (GPO) disproportionately affects low earners, such as teachers, potentially leading them into poverty. Data from the Social Security Administration shows that while 73% of those impacted by the GPO have their benefits fully offset, the percentage decreases for those with lower non-covered pensions. For individuals with pensions under $1,000 per month, only 23% had their benefits fully offset, compared to nearly 100% for those with pensions over $3,000 per month. Among those whose benefits were completely eliminated by the GPO, 7% had pensions below $1,000 per month. Additionally, about 64% of beneficiaries received some Social Security spousal benefit after GPO reduction. Among those affected by the Government Pension Offset (GPO), a greater percentage with lower non-covered pensions receive partial Social Security benefits. In 2001, the poverty rate for GPO-affected individuals was 6.0%, lower than the rate for those affected by the dual entitlement rule (8.9%) and the general population (11.3%). Opponents argue that the Government Pension Offset (GPO) is an imprecise way to estimate spousal benefits, leading to varying outcomes based on income levels. They suggest applying the Social Security benefit formula to replicate the dual entitlement rule for a more accurate offset calculation. The dual entitlement rule proposes applying the Social Security benefit formula to a spouse's total earnings, including non-covered earnings, and adjusting the spousal benefit accordingly. The Social Security Administration lacks complete records of non-covered earnings histories, leading to questions about why the Government Pension Offset (GPO) does not apply to spousal benefits received by spouses of private sector workers with private pensions. The dual entitlement rule replicates the GPO to reduce Social Security spousal benefits, potentially more than the GPO. Repealing the GPO could cost $42 billion over 10 years and 0.06% of present-law taxable payroll. Eliminating the dual entitlement rule could cost $500 billion over five years. A controversy arose in the 108th Congress regarding state and local government workers exploiting a loophole to avoid the Government Pension Offset (GPO) by switching to Social Security-covered positions at the end of their careers. A report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 4,819 individuals in Texas and Georgia had done so, potentially costing the program $450 million. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act of 2003, which eliminated the last-day exception clause for workers switching to Social Security-covered positions. The new provision required a minimum of 60 months in the covered position to be exempt from the GPO. This change became effective for spousal benefit applications filed after March 31, 2004. Individuals exempt from the GPO under the last-day rule before April 1, 2004, would continue to be exempt. Individuals who received Social Security spousal benefits before April 1, 2004, could still use the last-day rule if they worked their last day in a Social Security-covered position within the same retirement system. This exemption from the Government Pension Offset (GPO) applies even if they file for Social Security benefits at a later date. However, the last-day exception clause was eliminated for workers switching to Social Security-covered positions under the Social Security Protection Act of 2003, requiring a minimum of 60 months in the covered position to be exempt from the GPO. If a retiree works in a non-covered position in the same retirement system where they previously retired, new contributions are made to the non-covered pension system, and their last day of government service is on or after July 1, 2004, and before March 2, 2009, they must work a total of 60 months in a Social Security-covered position within the same retirement system to be exempt from the Government Pension Offset (GPO). The required 60-month period can be reduced by the number of months worked in a Social Security-covered position before March 2, 2004, but not less than one month. If a retiree previously worked for 12 months in a Social Security-covered position under the same retirement system, the 60-month requirement for exemption from the Government Pension Offset (GPO) is reduced to 48 months. The remaining 48 months must be worked consecutively after March 2, 2004. Individuals receiving government pensions based on non-covered employment would still be subject to reductions in Social Security spousal benefits under the GPO."
