    "content": "In FY2015, Section 32 had a permanent appropriation of $9.7 billion, 30% of prior calendar-year customs receipts. $8.4 billion was transferred to the Food and Nutrition Service child nutrition program, $144 million to the Commerce Department for fisheries activities, and $1.216 billion remained for farm bill limitations. In FY2015, Section 32 had a permanent appropriation of $9.7 billion. The Section 32 balance was reduced by various transfers and rescissions, including $40 million for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, $121 million rescission, and $82 million sequestration. Additions included unobligated funds carried into FY2015 and recoveries. The final amount available for obligation was $1.052 billion, with $465 million designated for planned AMS commodity purchases. In FY2015, $465 million was allocated for planned AMS commodity purchases under the National School Lunch Act. An additional $306 million was used for emergency removals of surplus commodities, $4 million for disaster relief foods, and $54 million for AMS administrative expenses. This left Section 32 with a $223 million unobligated balance at the end of the fiscal year. Section 32 funds are primarily used for the National School Lunch Program and other domestic food assistance programs. The funds are transferred to USDA's Food and Nutrition Service to meet entitlement spending requirements. A smaller portion is used to purchase commodities directly for schools and other food assistance programs. The USDA uses Section 32 funds to provide commodities for the National School Lunch Program and other food assistance programs, support farm prices, and assist victims of natural disasters. Congress has limited USDA's discretionary authority over these funds through various provisions in farm bills. The farm bill mandates minimum purchases of fruits, vegetables, and nuts from Section 32 for nutrition programs in schools. Congressional appropriators have banned emergency disaster payments from Section 32 since FY2012. Section 32 funds federal commodity purchases like meats, poultry, fruits, and vegetables not covered by mandatory farm programs. USDA donates these purchases to low-income families and schools to supplement their food purchases. Section 32 allows for a wide range of commodity purchases to support various programs, with decisions made by the Secretary of Agriculture. The 2008 farm bill mandates annual specialty crop purchases of at least $406 million under Section 32. Commodity purchases are categorized as \"entitlement\" or \"contingency\" and are made for FNS through USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) plans commodity purchases based on prior year purchases, school needs, available funds, and market conditions. In FY2015, AMS purchased $465 million in agricultural commodities to fulfill a mandate in child nutrition law. The Farm Service Agency administers the purchase contracts and pays the vendors. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act entitles schools and child nutrition program sponsors to commodities worth specific dollar amounts. USDA taps the contingency reserve for emergency surplus removals, distributing them as bonuses to domestic food assistance programs to help limit supply and increase prices. Recipients include schools, child care centers, soup kitchens, food banks, and others serving the needy. Annual contingency purchases have varied from $54 million to $320 million. In FY2015, bonus purchases of fruits, vegetables, and meat products totaled $306 million. USDA has discretionary authority to spend Section 32 money on direct farm assistance, including payments to producers for crop destruction or diversion to livestock feed. Direct payments are also made to agricultural producers for economic or disaster-related reasons, with $178.3 million in direct payments funded by Section 32 in FY1999. In FY1999, Section 32 funded $178.3 million in direct payments to smaller hog producers to assist during historically low prices. Similar assistance continued in the 2000s for disaster initiatives, leading to calls for dedicated funding for agricultural disaster programs in the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill funded agricultural disaster programs for four years, while the 2014 farm bill permanently funded livestock and tree fruit disaster programs. Permanent farm disaster programs and enhancements to federal crop insurance have reduced the need for ad hoc disaster programs through Section 32 funding. USDA is currently prohibited from distributing emergency payments to farmers under Section 32 authority. Congress has also prohibited the use of appropriated funds for farm disaster programs in recent appropriations acts. For more information on disaster programs, see CRS Report RS21212, Agricultural Disaster Assistance. Section 32 funds are allocated annually by AMS for the removal of defective commodities and domestic food assistance programs. In FY2008, $50 million was spent on removing defective ground beef. Funds are also used for providing food commodities to victims of hurricanes and natural disasters. In FY2013, $4 million was allocated for assistance related to Hurricane Sandy, severe weather, tornadoes in Oklahoma, and drought in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Congress periodically designates other uses for Section 32 funds. In FY2015, Section 32 funds were used for food-buying operations, administrative expenses for federal marketing orders, and oversight of agricultural marketing agreements. Congress has designated other uses for these funds, such as providing food to needy families in high unemployment areas. Agriculture appropriations acts have limited the availability of Section 32 funds in recent years. In FY2015, $121 million was rescinded and $82 million was sequestered under the Budget Control Act of 2011, impacting 32 funds for budgetary savings."
