    "content": "The Gulf of Mexico is the primary location for U.S. offshore oil and gas production, with almost all production occurring there. It also holds the highest levels of undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. outer continental shelf. Federal revenues from offshore leases in the Gulf were estimated at $5.51 billion for FY2019, with fluctuating revenues in previous years due to changing oil and gas prices. The Gulf of Mexico is the main location for U.S. offshore oil and gas production, with significant revenue fluctuations due to oil and gas development in the Central and Western Gulf planning areas. Leasing restrictions in the Eastern Gulf have been in place since the 1980s, with leasing moratoria mandated by Congress in certain parts of the OCS, including the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Leasing restrictions in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico have been in place since the 1980s, with moratoria mandated by Congress in certain parts of the OCS. President Clinton extended offshore leasing prohibitions in the Eastern Gulf until 2012, which were later modified by President George W. Bush in 2008 to open multiple withdrawn areas to leasing. President Bush modified leasing restrictions in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico in 2008, but GOMESA prevented the opening of the Eastern Gulf moratorium area to leasing. Before GOMESA, federal revenues from oil and gas leasing in most parts of the Gulf were not shared with coastal states. Gulf Coast states argued for a greater share of OCS revenues due to the significant effects of oil and gas development on their coastal infrastructures and environments. GOMESA, signed into law in 2006, directs revenue sharing from oil and gas leasing in the Gulf. Section 104 imposes a leasing moratorium in certain areas until June 30, 2022, while Section 105 shares revenue with four states and their coastal subdivisions. Until June 30, 2022, the Secretary of the Interior is prohibited from offering certain areas in the Eastern Gulf for leasing, preleasing, or any related activity. The moratorium includes specific areas outlined in the law, such as those east of a designated Military Mission Line and within certain distances of the Florida coast. Existing oil and gas lease holders in parts of the moratorium area may exchange their leases for a bonus or royalty credit in the Gulf of Mexico. The moratorium imposed by Section 104 prohibits lease sales, preleasing, and related activities in certain areas until June 30, 2022. However, geological and geophysical surveys are allowed to locate oil and gas resources. The 116th Congress is considering whether to extend the moratorium or enact legislation to further restrict federal oil and gas activity in the area. After June 30, 2022, new oil and gas leases could be offered in the expired moratorium area. The Secretary of the Interior can decide to include or exclude the area in future leasing programs. The President has the discretion to withdraw the area from leasing consideration. The Trump Administration is interested in leasing in the GOMESA moratorium area. BOEM's draft proposed program includes lease sales in 2023 and 2024 in the moratorium area. The DPP proposes to offer all available tracts in the former moratorium area after its expiration in 2023 and 2024. BOEM is analyzing options to exclude portions of the area from lease sales, including a coastal buffer off Florida and a leasing buffer offshore of Baldwin County, AL. The next draft of the 2019-2024 program will reflect BOEM's analysis, with sales listed in the DPP subject to modification or removal. The Secretary of the Interior must consider economic, social, and environmental criteria when deciding on including sales in the final leasing program. Coastal state governors' views on leasing off their coasts, particularly in the Eastern Gulf, are important factors. DOD historically opposes new leasing in the area due to military testing and training activities. The oil and gas industry has shown interest in leasing in the Eastern Gulf, citing better developed data and existing infrastructure for exploration. Industry representatives are particularly interested in the deepwater Norphlet play in the area. Public comments on the 2019-2024 DPP will be considered in the second draft of the program. The oil and gas industry has expressed interest in the deepwater Norphlet play in the Eastern Gulf. Legislative proposals in the 116th Congress are debating extending or permanently prohibiting leasing in the moratorium area. One bill, H.R. 205, aims to extend the Eastern Gulf moratorium indefinitely to prevent future oil and gas leasing in the area. The House Natural Resources Committee report supports a continued moratorium in the Eastern Gulf to protect military readiness and Florida's economy. Some members believe oil and gas leasing can coexist with other activities and fund environmental restoration. Previous bills aimed to either shrink the moratorium area or restrict certain activities within it. The House Natural Resources Committee report supports extending the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf to protect military readiness and Florida's economy. Some argue that oil and gas development could bring economic benefits, while others are concerned about potential costs to fishing, tourism, and recreation sectors if drilling occurs off the coast of Florida. The House Natural Resources Committee supports extending the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf to protect military readiness and Florida's economy. Stakeholders are concerned about potential costs to fishing, tourism, and recreation sectors if oil and gas development takes place off the coast of Florida, including financial losses from a major oil spill. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that bills to extend the moratorium would increase direct federal spending. In the version of H.R. 205 reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources, CBO estimated that extending GOMESA's moratorium would increase direct spending by $400 million over 10 years. The Eastern Gulf area is crucial for U.S. military readiness, providing a large test and training area. DOD has historically supported an oil and gas leasing moratorium in this region for safety reasons. The importance of maintaining the moratorium on oil and gas development in the Eastern Gulf beyond 2022 is crucial for military readiness. The area provides a surrogate environment for military operations, and extending oil and gas activities without restrictions agreed upon by the DoD and DoI would impact military flexibility and test activities. The 2018 report suggests that DOD may be more open to oil and gas activities in the moratorium area with proper restrictions. Oil and gas leases in the Gulf often include stipulations related to military activities to accommodate both military readiness and development. The 2018 report raises concerns about potential conflicts between military activities and oil and gas operations in the Eastern Gulf, including increased vessel traffic, underwater noise, and foreign observation. It is unclear what lease stipulations and restrictions may be needed to address these issues. The potential impact of restrictions on oil and gas operations in the Eastern Gulf, including defense-related constraints and compatibility with Florida's Coastal Management Program, may affect industry interest in bidding on leases. Despite concerns, some industry representatives express consistent interest in leasing in the area, citing substantial economic returns. Section 105 of GOMESA allows for federal revenues from qualified leases in the Gulf of Mexico to be shared with Gulf producing states and their coastal political subdivisions. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) allows for sharing federal revenues from qualified leases in the Gulf of Mexico with Gulf producing states and their coastal political subdivisions. The law specifies that 50% of qualified revenues are deposited into a special account, with 75% disbursed to the Gulf states and their CPSs, and 25% to the LWCF state assistance program. Qualified OCS revenues are defined differently for the first decade after GOMESA's enactment and subsequent years. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) allows for sharing federal revenues from qualified leases in the Gulf of Mexico with Gulf producing states and their coastal political subdivisions. Qualified OCS revenues include bonus bids, rents, royalties, and other sums from leases in specific areas. Phase II expands the geographic area of qualified revenues to include more areas, resulting in higher revenues for sharing. Phase II of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) allows for sharing federal revenues from qualified leases in the Gulf of Mexico with Gulf producing states and their coastal political subdivisions. The total amount of qualified revenues available each year is capped at $500 million, with a cap of $650 million for FY2020 and FY2021. Revenues are shared with recipients in the fiscal year following the year in which they are generated. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) Phase II revenue sharing began in FY2018, with shared revenues increasing notably compared to previous years. The law directs the Secretary of the Interior to allocate qualified state revenues among Gulf producing states based on their distance from leased tracts, ensuring each state receives a minimum of 10% of the total amount available. GOMESA directs the Secretary to allocate state revenues based on distance from leased tracts, ensuring each state receives a minimum of 10%. 20% of the allocable share goes to the state's CPSs for coastal protection, conservation, restoration, and infrastructure projects. Revenues can also be used for damage mitigation, conservation plans, onshore infrastructure projects, and administrative costs. Under GOMESA, revenue sharing with states and LWCF continues indefinitely. The annual cap on shared revenues from Phase II areas continues through FY2055. DOI develops five-year projections of qualified GOMESA revenues, with half of all qualified revenues shared with states and LWCF. Under GOMESA, revenue sharing with states and LWCF continues indefinitely. DOI develops five-year projections of qualified GOMESA revenues, with changing oil prices affecting projections. The majority of the moratorium area does not qualify for revenue sharing, with any revenues from oil and gas leasing in this area going entirely to the Treasury. GOMESA does not provide revenue sharing with Florida, but there are bills in Congress to increase revenue sharing with Gulf producing states. Some legislative proposals aim to increase state revenue share under GOMESA by raising the states' percentage share or eliminating the revenue-sharing cap. Other bills would expand the purposes for which states can use GOMESA revenues or modify the LWCF share. None of these bills have been reported from committee in the 116th Congress. In contrast, previous proposals in the 114th Congress sought to end state revenue sharing under GOMESA by depositing 87.5% of qualified revenues in the Treasury's General Fund. State officials and Members of Congress have differing views on revenue sharing for Gulf Coast states from oil and gas leasing in federal Gulf areas. Gulf producing states argue for a higher share to cover costs and support the industry, citing environmental impacts and necessary infrastructure. Former Senator Mary Landrieu emphasized the importance of revenue sharing to recognize states' contributions. Advocates emphasize the need for additional federal revenues to address environmental challenges and economic impacts of wetland loss in Gulf Coast areas. They argue for a comparable state revenue share under GOMESA to support coastal wetland restoration. GOMESA requires Gulf producing states to use funding for coastal protection, damage mitigation, and restoration. Some Members of Congress and past administrations have argued for reducing or eliminating state revenue-sharing to use funds for national purposes. DOI budget requests under the Obama Administration recommended repealing GOMESA state revenue-sharing payments to redirect savings to programs benefiting the nation as a whole. The 114th Congress proposed amending GOMESA to eliminate state revenue sharing and redirect funds to the Treasury's General Fund. The Trump Administration suggested repealing state revenue-sharing provisions in FY2018 but has not pursued similar proposals in subsequent budget requests. No legislation to reduce or eliminate GOMESA state revenue sharing has been introduced in the 116th Congress. Phase II of GOMESA expanded the leases contributing to revenue. Phase II of GOMESA expanded revenue sharing to include leases entered into after December 20, 2006. Approximately 61% of active Gulf leases qualify for revenue sharing, but many newer leases are not producing oil and gas. Older leases that do not qualify still contribute a significant portion of production royalties, resulting in a smaller percentage of Gulf revenues being subject to GOMESA sharing. In FY2019, GOMESA-qualified revenues from federal offshore revenues constituted 18% of the total, with a potential increase over time as older leases expire and new leases begin production. Proposed changes to GOMESA terms aim to expand the qualified sharing group to include leases from October 1, 2000, onwards, potentially doubling the number of producing leases eligible for revenue sharing. Proposed changes to GOMESA terms could result in a higher revenue share with states and their Coastal Political Subdivisions (CPSs) and the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state grant program. Some Members are concerned that this change may reduce offshore revenues going to the Treasury for federal purposes. Offshore oil and gas revenues support various federal and state activities, but fluctuating revenue totals raise questions about future funding adequacy. Some Members of Congress are considering adjustments to GOMESA's state revenue share. Members of Congress are considering raising GOMESA's state revenue share to 50% and eliminating the revenue-sharing cap for states. Despite concerns about reducing state sharing under GOMESA, DOI projections suggest that OCS revenues would still be sufficient to meet statutory requirements for deposits to the LWCF and HPF in the coming years. Various economic factors or policy decisions could impact these projections. Economic factors or policy decisions could affect DOI projections, potentially impacting state revenue sharing under GOMESA. Legislative proposals to fund conservation programs with offshore revenues may also influence revenue distribution. For example, bills like S. 500 and H.R. 1225 in the 116th Congress aim to establish a deferred maintenance fund for federal lands using offshore energy revenues. These proposals ensure funding by drawing from miscellaneous receipts after other dispositions are made under federal law. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders propose limiting OCS oil and gas leasing due to climate change concerns. This could lead to a revenue shortfall to meet statutory requirements, especially as existing leases diminish. Supporters suggest finding revenue from renewable energy leasing on federal lands, while opponents argue against curtailing offshore leasing. Some opponents argue against limiting offshore oil and gas leasing due to revenue implications, as bills increasing state share of GOMESA revenues could increase direct spending by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The CBO is uncertain about estimating costs for bills related to offshore leasing, such as H.R. 4294 and S. 13, which could impact revenue sharing for states like Florida. Florida's share of GOMESA revenues under S. 13 would be lower compared to other Gulf Coast states. Adding Florida to the Gulf producing states would guarantee at least 10% of annual state revenue share, potentially reducing the total available to other states. Stakeholders in Florida have differing views on joining GOMESA revenue sharing, with concerns about incentivizing oil and gas development and advocating for a revenue share from leasing elsewhere in the Gulf to offset risks. The current period involves a transition in the oil and gas leasing framework in the Gulf of Mexico, with discussions on extending the GOMESA moratorium through 2027 and adding Florida as a revenue-sharing state. Some stakeholders support this move, while others suggest expanding revenue sharing areas to prevent a decrease in shares for existing states. The Eastern Gulf leasing moratorium is set to expire in 2022, with proposed offshore lease sales starting in 2023. The Gulf of Mexico leasing framework is undergoing a transition, with discussions on extending the GOMESA moratorium through 2027 and adding Florida as a revenue-sharing state. Congress is considering potential changes to meet national goals, including whether decisions about leasing in the Eastern Gulf should be legislatively mandated or left to the executive branch. After June 2022, the President and the Secretary of the Interior will decide on leasing tracts in the former moratorium area. Some Members of Congress seek to amend GOMESA to either extend the moratorium or mandate lease sales. At stake in the debate over amending GOMESA are questions of economic, environmental, energy, and military priorities. Current revenue-sharing provisions consider mitigating Gulf Coast impacts, supporting conservation, and contributing to the Treasury. Legislative proposals aim to adjust the balance of revenues for these purposes. The 116th Congress is debating proposals to amend GOMESA, including adjusting the balance of revenues for conservation and addressing climate change by potentially reducing Gulf oil and gas production."
