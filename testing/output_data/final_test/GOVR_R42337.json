    "content": "In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled on wartime detention authority. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan could be held as an enemy combatant but was entitled to a hearing. The petitioner was allowed to return to Saudi Arabia. In Rumsfeld v. Padilla, another U.S. citizen in military custody was denied habeas corpus. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated a decision on jurisdictional grounds, sending the case to a district court in the Fourth Circuit for a new trial. The court held that the detention of a U.S. citizen arrested in the United States on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack was different from a citizen captured on the battlefield overseas, and that detention without trial was precluded by the Non-Detention Act. The Act states that no U.S. citizen may be detained except pursuant to an act of Congress. The AUMF authorizes the President to use \"all necessary and appropriate force\" against those associated with the 9/11 attacks, including individuals who fought against the U.S. in Afghanistan. The detention of individuals falling into this category during the conflict is considered a fundamental incident of war authorized by Congress. The AUMF authorizes the detention of Taliban combatants for the duration of the conflict in Afghanistan under long-standing law of war principles. This authority is based on the use of \"necessary and appropriate force\" granted by Congress. The AUMF authorizes the detention of Taliban combatants in Afghanistan under long-standing law of war principles. Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg joined the plurality opinion to vacate the decision and remand the case for Hamdi to contest his detention. They found no explicit authority in the AUMF to detain American citizens as enemy combatants and rejected the theory that the detention was authorized as a necessary incident to the use of military force. The Supreme Court justices disagreed on whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) allowed for the detention of American citizens like Hamdi as enemy combatants. Justices Scalia and Stevens argued that U.S. citizens accused of waging war should be prosecuted in federal court unless Congress suspends the Writ of Habeas Corpus. They believed that the Executive's intent to detain dangerous offenders did not make their detention noncriminal. Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas dissented on the issue of whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) allowed for the detention of American citizens like Hamdi as enemy combatants. Scalia argued that U.S. citizens detained within the United States should be prosecuted in federal court unless the Writ of Habeas Corpus is suspended. Thomas agreed with the government's position that the detention of enemy combatants is an unreviewable aspect of the war powers constitutionally allocated to the political branches. The majority of the Court approved the AUMF authority to detain enemy combatants, with Chief Justice Rehnquist leading the decision in Padilla. However, four dissenting Justices indicated they would have upheld the Second Circuit's grant of the petition on the merits for a U.S. citizen arrested in the United States. The Bush Administration's authority to detain a U.S. citizen associated with Al Qaeda was questioned, along with due process for acts of war like bombings and missile strikes. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of executive detention of subversive citizens associated with Al Qaeda, emphasizing that detaining individuals to prevent them from aiding terrorist groups is justifiable, but using unlawful procedures to extract information is not. Incommunicado detention for extended periods was deemed unacceptable, as the nation should not resort to tyrannical methods even in the face of tyranny. In 2004, the Supreme Court debated the Non-Detention Act's application to U.S. citizens associated with Al Qaeda. There were differing opinions on whether the Act allows detention of citizens on the battlefield in Afghanistan. The majority agreed that indefinite detention for interrogation purposes is impermissible, even if lawful under the law of war. The Supreme Court debated the detention of U.S. citizens associated with Al Qaeda in 2004. A majority agreed that citizens detained under the AUMF have the right to contest their detention before a neutral decision maker. U.S. citizens who engage in hostilities against the United States may be treated as enemy belligerents, similar to alien enemy belligerents under the laws of war. The legal category of persons subject to detention, as interpreted by lower courts, the executive branch, and Congress, is unlikely to differ based on citizenship. U.S. citizen-detainees may have more procedural rights than alien detainees. Citizens detained abroad can seek habeas review, and courts have jurisdiction over non-habeas cases for U.S. citizens. Military commissions do not have jurisdiction to try citizens for war crimes. Lower courts have used the Hamdi decision as a baseline for determining rights of U.S. citizen-detainees. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed whether an alien lawfully present in the United States can be detained under the AUMF based on activity conducted there. A noncitizen may contest the government's facts supporting an enemy combatant designation. The government's facts support an enemy combatant designation, as seen in cases like Hamdi and Padilla. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, declared an \"enemy combatant,\" had his habeas corpus petition dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Both al-Marri and Padilla filed new petitions in the Fourth Circuit, leading to a potential Supreme Court review on detention authority for citizens and aliens in the US. The Fourth Circuit confirmed detentions of individuals under AUMF authority without establishing a clear test. Supreme Court review was avoided by moving petitioners to civilian courts. The only upheld opinion affirmed Jose Padilla's detention for fighting against the US on a foreign battlefield, similar to Hamdi's case. The report discusses wartime detention under international law and relevant U.S. practice, including the Fourth Circuit's treatment of the Padilla and al-Marri cases. It also mentions the Hedges v. Obama case, where plaintiffs sought to block enforcement of the detention provision in the 2012 NDAA. The law of war categorizes individuals in armed conflict as combatants or civilians, determining their legal status. The legal status of persons in combat is determined by international law, distinguishing between combatants authorized to fight and civilians protected from deliberate targeting. Combatants must minimize civilian casualties and distinguish themselves from civilians to limit exposure to military attacks. Failure to do so may result in being denied prisoner of war status. The Geneva Conventions determine the treatment of individuals captured during international armed conflicts. Enemy combatants and civilians can be detained for security reasons, not based on guilt. POWs are held to remove them as a threat from the battlefield, promoting a more humane approach than other alternatives. The law of war allows for the detention of enemy combatants and civilians for security reasons, to prevent them from aiding the enemy. This includes internment and confiscation of property, not based on guilt but to deprive the enemy of resources. The President has the authority to restrict, intern, or remove enemy aliens deemed dangerous during a declared war. The law allows for the detention of enemy combatants and civilians for security reasons during armed conflict. The Detaining Power may punish detainees for crimes committed before or during captivity, following a fair trial. International armed conflict is governed by the Geneva Conventions, while non-international armed conflict is regulated by Common Article 3. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions provides minimal protections for individuals in armed conflicts, without distinguishing between combatants and civilians. There is debate among legal scholars on whether detention is permissible in non-international conflicts to the same extent as in international conflicts, with some arguing for specific domestic legal authority. Customary international law may apply to non-international conflicts that meet the threshold for belligerency under the law of war. Under international law of war, contention not meeting this level is governed by domestic law. US practice shows statutory authority and a declaration of war are needed for wartime detention in the US, especially for preventive detention of civilians or unprivileged belligerents. History shows individuals deemed \"enemies\" or too dangerous during war or national emergency have been interned. They are treated as alien enemies rather than prisoners of war or \"enemy combatants\". Persons captured on the battlefield abroad have been treated as alien enemies by the military, following traditional international law practices. Individuals acting on behalf of an enemy government within the US have been tried in federal court. The US has generally adhered to established laws of war in handling detainees. During wartime, individuals associated with enemy governments or armed forces were subject to different legal treatment. Those with personal sympathy towards the enemy were still protected under domestic and international law, while alien enemies had little to no protection. The necessity and adequacy of restrictive measures taken against individuals were evaluated based on due process. Privileged belligerents were not tried as criminals for acts that did not violate the law of war. During the summer of 1798, tensions with the French Republic led to the enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts by Congress. These national security measures included the Alien Act, Sedition Act, and Alien Enemy Act. The Alien Act allowed the President to expel noncitizens deemed dangerous or involved in treasonous activities. Only the Alien Enemy Act remains in modern times, permitting the expulsion and imprisonment of aliens who return without permission. The Alien Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, allowed the President to expel noncitizens considered dangerous or involved in treasonous activities. Debate surrounded whether \"alien friends\" on U.S. territory were entitled to due process of law and the same protection as citizens. The bill passed along regional lines but was never enforced, with some aliens leaving the country voluntarily. The Alien Enemy Act was the last law enacted during the crisis of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. It stated that in the event of war or invasion against the United States, males over the age of fourteen from hostile nations within the country could be apprehended. Virginia and Kentucky declared the Alien Act and Sedition Act unconstitutional, with Thomas Jefferson's opposition to these Acts aiding in his presidential victory. The Alien Enemy Act allowed for the apprehension and removal of alien enemies during declared wars or invasions. Unlike the Alien Act or Sedition Act, it did not require suspicion of hostile activities. There was little controversy surrounding this act, with even opponents of the Alien Act in Congress raising no objections. The Alien Enemy Act allowed for the apprehension and removal of alien enemies during wars or invasions, without requiring suspicion of hostile activities. Opponents of the Alien Act in Congress did not object to this act, indicating its constitutionality and the understanding of aliens' different status based on allegiance to a warring government. The Sedition Act, the only one enforced, was criticized for limiting freedom of speech and press but did not allow detention without trial for citizens or aliens. During the War of 1812, President Madison issued the first presidential proclamation under the Enemy Alien Act, requiring alien enemies near tide water to report to local marshals for residency. Aliens could challenge these measures through habeas corpus relief, with one British subject succeeding in court. An American citizen detained for aiding the British was granted habeas corpus as there was no authority for military trial for treason. It was not argued that U.S. citizens aiding the enemy could be detained without trial as enemy belligerents or prisoners of war. The Supreme Court ruled that enemy property in the US cannot be confiscated by the military without specific statutory authority, even though the law of war allows it. The Civil War raised new legal issues regarding the treatment of enemy aliens and prisoners of war. During the Civil War, the United States asserted both belligerent and sovereign rights against seceded states and their citizens, establishing that the conflict was a war under international law, not just an insurrection. This allowed for the prosecution of treason and other crimes against U.S. citizens who supported the seceded states. During the Civil War, citizens of seceded states were considered public enemies, while those in non-seceded states were not unless they actively supported the Confederacy. In border states with high anti-Union sentiments, martial law was imposed as necessary. President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus in the North for troop protection, later expanding it broadly. During the Civil War, the Lincoln Administration suspended habeas corpus in the North to protect troop transport lines and enable the arrest of civilians as \"prisoners of state.\" This was done to address the war and internal security issues, proclaiming martial law for rebels, insurgents, and their supporters. During the Civil War, the Lincoln Administration suspended habeas corpus in the North to protect troop transport lines and enable the arrest of civilians as \"prisoners of state.\" President Lincoln reiterated that habeas corpus was suspended for \"prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy\" in military custody. The Supreme Court's decision in Ex parte Milligan cast doubt on the Lincoln Administration's approach to internal security. In 1866, the Court addressed whether a citizen of Indiana could be tried by military commission for alleged involvement in a group planning sabotage against the North. During the Civil War, the Lincoln Administration suspended habeas corpus in the North to protect troop transport lines and enable the arrest of civilians as \"prisoners of state.\" President Lincoln reiterated that habeas corpus was suspended for \"prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy\" in military custody. The Supreme Court's decision in Ex parte Milligan cast doubt on the Lincoln Administration's approach to internal security. In 1866, the Court addressed whether a citizen of Indiana could be tried by military commission for alleged involvement in a group planning sabotage against the North. The Court recognized military commission jurisdiction over violations of the \"laws and usages of war,\" but stated those laws and usages cannot be applied to citizens in states where the courts are open and their process unobstructed. During the Civil War, the Lincoln Administration suspended habeas corpus in the North to protect troop transport lines and enable the arrest of civilians as \"prisoners of state.\" President Lincoln reiterated that habeas corpus was suspended for \"prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy\" in military custody. The Supreme Court's decision in Ex parte Milligan cast doubt on the Lincoln Administration's approach to internal security. In 1866, the Court addressed whether a citizen of Indiana could be tried by military commission for alleged involvement in a group planning sabotage against the North. The Court recognized military commission jurisdiction over violations of the \"laws and usages of war,\" but stated those laws and usages cannot be applied to citizens in states where the courts are open and their process unobstructed. The government argued that Milligan could be held as a prisoner of war, excluded from the privileges of habeas corpus, and tried for his crimes under the acts of Congress. Milligan, however, argued that he had no belligerent rights and could not be held as a prisoner of war. The Court questioned Milligan's status as a prisoner of war, stating that since he had not engaged in legal acts of hostility against the government, he could not enjoy the immunities of a prisoner of war. Milligan argued that he had no belligerent rights and could not be held as a prisoner of war. The Supreme Court upheld damages awarded to Madison Y. Johnson for being confined without charge under military authority during the Civil War. In a similar case in 1909, the Court declined to grant relief to a plaintiff detained without charge during a miners' strike, stating that such arrests are permissible during insurrections. The Supreme Court upheld damages awarded to Madison Y. Johnson for being confined without charge under military authority during the Civil War. In a similar case in 1909, the Court declined to grant relief to a plaintiff detained without charge during a miners' strike, stating that such arrests are permissible during insurrections. The Court emphasized the governor's authority to make arrests in good faith to prevent insurrections, noting that these arrests are precautionary measures and not necessarily for punishment. The Supreme Court upheld damages awarded to Madison Y. Johnson for being confined without charge under military authority during the Civil War. The Court clarified that the governor's judgment in making arrests during insurrections is not subject to revision by a jury unless there are allegations of dishonesty or unnecessary detention after the threat has passed. The Court's holding may be limited to situations of martial law where deadly force is authorized, emphasizing the substitution of executive process for judicial process in times of public danger. The Supreme Court upheld damages awarded to Madison Y. Johnson for being confined without charge under military authority during the Civil War. The Court clarified that the governor's judgment in making arrests during insurrections is not subject to revision by a jury unless there are allegations of dishonesty or unnecessary detention after the threat has passed. It may also be argued that temporary detention during a public emergency is permissible, as seen in the Moyer case. The Alien Enemy Act grants the President broad authority during war to institute restrictions affecting alien enemies, including detention and deportation. President Wilson issued a Proclamation under the Act during World War I, warning alien enemies against violations of the law or hostilities against the United States. Damages for wrongful detention by the President's order may not be available, as seen in some court decisions. The government defended the constitutionality of the Alien Enemy Act as necessary for national security during war, citing the power of Congress to declare war and make rules concerning captures. The President reported instances of improper activities by German officials in the US before the declaration of war. The statute did not require a hearing prior to internment, according to the government's argument. The Alien Enemy Act did not require a hearing before internment, as the President had the power to act based on suspicion to prevent harm during war. Regulations under the act applied to alien enemies deemed a threat to the state. Alien enemies could challenge their status through habeas corpus petitions. Two enemy spies were arrested in the US, including Pablo Waberski sent by the Germans. Pablo Waberski, a German spy posing as a Russian national, was arrested by U.S. secret agents for planning to \"blow things up in the United States.\" There was a dispute over whether he should be tried by a military tribunal, but it was eventually resolved through compromise. Waberski, whose real name was Lothar Witzke, was an officer in the German armed forces. Waberski, a German spy posing as a Russian national, was sentenced to death by a military commission but later had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment by President Wilson. The decision was influenced by doubts about the military tribunal's jurisdiction over the accused spy. In United States ex rel. Wessels v. McDonald, Herman Wessels challenged his detention by military authorities for spying using a forged Swiss passport in New York City. The court affirmed jurisdiction by court martial, stating that spying was not technically a crime under international law. The court affirmed jurisdiction by court martial for spying, stating it was not a crime under international law. Two American citizens accused of espionage with Wessels were acquitted of treason in federal court. In 1918, a bill was introduced for trial by court-martial of non-military persons accused of espionage or sabotage. The bill introduced in 1918 proposed trial by court-martial for non-military persons involved in espionage or sabotage. Attorney General T.W. Gregory provided statistics on war-related arrests and convictions, stating that the numbers did not raise concern. The Attorney General stated that the numbers of war-related arrests and convictions did not raise concern. He emphasized that trying civilians for offenses outside of military territory by court-martial would be unconstitutional. The President issued a proclamation after the capture of eight Nazi saboteurs, but there was no mention of detaining suspects without trial. The President issued a proclamation declaring that enemies who entered the US for hostile acts should be tried in accordance with the law of war. Eight German saboteurs were tried by military commission for entering the US by submarine and conspiring to use explosives on war industries. The Supreme Court denied their writs of habeas corpus, upholding their right to petition for the writ and finding trial by commission authorized by statute. The Supreme Court upheld the military commission's authority to try German saboteurs, finding it authorized by statute and not in violation of the Constitution. The Court determined that the saboteurs' citizenship was irrelevant in defining them as \"enemy belligerents\" under the law of war. The decision was based on international common law of war and the President's proclamation regarding individuals from nations at war with the US committing hostile acts on US soil. The Supreme Court upheld the military commission's authority to try German saboteurs as \"enemy belligerents\" under the law of war. The Court distinguished between lawful and unlawful combatants, stating that unlawful combatants are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals. The Supreme Court upheld the military commission's authority to try German saboteurs as \"enemy belligerents\" under the law of war, distinguishing between lawful and unlawful combatants. The Court recognized the petitioners as unlawful combatants and limited its opinion to the specific case at hand. The Supreme Court upheld the military commission's authority to try German saboteurs as \"enemy belligerents\" under the law of war. The Quirin Court distinguished its holding from Milligan, finding that the petitioners were enemy belligerents and that the charge constituted an offense against the law of war. The Court did not intend to overrule Milligan, but the distinction between the two cases may seem puzzling to those familiar with Civil War history. The Quirin Court upheld the military commission's authority to try German saboteurs as \"enemy belligerents\" under the law of war, distinguishing its holding from Milligan. The Court noted that Milligan was not a lawful combatant belonging to Confederate forces, unlike the petitioners in Quirin who were considered enemy belligerents. The key distinction lies in the concept of war versus insurrection, where Milligan's activities were not legal acts of hostility due to his civilian status. The Quirin Court's opinion, in conjunction with Milligan, focuses on the legal nature of acts based on the petitioner's association with a legitimate belligerent party rather than the acts themselves. Membership in the Sons of Liberty did not legitimize Milligan as a belligerent, nor did it give the government the right to detain him as a prisoner of war. The Sons of Liberty did not qualify as a belligerent under the law of war, despite alleged hostile acts on behalf of the Confederacy. The Quirin Court referenced Civil War cases where enemy belligerents were tried for hostile acts in the North, emphasizing the defendant's status in each case. The Quirin Court's opinion focused on the legal nature of acts based on the petitioner's association with a legitimate belligerent party. The Court emphasized the defendant's status in cases involving enemy belligerents tried for hostile acts in the North, highlighting the nature and status of the enemy forces. The important distinction in Quirin seems to be the nature and status of the enemy forces of which Milligan was allegedly a member. The Quirin Court's opinion focused on the legal nature of acts based on the petitioner's association with a legitimate belligerent party. The Court emphasized the defendant's status in cases involving enemy belligerents tried for hostile acts in the North, highlighting the nature and status of the enemy forces. The important distinction in Quirin seems to be the nature and status of the enemy forces of which Milligan was allegedly a member. The fact that Milligan's membership in an organization with ties to the Confederate government was ruled insufficient to make him a belligerent within the meaning of the law of war might have some bearing on the interpretation of the term \"associated forces\" in the NDAA definition of persons susceptible to detention without trial under the law of war. Another point of distinction was that Milligan had not traveled from enemy territory into friendly territory, while the Quirin petitioners were described as having crossed military lines of defense to enter the country surreptitiously. This apparently stems from the long-standing concept under the law of war that permits the armed forces of a belligerent to punish those who cross defensive lines and act as spies. The validity of Milligan has been questioned by scholars, with some suggesting it only applies to martial law or civil wars. The portion in Milligan stating Congress couldn't authorize the President to detain civilians may have less precedential value. The Hamdi Court emphasized that Milligan was not a prisoner of war, distinguishing it from Quirin based on combatant status. The Hamdi Court found that Milligan did not apply to a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan, emphasizing the distinction based on combatant status. Milligan's status as not a prisoner of war was central to the Court's conclusion. The court in the case In re Territo disagreed with a petitioner who argued that his U.S. citizenship prevented him from being held as a prisoner of war. The court stated that citizenship does not necessarily affect the status of one captured on the battlefield. The court found that citizenship does not prevent individuals captured on the battlefield from being considered enemy belligerents under the Hague Convention. The court found that individuals captured on the battlefield from a country engaged in hostile acts are considered enemy belligerents under the Hague Convention and the law of war. The court did not address the detention of citizens associated with non-enemy armed groups, and the opinions in previous cases may not fully support the detention of U.S. citizens captured within the country as enemy combatants. The Supreme Court has not confirmed the President's power to indefinitely detain individuals accused of being unlawful combatants solely based on association with a non-legitimate belligerent group. Previous cases suggest that U.S. citizenship may not be relevant in the treatment of enemy forces during declared wars. The Hague Convention only applies to conflicts involving belligerents meeting specific qualifications for prisoner of war status. The Hague Convention, later incorporated into the Third Geneva Convention, may not apply to conflicts with Al Qaeda or the Taliban due to their status as non-prisoners of war. President Roosevelt used the Alien Enemy Act during World War II to intern aliens from enemy countries for security reasons. During World War II, the Attorney General established \"prohibited areas\" for aliens of Japanese, Italian, or German descent. The President delegated authority to the Attorney General to create regulations, leading to the Alien Enemy Control Unit reviewing cases of over 2,500 enemy aliens. The program was later extended to cover certain citizens, with military areas designated by the Secretary of War and responsibilities delegated to the Commanding General of the Western Defense Command. Executive Order 9066 amended the policy regarding aliens and restricted areas during World War II. The transfer of authority to the Department of War was significant as it relied on the nation's war powers directly, rather than the Alien Enemy Act. The House Select Committee Investigating National Defense Migration found the shift in authority concerning, as it lacked support in the Alien Enemy Act for citizens. Congressional authorization was deemed necessary for the War Department to exercise authority over U.S. citizens. Congress granted the War Department's request for punishment for violating exclusion orders related to Executive Order 9066. Mass evacuation of persons of Japanese descent from the West Coast led to compulsory internment at relocation centers. Persons of German and Italian descent received loyalty hearings, while the treatment of Japanese descent individuals was more indiscriminate due to the difficulty in distinguishing loyal from disloyal individuals. The Supreme Court limited the internment program for persons of Japanese descent, finding the curfew constitutional as a wartime security measure. The Court emphasized the importance of congressional ratification of the Executive Order and did not review the constitutionality of the exclusion measure. The Court framed the inquiry as a question of equal protection. The Supreme Court upheld the curfew as a wartime security measure for persons of Japanese descent, finding it necessary to meet the threat of sabotage and espionage. Justice Douglas noted that due process considerations did not apply to ensure only disloyal individuals were affected, but raised concerns about citizens not having the opportunity to demonstrate loyalty to be reclassified. In Korematsu, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of an American citizen for violating an exclusion order in a \"Military Area\" off-limits to persons of Japanese descent. The Court validated the treatment of citizens similar to enemy aliens under war powers, avoiding the constitutionality of internment. In Ex parte Endo, the Court found inadequate statutory support for the internment of loyal citizens. The Supreme Court in Ex parte Endo found that the authority to detain loyal American citizens during wartime could not be implied from the power to protect against espionage and sabotage. The Court narrowly interpreted the executive order and congressional ratification to avoid deciding the constitutional issue of the evacuation and internment program. Detention in Relocation Centers was not explicitly authorized, but developed during program implementation. The authority to detain citizens could only be implied from the act and must serve the ends of the program. The Supreme Court in Ex parte Endo found that the authority to detain loyal American citizens during wartime could not be implied from the power to protect against espionage and sabotage. The Court declared its obligation to interpret the wartime measure to allow for the \"greatest possible accommodation between liberties and the exigencies of war,\" assuming Congress intended to place no greater restraint on citizens than indicated by the language used. The Court avoided the question of constitutionality regarding internment based on loyalty or explicit authorization, but suggested a Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process for determining loyalty or dangerousness. The Fifth Amendment would require reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard for detainees, as seen in the case of Homer Wilcox who was excluded from his home despite having no ties to enemy countries. He was eventually removed by military force to Nevada under Executive Order 9066. The exclusion was deemed within the military's authority, leading to a reversal of damages awarded to Wilcox by the district court. The court upheld the military's decision to exclude Wilcox from his home under Executive Order 9066, citing his activities as a potential threat to military security in designated areas. It was found that General De Witt had the authority to use military force to remove Wilcox, despite the act of Congress penalizing violations of military orders. The Japanese internment program has been discredited, convictions for violating orders vacated, victims compensated, but the constitutionality of detaining citizens during war remains unresolved. Courts determined restrictions on citizens of other ethnic backgrounds, sometimes lifting them after hearings. Equal Protection Clause did not require compensation for non-Japanese internees. The constitutionality of detaining citizens during war remains unresolved, with courts requiring specific legislation to validate such measures. Congress ratified Executive Order 9066 with 18 U.S.C. Section 1383, supporting the internment of Japanese-Americans during wartime. The internment of Japanese-American citizens without individualized determination of dangerousness was not authorized by Executive Order 9066 and ratifying legislation. Enemy combatants under Proclamation No. 2561 were only German military members captured after landing on U.S. beaches from submarines. Collaborators and saboteur harbors were tried for treason in federal courts. Hans Haupt's death sentence for treason was overturned due to procedural issues. Hans Haupt was initially sentenced to death for treason, but the sentence was overturned due to procedural violations. He was later sentenced to life imprisonment, which was then commuted on the condition that he leave the country. Another individual, Helmut Leiner, was acquitted of treason but interned as an enemy alien. Anthony Cramer, an American citizen convicted of treason, had his conviction overturned by the Supreme Court. Emil Krepper, a pastor, was indicted for violating TWEA and receiving a salary from the German. During World War II, cases involving collaborators with the Quirin eight and other saboteurs did not result in military determinations of enemy combatant status. The Quirin decision did not establish executive authority to detain individuals based solely on alleged hostile intent without a trial. The Attorney General sought Congressional approval after the Quirin decision. After the Quirin decision, the Attorney General urged Congress to pass legislation strengthening criminal law for internal security during wartime. The proposed War Security Act aimed to address gaps in the penal code for punishing enemy acts on U.S. territory. The House Committee on the Judiciary supported the bill, citing the need for military commissions to try Nazi saboteurs due to legal inadequacies. The bill passed in the House but was not taken up in the Senate. After World War II, Congress focused on the threat of communism and introduced the Internal Security Act of 1950 to combat foreign conspiracy to infiltrate and overthrow the government. The Attorney General proposed legislation to strengthen espionage statutes and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept communications. The Internal Security Act of 1950, also known as the McCarran Act, aimed to combat communism by strengthening espionage statutes and authorizing U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept communications. The legislation included measures to exclude subversive aliens, detain or supervise aliens awaiting deportation, and require Communist-controlled organizations to register. President Truman and opponents of the Act criticized its registration requirements and other provisions. Opponents of the McCarran Act were concerned about its constitutionality and effectiveness, as well as its potential impact on civil liberties. They proposed the Emergency Detention Act (Kilgore bill) as an alternative, allowing preventive incarceration of individuals with suspected subversive ties during a national emergency. Proponents argued that this legislation would address security concerns more effectively. Proponents of the Kilgore bill argued that the proposed legislation would create a program for internment of enemies with procedural safeguards to prevent court invalidation. The final version of the ISA included both the McCarran Act and the Emergency Detention Act. President Truman vetoed the bill, opposing the McCarran Act but not taking a firm stance on the Emergency Detention Act. He expressed concerns that the provisions in the ISA would likely be ineffective without suspending the writ of habeas corpus, raising constitutional questions. The President recommended further study on the matter of preventive detention. The President recommended further study on preventive detention for national security purposes. Congress passed the ISA over the President's veto, authorizing the declaration of an \"Internal Security Emergency\" and the maintenance of internment camps for use during crises. Detainees suspected of engaging in sabotage or espionage were to be taken before a hearing officer within 48 hours of arrest. The Attorney General had to present evidence to determine if a person could be detained as dangerous, including ties to foreign Communist parties or groups seeking overthrow. The Emergency Detention Act, despite no internal emergencies being declared, raised concerns among citizens about potential misuse to detain those with unpopular beliefs. Efforts were made to amend or repeal the act, with the Justice Department supporting its repeal to alleviate fears and suspicions. The Emergency Detention Act was repealed in 1971, replaced by the Non-Detention Act to prevent arbitrary executive authority over citizens. Executive Order 9066 was rescinded in 1976, and Congress repealed 18 U.S.C. Section 1383 the same year. Congress passed the Emergency Detention Act in 1950 based on constitutional war powers for preventive detention during national security emergencies. The Alien Enemy Act does not give the President the power to declare individuals as enemy combatants for detention under the law of war without express congressional authority. The repeal of the Emergency Detention Act and the enactment of the Non-Detention Act prevent the detention of American citizens without charge or trial as enemy agents or traitors. Hamdi establishes that the AUMF authorizes the detention of persons captured during hostilities, including U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court has not elaborated on the scope of detention authority since the Hamdi decision. Cases of Jose Padilla and Ali Saleh al-Marri were sent to the Fourth Circuit for new litigation after the Supreme Court declined to resolve them. Padilla, a U.S. citizen, was initially ordered to be released from military detention by a district judge, suggesting he could be kept in civilian custody if charged with a crime. Padilla's attorneys argued for his release from military detention, citing dissenting Supreme Court Justices and the Non-Detention Act. The government claimed his detention was justified under the AUMF due to his alleged ties to Al Qaeda. The original justification of a \"dirty bomb\" plot was replaced with allegations of attending an Al Qaeda training camp. The judge disagreed with the government's justification for detaining Padilla as an enemy combatant, stating that express authority from Congress was necessary. The district court found that Padilla's detention was prohibited by 18 U.S.C. Section 4001(a). The case was appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where arguments were made comparing it to the Ex parte Milligan case from the Civil War. The government argued that Padilla's case was more similar to the Quirin case. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision to detain Padilla as an enemy combatant, citing his association with the enemy during wartime. The government charged Padilla with conspiracy unrelated to the original allegations, seeking approval for his transfer while deferring to the Supreme Court for a final decision. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision to detain Padilla as an enemy combatant, citing his association with the enemy during wartime. Circuit Judge Luttig rejected the government's application, expressing disappointment at their abrupt decision to abandon the position that national security demanded Padilla's military detention. The government petitioned the Supreme Court to transfer Padilla from military custody to a federal prison for civilian trial. Justice Kennedy cited prudential reasons for declining to hear the case, despite the possibility of Padilla being placed back in military custody. The district court in Florida would be able to act quickly if the government changed Padilla's status. Justice Ginsburg dissented from the denial of certiorari, noting that the government had not retracted its assertion of executive power over Padilla. Padilla was found guilty and sentenced to 17 years and three months in prison, with the government later appealing for a harsher sentence. Judge Floyd agreed with the government in March 2005. In March 2005, Judge Floyd agreed with the government that al-Marri's detention was authorized by the AUMF. The government claimed al-Marri was a sleeper agent for Al Qaeda sent to the US to facilitate terrorist activities. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing the petition based on this information, which al-Marri did not rebut. The district judge upheld the designation of al-Marri as an \"enemy combatant\" despite his capture away from a foreign battlefield. Al-Marri appealed, arguing that the court had jurisdiction and that the Military Commissions Act (MCA) was unconstitutional. The appellate panel found that al-Marri did not meet the statutory definition of an enemy combatant, allowing him to seek habeas relief. The panel then assessed the merits of al-Marri's case. The panel majority found that al-Marri is not an \"enemy combatant\" under Hamdi, and the government can only hold him if charged with a crime, deported, obtained a material witness warrant, or detained under the USA PATRIOT Act. They rejected the government's argument that the AUMF allows the President to order military detention in the US. The government cited Hamdi and Padilla v. Hanft, but the court interpreted Hamdi differently. The court interpreted Hamdi and Padilla cases as confirming that the AUMF authorizes detention of individuals involved in armed conflict against the US in specific circumstances. This is similar to the WWII case Ex parte Quirin where enemy combatants were tried by military commission. The court agreed that German saboteurs could be tried by military commission as enemy belligerents. In contrast, al-Marri's situation was likened to Ex parte Milligan, where a civilian was not subject to military jurisdiction. Enemy combatant status is determined by affiliation with the military arm of an enemy government in an international armed conflict. Judge Hudson dissented, citing the broad language of the AUMF authorizing the President to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks. The Fourth Circuit full bench rejected the earlier panel's decision in favor of the government's position that al-Marri fit the legal definition of \"enemy combatant,\" but also reversed the district court's decision that al-Marri was not entitled to present any more evidence to refute the government's case against him. Four judges argued that the court couldn't expand the definition of \"enemy combatant\" beyond law-of-war principles, but agreed to remand for evidentiary proceedings. Judge Traxler's opinion in the Fourth Circuit case on al-Marri's military detention emphasized the need for the Government to show that normal due process protections are burdensome and that the evidence presented is reliable. He agreed with dissenting judges that the AUMF grants the President power to detain enemy combatants, including those associated with al Qaeda entering the US for hostile acts. Persons associated with al Qaeda traveling to the US for the purpose of engaging in terrorism could be treated as enemy combatants, even if they did not take up arms in a foreign combat zone. Judge Traxler disagreed that al-Marri had been given due process to challenge his designation as an enemy combatant, questioning the use of hearsay evidence to prove combatant status. Judge Traxler disagreed with the relaxed evidentiary standards for proving enemy combatant status, stating that al-Marri, who was detained in the US, is entitled to habeas review and due process protections under the Constitution. The court must consider the circumstances and burdens involved, with Hamdi serving as a guide but not a one-size-fits-all procedure for every alleged enemy combatant. In December 2008, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of the al-Marri ruling, potentially making a definitive pronouncement on the President's authority to detain terrorist suspects. President Obama later instructed a review of al-Marri's detention, leading to criminal charges being brought against him for supporting Al Qaeda. The United States then requested the Supreme Court to dismiss the habeas petition. The Supreme Court granted the government's request to transfer al-Marri from military to civilian custody for his criminal trial after he pled guilty to providing material support to Al Qaeda. The Fourth Circuit's judgment was vacated, and the case was dismissed as moot, no longer serving as binding precedent. Al-Marri was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. The legal authority to detain terrorist suspects in the US has not been definitively settled. Padilla and al-Marri were transferred to civilian custody for trial, clearing all terrorist suspects from military detention in the US. Currently, no one is detained under AUMF authority, but a federal judge issued an injunction in Hedges v. Obama against Section 1021(b)(2) of the 2012 NDAA, which allows detention of individuals who support terrorist groups. The Hedges plaintiffs, including journalist Christopher Hedges, sued the government over a provision in the 2012 NDAA that allowed for military detention without trial of individuals who supported terrorist groups. Hedges stated that his work covering groups like Al Qaeda and the Taliban could potentially subject him to detention under this provision. The Hedges plaintiffs, including journalist Christopher Hedges, sued the government over a provision in the 2012 NDAA that allowed for military detention without trial of individuals who supported terrorist groups. Another journalist, Alexa O'Brien, testified that her reporting on Guantanamo detainees and WikiLeaks disclosures could lead to her detention under Section 1021. Foreign plaintiffs also expressed concerns based on their past activities in support of WikiLeaks, with one noting participation in the release of a leaked video depicting a U.S. Apache helicopter attack on civilians. The Obama Administration argued that Section 1021 of the NDAA does not change detention authority granted by the AUMF. The government claimed that the plaintiffs had no standing to fear imminent detention under Section 1021, as their activities did not result in detention under the AUMF alone. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest rejected this argument. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled that Section 1021 of the NDAA affirms the AUMF without changing detention laws. She highlighted differences in language between the two statutes, making the NDAA appear broader in scope. The court noted that the NDAA language aligns with government filings but emphasized that these filings do not carry the force of law. The court found that the government's filings, while not legally binding, did not clarify the vague language of Section 1021 of the NDAA. Plaintiffs testified about the chilling effect of the statute on their professional activities, with the government unable to define what constitutes \"substantial support\" to Al Qaeda. As a result, the court deemed the plaintiffs' fears reasonable and concluded that the statute needed clarification. The court found the plaintiffs' fears reasonable and concluded that the statute was too vague to satisfy the Fifth Amendment. The government's motion for reconsideration focused on the plaintiffs' standing, stating that \"law of war detention\" does not apply to independent journalistic activities or public advocacy. The court clarified that the injunction was not limited to the named plaintiffs. The court found the provision constitutionally infirm on First Amendment and Due Process Clause grounds, issuing a nationwide permanent injunction in September 2012. The government appealed, and in July 2013, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision due to lack of standing for citizen and noncitizen plaintiffs. The appellate court clarified that the provision does not affect U.S. citizens' detention under the AUMF but has an impact on noncitizens outside the U.S. The court examined the legislative history of Section 1021, particularly paragraph (e), which clarified the AUMF's impact on U.S. citizens and lawful residents. The court did not resolve the issue but emphasized the need to interpret Section 1021 to give effect to all its provisions. The court interpreted Section 1021 as affirming the AUMF's authority and adding new criteria for organizations involved in 9/11. It explained that there were legitimate reasons for Congress to clarify the AUMF in this way, despite differing opinions on the matter. Section 1021(b)(2) clarifies the authority to detain individuals associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and related groups under the AUMF, resolving previous debates. The court clarified the scope of AUMF authority, stating that Section 1021(d) does not expand or limit the President's authority to detain under the AUMF. Section 1021(e) disclaims any statement about existing authority. The President's AUMF authority includes the detention of individuals responsible for 9/11 and those associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or related forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. Section 1021 clarifies detention authority for noncitizens captured abroad, while remaining silent on citizens and lawful residents detained in the US. The court found that American citizens lacked standing to challenge Section 1021, as it pertained to existing laws and authorities. Noncitizens captured abroad could assert First and Fifth Amendment rights under Section 1021(b). The court found that noncitizen plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a law that had not been enforced against them. They must demonstrate a sufficiently imminent chance of enforcement. The government disputed their subjectivity to the statute, while the plaintiffs feared their work for WikiLeaks could indirectly support Al Qaeda. The court vacated the injunction, stating that the plaintiffs failed to show evidence of threatened military detention. They have appealed to the Supreme Court for review. Congress has authority to regulate capture and detention of enemy combatants under Article I of the Constitution. Additional statutory authority has been deemed necessary for domestic detention of non-members of armed forces, even during declared wars. In Ex parte Milligan, the Supreme Court invalidated military detention of a civilian for law of war violations, stating that the law of war does not apply to those not part of armed forces in an international armed conflict. The Milligan Court ruled that Congress cannot authorize military jurisdiction in areas not under martial law. The Court did not object to temporary military detention until a grand jury met. It is unclear if the Court would have rejected a statute suspending habeas corpus for \"aiders and abettors\" of the enemy. The Korematsu decision is often cited for upholding the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII. Ex parte Endo limited its decision to excluding Japanese-Americans from military areas during WWII. It invalidated the detention of a loyal U.S. citizen, leaving open the question of due process for determining loyalty. Congress passed the Emergency Detention Act in 1950, allowing the President to detain individuals likely to engage in espionage or sabotage, but this authority was never used and the act was later repealed. The Emergency Detention Act (EDA) was repealed without being tested for constitutionality in court. Ex parte Quirin suggests that individuals aiding the enemy within the US can be treated as enemy combatants. The evolution of the law of war may apply to conflicts not meeting traditional belligerency requirements, but there is limited evidence of widespread adoption. Supreme Court cases like Quirin reflect a traditional view of international law regarding belligerent status. The individual's belligerent status was determined by his employment in the armed forces of an opposing government. Military force might be permissible only if absolutely necessary, as clarified in the Quirin opinion. The Hamdi Court did not deviate from traditional practices, and the AUMF's domestic impact was not analyzed in that case. The AUMF's domestic impact and the interpretation of Quirin regarding belligerent status and military commissions have raised questions about civil liberties during war. Congressional activity suggests that authorization to use military force does not imply the authority to detain individuals in the U.S. without trial. The AUMF's authorization for the use of military force does not automatically allow for the detention of individuals in the U.S. without trial. Congress has not explicitly clarified the extent of detention authority under the AUMF, including whether it applies to U.S. citizens within the country. The 2012 NDAA affirmed detention authority under the AUMF but did not address the detention of U.S. citizens specifically. If a U.S. citizen is detained in military custody, a court will need to determine Congress's intent. The NDAA detention provisions may require a court to determine Congress's intent regarding detention authority under the AUMF, especially in cases involving U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court has not explicitly upheld the detention of citizens during war, but may defer to congressional findings on the necessity of restrictions for national security. The NDAA detention provisions may require court interpretation for clarity on detention authority under the AUMF, particularly for U.S. citizens. Various bills in the 112th Congress aimed to amend detainee provisions in the 2012 NDAA. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on banning indefinite detention of Americans, but no Obama Administration officials testified. The House and Senate passed versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 addressing detention of U.S. persons. P.L. 112-239 was enacted into law on January 2, 2013, with detainee measures largely adopted from the House version. The Senate's measure to clarify detention of U.S. citizens was eliminated from the final bill. An amendment to remove military detention as an optional \"disposition under the law of war\" for persons in the United States was proposed during House debates but failed to pass. Section 1029 of P.L. 112-239 adopted a modified version of the House provision on habeas corpus rights, ensuring the availability of the writ of habeas corpus and Constitutional rights in court for individuals in the U.S. The original House provision would have covered only lawfully present individuals, but the floor amendment expanded this to include all persons inside the U.S. detained under the AUMF. The 2013 NDAA does not clarify which U.S. persons can be detained under the AUMF. Ambiguity remains, but access to habeas corpus for those detained in the U.S. under the AUMF is assured. The House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2014, containing a provision for habeas relief for U.S. citizens detained under the AUMF. The government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the citizen is an enemy belligerent. This standard is higher than that applied by the D.C. Circuit courts. The 2014 NDAA included a provision for habeas relief for U.S. citizens detained under the AUMF, requiring the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the citizen is an enemy belligerent. This standard is higher than that applied by the D.C. Circuit courts. H.R. 2325 and S. 1147 propose amendments to the 2012 NDAA to ensure prompt disposition under the law of war for covered persons detained within the U.S. under AUMF authority, with transfer for trial and proceedings by a federal or state court in accordance with due process. The 2014 NDAA included a provision for habeas relief for U.S. citizens detained under the AUMF, requiring the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the citizen is an enemy belligerent. H.R. 2325 and S. 1147 propose amendments to the 2012 NDAA to ensure prompt disposition under the law of war for covered persons detained within the U.S. under AUMF authority, with transfer for trial and proceedings by a federal or state court in accordance with due process. The bills would also prohibit the transfer of any person detained in the United States into military custody, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. President Obama stated that his Administration does not intend to detain indefinitely U.S. citizens under the 2012 NDAA, but the Supreme Court may still address issues related to \"enemy combatants\" and preventive detention. Lower courts have not reached a consensus on Congress's authority in this matter. The Supreme Court has not clarified Congress's authorization for detaining U.S. persons as \"enemy combatants.\" The Guantanamo cases may set a legal precedent for detaining similar persons within the U.S. under the law of war. Historical precedent and the AUMF's authority for detaining U.S. persons are still debated. Congress has the authority to permit detention of civilians without trial based on national security risk, but an authorization to use force may not automatically confer this power."
