    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Trade in Meat and Pork Products Act of 1997\". Congress finds that the European Union's Third Country Meat Directive has led to the decertification of over 400 US facilities exporting beef and pork to the EU, resulting in a loss of $60 million annually for the US pork industry. Investigations were initiated in 1987 and 1990 under the Trade Act of 1974 in response to these decertifications. The United States Trade Representative investigated the European Union's administration of the Third Country Meat Directive under the Trade Act of 1974. It was found to burden and restrict US commerce. Bilateral talks led to an agreement that both US and EU meat inspection systems provide equivalent public health safeguards. The United States and the European Union reached an agreement on meat inspection systems to ensure equivalent public health safeguards. The US terminated an investigation under section 301, stating that the practices would have been actionable without the agreement. US meat producers have shown interest in exporting to the EU and made investments to comply with the agreement. The EU has not acknowledged changes in US plant safety and inspection procedures. The European Union has failed to inspect and relist US producers who meet the required standards, violating commitments made in the Exchange of Letters and GATT 1994. Meat inspection procedures in the US are deemed equivalent to EU standards, but the EU has not recognized this. The US Trade Representative must take action under section 301(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 when a foreign country fails to implement international trade measures satisfactorily. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as Exchange of Letters, GATT 1994, Third Country Meat Directive, and Community Third Country Directive related to trade agreements between the United States and the European Union. The Act defines key terms related to trade agreements between the United States and the European Union, including the WTO Agreement entered into on April 15, 1994. The United States Trade Representative must determine if the European Union has failed to meet its obligations under certain agreements within 30 days of this Act's enactment. If a failure is found, the Trade Representative will initiate dispute settlement procedures. The United States Trade Representative will request the Secretary of Agriculture to direct the Food Safety and Inspection Service to review certifications for European Union facilities importing meat and agricultural products if the EU fails to meet its obligations. This review is separate from the USTR's authority to take actions under the Trade Act of 1974."
