    "content": "The Act titled \"All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013\" mandates energy performance requirements for federal buildings. The \"All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013\" mandates energy performance requirements for federal buildings, requiring agencies to apply energy conservation measures and improve design to reduce energy consumption per square foot from 2006 to 2020 compared to 2003 levels. From 2006 to 2016, there was a gradual increase in energy reduction percentages for federal buildings, starting at 2% in 2006 and reaching 33% in 2016. In 2016, federal buildings achieved a 33% energy reduction. An agency can exclude buildings with energy-intensive activities from energy reduction requirements. Each agency must report excluded buildings under this provision. The Secretary will review energy performance requirements by December 31, 2016, and may amend requirements for fiscal years 2018 through 2025 based on cost-benefit analysis and public input. In subsection (f)(3), amendments are made to subsection (f) regarding ongoing commissioning to ensure continuous optimum performance of a facility over its useful life. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act introduces requirements for energy management systems and certification of facilities according to ISO standard 50001. Amendments include evaluations for energy and water efficiency, with ongoing commissioning for optimal facility performance. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 mandates energy managers to conduct comprehensive energy and water evaluations for 25% of agency facilities annually, ensuring each facility is evaluated at least once every 4 years. Exceptions apply to facilities that have had evaluations within the previous 8 years. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 requires energy managers to conduct regular evaluations for agency facilities, with exceptions for recently evaluated or commissioned buildings. Facilities must meet specific criteria, including benchmarking and achieving energy savings targets. The Act requires energy managers to conduct regular evaluations for agency facilities to meet energy savings targets, with exceptions for recently evaluated or commissioned buildings. Energy managers must implement energy and water efficiency measures identified in evaluations within 2 years if they are cost-effective. They can combine multiple measures into projects and must explain reasons for not implementing certain measures in the certification system. The Secretary must provide a summary report on the information tracked by agencies regarding cost-effective measures not implemented within 2 years. SEC. 3. Federal building energy efficiency performance standards and certification system for green buildings. (a) Definitions.--Section 303 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act is amended to include a definition of \"major renovation\" as a modification of building energy systems extensive enough for the whole building to meet energy standards for new buildings. \n(b) Federal Building Efficiency Standards.--Section 305 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act is amended to specify requirements for federal building efficiency standards. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 mandates the establishment of revised federal building energy efficiency performance standards within a year of enactment. The standards will align with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 or the International Energy Conservation Code revisions. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 requires new Federal buildings to meet the latest International Energy Conservation Code for residential buildings or ASHRAE Standard 90.1 for commercial buildings to improve energy efficiency. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 mandates that new Federal buildings must adhere to the latest energy provisions of state and local building codes if they are more stringent than the International Energy Conservation Code or ASHRAE Standard 90.1, unless proven not cost-effective for new or renovated Federal buildings. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 requires new Federal buildings to meet energy consumption levels at least 30 percent below ASHRAE Standard or International Energy Conservation Code, with sustainable design principles applied to siting and design. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 mandates that new Federal buildings must meet energy consumption levels 30 percent below ASHRAE Standard or International Energy Conservation Code, with sustainable design principles applied to siting, design, and construction. Water conservation technologies should be used for energy efficiency, and at least 30 percent of hot water demand in new Federal buildings should be met with cost-effective technologies. The All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013 mandates new Federal buildings to meet energy consumption levels 30 percent below ASHRAE Standard or International Energy Conservation Code, with sustainable design principles applied. The Act also requires that at least 30 percent of hot water demand in new Federal buildings be met with cost-effective technologies, such as solar hot water heaters. The text chunk discusses amendments to the All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013, specifically regarding certification for green buildings and various modifications to clauses within the Act. The text chunk includes amendments to the All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013, focusing on certification for green buildings and modifications to clauses within the Act related to internal certification processes and privatized military housing. The text chunk proposes amendments to the All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013, specifically focusing on alternative certification systems for green buildings and adjustments to clauses related to internal certification processes and privatized military housing. The proposed amendment involves periodic reviews every 5 years of Federal building energy standards to potentially upgrade them with new energy efficiency and renewable energy measures."
