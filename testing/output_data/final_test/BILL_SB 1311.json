    "title": "SB 1311",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1808.4 of the Vehicle Code is amended to make the home address of certain individuals confidential upon request. This includes the Attorney General, State Public Defender, Members of the Legislature, judges, district attorneys, public defenders, and certain attorneys and police dispatchers. Certain individuals, including nonsworn police dispatchers, child abuse investigators, peace officers, employees of correctional facilities, and county counsels assigned to child abuse cases, have their home addresses kept confidential upon request. (14) County counsel assigned to child abuse cases, investigators from Department of Justice, district attorneys, public defenders, city council members, board of supervisors, federal prosecutors, criminal investigators, National Park Service Rangers, city enforcement officers enforcing Vehicle Code or parking ordinances, trial court employees, psychiatric social workers, police or sheriff department employees designated by chief of police or sheriff as sensitive positions. State employees in specific classifications, spouses or children of certain individuals, and surviving spouses or children of peace officers who died in the line of duty are eligible for certain benefits. Restrictions apply if the individual listed has been convicted of a crime and is on active parole or probation. The department will discontinue keeping a home address confidential for a person's spouse or child if they are convicted of a felony in California or a felony-equivalent offense in another jurisdiction. The employer or department is not required to verify this information. The department must disclose a person's home address if their spouse or child is convicted of a felony, as required by law. The address can only be disclosed to specific entities like a court, law enforcement agency, or attorney with a court-approved subpoena. Following termination of office or employment, a confidential home address shall be withheld from public inspection for three years, unless the termination is due to a criminal conviction. If the termination is a result of a criminal complaint, the address will remain confidential during the appeal process and until it is exhausted. Upon reinstatement, the protections of this section apply. (3) A retired peace officer can request permanent confidentiality for their home address, while the home address of a surviving spouse or child of a peace officer is confidential for three years after the officer's death. (4) The department must disclose the agency or court where the individual works when someone requests a confidential home address. A violation of disclosing the confidential home address of a peace officer or their family members, resulting in bodily harm, is a felony."
