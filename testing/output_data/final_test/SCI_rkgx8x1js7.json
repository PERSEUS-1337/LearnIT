The challenge lies in inferring joint representations that can process information from these modalities. A new method is proposed in this paper to learn robust joint representations by translating between modalities, utilizing the success of sequence to sequence models in machine translation. This approach allows for learning joint representations using only the source modality as input. The paper proposes a method for multimodal sentiment analysis by translating between modalities to learn robust joint representations using only the source modality as input. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on sentiment analysis datasets and maintains robustness to perturbations or missing target modalities. Multimodal sentiment analysis involves using machine learning methods to learn joint representations from behavioral cues in visual and acoustic modalities, in addition to text-based analysis. This extends traditional sentiment analysis to a multimodal setup, with the creation of multimodal datasets and deep multimodal models. The Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network model (MCTN) aims to learn robust joint multimodal representations by translating between language, visual, and acoustic modalities. This approach addresses the sensitivity of joint representations to noisy or missing modalities at test time, drawing inspiration from sequence to sequence models for unsupervised representation learning. The Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN) utilizes cyclic translation to capture joint information between source and target modalities. It includes a hierarchical model for learning joint representations and is trainable end-to-end with a coupled translation-prediction loss. MCTN only requires data from the source modality once trained with paired multimodal data. The Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN) is robust to test-time perturbations and missing modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results in multimodal sentiment analysis. It learns discriminative joint representations with more input modalities while maintaining robustness. Sentiment analysis has evolved from focusing on written text to incorporating multiple modalities for joint representation learning. Several neural models have been proposed to learn joint representations of multiple modalities, including a multistage approach to hierarchical multimodal representations and methods based on Cartesian-products to model interactions. Generative methods using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have also been utilized to learn joint distributions between modalities and translate one modality to another. Generative-discriminative objectives have been employed to learn joint or factorized representations. Our work considers sequential dependency in modality translations and explores the impact of cyclic translation loss. Progress has been made in handling noisy or missing modalities at test time, with methods such as Deep Boltzmann Machines and Restricted Boltzmann Machines used for joint distribution modeling and inference of missing modalities. Training with missing or noisy modalities can enhance the robustness of joint representations. Our approach focuses on learning joint multimodal representations through modality translations. A multimodal dataset includes data from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. The data is synchronized by aligning inputs based on word boundaries and zero-padding segments to obtain time-series data of the same length. Each segment is represented by words and their lengths. The approach focuses on learning joint multimodal representations through modality translations. It involves aligning inputs based on word boundaries and zero-padding segments to obtain synchronized data. A parametrized function is learned to create a joint representation between two modalities, followed by predicting labels using another function during training and testing. The Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN) learns joint representations through modality translations. It uses a cycle consistency loss to ensure maximal information retention from all modalities. The model predicts sentiment based on the joint representation obtained via cyclic translation between source and target modalities. The Multimodal Cyclic Translation Network (MCTN) utilizes cycle consistency loss for modality translation, resembling back-translation. It decomposes function f \u03b8 into encoder and decoder parts to learn joint representations through Seq2Seq models with attention. The Seq2Seq model with attention translates source modality X S to target modality X T using encoder and decoder networks parametrized as RNNs. The encoder maps X S to an embedded representation E S\u2192T, while the decoder maps E S\u2192T to X T by decoding each token at a time based on previous tokens. MCTN accepts variable-length inputs for X S and X T. The MCTN model accepts variable-length inputs of X S and X T, maximizing the translational condition probability. Beam search is used for decoding, and a recurrent neural network is employed for prediction using joint representations. Training involves paired multimodal data and labels, evaluating forward translation and cycle consistency losses with suitable loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE). The MCTN model is trained using paired multimodal data and labels, minimizing prediction and translation losses with suitable loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Inference at test time only requires the source modality X S, as the encoder has been trained to capture information from both source and target modalities in a joint representation. The MCTN model learns to predict target modalities through joint representations obtained via cyclic translations. It is trained with a coupled translation-prediction objective and extends hierarchically to learn joint representations from multiple modalities. At test time, only the source modality X S is needed. The hierarchical MCTN model learns joint representations through cyclic translations between modalities. It uses Seq2Seq models for translation and a recurrent neural network for sentiment prediction. Training involves computing a cycle between modalities. The hierarchical MCTN model learns joint representations through cyclic translations between modalities using Seq2Seq models and a recurrent neural network. Training involves computing a cycle consistent loss for modality T1. The final objective for MCTN is defined by DISPLAYFORM4. The model is robust to noise or missing target modalities and requires only a single source modality at test time. Experimental methodology is described for evaluating the joint representations learned by MCTN using the CMU-MOSI dataset with sentiment labels ranging from -3 to +3. The CMU-MOSI dataset is used for sentiment analysis, with a state-of-the-art binary accuracy of 78.4%. Experiments are also conducted on the ICT-MMMO and YouTube datasets. Various features are extracted for language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Forced alignment is performed to obtain word utterance times, and modalities are aligned over each word utterance interval. The section discusses research questions and presents experimental results. The experimental results show that adding more modalities improves performance in learning joint representations. Using language as the source modality consistently leads to the best performance. Visual inspection of the joint representations learned from MCTN reveals that little information is lost when adding more modalities. The t-SNE algorithm BID58 is used to separate video segments based on positive or negative sentiment. Joint representations become more separable with additional modalities in MCTN, leading to increased discriminative performance. Ablation studies test design decisions in MCTN, including cyclic translations, shared Seq2Seq models, modality ordering, and hierarchical structure. Different ablation models for bimodal MCTN are proposed in FIG6. The ablation models for trimodal MCTN in FIG6 include hierarchical MCTN, translation from X S to X T1 without cyclic translations, two independent translations between X S and X T1, and direct translation of [X S , X T1 ] into X T2. Results in TAB4 show that cyclic translations in the model (a) outperform other baselines, similar to hierarchical MCTN in FIG6 (e). The use of cyclic translations in hierarchical MCTN outperforms trimodal baselines, emphasizing the importance of symmetry and information retention in joint representations. Using one Seq2Seq model with shared parameters is more effective than using two separate models, as it requires less data and reduces the risk of overfitting. The impact of varying source and target modalities for cyclic translations in hierarchical MCTN shows that language is the most important modality for multimodal sentiment analysis. Combining language with visual yields better results than combining language with audio. Translating between visual and acoustic modalities alone decreases performance. Adding language as a target modality for hierarchical MCTN does not significantly improve results. Language should be used as the source modality during translations. The hierarchical MCTN utilizes two levels of modality translations, which are shown to be important for representation learning. The paper focuses on learning joint representations through cyclic modality translations from source to target modalities, emphasizing the use of two translations between a single pair of modalities for easier representation learning. The model remains robust during testing by only requiring the source modality for prediction. Our model utilizes cyclic translations and seq2seq models for learning joint multimodal representations, achieving state-of-the-art results on three datasets. It maintains robustness to all target modalities and presents future work areas such as combining with transformer architecture for modality translations, exploring pretrained deep language models for translations, and extending to other multimodal tasks. Additional details on feature extraction for language, visual, and acoustic modalities are provided. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets by learning joint multimodal representations using cyclic translations and seq2seq models. Feature extraction for language, visual, and acoustic modalities includes Glove word embeddings for language, Facet for visual features, and COVAREP for acoustic features. The study aligns visual, audio, and language features using forced alignment to analyze variations in tone of voice. By utilizing different models, including EF-SLSTM and EF-BLSTM, the model achieves state-of-the-art results in multimodal sentiment analysis on the CMU-MOSI dataset. The study achieves state-of-the-art results in multimodal sentiment analysis on the CMU-MOSI dataset, with impressive results on the ICT-MMMO and YouTube datasets as well. The MCTN model only uses the language modality during testing, outperforming baseline models that utilize all three modalities."
