    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reasonable Search Standards Act\". During fiscal years 1997 and 1998, 140 million people entered the US on international flights. Customs personnel searched 102,000 passengers, with 95% pat-downs, 4% strip searches, and 1% x-ray exams. Certain races and genders were more likely to undergo intrusive searches, but not always found with contraband. African-American men and women, as well as Hispanic men and women, were disproportionately subjected to x-ray exams compared to white Americans, despite similar rates of contraband findings. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Customs Service personnel\" refers to employees responsible for inspecting people entering the US. \"Intrusive nonroutine search\" includes actions like removing clothing or using medical x-rays to detect contraband on a person. The curr_chunk discusses various methods of conducting searches on individuals, including using x-ray technology to detect merchandise on or within the body, body cavity searches, requiring individuals to take laxatives, monitored bowel movements, surgical procedures, and pat down searches involving physical contact with a person's body. The curr_chunk defines \"profiling\" as the identification of individuals for inspection, search, interview, or examination based on race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. Customs Service personnel are prohibited from profiling travelers based on race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation, except when specific information links a traveler to illegal activity. Additionally, there are other requirements related to searches. Customs Service personnel must document reasons before conducting pat down or intrusive nonroutine searches, except when suspecting a weapon. The Commissioner of Customs mandates periodic training for personnel on passenger identification, detention, and search procedures, emphasizing the prohibition of profiling. Training includes reviewing reasons for searches, search results, and criteria effectiveness. The Commissioner of Customs conducts an annual study on detentions and searches by Customs Service personnel, including the number of searches, demographics of travelers searched, types of searches, and results. A report is submitted to Congress by March 31 each year. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal year 2002 and beyond to carry out the Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
