    "content": "The Act is titled the \"21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007\". Congress finds that millions of children in the US are unsupervised after school, with many lacking access to after school programs. These programs have shown to improve academic performance and student behavior. After school programs benefit children by improving academic performance, homework completion, and class participation. Research shows that participation in these programs leads to better school attendance, higher likelihood of staying in school, and better preparation for college and careers. Additionally, communities with after school programs experience reduced vandalism and juvenile crime. These programs also help working families by reducing stress and absenteeism related to after school care arrangements, which can cost employers up to $1,984 per employee per year. After school programs funded by 21st Century Community Learning Centers offer STEM activities, improving students' skills and interest in science careers. Evaluations show increased proficiency in reading, writing, and science, with children more likely to engage in science activities for fun. Data from 73 studies support the positive impact of after school programs on students. After school programs with evidence-based approaches improve students' personal, social, and academic skills, as well as self-esteem. Teens who do not participate in these programs are more likely to skip classes, use drugs, alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and engage in sexual activity. Self-care and boredom can increase the likelihood of drug and alcohol experimentation by 50 percent. After school programs help reduce obesity rates in school-age children by providing opportunities for sports and fitness activities. These programs also improve nutrition education and physical activity, addressing the low consumption of fruits and vegetables among youth. After school programs offer service learning opportunities for children and youth, integrating student-designed projects addressing community needs with academic studies. These projects enhance student engagement, academic achievement, and workforce skills like leadership, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication. SEC. 3. REFERENCES.
