    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North Korea Sanctions Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to North Korea. Congress finds that North Korean negotiators did not act in good faith by refusing a transparent verification process for denuclearization. Reports suggest North Korea has supported Iran in missile technology and nuclear development, as well as provided training to Hezbollah and Hamas for attacks on Israel. North Korea assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor destroyed by Israel. North Korean negotiators refuse to address the abduction of civilians from Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Defectors reported the torture and murder of Reverend Kim Dong-shik in North Korea. Congress has expressed its view that US nonhumanitarian assistance to North Korea should be contingent on human rights improvements, release of abductees, family reunification, reform of labor camps, and decriminalization of political expression, none of which has occurred. The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 acknowledges the deplorable human rights conditions in North Korea and the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. Congress has determined that any missile test by North Korea would violate UN Security Council resolutions. The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 acknowledges the deplorable human rights conditions in North Korea and the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. Congress has determined that any missile test by North Korea would violate UN Security Council resolutions. Activities related to North Korea's ballistic missile program must re-establish pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on missile launching, with resulting sanctions imposed under resolution 1718 coming into full effect following a missile test or launch. A return to the Six-Party diplomatic process by North Korea after a missile test or launch must include a commitment to dismantling all nuclear programs. Japanese press reports suggest a delegation of Iranian missile experts visiting North Korea. A delegation of around fifteen Iranian missile experts arrived in North Korea in March 2009 to assist with a rocket launch. They included senior officials from the Iranian rocket and satellite producer Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, carrying a letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il emphasizing cooperation on space technology. North Korea was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. The Secretary of State designates North Korea as a country supporting terrorism under various acts, but the President can waive this if North Korea discloses its nuclear program and refrains from illegal technology transfers. The government of a country designated as supporting terrorism must fully disclose all proliferation activities in the past 10 years and refrain from engaging in certain activities like training in combat operations or tunneling. The government of a country designated as supporting terrorism must refrain from activities like training in combat operations or tunneling, or supporting organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Japanese Red Army. The government has released detained journalists and returned remains of a permanent resident for proper burial. They have also released abduction victims recognized by Japan and South Korea. North Korea has released surviving South Korean POWs and other POWs from the Korean War held against their will since 1953. They have allowed visits to their penal system and concentration camps by the Red Cross. Access by UNHCR representatives to forcibly repatriated refugees has been granted, and threats of terrorist acts have ceased. North Korea has stopped threatening terrorist acts and has assured the Government will not sponsor terrorism again. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 is amended to state the policy of the United States on human rights in North Korea. Congress believes that the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea should be present at all negotiations between the US and North Korea."
