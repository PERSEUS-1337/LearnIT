    "content": "Most distributed machine learning systems store model parameters locally on each machine to minimize network communication. Staleness of these copies can impact learning efficiency, but controlling it in complex environments is challenging. This study explores the convergence behaviors of ML models under delayed updates, revealing diverse effects on algorithm convergence. Empirical findings lead to a new convergence analysis of SGD in non-convex optimization under staleness, achieving a convergence rate of O(1/\\sqrt{T}). The text discusses optimization under staleness in distributed machine learning systems, comparing synchronous and non-synchronous execution. Different studies show conflicting results on whether synchronous or non-synchronous training is more effective in terms of convergence speed. Some argue that asynchronous systems achieve high scalability and model quality, while others claim that synchronous training converges faster. Various algorithms are shown to scale effectively under non-synchronous settings, but there are significant penalties from using asynchrony. The disagreement between synchronous and non-synchronous execution in distributed machine learning systems centers on the trade-off between statistical efficiency and system throughput. Non-synchronous systems can improve throughput by reducing synchronization overheads, but they may exhibit lower statistical efficiency due to workers using outdated model versions. Understanding how these factors trade off during execution is challenging because they are interconnected. In distributed environments, a trade-off exists between statistical efficiency and system throughput. Non-synchronous executions can be non-deterministic and difficult to profile. Staleness in distributed deep learning has varying effects on convergence, with some algorithms being insensitive to staleness. By controlling staleness, the distributed execution can be decoupled from machine learning convergence outcomes. The focus is on commonly used algorithms in large-scale optimization. In distributed environments, the trade-off between statistical efficiency and system throughput is crucial. Non-synchronous execution, with theoretical underpinnings, is studied for algorithms that support data parallelism in distributed machine learning. Six ML models are analyzed, focusing on optimization, sampling, and black box variational inference. The simulation model includes a random delay for updates between worker caches. The algorithms do not necessarily meet all assumptions in their analyses. In our study, we analyze ML models with optimization hyperparameters and learning rates. CNNs are used for large-scale training, both synchronously and non-synchronously. Residual networks with multiple weight layers are considered, with groups of residual blocks and global pooling layers. Model quality is measured using test accuracy. DNNs are neural networks with fully connected layers. Data augmentation is omitted in experiments. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consist of fully connected layers with 1 to 6 hidden layers and 256 neurons each, using ReLU for nonlinearity. Multiclass Logistic Regression (MLR) is a special case of DNN with 0 hidden layers. Matrix factorization (MF) is used in recommender systems to factorize a partially filled matrix D into two factor matrices L and R. Optimization is done via SGD with a 2-penalized problem. Model quality is measured using test accuracy. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) are unsupervised methods used to uncover hidden semantics and optimize model quality. LDA has been successfully scaled under non-synchronous execution, while VAE is commonly optimized using black box variational inference. DNNs with 1-3 layers are used as encoders and decoders in VAE, with model quality measured by test loss. The text discusses the impact of staleness on machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the slowdown in convergence. Different batch sizes and staleness levels are studied for various models like CNNs, DNNs, MLR, VAEs, MF, and LDA. The experiments show the number of batches required to achieve the desired model quality, highlighting the effect of staleness on convergence. The text discusses the impact of staleness on machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the slowdown in convergence. It shows that higher levels of staleness require more batches to reach the desired model quality, with up to 6x more batches needed compared to settings without staleness. Despite the convergence slowdown, desirable models are still reached in most cases. This finding has important implications for distributed ML, as the additional workload from parallelization errors may not be easily compensated by additional computation resources. The impact of staleness on machine learning algorithms shows that deeper networks are more affected by staleness compared to shallower ones. This effect is observed across various optimization schemes and numbers of workers. The additional workload from parallelization errors in distributed execution can be mitigated by higher system throughput, but justifying large resource allocation for distributed implementation may be challenging if the statistical penalty is too high. The impact of staleness on machine learning algorithms is more pronounced in deeper models. Staleness affects the number of batches needed to reach target accuracy, with certain algorithms being more sensitive to it. The complexity of the model can determine the acceptable staleness level in distributed training, suggesting that synchronous training may be more beneficial for complex models. The impact of staleness on machine learning algorithms is more pronounced in deeper models, affecting the number of batches needed to reach target accuracy. Certain algorithms, like Momentum, show higher sensitivity to staleness, while Adagrad appears robust. The choice of optimization algorithms plays a significant role in the success of non-synchronous training for deep neural networks. The number of workers can amplify the impact of staleness, with convergence slowdown being more than twice on 8 workers in the case of MF. The impact of additional workers on convergence slowdown is more than twice as much on 8 workers compared to 4 workers. This is due to the amplification of staleness effects by generating and missing updates, as seen in Fig. 3. Convergence curves for LDA with different staleness levels show smooth behavior even with high staleness and a large number of workers, attributed to the structure of the log likelihood objective function. The log likelihood objective function BID12 changes smoothly with staleness levels below 10, leading to convergence regardless of the number of topics or workers. However, with staleness levels above 15, Gibbs sampling does not converge, showing distinct trajectories sensitive to topics and workers. A \"phase transition\" occurs at a certain staleness level, creating two convergence behaviors. This is the first report of staleness-induced failure in LDA Gibbs sampling. VAEs are more sensitive to staleness compared to DNNs, possibly due to additional stochasticity from the sampling procedure. Theoretical insight is provided on the effect of staleness on convergence slowdown in asynchronous SGD cases for neural network models. The objective function F in the problem satisfies certain conditions, and Async-SGD is used to solve it. The update rule involves mini-batch gradients and delayed updates. The optimization dynamics are complex due to nonconvexity and delayed updates. Gradient coherence is key to understanding convergence properties. The notion of gradient coherence, defined as the minimum coherence between the current gradient and past gradients, provides insights into the convergence properties of Async-SGD. It indicates how well the direction of the current gradient aligns with past gradients, affecting the convergence induced by delayed stochastic gradients. This coherence requirement is not global and only needs to be satisfied over a small number of iterations. Recent studies have shown that in practical neural network training, SGD encourages positive gradient coherence, indicating mild non-convexity around critical points. The optimization path minimizes staleness, leading to \u00b5 k > 0 for most of the process. This quantity is easy to compute empirically and informative for controlling synchronization levels. The convergence property of Async-SGD is characterized by Theorem 1, assuming gradient coherence and bounded variance of stochastic gradients. Our gradient coherence is similar to the sufficient direction assumption in BID19, but with random staleness affected by system-level factors. Storing a pre-selected batch of data on a worker can approximate the gradient for computational efficiency. Theorem 1 characterizes theoretical aspects of Async-SGD, adapting stepsize based on staleness and gradient coherence. Larger staleness requires smaller stepsize, while high gradient coherence allows for a more aggressive stepsize. Refer to the Appendix for details on computational efficiency and reaching test accuracy on CIFAR10. The choice of stepsize in Async-SGD should balance staleness and gradient coherence. Theorem 1 indicates that a positive gradient coherence leads to convergence to a stationary point. Empirical observations suggest that coherent gradients allow for a larger staleness in optimization paths. Theorem 1 suggests that coherent gradients are beneficial in non-synchronous execution. Cosine similarity between gradients improves during convergence, except for early staleness. Higher model complexity leads to lower cosine similarity. Lower gradient coherence amplifies the effect of staleness in deeper models. Our study on convergence behaviors under delayed updates for various models and algorithms reveals that staleness significantly impacts learning. Staleness slows down convergence, especially at high levels, and can cause slow progress or failure. The effects of staleness are influenced by model complexity, choice of algorithms, number of workers, and the model itself. Our empirical findings suggest new analyses of non-convex optimization under asynchrony, focusing on gradient coherence to match the rate of O(1/ \u221a T ). Distributed ML systems must address staleness to achieve actual speed-up in convergence, balancing system throughput gains with statistical penalties. Many ML methods show robustness against low staleness, offering optimization opportunities. Successful nonsynchronous systems maintain low staleness and use efficient algorithms. Theorem 2 states conditions for iterates generated by Async-SGD. The iterates generated by Async-SGD are upper bounded by \u03c3 2. By the L-Lipschitz property of \u2207F, we can derive inequalities that lead to the conclusion that the choice of stepsize guarantees positive gradient coherence. This assumption is supported by empirical evidence. In practice, gradient coherence generally improves when approaching convergence for both SGD and Adam algorithms. Higher staleness lowers gradient coherence and slows convergence, as observed empirically. Delay distribution is considered using geometric distribution for stragglers in the optimization process. The delay in the optimization process is drawn from a geometric distribution to account for stragglers. Staleness significantly impacts convergence speed, especially in deeper networks. Additional results for DNNs show the effect of batch size and staleness levels on convergence. The results show that staleness affects convergence speed, with deeper networks experiencing more slowdown. SGD and Adagrad are more robust to staleness compared to Adam, RMSProp, and SGD with momentum. Having more workers amplifies the impact of staleness. SGDS is more resilient to staleness than Adam, and shallower networks are less affected. Staleness can sometimes accelerate convergence due to implicit momentum. In LDA, tokens are assigned latent topics using Gibbs sampling. Model quality is measured using log likelihood. Additional results of LDA under different worker and topic numbers are presented in FIG12 and FIG1. The convergence curves for Matrix Factorization (MF) under different numbers of workers and staleness levels show that higher staleness leads to higher variance in convergence. The number of workers also affects variance, with MF showing low standard deviation with 4 workers up to staleness 20, but large variance with 8 workers at staleness 15. The number of batches needed to reach 92% test accuracy using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with varying hidden layers is shown in Figure 7, with results averaged over 5 runs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM, are used for language modeling tasks with a subset of the Penn Treebank dataset. The impact of staleness on LSTM models with 1 to 4 layers and 256 neurons each is evaluated. The dataset is pre-processed and the model quality is measured in perplexity. The number of batches needed for convergence is shown in Figure 1. The impact of staleness on LSTM models with varying network depths is measured in perplexity. Figure 1 illustrates the batches required to achieve desired model quality, showing deeper networks are more affected by staleness compared to shallower ones."
