    "content": "The \"Regulatory Reform Act of 2012\" may be cited as the official title of the Act. Additionally, a Federal Regulatory Reform Report is required by the Act. The Regulatory Reform Act of 2012 mandates a Federal Regulatory Reform Report to be submitted every four years, listing outdated, duplicative, ineffective, or burdensome rules. The Federal Regulatory Reform Report, required by the Regulatory Reform Act of 2012, must include recommendations to consolidate, modify, simplify, or repeal rules to make them more effective or less burdensome. It should also justify the recommendations with supporting data and analyze how the costs outweigh the benefits for each rule listed. The Administrator can use agency action plans as resources for the report. The Federal Regulatory Reform Report, mandated by the Regulatory Reform Act of 2012, must include recommendations based on agency action plans, Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, OMB Circular A-4, and other relevant reports. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs must publish the report for public comment at least 60 days before submission. The Administrator may modify the report in response to comments before submission to Congress. Consultation with relevant parties is required before submitting the Federal Regulatory Reform Report. The President will propose implementing recommendations from the report. The recent Federal Regulatory Reform Report prepared by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs requires the President to transmit a special message to Congress within 120 days, along with a bill to implement the recommendations. The President can only send one special message per year, and the regulatory reform bill must be considered within 14 days of submission. The majority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate must introduce a bill by request. Any House committee to which the bill is referred must report it without amendment within 14 legislative days. If the committee fails to do so, it will be automatically reported. The bill must be reported by the House committee within 14 legislative days, or it will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar for consideration. Within 21 legislative days after the bill is reported or a committee is discharged, a motion to proceed to consider the bill in the House can be made, which is highly privileged and not debatable. The motion to proceed with a bill in the House must be made within 21 legislative days after the bill is reported or a committee is discharged. The motion is highly privileged, not debatable, and the previous question is ordered on its adoption without a reconsideration option. The House shall immediately proceed to consider a bill without intervening motion, with all points of order waived. The bill will be considered as read, with 4 hours of debate and one motion to limit debate. Reconsidering the vote on passage of the bill is not allowed. The Senate committee must report the bill without amendment within seven session days after introduction. Failure to do so or if the Senate adjourns sine die, the committee is discharged from further consideration, and the bill is placed on the calendar. After the Senate committee reports the bill without amendment within seven session days, any Senator can move to proceed to consider the bill in the Senate. The motion must be decided without debate, and if agreed to, the Senate shall immediately consider the draft bill. The Senate shall proceed to consideration of the draft bill without delay, with a limit of 10 hours for debate and all points of order waived. The Senate shall proceed to consideration of the draft bill with a 10-hour limit for debate. No motions to postpone, proceed to other business, or recommit the bill are allowed. No amendments or motions to strike provisions are permitted in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. Coordination with the other House is required before passing the bill. The bill from the other House supplants the receiving House's bill upon passage. This rule applies only to the specific bill mentioned in the section. The continuity of a session is only broken by a sine die adjournment lasting more than 3 days. The House is not in session due to an adjournment of more than 3 days, which excludes the computation of any period. Additionally, a technical and conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code. Federal Regulatory Reform Report and Authorization of Appropriations."
