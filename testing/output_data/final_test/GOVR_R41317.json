    "content": "The federal government supports farm prices and income for major field crops through commodity programs, which many policymakers and farmers see as necessary for financial survival. However, environmental groups criticize these subsidies for encouraging overproduction on fragile land. Budget hawks argue that farm subsidies distort the market and misuse taxpayer dollars, leading to harsh criticism in major U.S. newspapers. Farm safety net programs are categorized under the 2008 farm bill and other legislation. Farm safety net programs are divided into three main categories: commodity programs, risk management, and supplemental disaster assistance. These programs primarily benefit farmers of major field crops and some livestock, with a history of government support dating back to the 1930s. Specialty crops have become eligible for support in recent years. Farm safety net programs primarily support major field crops and some livestock, while specialty crop producers and livestock farmers receive little to no direct government support. Payment limits control the level of payments made to individuals, but some operators have found ways to avoid these limits. The evolution of farm support programs over many decades has led to overlapping or conflicting programs, generating criticism for being poorly integrated, costly, or lacking adequate risk protection. Traditional commodity programs for field crops provide risk protection through direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing loan benefits. Eligible crops include wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, oats, cotton, rice, pulse crops, soybeans, oilseeds, and peanuts. The payment amount is partly determined by market prices relative to program parameters. Farmers can also opt for the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program instead of counter-cyclical payments. Additional program details can be found in CRS reports referenced in each section. The 2008 farm bill determines payment amounts to farmers based on historical plantings, yields, and national payment rates. Direct payments were established in the 1996 farm bill as a transition away from target-price programs, and made permanent in the 2002 farm bill. This shift to fixed payments was influenced by high crop prices and low farm payments. Direct payments in the 2008 farm bill are fixed to preserve funding and do not rely on market prices. Farmers have flexibility in crop choice but must follow conservation provisions. The Congressional Budget Office projects $49 billion in direct payments over FY2011-FY2020, providing stability for farmers and aiding in securing bank credit. These payments are considered acceptable by the World Trade Organization. Direct payments in the 2008 farm bill are considered acceptable by the World Trade Organization as they do not depend on current production or prices. Critics argue that these payments can inflate land prices and provide no risk protection for producers, serving as a taxpayer-funded income transfer to owners of historical agricultural base acres. Counter-cyclical payments are crop-specific and are triggered when national farm prices fall below a certain threshold. Counter-cyclical payments are made to farmers based on historical acreage and yield, averaging $1.859 billion per year in the last five years. The payment rate formula depends on market prices, not production. These payments are decoupled from yield and acreage but tied to market prices, classified as \"amber box\" subsidies by the United States. The United States classifies agricultural subsidies as \"amber box\" for reporting to the WTO, limited in size with other subsidies. Some commodities have prices below levels triggering counter-cyclical payments, while others like wheat have prices above program parameters, raising concerns about price protection. The Marketing Assistance Loan program offers financial benefits to farmers with a guaranteed floor price for certain crops and short-term financing. The Marketing Assistance Loan program provides financial benefits to farmers by offering a guaranteed floor price for designated crops used as collateral. Farmers can repay the loan at the posted price or receive a loan deficiency payment when the market price is below the loan rate. Program benefits are based on the entire crop produced, with no benefits in case of crop loss. The Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program offers financial benefits to farmers by providing a guaranteed floor price for designated crops used as collateral. However, critics argue that the program's lack of payment limits encourages larger farm operations to expand at the expense of smaller producers. The program has had limited benefits in recent years due to low loan rates compared to market prices, costing an average of $3.4 billion per year in the last five years. Critics suggest that raising loan rates in the next farm bill would increase projected outlays. The ACRE program, introduced in the 2008 farm bill, is revenue-driven and aims to protect farmers against revenue losses for each DCP crop. It pays farmers when state-level revenue falls below a guaranteed level and the farmer experiences an individual crop revenue loss on a farm. The CBO baseline projects average outlays of $311 million per year for FY2011-FY2020. The ACRE program, introduced in the 2008 farm bill, requires a second trigger for payments to farmers who experience revenue loss. Selection of the ACRE option is permanent for the 2008 farm bill period. Participants forgo 20% of direct payments, have reduced loan rates by 30%, and are not eligible for counter-cyclical program payments. Program participation has been low, with only 8% of eligible farms enrolling in 2009. The ACRE program, introduced in the 2008 farm bill, requires a second trigger for payments to farmers who experience revenue loss. Program participation has been low, with only 8% of eligible farms enrolling in 2009. Some farmers find it challenging to determine if enrollment would be advantageous and explain the program to landlords. Critics have raised concerns about duplicate payments and coverage when low prices and/or yields result in both crop insurance indemnities and ACRE payments. A tenant or sharecropper actively engaged in farming shares the risk and is entitled to a share of the crop produced on the farm. Conservation and planting flexibility rules must be followed, with two common rental arrangements being cash rent and share rent. Landlords receive fixed cash rent under cash rental contracts. The tenant pays fixed cash rent to the landlord, who bears no production risk and does not receive program payments. The tenant bears all the risk, harvests the crop, and receives government subsidies. Under share rental contracts, the tenant provides labor and machinery while the landlord supplies land and inputs. Both share risk and harvest, eligible for government subsidies. Government payments often pass through to landlords, raising land prices and rental rates, impacting farm production. Government payments, such as direct and counter-cyclical payments, ACRE payments, and Marketing Assistance Loan Program, impact land prices and rental rates, increasing production costs for farmers. These payments address price or revenue risk at the national market level but do not address production risk. Crop insurance and disaster programs are designed to manage production risk. Dairy and sugar producers also benefit from these programs. Dairy and sugar producers benefit from federal programs such as milk price support and MILC payments. Import controls and alternative proposals are being considered for dairy policies. Direct payments for dairy support have averaged $383 million per year in the past five years. Sugar is supported through import quotas and domestic marketing allotments. The federal crop insurance program provides risk management tools for producers to address crop yield and revenue losses. It has wide coverage and a revenue protection feature. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program fills gaps in coverage where insurance is not available. Federal crop insurance has grown in importance as a risk management tool due to subsidy intervention since the early 1990s. The federal crop insurance program, established in the early 1990s, is supported by federal subsidies. The program covers major crops like corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat, with the government subsidizing premiums and sharing the loss risk. Administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency, the program covered 265 million acres in 2009. Corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat accounted for over 73% of enrolled acres, with high coverage percentages for each crop. Crop insurance covers major crops like corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat, with government subsidies. Over the last five years, crop insurance outlays averaged $5.2 billion per year, projected to increase to $8.1 billion per year by 2020. Policies are available for over 100 crops, including specialty crops like dry peas, blueberries, citrus, and walnuts. Livestock coverage is also now available. Specialty crop producers rely on crop insurance as their main safety net. Livestock coverage is a new program that protects producers from loss of gross margin or price declines. These policies are not subsidized, limiting producer participation. Producers select coverage levels and pay a portion of the premium, with the government covering the remainder. Farmer participation in crop insurance would be lower without subsidies. Federal crop insurance policies are yield-based. Federal crop insurance policies can be yield-based or revenue-based. Yield-based policies provide indemnity for yield loss compared to historical yield, while revenue-based policies protect against revenue loss from yield or price declines. Some farmers find current policies unhelpful due to high premiums. Critics argue for cost control and claim heavy government subsidization distorts the program. AGR-Lite is a whole farm revenue protection plan of insurance available in 36 states, providing protection against low revenue due to natural disasters and market fluctuations. It uses a producer's five-year historical farm average revenue to guarantee income for the insurance period. Whole-farm insurance, known as AGR-Lite, offers revenue protection for producers with less than $2.05 million in approved gross revenue. Coverage levels range from 65% to 80% of historical revenue, with payment rates from 75% to 90% for losses exceeding the minimum coverage level. Despite limited use, with only 826 policies sold in 2009, the policy is seen as complex due to the information required for application. Whole-farm insurance, AGR-Lite, provides revenue protection for producers with less than $2.05 million in approved gross revenue. Coverage levels range from 65% to 80% of historical revenue, with payment rates from 75% to 90% for losses exceeding the minimum coverage level. Producers growing ineligible crops may qualify for direct payments under USDA's Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), which has smaller outlays compared to crop insurance. NAP outlays averaged $74 million per year from FY2006 to FY2010, with a projected average of $92 million per year from FY2011 to FY2020. The USDA projects an average of $92 million per year for NAP payments from FY2011-FY2020. To be eligible, producers must apply by the closing date, pay a $250 administrative fee, and experience at least a 50% crop loss or be prevented from planting 35% of intended acreage. NAP provides 55% of the average market price for losses exceeding the minimum threshold, similar to catastrophic crop insurance. Additionally, the 2008 farm bill included funding for five new disaster programs. The 2008 farm bill authorized and funded five new disaster programs to cover losses through FY2011, costing $3.9 billion over five years. These programs aim to provide more structured disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers compared to previous ad hoc assistance. The largest program, SURE, compensates eligible producers for crop losses not covered by insurance. The SURE program provides payments to producers for crop revenue losses due to natural disasters or adverse weather incurred on or before September 30, 2011. It calculates and reimburses losses using total crop revenue for the entire farm. If a farmer's actual farm revenue is less than the guaranteed level, they receive a payment calculated as 60% of the difference. The SURE program provides payments to producers for crop revenue losses due to natural disasters or adverse weather. Payments are calculated as 60% of the difference between actual farm revenue and the guaranteed level. The program has been criticized for its data-intensive payment determination process, resulting in delays in payment disbursement. Additionally, the 2008 farm bill authorized new livestock assistance programs, including the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) which compensates ranchers for livestock mortality caused by disasters. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) compensates ranchers for livestock mortality due to disasters, while the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) covers losses not included in other programs. The Tree Assistance Program (TAP) helps orchardists and nursery tree growers replant trees after natural disasters. The 111th Congress considered additional emergency payments for 2009 crop losses due to reduced potential under SURE program. The Administration announced in 2010 the implementation of a $630 million disaster assistance package for producers of rice, soybeans, sweet potatoes, and cotton. Critics question the effectiveness of the SURE program and its whole-farm disaster assistance approach. Farmers find the program too complicated and not beneficial for diversified operations. The federal budget deficits have led to calls for fiscal restraint and spending reductions. President Obama created a commission to propose solutions for a sustainable budget, considering all programs. The Commission recommended reducing agricultural spending by $15 billion from FY2012-FY2020, including direct payments, crop insurance subsidies, and conservation programs. The Bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force proposed a larger cut of $30 billion through FY2020, tightening payment limits and consolidating programs. This budget situation may hinder any increase in new spending on a 2012 farm bill. The level of funding in the CBO baseline for agricultural programs will be crucial for the bill's development. The CBO issues baseline budget projections for federal spending under current law. The baseline serves as a benchmark for future budget analyses. Any new legislation impacting federal mandatory spending is measured against the baseline. Scorekeeping and estimating baselines are done by CBO under the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees. The current federal budget situation is different from when the 2002 farm bill was written. The 2002 farm bill had a surplus allowing for increased spending, while the 2008 farm bill was budget neutral with outside funding. Negotiating offsets with other committees caused delays in the development of the 2008 farm bill. The next farm bill is expected to be budget-neutral and written within the agriculture committees' confines. Funding will be limited to the CBO baseline, requiring offsets within the agriculture committees' jurisdiction. This may involve decreasing one program to increase another, or transferring funds between different programs within the bill. The 2008 farm bill faces challenges in securing funding beyond FY2012, with potential need for offsets of up to $10 billion over five years. Political stakes are high among interest groups to pass the bill, and budget reconciliation may be necessary. Title I farm commodity programs are unlikely to receive additional mandatory funding, while other titles like nutrition and conservation have been more successful in competing for funds. The pool of money for proposed revisions to the farm safety net may come from existing farm commodity programs and crop insurance. Direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, or crop insurance could be replaced, revised, or reduced to fund new safety net programs. Combined outlays for these programs have ranged from $12.2 billion to $20.5 billion annually, with an average of $15.7 billion per year from FY2003 to FY2010. The projected average for FY2011-FY2020 is $14.8 billion. Crop insurance outlays have increased significantly, reaching $7.3 billion in FY2010 and projected to rise to $8.7 billion in FY2020. Conversely, Title I farm commodity program costs have decreased due to lower counter-cyclical payments. The status of supplemental disaster assistance remains uncertain. The status of disaster assistance is uncertain and unpredictable, with ad hoc payments subject to congressional action and not included in baseline projections. The 2008 farm bill's \"permanent\" agricultural disaster provisions are only authorized temporarily. Crop insurance is the largest component of projected payments, totaling $81 billion over 10 years, followed by direct payments at $49 billion and counter-cyclical/ACRE payments at nearly $9 billion. Cotton accounts for 55% of combined counter-cyclical/ACRE payments. Corn receives the most support in farm commodity payments, accounting for 17% of the projection. Direct payments may be included in new safety net proposals, potentially offsetting funding from counter-cyclical payments. Other top supported commodities include cotton, wheat, soybeans, and rice, together making up 93% of Title I payments. The top five supported commodities in farm payments are corn, cotton, wheat, soybeans, and rice, accounting for 93% of Title I payments. Policy questions are being raised to evaluate the effectiveness of current farm safety net programs and consider potential changes. Calls for emergency disaster relief indicate that the farm safety net, including programs like SURE and ACRE, is not meeting the needs of farmers due to complexity and limited benefits. Some farmers feel that existing programs like MAL benefits and counter-cyclical payments are insufficient, as trigger levels are below current price levels. Critics question the necessity of farm subsidies, suggesting resources could be better used for environmental goals or improving agricultural productivity. Some argue against farm commodity programs, stating they distort production, benefit resource owners, and harm smaller producers. The future of farm safety net programs, particularly crop insurance, is uncertain as funding may be reduced. Farm policy observers note significant overlap between farm programs like ACRE and crop insurance addressing revenue variability. The current farm program mix includes various \"counter-cyclical-style\" payments, but some suggest a different program array could reduce farm risk more cost-effectively. Major commodity producers like wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, and milk have historically benefited the most from farm programs shaped by farmers and policymakers representing those commodities. The federal government has enacted programs supporting agriculture-based biofuels, primarily corn-based ethanol, leading to a 30% increase in corn demand and higher prices. Biofuels subsidies in 2009 totaled nearly $6 billion, benefiting not only corn but also other major field crops. This increased demand for corn has expanded its area into non-traditional crop areas, affecting prices of other crops. The expansion of corn area into non-traditional crop areas has raised prices for other major field crops. Federal budget watchers argue that biofuels subsidies should be considered as agricultural price and income subsidies. The complexity of programs like ACRE and SURE requires a substantial amount of individual farm data, leading to high setup and ongoing administrative costs. Payment limits for farm commodities are also a factor in program participation. Payment limits for farm commodity programs are controversial as they determine the maximum amount of payments a person can receive per year or the income threshold for program eligibility. Some policymakers advocate for tighter limits to save money and prevent the expansion of large farms at the expense of small farms, while others argue that larger farms should not be penalized for their efficiencies. Crop insurance, unlike farm commodity programs, has no payment limits. Crop insurance has no payment limits, making it an attractive centerpiece of farm policy for small and large farms alike. The United States, as a member of the World Trade Organization, must adhere to its rules, which scrutinize domestic and trade policies. U.S. farm policy is constantly evaluated against WTO rules, particularly the Agreement on Agriculture. The U.S. farm policy is subject to WTO rules, including the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Violations may lead to challenges under the WTO dispute settlement process. The \"Brazil cotton case\" highlighted the need for compliance, requiring potential legislative changes for WTO adherence. Policymakers must consider how farm programs impact U.S. commitments under the WTO. The U.S. farm policy is subject to WTO rules, including the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Policymakers must consider how farm programs impact U.S. commitments under the WTO, particularly regarding compliance with the AA and SCM rules. The AA categorizes programs based on their potential to distort production and trade, with a limit of $19.1 billion per year on AMS amber box support. Compliance with WTO limits is crucial for U.S. farm programs. The SCM rules under the WTO govern the operation of farm programs to ensure compliance with spending limits. Even if a program stays within its limit, it may still face challenges under the SCM rules, particularly regarding actionable subsidies that cause adverse effects in international markets. Agricultural subsidies within spending limits may face challenges under SCM rules due to potential adverse effects in markets. Amber box programs are vulnerable to scrutiny for being \"market distorting,\" leading to adverse effects. Trade analysts argue that the criteria for adverse effects are easier to meet than injury requirements for countervailing duty claims. Three criteria must be met to establish adverse effects: 1. subsidy's significant share of farmer returns or production costs, 2. importance of subsidized commodity in world markets. The available evidence suggests that major U.S.-subsidized program crops are vulnerable to dispute settlement challenges under WTO rules. Despite this vulnerability, challenges may not be frequently filed due to economic and diplomatic costs. Policy measures that may attract future scrutiny include setting revenue targets above historical levels. The AA includes three categories of programs\u2014green box, blue box, and de minimis\u2014that are exempted from AMS spending limits. Green box policies are presumed to be less trade or production distorting, while blue box policies are based on historical data or production limits. The de minimis exemption allows for minimal trade or production distortion. The de minimis exemption in agricultural support programs is for spending that is small relative to the value of a specific product or total production. The AA includes a list of exempt programs such as general farm services, income support, relief from natural disasters, and environmental program payments. The United States' direct payments were found lacking green box exempt status by a WTO panel due to planting restrictions on certain crops. The WTO panel challenged the green box eligibility of U.S. direct payments, which could lead to disqualification and exceed the WTO limit. Eligible payments for income insurance or safety net programs require agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income in the preceding three-year period, compensating for less than 70% of the income loss in the year of eligibility. Payments under the green box rules must be based solely on income loss exceeding 30% of production in the preceding three-year period, compensating for less than 70% of the income loss in the year of eligibility. Total annual payments cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. The green box rules require that income or farm safety net program payments compensate for income loss exceeding 30% and not exceed 70% of the loss. U.S. crop insurance subsidies do not qualify for the green box and are classified as amber box AMS. The United States has not notified any program spending under the blue box since 1996. The old target-price deficiency payments under the 1996 farm law were linked to land set-aside requirements, meeting the \"production-limiting\" characteristic of the blue box. It is unlikely that a whole-farm safety net program or crop-specific income program could meet current AA blue box criteria without notable land or resource constraints. The US has made minimal use of the product-specific de minimis exemption due to programs accounting for less than 5% of annual production value. A whole-farm safety net proposal involves aggregating all farm-related income activities and must qualify under the \"non-product-specific\" de minimis. To qualify for the non-product-specific de minimis exemption, the total annual cost of the whole-farm safety net program and other non-product-specific AMS measures must be less than 5% of total U.S. agricultural production value. If it exceeds this threshold, it will count towards the $19.1 billion annual limit. The United States has notified all crop insurance subsidies under this exemption category. The WTO compatibility of a whole-farm safety net program depends on various factors. The WTO compatibility of a whole-farm safety net program depends on meeting green box exemption criteria, potential impact on AMS spending, and market effects. Policymakers face challenges in revising the farm safety net due to historical development, budget concerns, and potential WTO challenges. During the farm bill debate, various factors such as budget deficit, biofuel policy, and WTO commitments will influence changes to the farm safety net."
