The law authorizes funding for infrastructure improvements, identifies choke points, sets performance targets, and establishes metrics for seaports. DOT predicts a 40% increase in domestic freight tonnage and a 44% increase in truck tonnage over the next three decades. Coastal and Great Lakes shipping routes could help alleviate congestion on major highways and railroads in the Midwest. Despite efforts to promote the U.S. merchant marine, domestic shipborne commerce has declined compared to truck and rail freight. Federal support for projects diverting freight to waterways has not been successful in reversing this trend. The declining cargo volumes of domestic coastal and Great Lakes shipping are attributed to federal maritime policies that increase transportation costs by ship. Port costs also hinder the diversion of truck freight to coastal waterways. This report explores recent trends in waterborne freight movement in the U.S. and suggests policy options to enhance the competitive position of coastal and Great Lakes shipping. Ships could be a cost-effective method for transporting goods with the right federal policies in place, as they do not require rights-of-way like railroads and pipelines and can transport more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel. Ships offer cost advantages for freight transportation due to lower fuel costs compared to trucks and railroads. Despite being slower, many shippers opt for waterborne shipping for its cost efficiency, especially for lower-value goods. Importers in the eastern United States often choose the Panama Canal route over rail transport for its lower costs, even though it takes longer. U.S. geography is well suited for coastal shipping due to its extensive coastline, water access between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes, and the Panama Canal for intercoastal transport. Despite the potential market along the coasts, the age of the domestic ship fleet could be a limiting factor. The domestic ship fleet in the U.S. faces constraints due to the age of the ships and missing common ship designs. Most container ships are over 30 years old, dry bulk ships are approaching 40 years, and Great Lakes fleet ships are over 40 years old. There is a lack of break-bulk or heavy-lift/project cargo ships. The one chemical tanker is nearly 50 years old, while the oil tanker fleet is more modern due to regulations requiring double hulls. The U.S. domestic ship fleet faces constraints due to aging vessels and a lack of common ship designs. Regulations require oil tank vessels to have double hulls, resulting in more modern fleets. Only 128 deep-draft ships are in the domestic fleet, and vessels transporting goods between U.S. points must be U.S.-built under the Jones Act. Despite their efficiencies, domestic coastal and Great Lakes shipping carry only half as much cargo as in 1960, while other transportation modes have increased their transport volume. The use of river barges, coastal ships, and vessels for trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico has doubled freight tonnage. However, domestic shippers prefer other transport methods over ships. Vessels are more cost-effective for moving low-value goods between the Midwest and coasts. The Mississippi River System, Great Lakes, and coastal shipping offer potential routes for cargo movement. Yet, high costs and limited availability of domestic coastal shipping may lead to using international trade instead. For example, hog and poultry farmers in the Carolinas import feed from South America due to lower shipping costs. An all-water route from the Midwest could make feed transportation more price-competitive and reduce spill risks. Decline in domestic coastwise and Great Lakes shipping volumes over decades is due to enduring economic factors. Higher-value cargo has shifted to truck and rail modes, leading to less diverse commodity mix in domestic shipping. The decline of coastwise and Great Lakes shipping has been a long-standing concern, with domestic ocean carriers advocating for legislation in the 1960s to improve the industry's competitive position. Today, coastwise shipping of refined petroleum products is only a third of what it was in 1960. Strikes by tanker crews in the early 1960s led to the construction of coastal pipelines, which now transport the equivalent of 4,000 tanker loads of products annually. The coastwise shipping of refined petroleum products has declined significantly since the 1960s, with the opening of the Alaska pipeline leading to a temporary surge in the late 1970s. High transportation costs have contributed to the decline in Alaska oil shipments, while the volume of coastwise and inland waterway freight has been increasing due to the boom in crude oil production in Texas and North Dakota. However, the use of coastal shipping, mainly by barge, is decreasing even for short distances along the coastline. Coastal shipping for freight transportation between New England, eastern New York, and southeastern coastal states like South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida is predominantly done by overland modes. Reviving coastal shipping could significantly increase the nation's freight network capacity and provide a competitive alternative for some shippers. This could address complaints about high freight rates in the rail and oil pipeline industries. The necessary infrastructure for coastal shipping is largely in place, with potential for increased efficiency and capacity. The infrastructure for coastal shipping is already in place, with little ship traffic in harbors dredged by the federal government. The high cost of U.S.-built ships is deterring carriers, with prices ranging from $190 million to $250 million, compared to $30 million for ships built in foreign shipyards. This cost difference also applies to barges, making U.S.-built ships six to eight times more expensive than their foreign-built counterparts. The high cost of building ships domestically is due to the lack of foreign competition and economies of scale. U.S.-built ships are six to eight times more expensive than foreign-built ships, with prices ranging from $190 million to $250 million. The domestic oceangoing ship fleet is mainly used on routes without overland competition, such as those to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. Small general-cargo ships deliver supplies to Alaskan harbor communities without road connections, and the domestic tanker fleet operates where pipeline service is unavailable or at capacity. U.S. shipyards build only a few deep-draft ships annually for the domestic market, while focusing on constructing around 1,000 barges and 70 towboats/push boats each year. The barge fleet is substantial, with approximately 4,000 towboats/push boats and 22,000 barges on the Mississippi River System alone. Competitive pressure from railroads impacts barge carriers, leading to price pressure on U.S. shipyards specializing in barge construction. Coastal barge substitution for coastal ships is not reflected in the data. Since 1960, ship tonnage on coasts and Great Lakes decreased by 61%, while barge tonnage increased by 356%. Federal programs like Title XI aim to finance U.S.-built ships, with MARAD providing loan guarantees and tax-free accounts for U.S. carriers to purchase ships for trade in specific areas. These programs have supported the construction of most U.S.-built ships. The loan guarantee program for U.S.-built ships has faced controversy due to default loans. A 2011 MARAD determination requires that 50% of imported components used in ship construction with government financing must be shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels. Cargo preference laws mandate that 50% to 100% of federally financed cargo transported overseas be carried by U.S.-flag ships, benefiting owners of U.S.-flag international vessels. MARAD issued regulations requiring imported vessel components to be shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels when applying for Title XI financing, causing concerns about increased costs and supply chain disruptions. The burden of increased shipping costs, supply chain disruptions, and additional paperwork to demonstrate compliance is a concern for U.S. shipyards. Compliance with the Cargo Preference Act requirement significantly raises the cost of foreign components for coastal ships under construction. MARAD determines rates for cargo based on U.S.-flag carriers' costs, further increasing construction costs for U.S.-built ships with foreign components. Comparatively high cargo-handling costs also contribute to the overall cost of shipping goods by water. The high cargo-handling costs, especially for containers, hinder coastwise shipping and the goal of diverting truck traffic to water transportation. U.S. container ports are less efficient than those in Europe and Asia, with port handling costs being the largest cost element for coastal container services on the East Coast. Significant differences in container-handling costs exist among East Coast ports. The study found that state port authorities manned terminals with state employees, not longshore union members, resulting in a lower per-container rate of $165 instead of $255. The total cost of loading and unloading containers at East Coast ports could be several hundred dollars, making coastwise shipping more expensive than other modes. Port container-handling costs may deter waterborne shipping, as evidenced by the U.S. trading fewer containers with Canada than with Cambodia. Waterborne trade between Canada and the U.S. is lower than with Cambodia. Factors such as container port costs and crew costs contribute to the preference for truck or rail service for containerized cargo. Crew costs make up a significant portion of operating costs for U.S.-crewed container ships compared to foreign-flag ships, leading to higher overall operating costs for U.S.-flag vessels. The high crew costs play a significant role in total ship operating costs for domestic ships, making it uneconomic for them to call at foreign ports. Domestic carriers could improve ship utilization by sailing on triangular routes and calling at additional ports to increase cargo capacity. This efficiency advantage is important for cargo ships in U.S. coastal trades. The limited geography of the domestic fleet may explain the absence of Jones-Act qualified heavy-lift/project cargo ships. To help U.S.-flag international vessels compete with foreign ships, the federal government provides operating subsidies, with Congress appropriating $3.5 million per ship in FY2017. The federal government provides operating subsidies to U.S.-flag international vessels, with Congress appropriating $3.5 million per ship in FY2017. The authorized amount has recently increased to $5 million per ship for FY2018, potentially leading to higher wages for U.S. mariners and impacting domestic shipping. Congress has recognized the upward pressure on crew costs induced by these subsidies in the past. The concern over inflated U.S. crewing costs led to fixed crewing costs for U.S. and foreign vessels. High labor costs in coastal shipping, due to government subsidies for international shipping, have resulted in increased use of barges over ships. U.S. shippers have turned to alternative transport methods like truck, rail, and pipeline, and have increased waterborne imports and exports. The higher cost of domestic shipping has led to displacement of coastal trade in some commodities. Despite the world economy growing faster than the U.S. economy, U.S. international and domestic waterborne trade may not have increased as expected. Since 1960, domestic Great Lakes shipping volume has decreased by 104 million tons, while international waterborne volume has increased by over 1 billion tons. Many materials are imported and exported through coastal ports in large volumes, with lower transportation costs leading consumers near ports to choose imports over domestic products. This trend encourages domestic producers to sell abroad rather than domestically, leading to import substitution in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Import substitution is evident in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, where waterborne shipping volumes from foreign sources have significantly increased compared to shipments from the contiguous United States. The lack of domestic oceangoing fleet for dry bulk materials and chemicals results in these commodities being transported in barges instead of ships. For instance, a large percentage of fertilizer, chemicals, and forest products in coastwise trade are shipped in barges. The shift in coastwise trade shows a decline in ship cargo and a steady barge cargo, with barges now carrying 60% of tonnage. The U.S. maritime industry has developed articulated tug barges (ATBs) to operate offshore, offering lower construction costs and requiring fewer crew members compared to traditional ships. ATBs are more seaworthy than river barge tows but have limitations in rough sea conditions. The domestic oceanborne shipping market is shifting towards shorter-distance voyages due to the inefficiency of barges compared to ships in moving goods over longer distances. Since 1960, the average length of coastwise freight movements has decreased, while railroads have seen an increase in average haul distance. This trend has led to a loss of market share to railroads in terms of ton-miles. The shift from ships to ATBs (Articulated Tug-Barges) has led to a decrease in coastwise shipping ton-miles by 73% since 1980, while railroad ton-miles have increased by 100%. ATBs mainly handle liquid cargoes and frustrate U.S. shipyards' ability to achieve economies of scale in constructing coast-size ships. This shift also complicates efforts to maintain a large pool of skilled mariners for deep-draft ship navigation. Coastal shipping is facing challenges due to slower and less reliable conveyances compared to land-based competitors. Railroads and pipeline operators have improved efficiency with larger-capacity rail cars, longer trains, and larger-diameter pipes. The Panama Canal has seen a decline in domestic waterborne commerce, with fewer domestic cargo ships transiting in recent years. The Panama Canal recently completed a lock-widening project to accommodate larger ships, benefiting U.S. trade with South America. However, domestic cargo ships rarely use the canal, limiting its impact on domestic shippers. The expanded canal could be useful for moving domestic crude oil, as tankers carrying Alaska oil were previously too large to transit. Coastwise shipping has focused on routes where overland transportation is not feasible. The Jones Act tankers supplement the capacity of pipelines by delivering refined petroleum to Florida and New England, which are not connected to the pipeline network. Tankers from Europe also contribute to filling the void, transporting about 30 tanker loads per month. The Colonial and Plantation pipelines have been operating at or near capacity, with Jones Act tankers adding about one to three tanker loads per month. Jones Act tankers supplement pipeline capacity by delivering refined petroleum products to areas like Florida and the West Coast. They also transport ore from Mesabi iron mines to steel mills in the Midwest. Iron ore shipments have been able to maintain market share against rail competition due to the density of the commodity. Iron ore is dense and requires multiple train trips to supply a Great Lakes steel mill. U.S.-flag vessels face competition from steel manufacturing using scrap metal. Vessels have an advantage in shipping oversize cargo. Oversize cargo that exceeds weight or size limits on highways or railroads faces challenges with state permitting practices, adding costs and delays to interstate shipments by road. Railroads have higher weight tolerances but limited cargo width tolerances. Vessels have an advantage in shipping oversize cargo due to avoiding road restrictions, although they still require overland transport to and from port facilities. Ships are not competitive with trucks and railroads for moving oversize cargo, except for \"megasize\" loads that cannot be accommodated by highways or railroads. There are no heavy-lift/project cargo ships in the domestic fleet, but ships can compete for higher value cargo, such as on the Great Lakes and in the carriage of automobiles. The Great Lakes region is a hub for industrial activity. The Great Lakes region, once a center of industrial production, still plays a prominent role in auto manufacturing, grain milling, paper manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, and dairy product processing. However, industries in the region are no longer shipping their products over the Great Lakes, except for cement and gypsum. U.S.-built car carriers now transport automobiles to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, while foreign-built carriers are used for other routes due to competition from railroads and trucks. In 2014, Congress requested MARAD to submit a national maritime strategy for increasing the use and size of the U.S. fleet. Suggestions from industry included expanding legal restrictions favoring U.S.-flag vessels, enforcing existing restrictions, and increasing appropriations to MARAD programs. General Electric Corp. (GE) was the only shipper to participate in the symposium. The General Electric Corp. (GE) representative at the symposium emphasized the importance of U.S. carriers being desirable to use. Despite federal efforts to support the U.S. merchant marine, the high cost of shipping due to new ship capital costs limits availability of certain ship types in the domestic fleet. This leads domestic shippers to seek alternative transport methods, hindering domestic shipyards' production economies. Federal policies have raised the cost of domestic shipping, leading customers to choose land-based transport over ships. This has boosted the use of oceangoing barges instead of U.S. ships, impacting the merchant fleet and shipbuilders. Policymakers are urged to consider the success of river barges and address the cost issue in coastal shipping. Federal policies have increased the cost of domestic shipping, causing customers to opt for land-based transport over ships. This shift has led to a rise in the use of oceangoing barges instead of U.S. ships, affecting the merchant fleet and shipbuilders. Policymakers are advised to examine the effectiveness of river barges and tackle the cost issue in coastal shipping. Congress has been seeking information on various aspects of coastal shipping since 1916, with a focus on crewing requirements, ship costs, and the potential for automation in cargo handling at ports. The high cost of domestic coastal shipping is causing a decline in the cargo base, leading to a greater demand for U.S. ships and mariners."
