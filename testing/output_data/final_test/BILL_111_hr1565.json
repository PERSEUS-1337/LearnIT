She also voted against declarations of World War I and II, and worked for peace outside of Congress. In 1924, Mary Teresa Norton became the first Democratic woman elected to the House of Representatives. Mary Norton, representing New Jersey's 12th Congressional District from 1925 to 1951, chaired the Committee on the District of Columbia from 1931 to 1937, effectively governing the city. She also became the first woman to chair a major political party in a State in 1934. Norton played a key role in drafting and passing the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1964, Patsy Takemoto Mink became the first Asian-American woman elected to the House of Representatives. Patsy Mink, a trailblazing American woman, served in the House of Representatives representing Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 1965 to 1977 and again from 1991 until her death in 2002.

Mink also played a key role in passing legislation to support school construction in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and established the Democratic Women's Caucus in 1995. Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to the House of Representatives in 1968, was a fierce advocate for women's rights, democracy, and equal rights.
