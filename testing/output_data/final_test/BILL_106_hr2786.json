    "content": "The \"Interstate Transmission Act\" aims to expand, enhance, and improve transmission networks to support competitive power markets and increase interstate commerce in electricity. It also emphasizes the need to maintain and improve the reliability of electric service through the reform of transmission service regulation. The \"Interstate Transmission Act\" amends the Federal Power Act to include unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at retail. The Commission will determine which facilities are used for transmission after consulting with State regulatory authorities. The Federal Power Act is amended to define terms related to the sale and distribution of electric energy, including bundled retail sales and unbundled local distribution services. The Act also clarifies that interstate commerce includes consumption in foreign countries. The Federal Power Act is amended to define terms related to the sale and distribution of electric energy, including unbundled local distribution services and transmission of electric energy sold at retail. The Federal Power Act is amended to define terms related to the sale and distribution of electric energy, including unbundled local distribution services and transmission of electric energy sold at retail. The term 'public utility' is clarified to include persons owning or operating facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission, as well as transmitting utilities for regulating rates and conditions for electric energy transmission. The Federal Power Act is amended to include new standards for establishing rates, charges, terms, and conditions for transmission service. Section 203 of the Act is repealed. The Commission allows transmitting utilities to recover all costs related to transmission services, including facility enlargement. For services using post-enactment facilities, the Commission considers incremental costs and benefits to interconnected systems. Rates, charges, terms, and conditions must meet certain requirements. The Commission promotes efficient transmission of electricity, network expansion, and new technologies by regional organizations. It aims to prevent cost shifting and ensure fair and non-discriminatory pricing policies. The Commission encourages innovative pricing policies voluntarily filed by transmitting utilities to incentivize participation and formation. The Commission promotes voluntary participation in regional transmission organizations, limits multiple rates for transmission service, minimizes cost shifting among customers, and encourages efficient operation of the transmission grid. The Commission may permit negotiated rates for transmission services without regard to costs if individual companies are willing to pay, without recovering costs from other customers. Additionally, the Commission may consider effective competition when reviewing transmission rates. The Commission may allow market-based rates for transmission services under this Act if it determines that relevant markets are competitive. Within specified timeframes, the Commission must establish definitions and standards to implement the Act's provisions. SEC. 6. ELECTRIC RELIABILITY STANDARDS. Part II of the Federal Power Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 216, focusing on electric reliability standards. A transmitting utility may require its transmission customers to observe policies and standards adopted by an electric reliability organization approved by the Commission. The Commission has authority to investigate and address any issues with these policies or standards. If a policy or standard approved by an electric reliability organization or its affiliate is found to be unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, or preferential, the Commission can disapprove and prohibit its application, remanding the matter for further consideration. SEC. 217 of the Federal Power Act promotes the voluntary development of regional transmission organizations. The Commission may approve the formation of regional transmission organizations to enhance electric energy transmission in interstate commerce. Preferably, participation is voluntary, structure is approved by utilities, and market incentives exist for investment in transmission facilities and technologies. No order under this Act can require a utility to transfer operational control of facilities to an independent system operator. Entities denied services by a regional transmission organization can file a complaint with the Commission if found unjust, discriminatory, or against the public interest, the Commission may order the provision of services at reasonable rates. The Commission may order the provision of services at rates and on terms and conditions in accordance with section 215 of this Act."
