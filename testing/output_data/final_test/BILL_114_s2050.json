    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Education Loan Modification Act of 2015\". It includes findings and purpose. Congress finds that there is over $1.3 trillion in outstanding student loan debt in the US, including $150 billion in private education loans. In 2008, 81% of undergraduates with over $40,000 in student loans had private education loans. A 2012 study reported 850,000 private student loan defaults totaling more than $8 billion. Limited lenders in the private education loan market hinder borrower options. The loan marketplace restricts borrowers with private education loans from restructuring or refinancing, leading to excessive debt burdens and potential default. Few private student lenders offer flexible repayment options to mitigate defaults. Excessive student debt hinders economic activity, threatens homeownership, and limits opportunities for economic expansion. The Act aims to promote economic growth by allowing borrowers of private education loans to refinance their loans, fostering competition, addressing market inefficiencies, and encouraging innovation in the private education lending and refinancing markets. Financial institutions are encouraged to assist private student loan borrowers facing financial difficulties to ensure safe lending practices. The Act aims to promote economic growth by allowing borrowers of private education loans to refinance their loans and encouraging innovation in the private education refinancing markets. It also seeks to promote the participation of private capital in these markets. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"private education loan\" is defined as in the Truth in Lending Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury, not the Secretary of Education. SEC. 4. TEMPORARY AUTHORITY TO CREATE A CREDIT FACILITY TO INCREASE MARKET EFFICIENCY IN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. The Secretary is authorized to establish lending, purchase, and credit facilities to provide refinancing opportunities and loan adjustments for borrowers struggling with private education loans. This aims to improve payment sustainability and reduce delinquency and default. The Secretary aims to benefit borrowers with private student debt by ensuring lower interest rates to support economic activities like home purchases and small business formation, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Director of the program. The Secretary, in consultation with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, must establish a compliance system before setting up a facility under this subsection. Mechanisms created should not incur any net cost to the Federal Government, as determined jointly by the Secretary, the Secretary of Education, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Prior to exercising authority, the Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register seeking comments on terms, methodology, loan modifications, and relief for borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. The Secretary will provide relief for income, ensure no net cost to the Federal Government, and prevent extraordinary gains by market participants holding distressed loans. A report will be submitted on market liquidity, loan financing status, public economic benefits, funds for a private education loan program, and limited access to loans by borrowers. The Secretary will implement credit mechanisms to address limited access to loans by borrowers and report on the macroeconomic benefits and benefits to private education loan borrowers. Annual reports will be provided to relevant committees on the utilization and impact of the authority granted under this section. The House of Representatives will receive reports on program utilization and financial performance. A national awareness campaign will target private education loan borrowers. Authority expires three years after credit facility establishment. The credit facility established under this Act will cease new lending, purchase, or other activities within 5 years of enactment. Congress believes that federal financial institutions and private entities should use their available authorities to help borrowers of private education loans refinance existing loans without increasing costs to taxpayers or benefiting market participants holding distressed loans."
