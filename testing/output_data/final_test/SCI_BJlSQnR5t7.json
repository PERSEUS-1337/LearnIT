    "content": "Recent work has focused on combining kernel methods and deep learning. Introducing Deepstr\u00f6m networks, a new neural network architecture that replaces top dense layers of standard convolutional architectures with an approximation of a kernel function using the Nystr\u00f6m approximation. This approach is highly flexible, compatible with any kernel function, and allows for the exploitation of multiple kernels. Deepstr\u00f6m networks achieve top performance on datasets like SVHN and CIFAR100 with few learnable parameters, ideal for small training sets. Multiple kernel usage, including a Deepstr\u00f6m setting, is explored. Deep learning and kernel machines are seen as complementary methods, with deep learning requiring large datasets to fully utilize its potential. Kernel machines are powerful tools for learning nonlinear relations in data and are well suited for problems with limited training sets. They extend linear methods to nonlinear ones with theoretical guarantees but do not scale well to large training datasets and do not learn features from the data. Research in deep learning has evolved as a parallel strategy to kernel methods, with some studies exploring the transfer of concepts between the two domains. This paper explores mixing deep learning and kernels by focusing on convolutional networks. It introduces Deepstr\u00f6m networks, which replace dense layers in a convolutional neural network with an adaptive approximation of a kernel function. Inspired by Deep Fried Convnets, this work revisits the concept of combining convolutional neural networks and kernels using Fastfood, a kernel approximation technique. The method discussed in the curr_chunk is a flexible approach for using any kernel function in Nystr\u00f6m kernel approximation, allowing for the use of multiple different kernels. It also introduces a Deepstr\u00f6m variant that utilizes Nystr\u00f6m kernel approximation for each feature map output by the neural network's convolutional part, with a limited number of parameters. Our architecture uses a limited number of parameters, making it effective for learning with small training sets. Experiments on various datasets show that our method compares well to standard approaches while requiring fewer parameters. It can handle limited training set sizes and exploit multiple kernels for multiple kernel learning. The paper discusses the Deepstr\u00f6m network, which leverages information from multiple feature maps in convolution networks through Deepstr\u00f6m layers. It also covers kernel approximation methods like Nystr\u00f6m and random Fourier features, and presents the Deep Fried Convnet architecture. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the Deepstr\u00f6m network in classification tasks with small training sets. Kernel approximation methods like Nystr\u00f6m and random features have been proposed to make kernel methods scalable. Nystr\u00f6m approximation involves approximating the kernel matrix by a low-rank decomposition, while random features approximation maps input features into a low-dimensional space where dot products approximate the kernel function well. Nystr\u00f6m approximation computes a low-rank approximation by randomly subsampling a subset of instances from the training set. The Nystr\u00f6m nonlinear representation of a single example x is approximated using Random Kitchen Sinks (RKS) and Fastfood methods. RKS approximates a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with a random feature map, while Fastfood reduces computational cost for the Gaussian kernel by approximating the matrix Q. The Fastfood method approximates the matrix Q in Eq. 2 using diagonal and Hadamard matrices, along with a random permutation matrix and an hyperparameter \u03c3. It is used in Deep Fried Convnets to replace dense layers with a Fastfood approximation of a kernel in a deep learning architecture. This allows for combining kernel approximation with deep learning. The Fastfood method is used in Deep Fried Convnets to replace dense layers with a Fastfood approximation of a kernel in a deep learning architecture. This significantly reduces computation cost and the number of parameters in the fully-connected layers of the network. The method applies the Fastfood feature map to the convolutional representation instead of fully-connected layers, resulting in a feature representation dedicated to RBF kernels. Deepstr\u00f6m Networks are introduced as an alternative to Deep Fried Convnets, based on Nystr\u00f6m approximation and not limited to RBF kernels. They combine the characteristics of Nystr\u00f6m approximation and convolutional neural networks, allowing the use of multiple kernels and finding an appropriate kernel function. The Nystr\u00f6m kernel approximation involves an empirical kernel map that can recover the kernel matrix using a positive semi-definite matrix. The Deepstr\u00f6m network architecture includes convolutional blocks and a Deepstr\u00f6m layer followed by standard dense layers. The Deepstr\u00f6m network architecture includes convolutional blocks and a Deepstr\u00f6m layer which computes the kernel between the output of the conv block and representations of train samples. The Nystr\u00f6m approximation feature map is given by T with x i \u2208 L, and it can be seen as an \"empirical kernel map\". Learning a metric W in the empirical feature space instead of assuming it to be equal to K 11 allows for learning a kernel through its Nystr\u00f6m feature representation, termed Adapative Deepstr\u00f6m. The Adapative Deepstr\u00f6m Network is an alternative to Deep Fried Convnets, utilizing the Nystr\u00f6m approximation for integrating kernel functions in deep nets. This method can handle multiple kernels and uses a nonlinear representation function computed with the Nystr\u00f6m approximation. Starting from Deep Fried Convnets, the Deepstr\u00f6m nets implement a function f(x) = (lc \u2022 \u03c6 nys \u2022 conv)(x). The Nystr\u00f6m representation of a sample x in the Deepstr\u00f6m nets involves computing a kernel function on a subsample L of training instances processed by convolutional layers. This allows for flexibility in using different kernel functions and combining multiple kernels. However, there is a challenge in computing K, which is addressed through experimental results. The Deepstr\u00f6m networks are explored for classification tasks, showing potential with various kernels and minimal subsample size. The approach allows learning new classes with few training samples due to reduced parameter learning. Multiple kernel architecture is investigated to overcome hyperparameter selection challenges.

Experiments were conducted on image classification datasets using different convolutional architectures. The pretrained convolutional layers were shared among the architectures, with variations in the top layers. The study compares different convolutional architectures for image classification tasks. Dense architectures with relu activation function and varied output dimensions were considered. Deep Fried uses the Fastfood approximation with random features, while Deepstrom proposes a multiple kernel approach with varying subset sizes and kernel types. Models were trained to optimize cross entropy. The study compared different convolutional architectures for image classification tasks, optimizing cross entropy with Adam optimizer. Dropout was used on representation layers, and experiments were conducted using Keras and Tensorflow. The aim was to investigate the potential of the architecture, not to achieve state-of-the-art results. Results were compared with other models using a shared convolutional model, without using data augmentation or extensive tuning. The study compared different convolutional architectures for image classification tasks using VGG19 on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets. Deepstr\u00f6m networks were compared to Deep Fried Convnets and classical convolutional networks. The number of parameters was varied to highlight classification accuracy with respect to memory space. Results were plotted in FIG2, showing accuracy vs. parameters for different architectures. Deepstr\u00f6m models showed increasing complexity with subsample size, indicating no need for a large subsample. The Deepstr\u00f6m network achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters compared to classical networks and Deep Fried Convnets. The choice of kernel function is flexible, with different kernels performing best on different datasets. Adaptive variants of the Deepstr\u00f6m model also show benefits, indicating robustness and improved performance. The Deepstr\u00f6m model shows benefits with adaptive variants and the ability to work with few training samples. Experiments demonstrate learning final layers from very few samples using a trained convolution model. The study explores the performance of Deepstr\u00f6m architectures on CIFAR100 using different training sets. It focuses on domain adaptation and leveraging additional information from subsample sets. Adaptive Deepstr\u00f6m variants are compared with other architectures on various datasets. The study compares adaptive Deepstr\u00f6m variants with other architectures on various datasets. Deepstrom architectures outperform baselines on most settings, except for 5 training samples per class on MNIST. ADSR and ADSC outperform Adaptive DeepFried and perform on par or better than Dense architectures on the hardest CIFAR100 dataset. No single kernel-based Deepstrom architecture dominates on all settings. The study shows that no single kernel-based Deepstrom architecture dominates on all settings, indicating the potential benefits of combining multiple kernels. Results using multiple kernels in two different ways are reported, including a strategy that automatically handles hyperparameters for improved performance on the CIFAR10 dataset. Deepstr\u00f6m is represented as a horizontal line, with results for subsample sizes of 2, 4, and 8. The Multiple kernel strategy optimally adapts the kernel combination without prior choice on the RBF bandwith hyper-parameter. Another architecture utilizes Multiple Deepstr\u00f6m approximations with Nystr\u00f6m approximations dedicated to each output of a single feature map. Results on CIFAR100 are presented, showing the best performances obtained through grid-searching on various hyper-parameters. The Dense model includes one or two hidden layers with varying numbers of neurons. Deepfried is the adaptive variant with varying stacks. Deepstr\u00f6m, a hybrid architecture combining deep networks and kernel methods, outperforms baselines by using Nystr\u00f6m approximation to reduce parameters and enable learning from few samples. It allows for multiple kernels and architectures, as shown in 2-dimensional \u03c6 nys representations of CIFAR10 test samples. In a 2-dimensional representation space of CIFAR10 test samples, 10 classes are well separated with a small subsample size of 2 and two different kernels. Designing Deepstr\u00f6m Convnets on lower level features from convolution blocks can achieve state-of-the-art performance with larger subsamples."
