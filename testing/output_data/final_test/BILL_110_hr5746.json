    "content": "The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" may be cited as the official title. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on hydrogen infrastructure and fuel costs. The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" allows a tax credit for hydrogen infrastructure and fuel costs. The credit includes 30% of infrastructure costs up to $200,000 for eligible hydrogen production and distribution facilities. The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" offers a tax credit for eligible hydrogen production and distribution facilities placed in service after December 31, 2007. The credit covers 30% of infrastructure costs up to $200,000. The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" provides a tax credit for eligible hydrogen production facilities with a capacity of up to 25 kilowatts. The credit is the lesser of 30% of hydrogen expenses or $2,000. For devices not owned throughout the year, the $2,000 limit is prorated. The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" offers tax credits for eligible hydrogen energy conversion devices based on their production capacity. Devices with more than 25 but less than 100 kilowatts of electricity receive a $4,000 credit, while those with at least 100 kilowatts receive a $6,000 credit. Eligible devices are defined as hydrogen energy conversion devices owned by the taxpayer. The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" provides tax credits for hydrogen energy conversion devices owned by the taxpayer, which convert hydrogen into electricity. If the primary user is provided a written statement as the owner, they will be treated as such for tax purposes. The \"Hydrogen Tax Incentives Act of 2008\" offers tax credits for hydrogen energy conversion devices that convert hydrogen into electricity or use it in combustion engines. The basis of the property is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed, and the credit can be applied along with other business credits. The tax credit under section 162 is treated as a credit listed in section 38(b) for the taxable year. The personal credit allowed under subsection (a) should not exceed the regular tax liability reduced by certain credits over the tentative minimum tax. Any deduction or credit for a cost used to determine the subsection (a) credit will be reduced by the amount of the credit attributable to that cost. The Secretary may recapture credits for property no longer eligible. Taxpayers can elect not to take the credit. Regulations will be prescribed for implementation. The section does not apply to costs after a 3-year period from enactment. The tax code is amended to include new paragraphs related to hydrogen infrastructure and fuel credits under section 30D. The tax code is amended to include new paragraphs related to hydrogen infrastructure and fuel credits under section 30D. A new item is inserted after section 30C in the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The tax code is amended to include new paragraphs related to hydrogen infrastructure and fuel credits under section 30D, effective after December 31, 2007."
