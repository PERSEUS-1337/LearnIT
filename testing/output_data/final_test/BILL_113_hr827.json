    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Security for Investors and Providing Closure Act of 2013\" or the \"Improving SIPC Act of 2013\". Customer payment during pending action is addressed in Section 2. Section 11 of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 is amended to allow customers of the debtor to elect to receive a one-time payment from the SIPC Fund during pending actions. Customers of a debtor can elect to receive a one-time payment from the SIPC Fund within 180 days of SIPC allowing the election. The payment amount is limited to the customer's net equity claim against the debtor or a set cap. SIPC sets a cap on one-time payments not exceeding $500,000 for all customers of the debtor. Customers receiving a one-time payment forfeit SIPC advance and SIPC gains subrogation rights once the customer recovers funds. Customers of the debtor can make an election to recover an amount equal to their net equity claim. SIPC will notify customers of their rights and provide assistance in making the election. Certificates of deposit are treated as cash deposited by the debtor. Customers of the debtor can recover their net equity claim by making an election. SIPC allows judicial review for those not identified as customers. SIPC can issue necessary regulations. The term 'debtor' refers to the broker or dealer in the action. Customers of the debtor can recover their net equity claim by making an election within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. A person's qualification as a customer under one section of the Securities Investor Protection Act does not affect their qualification under any other provision of the Act."
