The Karst Region of Puerto Rico is a unique geological formation critical for maintaining aquifers that supply much of Puerto Rico's water. It is threatened by unchecked development that could permanently damage these aquifers and cause irreparable harm to the environment. Protecting the Karst Region is essential for public health and welfare, as it contains diverse habitats for endangered species and is valuable for research in tropical forest management. The purpose of this Act is to authorize cooperation between federal agencies and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in acquiring, restoring, protecting, and managing lands and waters in the Karst Region, National Forest System, and National Wildlife Refuge System in Puerto Rico. Coordination is necessary to conserve critical natural resources threatened by outside development.
