    "content": "The \"Energy Independence Act of 2000\" requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a strategic plan for energy self-sufficiency by 2010, including legislative and regulatory recommendations. $20,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. Additionally, a Federal Government Fuel Cell Pilot Program is established. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to acquire up to 100 200 kilowatt fuel cell power plants or up to 20 megawatts of power from such plants for use at federally owned facilities. Funding will cover purchase, installation, and maintenance costs. All fuel cell systems must be assembled in the United States, and site selection for power plant locations will be based on federally owned or operated facilities. Priority will be given to sites with specific attributes for the location of power plants acquired under the program, including being in nonattainment areas, sensitive computer operations, need for reliable power supply, remote locations, and supporting national security efforts. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for this purpose. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for this purpose. SEC. 4. PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS. The President, in coordination with several Secretaries, shall establish a program for demonstrating fuel cell proton exchange membrane technology in various applications, including buses. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for this purpose. The President, in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Transportation, will establish a proton exchange membrane fuel cell bus demonstration program from 2001 to 2003. The program will focus on hydrogen production, storage, and use in transit bus applications, including the development and operation of hydrogen delivery systems and on-site storage. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell bus demonstration program focuses on using hydrogen as a safe, renewable energy source for buses. It includes developing a compatible fuel cell power system, durability testing at a national facility, and implementing necessary codes and standards for safe hydrogen use. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell bus demonstration program aims to identify maintenance requirements and evaluate fleet performance on normal transit routes. All fuel cell systems acquired must be assembled in the United States. Authorization of appropriations is provided for implementing these measures. In carrying out this subsection, $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Federal agencies maintaining vehicle fleets must develop plans to transition to fuel cell technology by fiscal year 2010, incorporating results from demonstration programs. Life-cycle cost benefit analyses by agencies must consider environmental and power reliability factors. State and local governments may receive incentives. State and local governments can receive grants from the Secretary of Energy for using fuel cell technology, including for powering motor vehicles. The grants require a 10 percent matching contribution from the recipient. $110,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005 for this program."
