    "content": "The Depleted Uranium Munitions Study Act of 2003 includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings, purposes, study of health effects, EPA studies on environmental contamination, and environmental mitigation and cleanup requirements for depleted uranium. Congress acknowledges the health risks posed by depleted uranium munitions used by the United States Armed Forces in various conflicts, including the Persian Gulf War and conflicts in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Depleted uranium munitions have been used in Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro, burning upon impact and creating inhalable aerosol particles. The United States and the United Kingdom have used depleted uranium munitions in conflicts, and no definitive cause has been established for illnesses related to their use. The Gulf War Syndrome affects around 130,000 US Armed Forces members who served in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War. Depleted uranium munitions have been linked to health issues, with claims from the Iraqi Government. Some navies are phasing out the use of depleted uranium munitions, while it has spread to over 20 nations. The 1949 Geneva Convention outlines precautions to avoid harming civilians in war. The 1977 Protocol to the 1949 Geneva Convention prohibits causing unnecessary harm to civilians, which includes the use of depleted uranium munitions that may result in superfluous injury or suffering. The purposes of this Act are to study the health effects and environmental contamination from depleted uranium exposure, and to clean up and mitigate contamination at sites in the US where depleted uranium was used or produced. The Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct a study on the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions on veterans and their children. The term \"uranium-exposed veteran\" refers to members of the US Armed Forces who had contact with depleted uranium munitions during active duty. The study will assess individuals who were exposed to depleted uranium munitions in various ways, including fires at depots, working in environments with depleted uranium dust, being in structures or vehicles struck by depleted uranium munitions, climbing on or entering affected equipment or structures, and providing medical treatment to affected Armed Forces members. Additionally, a public health assessment will be conducted on individuals with an epidemiological link to US military installations where depleted uranium munitions have been used. The Directors will submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of the Act, detailing the results of the study on individuals exposed to depleted uranium munitions and an assessment of related diseases or conditions. The report will also include information on production facilities in the US where depleted uranium or munitions have been produced. EPA will conduct studies on environmental contamination by depleted uranium. The Secretary of Defense must provide a list of depleted uranium sites in the US to the EPA, followed by environmental studies on each site. The EPA will evaluate soil, air, water, and vegetation contamination by depleted uranium. A report must be submitted within two years to relevant committees. The government will provide a report to relevant committees on the extent of depleted uranium contamination at studied sites, along with site-specific recommendations for mitigation and cleanup. General recommendations for cleanup of sites with depleted uranium on foreign lands will also be included. SEC. 6. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPLETED URANIUM. The Secretary of Defense must develop a cleanup plan for depleted uranium sites within a year of receiving a required report. The plan should prioritize cleanup and mitigation, with a copy submitted to relevant committees. Cleanup efforts must begin according to the plan's specifications after it is filed. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that cleanup and mitigation efforts for depleted uranium sites are conducted in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Progress reports on the cleanup must be submitted annually to the EPA and congressional committees until completion."
