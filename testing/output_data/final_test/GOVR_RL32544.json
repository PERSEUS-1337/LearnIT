    "content": "The EMP Commission was established by Congress in FY2001 due to concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. critical infrastructure and military to EMP attacks. In 2008, the Commission presented a report to the House Armed Services Committee assessing the effects of an EMP attack on national infrastructures and made recommendations for preparation and protection. The report highlighted the dependency of society on the electrical power system and the damage mechanisms of EMP. The EMP Commission warned about the potential catastrophic consequences of an EMP attack on the electrical power system, comparing it to the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. They highlighted the risk of widespread power grid collapse leading to cascading effects on critical infrastructures, potentially lasting for weeks or months. The Commission also emphasized the lack of robust capabilities in assessing and managing EMP threats, raising concerns about the potential loss of life in urban and suburban communities. The EMP Commission warned about the catastrophic consequences of an EMP attack on the U.S. military and civilian infrastructure. In 2004, they stated that the increasing complexity of military systems made them vulnerable to EMP effects. However, in 2008, the Commission suggested that the nation's vulnerability could be reduced through coordinated efforts between the private and public sectors. The cost for improved security was deemed modest compared to potential damages. The EMP Commission's reports in 2004 and 2008 highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure to High Altitude EMP (HEMP) and potential threats from High Power Microwave (HPM) devices. The cost of improving security against EMP attacks was considered modest compared to the potential damages. Concerns were raised about the attractiveness of smaller-scale HPM weapons to terrorist groups in the future. The EMP Commission, reestablished by P.L. 109-163, monitors and investigates vulnerabilities in electric-dependent systems of the Department of Defense, government agencies, and the private sector. The Commission assesses the threat of Electromagnetic Pulse Attack and makes recommendations to reduce vulnerabilities. The EMP Commission presented a report to the House Armed Services Committee consisting of five volumes, including a classified Threat Assessment and an unclassified Assessment of U.S. Critical Infrastructure. The report highlighted the catastrophic consequences of High Altitude EMP and the current vulnerability of critical infrastructures. It also noted a decrease in research and facilities related to EMP phenomena, posing a risk to national security. The EMP Commission's 2004 report highlighted the increasing threat of EMP attacks from various actors, including rogue nations and terrorist organizations. The report proposed a five-year plan to protect critical infrastructures from EMP and other large-scale attacks. The 2008 EMP Commission report discussed vulnerabilities and interdependencies among 10 U.S. critical infrastructures, highlighting limited EMP vulnerability testing. The 2008 EMP Commission report highlighted limited EMP vulnerability testing for critical infrastructures, expressing concern about the reduction in technical knowledge needed to support manual operations during emergencies. The Commission warned that the country is losing technical competence in managing the effects of nuclear weapons and EMP on modern systems. Little has been done by the private sector to protect against these threats. The Commission has raised concerns about the lack of protection from electromagnetic pulse threats in the private sector. Commercial electronic systems in the US could be severely damaged by an EMP attack. Most state-based emergency responders are not actively preparing for such an attack, according to a survey of state Adjutants General. According to a survey of state Adjutants General, 96% expressed concern over an EMP attack, but most had not analyzed the effects or prepared electronic equipment. None were actively planning for such an attack. Some analysts believe the US infrastructure would survive a large-scale EMP attack, with military communications and civilian phone calls still functioning. Limited testing suggests modern equipment may be resistant to EMP effects. Some testing has shown that modern commercial equipment and military systems using commercial equipment are resistant to electromagnetic pulse effects. However, some analysts believe past U.S. military testing may have been flawed, leading to inaccurate conclusions about equipment resistance. As EMP technology advances, modern electronics are becoming more vulnerable to disruption, potentially causing widespread damage to electronics and the power grid in the event of an EMP attack. Recovery from such an attack could take years. Commission members have expressed concerns that a lack of visible effort to protect computer systems and critical infrastructures could invite an EMP attack. A high-altitude EMP effect from a low-yield nuclear explosion could cause widespread electronics damage without immediate fatalities, potentially reducing the risk of massive nuclear retaliation. The threat of an EMP attack, whether from a rogue nation or terrorist group, poses a new incentive for developing nuclear capabilities. Electromagnetic energy can be weaponized through methods like High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and High-Power Microwave (HPM) emissions, causing widespread damage to electronic equipment. High-Power Microwave (HPM) energy is produced as a near-instantaneous pulse through special equipment, damaging electronics in a smaller area. Unlike HEMP weapons, HPM weapons are smaller in scale and require lower technology, making them accessible to extremist groups. HPM can damage computers similar to HEMP but in a smaller area. High-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) is a powerful energy field that can overload computer circuitry, causing damage similar to a lightning strike. The effects of HEMP were discovered during a 1962 nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean, disrupting electronic equipment in Hawaii. HEMP can span thousands of miles and affect all of the continental United States if detonated at the right altitude. Metallic conductors like wires and power lines can pick up the energy shockwave and damage electronic systems in cars, airplanes, and communications equipment. A high altitude nuclear explosion (HEMP) produces three major energy components that can damage electronic equipment. The first energy shockwave overloads circuitry, the second component is similar to a lightning strike, and the third component further disrupts equipment. The rapid rise time of the first component can destroy protective measures, allowing the second component to cause more damage. The third energy component of a high altitude nuclear explosion is a longer-lasting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) signal that damages long-lines electronic equipment. It consists of two components called \"blast\" and \"heave,\" which distort the earth's magnetic field due to the expanding fireball and heating of the atmosphere below the bomb. These slow MHD signals depend on the dynamics of cloud or fireball expansion. The MHD \"late-time\" power surge from a high altitude nuclear explosion can overload equipment connected to power grids and telecommunications infrastructure. This effect, dependent on the total energy of the detonation, is usually associated with larger yield nuclear weapons. Smaller isolated systems are usually disrupted only by the initial HEMP effect. Microwaves, characterized by electromagnetic energy with small wavelengths, can be used for communication or radar. High-power microwaves can be generated as an electromagnetic pulse through special devices like flux compression generators. HPM weapons can be created using reactive chemicals or batteries. HPM energy can be focused using antennas to target electronic equipment effectively. High-power microwaves can be used as weapons to disrupt electronic equipment and potentially cause harm to individuals. Studies on the effects of electromagnetic energy weapons are limited or classified, but it is known that a powerful HEMP field can interfere with radio frequency links and damage electronic devices over long distances. Connecting electronic devices to metal can increase their vulnerability to HPM attacks. High-power microwaves can disrupt electronic equipment and cause harm. A widespread HEMP effect could lead to long-term disruption of power grid, fuel distribution, transportation systems, and more. HPM weapons have a shorter range but can melt circuitry or cause equipment to fail gradually. In 2001, a Comanche helicopter disrupted GPS systems with a low-level energy pulse from HPM weapons. A HEMP attack could involve a nuclear warhead detonated above the mid-western states to disrupt computers on both coasts. The effects of HEMP and HPM weapons diminish with distance, and turning off electronic equipment can reduce the risk of damage. A nuclear device must explode at a high altitude to maximize the HEMP effect. To achieve maximum coverage for the HEMP effect, a nuclear device must explode very high in the atmosphere, too far from the earth's surface to cause direct injury or damage. HEMP is instantaneous and does not affect people, while HPM weapons can cause injury or even be fatal to individuals in the path of the power beam. Both HEMP and HPM can immobilize vehicles with modern electronic systems. Older electrical components are more resilient to these effects. Induction coils for spark ignition are more massive and tolerant of EMP. Modern electronics are shrinking, making them more vulnerable to electromagnetic interference. Countries with older technology may be less vulnerable to HEMP or HPM effects. The simultaneous loss of communications and power from an EMP attack would complicate system restoration. Recovery times for electrical systems are provided in a 2008 Commission report. The need to improve the electric power system presents an opportunity for enhancement. The Commission recommended that the federal government validate proposed enhancements to protect systems against damage from EMP attack and fund security-related elements. A study in 2007 focused on the economic impact of a HEMP attack on the Baltimore-Washington-Richmond area caused by a high-altitude EMP pulse from a nuclear device detonated 30-80 miles above ground. A high-altitude EMP device detonated between 30-80 miles above ground impacting an area at least 500 miles in radius. The economic loss in the Baltimore-Washington-Richmond area is only a fraction of the total damage from a regional EMP event. The report presents estimates of economic damage based on disruption to electronic and power infrastructure. The study estimated that an EMP attack on the Baltimore-Washington-Richmond region could lead to economic output loss exceeding $770 billion, equivalent to 7% of the nation's annual GDP. The analysis focused on the impact of the EMP on critical infrastructure, particularly the electrical grid and communication systems. Damage was calculated based on scenarios where 50% of the capacity of both systems was affected, resulting in the economy operating at only 25% capacity. An EMP attack on the Baltimore-Washington-Richmond region could result in economic losses of $9 billion to $34 billion, requiring one month of recovery. In the worst-case scenario, the damage could be widespread and last for years, with complicating factors slowing down the recovery process. Replacement equipment may quickly exhaust supplies and manufacturing capacity. In the aftermath of an EMP attack on the Baltimore-Washington-Richmond region, restoration efforts would face challenges due to limited supplies and manufacturing capacity. Skilled labor and infrastructure elements may be in short supply, complicating recovery. High-altitude EMP effects would extend beyond the immediate area, hindering restoration in an orderly fashion. Faraday cage protection can make electronic equipment more resistant to EMP by redirecting electromagnetic surges. To protect electronic equipment from EMP, special measures like surge protectors, wire termination procedures, transformers, spark gaps, and electrical filters are necessary. Even with shielding, a powerful nuclear blast could still cause damage. Portable Data Centers (PDC) offer a solution by housing computer equipment on racks inside modular rooms that can be easily moved and connected. A portable module can hold up to 1,200 servers with power supply and cooling system, fitting into a 40-foot shipping container for portability. This method aims to reduce computer facility installation costs and enhance EMP protection with welded metal enclosures and unique construction methods. A portable module, designed to block EMP frequencies and reduce weight for portability, could be mass-produced to protect U.S. computer systems from EMP attacks. DOD has published standards for protecting against High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse, but not all military systems are currently hardened against EMP. Some DOD systems rely on commercial facilities for support. In 2004, the EMP Commission noted that the DOD had not prepared for EMP attacks in tabletop exercises. The Defense Science Board Task Force published a report on current threat environments in April 2005. Hardening military and commercial equipment against HEMP or HPM could add 2-3% to the total cost if engineered into the original design. Retrofitting existing military equipment with hardening could add 3-10% to the cost. The Defense Science Board (DSB) published a report on current and emerging threat environments for the Department of Defense (DOD), highlighting the increasing likelihood of U.S. forces operating in nuclear environments due to the proliferation of nuclear weapon capabilities. Decision makers should be concerned about the survivability of critical warfighting elements in such environments. The Defense Science Board (DSB) report emphasizes the importance of ensuring the survivability of critical warfighting elements in nuclear environments. Factors such as reliance on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics, aging systems, and neglect of nuclear hardening pose challenges. Testing in 1992 at the Nevada Test Site focused on protecting military systems against HEMP effects from nuclear detonations, while the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibits nuclear explosions in certain environments. The U.S. military is conducting research on pulsed-power HPM electromagnetic weapons at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. These weapons can disrupt missile trajectories, enemy communications, telemetry, and circuitry. Portable and reusable HPM weapons are being tested, which are effective even when fired from miles away. Portable and reusable HPM weapons, powered by batteries, can be focused like a laser beam to penetrate shielded electronics. Even the deepest bunkers with thick concrete walls are not safe from these weapons, as they can affect piloted aircraft above. Testing involves HPM devices on UAVs and the Air Force's Air-Launched Cruise Missile system. By 2010, the DOD plans to field air-launched UAVs with disposable and reusable HPM weapons to disrupt enemy computers. The Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) was a communications system used by the military in the continental United States to relay emergency messages using low frequency ground waves. However, it was vulnerable to EMP disruptions and direct attacks due to its fixed locations. After 1998, the USAF decommissioned GWEN and replaced it with the Single Channel Anti-Jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) Terminal, which is resistant to EMP and offers more flexibility. The high frequency (EHF) technology is resistant to EMP and offers more flexibility than GWEN. Potential U.S. adversaries like Russia, China, and North Korea could launch a crippling HEMP strike against the United States. Other nations such as the United Kingdom, France, India, Israel, and Pakistan could also develop HEMP capabilities. Iran acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and tested nuclear-warhead-capable missiles in 2006. Iran has conducted successful missile tests, with speculation that they may be preparing for an HEMP attack. There are concerns about Iran's long-range ballistic missile launches being a scare tactic. China is also mentioned as actively developing electromagnetic pulse weapons. China is actively developing electromagnetic pulse weapons and other electronic warfare systems, including offensive counter space weapons. They could have up to 60 ICBMs capable of striking the United States by 2010, with plans to replace 20 ICBMs with longer-range missiles. Russia also has the capability to create a HEMP effect over the United States. Russia has reportedly made extensive preparations to protect their infrastructure against HEMP effects, including hardening electronic equipment and providing training for personnel. They may also have leading physicists researching electronic warfare weapons. The United States needs to address the threat of electromagnetic pulse attacks and determine appropriate responses to potential widespread damage to electronics. The United States faces the challenge of determining the source of a HEMP attack and assessing the impact on its industrial base and critical infrastructure. The reliance on commercial satellites for military communications and the use of civilian Internet for administrative information could be compromised after a high altitude nuclear explosion. This raises concerns about the ability to effectively respond to military advances by other nations during such a crisis. Some observers believe that military information systems may be vulnerable to HEMP and HPM attacks, but the benefits of using advanced technology and maintaining connections to civilian Internet and satellite systems outweigh the risks. Studies on the effects of large-scale HEMP have been conducted by various defense agencies, but the application of these findings across military systems has been inconsistent. Some analysts argue that U.S. military systems may have strong protection against HEMP, while other weapons used for the battlefield have less protection. Limited testing has shown that modern commercial equipment can be resistant to EMP, and some military systems have been retrofitted for increased resistance. There is disagreement about the U.S. military's testing procedures for EMP survivability, with concerns about flawed conclusions. The Department of Homeland Security has developed National Planning Scenarios as part of its risk analysis mission. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has developed 15 National Planning Scenarios depicting high-consequence threat scenarios for homeland security preparedness. Despite efforts by EMP Commission members, DHS has not included EMP attacks in these scenarios. A single nuclear device detonated above the U.S. could have severe impacts on industrial capacity, economic stability, and military effectiveness. The proliferation of nuclear technology raises concerns about the potential for adversaries to use nuclear weapons for cyber warfare. The threat of a HEMP attack, once deterred by mutually assured destruction, is now more difficult to assess. The possibility of a rogue state using a small nuclear arsenal for a HEMP strike against the U.S. without fear of retaliation is a growing concern. A smaller-scale HPM weapon can be easily constructed using common electrical materials and chemical explosives, costing less than $2,000. In 2001, DOD developed two small HPM weapons for testing, one of which could be shipped via regular mail. This raises concerns about the potential for terrorist organizations or nations to possess and use such weapons. HPM devices, including suitcase-sized ones, are available for purchase from commercial vendors. The threat of terrorists using smaller-scale HPM weapons against U.S. critical infrastructure is difficult to assess. While an HPM bomb may not be attractive to terrorists due to its smaller explosion, some terrorist organizations are becoming aware of the advantages of an EMP attack on U.S. information systems. The use of HEMP and HPM energy weapons can damage electronic systems without direct harm to humans, but may impact nearby medical devices and civilian infrastructure. International human rights organizations may object to their development. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 requires coordination for protection against electromagnetic pulse attacks on electricity infrastructure. The Department of Defense provides funding to the Commission for preparing a final report on infrastructure protection against cyber attacks. The deadline for the report submission has been extended to November 30, 2008. Several CRS reports on cybercrime, cyberterrorism, network-centric operations, and nuclear weapons are referenced."
