    "content": "In the 1990s, Congress enacted guidelines for trade sanctions related to missile proliferation, requiring the President to impose sanctions against individuals or entities involved in trade of items listed in the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex. Subsequent legislation extended economic sanctions to countries contributing to the proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. In the late 1990s, economic sanctions for foreign policy purposes became less popular due to civilian casualties. Concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation increased after tests by India, Pakistan, and North Korea, North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, missile tests, reports of Iraq's weapons, Iran's noncompliance, and A.Q. Khan's nuclear sales discovery. The 2004 discovery of A.Q. Khan selling nuclear materials to North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and Libya raised concerns. The 111th Congress enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act, but there are worries about its implementation. Unfinished initiatives suggest Belarus, Burma, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Venezuela may support WMD proliferation. Recent events with North Korea and Iran, leaked diplomatic documents, and political power shifts are causing speculation in policy circles. The 112th Congress's approach to sanctions and proliferation concerns may be influenced by political power shifts and foreign policy issues like terrorism and regional stability. President Obama is reviewing U.S. export policy to streamline procedures and increase exports, which could impact statutes related to economic sanctions. This report provides a list of legal provisions requiring or authorizing sanctions. The 112th Congress may be influenced by political power shifts and foreign policy issues like terrorism and regional stability. President Obama is reviewing U.S. export policy to streamline procedures and increase exports, which could impact statutes related to economic sanctions. Legal provisions exist that require or authorize sanctions for violating U.S. nonproliferation norms, including criminal and civil penalties for developing, producing, or using chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 brought the criminal and civil penalties section of the United States Code in line with the requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It also authorized the President to suspend export privileges for violations. 18 U.S.C. 832 prohibits participation in nuclear weapons or WMD programs, with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Prohibition Improvement Act of 2004 added a section to the United States Code that makes it an offense to develop, possess, threaten to use, or use a radiological weapon against any person in the United States or a U.S. national, punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. 2332a prohibits the use, threat to use, attempt, or conspiracy to use WMD against a national of the United States or within the United States. The section added to the United States Code prohibits the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including explosives, chemicals, biological agents, toxins, radiation, or radioactivity. Those found guilty face imprisonment or death if death results. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 amended this section to establish criminal and civil penalties. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Prohibition Improvement Act of 2004 expanded the means of delivering WMD to include the U.S. mail service and foreign commerce, and consolidated WMD-related offenses in this chapter and section. The Arms Export Control Act authorizes U.S. military sales, loans, leases, and licensing of commercial arms sales to other countries.

Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act allows the President to control defense article imports and exports, establish guidelines for U.S. importers/exporters, and define the United States Munitions List. Violations may result in fines up to $1 million, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both.

The Nance/Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1999 granted civil action authority to the Secretary of State, while the Security Assistance Act of 2000 limited the President's authority to exempt foreign countries from certain licensing exceptions. The Prevention of Terrorist Access to Destructive Weapons Act of 2004 expanded requirements on the President to identify persons subject to laws restricting transactions related to weapons of mass destruction. Section 40 of Public Laws restricts transactions related to WMD, prohibiting exporting munitions to countries supporting terrorism or aiding in the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The President may rescind the Secretary's determination regarding countries developing WMDs by reporting to Congress, but Congress can block the rescission.

Exceptions may apply if found innocent by an MTCR adherent, advised by the State Department, or authorized by MTCR laws without fraud. The President may authorize the export, transfer, or trade of missile technology if it is to an MTCR adherent country or if it is essential to U.S. national security. Exceptions apply for defense services or articles provided by foreign persons. The President may waive sanctions for individuals if a foreign government, which is an MTCR adherent, addresses the violation adequately. Sanctions may also be lifted for individuals providing essential products or services to the U.S. in fulfillment of contracts entered into before sanctions were announced.

The definition of key terms in sanctions legislation, such as \"person\" and \"international understanding,\" has evolved over time to target specific countries and activities, as seen in the amendments made by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1992 and 1993. The Helms amendment in China narrowed the definition of \"person\" to include government activities affecting military aircraft. The Arms Control and Nonproliferation Act of 1999 added the definition of \"international understanding\" in relation to MTCR adherents. Sanctions are imposed on foreign persons contributing to chemical warfare efforts.
