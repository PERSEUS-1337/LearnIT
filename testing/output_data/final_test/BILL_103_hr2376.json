The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians are descendants of the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Bay Mills Band of Chippewa Indians are also recognized as distinct Indian tribes by the Federal Government. The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians have at least 1,000 eligible members residing close to their ancestral homeland. The Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, with at least 500 eligible members, resides close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the 1836 Treaty of Washington and 1855 Treaty of Detroit. They filed for reorganization of their tribal government in 1935 under the Indian Reorganization Act. The Bands, including the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, sought reorganization under the Indian Reorganization Act but were denied due to lack of funding. Despite this, they maintained viable tribal governments and formed the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association in 1948. This association successfully pursued a land claim with the Indian Claims Commission between 1948 and 1975. In 1975, the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association petitioned to form a government for the Bands under the Indian Reorganization Act, but the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not act on their request. The United States Government, the government of Michigan, and local governments have had continuous dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Bands since 1836. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
