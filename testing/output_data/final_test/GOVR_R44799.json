    "content": "The Senate considered the American Health Care Act from July 25 to July 28, 2017, and placed the bill back on the Senate calendar. Various budget resolutions and reports were released in 2017, including the FY2018 budget resolution, CBO's economic outlook update, and OMB's FY2018 Budget. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 was signed into law on May 5, 2017, providing funding for FY2017. The House passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, 2017, and a continuing resolution was signed on April 28, 2017. CBO also released The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook on March 30, 2017. The Office of Management and Budget released summary information for the FY2018 President's Budget on March 16, 2017, with the statutory debt limit reinstated at $19.809 trillion. Secretary Mnuchin informed Congress of Treasury's intent to use extraordinary measures to stay under the limit on March 8, 2017. CBO released The Budget and Economic Outlook : 2017 to 2027 on January 24, 2017, and Congress acted on significant budgetary legislation at the end of 2016. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution (CR) extending provisions of P.L. 114-113 through April 28, 2017. President Obama signed the bill into law (P.L. 114-254) on December 10, 2016. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases annual budget projections, including a baseline for federal spending and receipts over the next 10 years, which Congress uses for budget decisions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assists Congress in assessing the budget and economic situation to develop a budget resolution. The baseline serves as a benchmark for measuring the budgetary impact of legislative proposals and enforcing budget constraints. Changes in budget projections are categorized into legislative, economic, and technical changes. The Budget and Economic Outlook is typically released in January and updated after the President's Budget release and in August. The CBO released an update to the Budget and Economic Outlook in June 2017, projecting a budget deficit of $693 billion for FY2017. The deficit increase was mainly due to lower than expected revenues and increased federal loan subsidy costs. The forecast also projected a cumulative deficit of $10.112 trillion from FY2018 to FY2027, with most of the increase in outlays. The CBO released The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027 on January 24, 2017, projecting a deficit of $563 billion in FY2018 and $1,463 billion in FY2027. The forecast included federal budget deficit projections of $559 billion in FY2017, decreasing from FY2016. The budget deficit was expected to fall to 2.4% of GDP in FY2018 but increase in subsequent years, reaching 5.0% of GDP in FY2027. The cumulative deficit from FY2017 through FY2026 was projected to be $8.577 trillion, a slight increase from previous projections. The CBO projected a deficit increase due to decreases in federal revenues exceeding outlays. Legislation enacted in late 2016 raised the deficit by $127 billion from FY2017 to FY2026, mainly from increased outlays. Technical changes reduced budget deficits by $133 billion through outlay reductions. Economic adjustments increased deficits by $12 billion from FY2017 to FY2026. Additionally, CBO releases a long-term budget outlook annually with similar assumptions as the Budget and Economic Outlook. The CBO released The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook on March 30, 2017, projecting federal spending and revenue levels through at least 25 years beyond the current fiscal year. The forecast includes budget and debt projections through FY2047, informing Congress about long-term trends in budgetary components under current law. The outlook increased its projection of long-term publicly held debt compared to previous forecasts. The CBO's 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook projected a rise in publicly held debt to 150% of GDP by FY2047, up from the current 77% of GDP. Policy changes increasing revenues or decreasing spending by 1.9% of GDP annually are needed to maintain current debt levels, while adjustments of 3.1% of GDP annually are required to reach the historical average of 40% of GDP by 2047. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a budget request to Congress for the upcoming fiscal year, including estimates of spending, revenues, borrowing, and debt, detailed estimates of federal agencies' financial operations, and policy recommendations. The budget request is submitted by the Office of Management and Budget on or after the first Monday in January but no later than the first Monday in February. The President's budget has been late on several occasions, with updates often sent to Congress in the second half of the fiscal year. The Trump Administration released the FY2018 version of the President's Budget on May 23, 2017, with policy proposals including reductions in outlays for programs like Medicaid and changes to the Affordable Care Act. If fully implemented, the budget estimates a deficit of $440 billion. The President's proposed budget aims to decrease deficits steadily from FY2019 through FY2026, leading to a budget surplus of $16 billion in FY2027. The budget projects a total net deficit of $3.15 trillion from FY2018-FY2027, with economic growth expected to rise to 3.0% per year from FY2021 to FY2027. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts a smaller reduction in federal deficits, estimating a deficit of $720 billion if policy proposals were fully implemented. The FY2018 President's Budget submission to Congress on March 16, 2017, included discretionary budget authority levels for FY2017 and FY2018. The budget allows for $1,182 billion in total FY2017 discretionary budget authority, representing an increase of $14 billion from FY2016. For FY2018, the budget provides for $1,152 billion in discretionary budget authority, a $30 billion decrease from FY2017. This results in a total decrease of $14 billion relative to CBO's January 2017 current law projections. The President's Budget for FY2018 includes increases in defense budget authority and decreases in nondefense budget authority. The budget resolution, agreed upon by both chambers, establishes parameters for Congress to consider subsequent budgetary legislation. Certain levels in the budget resolution are enforceable through points of order. The budget resolution, agreed upon by both chambers, contains enforceable levels through points of order. It includes spending limits for each committee known as \"302(a) allocations,\" which are then subdivided among subcommittees as 302(b) subdivisions. The House and Senate Budget Committees oversee the budget resolution, shaped by the Budget Act requirements. Congress is supposed to complete action on the budget resolution by April 15, although it often occurs later. Since its establishment in 1985, there have been nine years when the House and Senate did not agree on a budget resolution. In such cases, Congress uses \"deeming resolutions\" as substitutes to establish enforceable budget levels for the upcoming fiscal year. The House Budget Committee marked up a budget resolution for FY2017 on March 16, 2017, estimating it would reduce projected deficits by $7.2 trillion over the FY2017-FY2026 period compared to CBO's January 2016 baseline. The House Budget Committee's budget resolution for FY2017 aimed to reduce deficits by $7.2 trillion compared to CBO projections. It included reconciliation instructions to 12 House committees to achieve $8.315 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years. Additionally, the resolution called for mandatory spending savings of $30 billion over FY2017 and FY2018, and $140 billion over FY2017-FY2026. No further action was taken on the resolution. The House and Senate adopted a budget resolution for FY2017 (S.Con.Res. 3) to trigger the budget reconciliation process for changes to the Affordable Care Act. Two budget resolutions were planned for 2017 - one for FY2017 and one for FY2018 to increase the number of bills considered under reconciliation. S.Con.Res. 3 was introduced in the 115th Congress. The Senate and House adopted budget resolution S.Con.Res. 3 in 2017 to initiate the budget reconciliation process for changes to the Affordable Care Act. The resolution was introduced by Senator Enzi and passed in the Senate on January 11 and in the House on January 13. The House Budget Committee reported H.Con.Res. 71, a budget resolution for FY2018, with reconciliation instructions to achieve over $200 billion in deficit reduction. This resolution follows S.Con.Res. 3, which recommends lower federal revenue and outlay levels from FY2017 to FY2026 compared to CBO projections. Budget reconciliation is a congressional process that operates alongside the budget resolution, with reconciliation directives triggering the second stage related to mandatory spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Legislation developed under this process is privileged for fast-track consideration in both the House and Senate, requiring less support in the Senate to reach a final vote. Congressional differences in passed legislation must be resolved. In early January 2017, the House and Senate agreed to a budget resolution for FY2017 (S.Con.Res. 3) with reconciliation instructions to four congressional committees. The House directed the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees, while the Senate directed the Finance and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees to submit legislation to reduce the deficit by $1. On January 27, 2017, legislation was passed to reduce the deficit by $1 billion over FY2017-FY2026. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) was created as a result of markups by the Committee on Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce Committee. The AHCA was estimated to reduce budget deficits by $337 billion over FY2017-FY2026. The House Committee on the Budget reported a reconciliation bill, H.R. 1628, American Health Care Act (AHCA) of 2017, which aimed to reduce budget deficits by $337 billion over FY2017-FY2026. The House Rules Committee held hearings and debates on the AHCA, with amendments made to the bill before further consideration was postponed. On May 4, the House passed the AHCA by a vote of 217 to 213 after further debate and amendments. The budgetary effects of the AHCA as passed have not been estimated yet. The AHCA was then placed on the Senate Calendar in early June. The AHCA was placed on the Senate Calendar in early June and on July 25, the Senate agreed to proceed with consideration by a vote of 51-50. Several amendments were considered, and on July 28, the bill was placed back on the calendar. The bill is still privileged for consideration under expedited procedures. Appropriations legislation authorizes agencies to spend money and is under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The budget resolution sets spending limits for appropriations bills, which are divided among committees and subcommittees. Appropriations must be enacted by October 1 to avoid a government shutdown. Congress uses continuing resolutions to fund government operations when appropriations are not passed. Congress uses continuing resolutions to fund government operations when regular appropriations bills are not passed. For FY2017, Congress enacted one regular appropriations bill for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, while the rest of the appropriations were provided through three continuing resolutions and an omnibus appropriations bill. H.R. 5325 was passed on September 28, providing funding through December 9, 2016, for most programs and activities covered by regular appropriations bills, along with emergency funds for Zika virus combat. The appropriations bill for FY2017 included emergency funds for Zika virus and flood relief. It was signed into law on September 29, 2016. The continuing resolution provided funding at a slightly lower level than FY2016 until December 9, 2016. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allowed for increases in discretionary cap levels for FY2017. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2028 on December 8, 2016. On December 8, 2016, H.R. 2028 was passed by the House and Senate, providing funding through April 28, 2017, at a level 0.1901% below FY2016 levels. President Obama signed the bill into law on December 10 (P.L. 114-254). On April 28, 2017, H.J.Res. 99 was passed to fund programs through May 5, 2017, and on May 5, President signed H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) was passed by the House and Senate, providing funding for the remainder of FY17. It consists of 11 appropriations bills and complies with the Budget Control Act (BCA) with $551.068 billion in defense discretionary budget authority and $518.531 billion in nondefense discretionary budget authority for FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) was passed by the House and Senate, providing funding for the remainder of FY17. It includes activities classified as Overseas Contingency Operations and Global War on Terror (OCO/GWOT), disaster relief, program integrity, and emergency requirements, representing a $20 billion increase in funding. Other provisions in the Act resulted in direct spending and revenue changes that increased budget deficits from FY2017 through FY2027 by a combined $0.249 billion. The House passed H.R. 3219, the Defense, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development National Security Appropriations Act of 2018 on July 27. H.R. 3219 includes 4 regular appropriations bills and the Department of Homeland Security Border Infrastructure Construction Appropriations Act, 2018 for fencing and wall construction along the southern border. The House Rules Committee released legislative text for the remaining eight regular appropriations bills. The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and Foreign Operations, and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2018 deals with mandatory spending programs, which are federal programs that provide payments to eligible beneficiaries without requiring annual congressional action. Congressional consideration of mandatory spending legislation is influenced by House and Senate rules, the budget resolution, and the Budget Act. Each year, Congress reviews legislation affecting mandatory spending. The \"Budget Reconciliation Legislation\" deals with revenue legislation that authorizes the collection of taxes to fund the federal government. Congress regularly considers changes to existing revenue provisions, with the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee overseeing revenue measures. Congress passes legislation each year that impacts revenue, including extensions of short-term tax provisions. In late 2015, legislation extended 56 expiring tax provisions in the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015, some made permanent. All provisions were to remain in effect through 2016, with some expiring in 2016. Proposals in the 115th Congress aim to extend these provisions. Congress can limit federal debt through the statutory debt limit, which currently applies to over 99% of total federal debt. The statutory debt limit applies to over 99% of total federal debt, including debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt. Congress can choose to increase the debt limit, implement \"extraordinary measures,\" or temporarily suspend or abolish the limit. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have jurisdiction over debt limit legislation, shaped by House and Senate rules, the budget resolution, and the Budget Act. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 suspended the debt limit until March 15, 2017, and allowed for its increase as needed to accommodate federal borrowing. On March 16, 2017, the debt limit was reinstated at $19.809 trillion. Secretary Mnuchin requested a raise of the debt limit and planned to use extraordinary measures to manage the situation, which does not typically require legislative action. Congress faced a debt limit reinstatement to meet federal borrowing needs, with short-run budget surpluses in March and April 2015 estimated to be exhausted by early November. The latest CBO forecast predicts a larger budget deficit in FY2017 compared to FY2015, potentially shortening the time extraordinary measures can postpone a debt limit. Secretary Mnuchin warned that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by September 29, 2017, leading to a possible default on federal obligations. A binding debt limit could lead to default on federal obligations, impacting Treasury's ability to borrow funds and causing negative outcomes in global economies and financial markets. It may also affect the perceived credit risk of federal government borrowing, potentially reducing fiscal space. Congress may need to consider new budget enforcement legislation to address these concerns. Congress has implemented various budget enforcement mechanisms, both internally and externally. This includes incorporating budget restrictions in House and Senate rules, budget resolutions, and legislation like the Budget Control Act of 2011. Recent legislation, such as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, has adjusted discretionary spending limits. The House and Senate Budget Committees have been focusing on reforming the congressional budget process for FY2016 and FY2017. They have held hearings and released papers related to this effort. The House Budget Committee has released working papers aimed at overhauling the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, while the Senate Budget Committee has released Budget Bulletins on budget process reform. Links to these documents can be found on their respective websites. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made changes to discretionary spending caps for FY2017 and established spending targets for overseas contingency operations. It also amended limits for Program Integrity Initiatives. Budget Bulletins on budget process reform can be viewed at http://www.budget.senate.gov/chairman/newsroom/budget-bulletins."
