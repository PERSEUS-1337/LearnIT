    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"MTBE Elimination Act\". The Senate finds and expresses its sense. Congress finds that a single cup of MTBE can contaminate all the water in a 5,000,000-gallon well, as MTBE easily transfers from gasoline to air to water. Exposure to MTBE has been linked to tumors, nervous system disorders, and reproductive issues in mice and rats. The Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 that studies of MTBE support its classification as a neurotoxicant with possible adverse effects on a developing fetus. Higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream are linked to symptoms like headaches, eye irritation, and nausea. MTBE also reduces the efficiency of technologies used to clean water contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. The costs of remediating MTBE water contamination in the United States could reach billions of dollars. Studies are ongoing to find cost-efficient solutions for cleaning up drinking water contaminated by MTBE, but no practical engineering solutions have been found yet. Remediation efforts can cost millions of dollars per municipality, with industrial cleanups averaging around $150,000. Small businesses also face significant costs for cleaning up MTBE contamination. The reformulated gasoline program under the Clean Air Act has led to significant reductions in emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol is considered an effective fuel-blending component that reduces carbon monoxide emissions and provides high octane. The Department of Agriculture concluded that ethanol production can be expanded to meet the needs of the reformulated gasoline program in 4 years with minimal price impacts and no supply interruptions. Research efforts should focus on assessing infrastructure and overcoming challenges to allow ethanol to meet the program's requirements as MTBE is phased out, providing air quality and economic benefits. The Senate supports the EPA providing assistance for testing and remediation of drinking water contaminated with MTBE as part of the reformulated gasoline program. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the EPA. An \"eligible grantee\" includes federal research agencies, national laboratories, universities, private research organizations, and state environmental research facilities. \"MTBE\" stands for methyl tertiary butyl ether. SEC. 4. USE AND LABELING OF MTBE AS A FUEL ADDITIVE. Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive three years after enactment. Retailers selling gasoline with MTBE must label their fuel dispensing systems with information about MTBE as per Administrator regulations. The Administrator will establish regulations for a phased reduction in the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive over a 3-year period starting from the enactment of the subsection. SEC. 5. GRANTS FOR RESEARCH ON MTBE GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION AND REMEDIATION. The MTBE research grants program is established within the EPA for research on cost-effective ground water testing methods, remediation procedures, and health effects of MTBE. The Administrator will seek proposals, determine relevance, and award grants accordingly. The EPA establishes the MTBE research grants program to fund research on ground water testing methods, remediation procedures, and health effects of MTBE. Grants are awarded based on merit, quality, and relevance, with priority given to proposals demonstrating matching funds availability. Grants are awarded competitively and have a maximum term of 4 years. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2004 to carry out this program."
