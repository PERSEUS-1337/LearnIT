The \"Voluntary Environmental Self-Evaluation Act\" defines key terms such as Federal agency, State agency, and environmental law, which includes specific federal laws related to environmental protection. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, Clean Air Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986, Oil Pollution Act of 1980, and Noise Control Act of 1982 are specific federal laws related to environmental protection. The Noise Control Act of 1982, Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Endangered Species Act, Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Rivers and Harbors Act, Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, and any other relevant statutes are legal requirements that must be followed. The term \"voluntary environmental self-evaluation\" refers to a periodic review by regulated entities of facility operations related to meeting environmental requirements. It excludes an environmental compliance management system. The term \"environmental compliance management system\" includes a regulated entity's systematic efforts to prevent, detect, and correct violations through compliance policies, oversight responsibilities, and mechanisms for ensuring compliance. Efforts to ensure compliance with environmental requirements include monitoring, auditing, and reporting mechanisms, effective communication of standards to employees, and providing incentives for adherence to policies through consistent enforcement. The term \"voluntary environmental self-evaluation report\" refers to documents prepared as a result of a voluntary environmental self-evaluation, including various types of information related to observations, findings, opinions, and suggestions. The voluntary environmental self-evaluation report may include a document prepared by the auditor or evaluator describing the scope of the evaluation, conclusions, and recommendations, an analysis of the self-evaluation or related issues, and an implementation plan for actions to be taken by the facility owner or operator. The term \"civil proceeding\" includes administrative or civil judicial proceedings for suspension or listing. The term \"regulated entity\" refers to entities regulated under environmental laws. SEC. 3. NONDISCLOSURE PRIVILEGE. The privilege of nondisclosure in voluntary environmental self-evaluation reports prohibits their use as evidence in federal or state environmental proceedings, except for certain circumstances. This privilege does not apply to information required by law or intentional violations. Entities can waive this privilege with a written statement.

In civil proceedings, the privilege of nondisclosure in environmental self-evaluation reports may not apply if noncompliance with environmental laws is indicated and efforts to achieve compliance were not initiated by the entity. The burden of asserting the privilege lies with the entity, while the burden of persuasion against it falls on the party seeking disclosure. The privilege of nondisclosure in environmental self-evaluation reports may not apply if compliance efforts were not initiated by the entity or if the privilege is being asserted for a fraudulent purpose. Appeals can be made to the appropriate court if a ruling on the privilege is made by an administrative law judge or court. The privilege of nondisclosure in environmental self-evaluation reports may not apply in criminal proceedings if a court determines so in an in camera hearing. Law enforcement officials can obtain the report if they have probable cause of a criminal offense, but they must seal it upon possession and not review or disclose it. The report must be sealed immediately and not reviewed, disclosed, or used unless waived by the entity or determined by the court in an in camera hearing. The agency can review the report during the hearing but cannot disclose or use the information for any investigation or proceeding. SEC. 4. IMMUNITY FOR CERTAIN VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES. Entities disclosing violations of environmental laws through voluntary self-evaluation or compliance management systems are granted immunity from prosecution in Federal or State proceedings, except for cases involving specific intent to violate the law. Disclosed information is not admissible in court if disclosure is prompt and initiated by the entity or its representatives. Entities disclosing violations of environmental laws through voluntary self-evaluation or compliance management systems are granted immunity from prosecution in Federal or State proceedings, as long as the disclosure is prompt, initiated by the entity or its representatives, and not for fraudulent purposes.

Entities disclosing violations of environmental laws are granted immunity from prosecution under certain conditions. The immunity does not apply if the violation is part of a pattern of significant violations within the past 3 years, with senior management having knowledge but failing to take corrective action. The disclosure must be voluntary and initiated by the entity, and disclosed information cannot be used to avoid penalties in ongoing investigations. Entities disclosing violations of environmental laws can receive immunity if the disclosure is voluntary and the information was obtained through self-evaluation or compliance management. The entity is presumed to be entitled to immunity unless challenged by the agency within 60 days. Additionally, the entity can request a judicial determination regarding the applicability of immunity.
