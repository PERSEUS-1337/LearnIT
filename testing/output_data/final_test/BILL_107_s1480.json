    "content": "Section 2805(a) of the Act of October 30, 1992 is amended to include fines and imprisonment for violations of regulations issued under the Act. The Secretary may authorize law enforcement personnel to maintain law and order. The Secretary may authorize law enforcement personnel from other Federal agencies, State, or local governments to act as officers within Reclamation projects or on Reclamation lands to maintain law and order and protect persons and property. The Secretary can authorize law enforcement personnel to act as officers within Reclamation projects or on Reclamation lands to maintain law and order, cooperate with State or local governments, and provide reimbursement for incurred expenditures. Authorized officers can carry firearms, make arrests without warrants for offenses against the United States, or felonies under US laws. Authorized officers can make arrests for felonies under US laws within Reclamation projects or on Reclamation lands, execute warrants for federal law enforcement, and conduct investigations in these areas. Authorized officers can conduct investigations within Reclamation projects or on Reclamation lands for offenses against the United States if the relevant Federal law enforcement agency declines to investigate. State or local law enforcement officers designated to act as federal officers are not considered federal employees and are not subject to federal employment laws. For Federal Tort Claims Act purposes, state or local law enforcement officers are considered federal employees when carrying out federal law enforcement responsibilities under federal supervision. When acting as a designated law enforcement officer under Federal supervision and control, individuals are considered civil service employees of the United States for Federal law enforcement responsibilities. Benefits may be reduced if entitled to State or local workers' compensation benefits for the same injury or death. This does not limit the investigative jurisdiction of any Federal law enforcement agency or affect the rights of State or local governments. The text discusses the authority for law enforcement personnel, including Indian tribal agencies, to enforce criminal laws within a Reclamation project or on Reclamation lands. Law enforcement personnel must have completed approved training and be authorized to carry firearms, make arrests, and enforce criminal laws. Enforcement authorities are subject to rules and regulations approved by the Secretary and the Attorney General."
