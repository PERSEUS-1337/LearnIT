    "content": "The Act titled \"Savage Rapids Dam Act of 2000\" is cited in Section 1. Congressional findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress acknowledges the historical significance of the Savage Rapids Dam in providing water to the Grants Pass Irrigation District since 1921. There is a consensus among the State of Oregon, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the District that removing the dam and installing modern irrigation pumps will benefit the salmon and steelhead resources of the Rogue River basin. It is deemed to be in the public interest for the Federal Government to acquire the dam from the District to enhance and protect natural resources. The District aims to protect natural resources, maintain operational and financial stability, and ensure reasonable costs for delivering irrigation water to patrons. SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION, DAM ACQUISITION, DAM REMOVAL. Prior to the removal of Savage Rapids Dam on the Rogue River, the Secretary of the Interior must design and install electric irrigation pumps to supply water to the District. Fish screens must be installed at pump stations and the facility must comply with environmental regulations before dam removal. The Secretary is authorized to acquire and remove the dam, correct any pump deficiencies for five years post-removal, and transfer title of pumping facilities to the District for operation and maintenance. The Secretary is authorized to proceed with activities under the Environmental Impact Statement published by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1995 for Fish Passage Improvements at Savage Rapids Dam in Oregon. SEC. 4. MONITORING, MITIGATION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES. The Bureau of Reclamation, along with other agencies, will monitor downstream impacts of dam removal and implement remedial actions as needed. Riparian restoration and fisheries enhancement projects will be carried out upstream and downstream of the dam site. The Federal government will cover seventy-five percent of the costs for these activities. Collaboration with the State of Oregon and local counties will be done to identify and implement community projects. The Federal government will collaborate with the State of Oregon and local counties in Josephine and Jackson to implement community recreational enhancement projects, with a fifty percent cost-share. Authorization of appropriations totaling $13,500,000 for activities under the Act, with specific allocations for different sections. Activities funded under this Act will not be considered as supplemental benefits under previous Acts."
