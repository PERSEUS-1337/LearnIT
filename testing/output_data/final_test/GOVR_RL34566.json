FISA provides a statutory framework for gathering foreign intelligence information through electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen registers, trap and trace devices, and access to business records. The provisions passed almost 30 years ago became Title I of FISA, focusing initially on electronic surveillance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) was enacted to gather foreign intelligence information through electronic surveillance. The act has been amended over the years to balance national security interests and civil liberties. Recent attention in the 110th Congress was given to FISA bills, including the Protect America Act, which allowed warrantless acquisition of foreign intelligence information for individuals believed to be outside the United States. The Protect America Act was extended to February 1, 2008, by H.R. 5104. P.L. 110-182 was enacted to ensure the intelligence community's authority. The House passed the RESTORE Act of 2007, while the Senate reported the FISA Amendments Act of 2007. The FISA Amendments Act of 2007 was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 16, 2007. The Senate passed the amended version on February 12, 2008, and the House passed a compromise bill, H.R. 6304, on June 20, 2008. Further legislative activity is expected after the July 4th recess. The Senate returns from the July 4th recess, focusing on electronic surveillance under FISA. Key issues include the balance between national security and civil liberties, the need for efficient foreign intelligence collection, and proposed approaches to address these challenges. Additionally, limitations of liability for electronic communication service providers are being discussed. The report examines limitations of liability for electronic communication service providers aiding the federal government in foreign intelligence collection, focusing on constitutional provisions like the Fourth and First Amendments. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and assembly, reflecting the importance of free expression in a free society. Senator Edward Kennedy emphasized the need to balance national security with civil liberties in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 aims to strike a balance between protecting national security and safeguarding the civil liberties of citizens. The bill, supported by Attorney General Griffin Bell and President Carter, regulates government intelligence activities, ensuring transparency and accountability in clandestine operations. The delicate balance between intelligence for national security and preserving human rights is crucial in a free society. The House FISA bill, H.R. 7308, addresses the competing demands of the President's powers and the fourth amendment in electronic surveillance for national security purposes. The issue of the President's constitutional authority in this matter remains unresolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. The President's constitutional authority to authorize warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes has never been expressly decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. This issue has troubled constitutional scholars for decades. Electronic surveillance is crucial for identifying threats to U.S. interests and national security, as it can uncover plans or activities that may not be discovered through other investigative means. The investigative technique of electronic surveillance can be a valuable tool for national security but raises concerns about privacy intrusion and chilling political discussion. The current debate stems from questions about the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) revealed in 2005, where the NSA intercepted international communications linked to terrorist organizations. The President's authority to authorize warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes has not been decided by the Supreme Court. The TSP has led to congressional oversight and legislative proposals to provide the intelligence community with tools for foreign intelligence collection while protecting civil liberties. Global communications technology complexity poses challenges for intelligence collection, but the government is utilizing new technologies for law enforcement purposes. The government is utilizing new technologies for law enforcement and intelligence purposes, balancing the need for security with privacy and First Amendment rights. There is a debate on the standards for collecting foreign intelligence information, especially in light of the National Intelligence Estimate on the terrorist threat to the US Homeland. The U.S. Homeland faces a persistent threat from Islamic terrorist groups, particularly al Qaeda. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about orders authorizing surveillance on international communications involving suspected terrorists. This surveillance replaces the previous Terrorist Surveillance Program and is now subject to approval by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Attorney General informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) would now require approval from the FISC. The President decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expired. The Intelligence Committees were briefed on classified FISC orders, and draft legislation was submitted to Congress for modernization of FISA. The draft legislation for the modernization of FISA proposed a new section 102A authorizing the President, through the Attorney General, to acquire foreign intelligence information for up to one year. The DNI emphasized the need for modernization to adapt to technological changes and meet current intelligence collection needs, highlighting the importance of providing warning of threats to the United States. Admiral McConnell stated that court review may be considered for procedures in gathering foreign intelligence from foreign targets overseas, following a potential limitation on surveillance authority in certain circumstances. This was mentioned in an interview transcript published in the El Paso Times in August 2007. The judge interpreted FISA requirements differently from previous orders, deeming a FISA warrant necessary for surveillance of foreign persons abroad. Views differ on the scope and means of addressing this concern, whether through electronic surveillance or court orders from the FISC. The Protect America Act of 2007 amended FISA to allow surveillance of foreign persons outside the U.S. without a warrant, creating a new procedure under section 105B(a) of FISA. The Protect America Act of 2007 amended FISA to allow surveillance of foreign persons outside the U.S. without a warrant, creating a new procedure under section 105B(a) of FISA. This authority allowed the Attorney General and the DNI to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States for up to one year, based on specific criteria. The Act expired on February 16, 2008, but acquisitions authorized during its enforcement could continue until their expiration. H.R. 3773 passed by the House stated that no court order was needed for electronic surveillance directed at acquiring communication contents. The bill allows electronic surveillance for non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. without a warrant, with strict rules for accidental interception of U.S. persons' communications. It permits FISC orders for up to one year to collect foreign intelligence information by targeting non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. communicating with individuals inside the U.S. The Attorney General and DNI can jointly authorize such acquisitions. The amendment to H.R. 3773 allows the Attorney General and the DNI to jointly authorize targeting of persons outside the U.S. for up to one year to acquire foreign intelligence information. The Senate bill does not require prior approval by the FISC for certifications, targeting procedures, and minimization procedures, but mandates submission to the FISC within five days. The Senate bill requires the Attorney General and the DNI to prepare a certification within seven days after making a determination for an acquisition. The FISC will approve continued use of procedures if they meet statutory requirements and constitutional standards. If deficiencies are found, the government must correct them within 30 days or cease the acquisition. Prior approval by the FISC is required for targeting under the House amendment to H.R. 3773. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 requires FISC approval of targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and certification before authorization for acquisition of communications of non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. The FISC has 30 days to review and approve or deny an acquisition order. The House amendment also mandates guidelines for compliance with limitations on acquisitions, to be submitted to various committees. H.R. 6304 would amend FISA to allow joint authorization by the Attorney General and the DNI for targeting non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. for up to one year. Proposed section 702 of FISA includes limitations to prevent reverse targeting. Certification and targeting procedures would be subject to judicial review by the FISC to ensure compliance. The FISC ensures that acquisitions target persons outside the US and prevent intentional acquisition of communications within the US. If deficiencies are found, the government must correct them within 30 days or cease implementation. The Fourth Amendment protections apply to U.S. persons within the United States and U.S. citizens abroad, but may vary depending on the location of the interception. The Warrant Clause may not apply outside the U.S. where U.S. magistrates have no jurisdiction. The legality of interception abroad depends on the laws of the country where it occurs, leading to varying rights available. The availability of Fourth Amendment protections is influenced by the executor of the search and any U.S. involvement. The Fourth Amendment protections vary depending on the location of the interception, influenced by the executor of the search and any U.S. involvement. If warrantless electronic surveillance targets a U.S. citizen abroad for foreign intelligence purposes authorized by the President or Attorney General, it may be deemed reasonable. The 110th Congress is considering the level of privacy protection for U.S. persons abroad in FISA legislation. Various amendments and bills address procedures for targeting U.S. persons outside the U.S. for collecting foreign intelligence information, allowing for up to 90-day surveillance periods. The bills being considered by the 110th Congress allow for the renewal of surveillance orders for up to 90 days if statutory criteria are met. In the case of emergency authorizations by the Attorney General, notice to a FISC judge is required, and minimization procedures would apply. Without a judicial order approving an emergency acquisition, the acquisition would terminate when the information is obtained, when an application is denied, or after seven days. The 110th Congress bills allow for surveillance order renewal for up to 90 days if criteria are met. Emergency authorizations by the Attorney General require notice to a FISC judge and minimization procedures. Without a FISC order, no information acquired from an emergency acquisition can be used in proceedings without consent, except in cases of threat with approval from the Attorney General. The DNI identified a need for liability protection for those aiding in foreign intelligence collection efforts. The 110th Congress bills provide retrospective relief from liability for those aiding the Government in electronic surveillance since September 11, 2001. Telecommunications providers can also receive prospective liability protection for aiding the government in the future, with lawful acquisition and surveillance requirements met. The 110th Congress bills offer retrospective and prospective liability protection for telecommunications providers aiding the government in electronic surveillance. This includes immunity from lawsuits for providing information in accordance with court orders or certifications by the Attorney General. The Senate Amendment to H.R. 3773, House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773, and H.R. 6304 authorize the FISC to compel compliance through contempt power. There are pending lawsuits against telecommunications providers for aiding the government in surveillance programs since September 11, 2001. Approximately 40 suits are in the Northern District of California. The Senate Amendment to H.R. 3773, House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773, and H.R. 6304 authorize the FISC to compel compliance through contempt power. Pending lawsuits against telecommunications providers for aiding government surveillance programs since September 11, 2001, have been consolidated in the Northern District of California under Judge Vaughn Walker for coordinated pretrial proceedings. Centralization of the cases is deemed necessary to prevent duplicative discovery, inconsistent pretrial rulings, and conserve resources. Arguments may be made for granting retroactive immunity to telecommunication providers who assisted the government in surveillance programs. Cooperation is crucial for electronic surveillance and gathering intelligence. Providers acting in good faith reliance on government assertions may argue for immunity from liability. Some believe the unique circumstances support relief from liability for those who assisted the government. The government has asserted states secrets privilege in response to lawsuits filed regarding telecommunications carriers' cooperation after 9/11. This privilege protects national security information from disclosure in court cases. It can lead to case dismissal or prevent damaging information from being admitted as evidence. The state secrets privilege can bar evidence that may harm national security. If a plaintiff lacks nonprivileged evidence to prove their case, it may be dismissed. However, if the privilege prevents a defendant from presenting a valid defense, the court may rule in favor of the defendant. In cases involving telecommunications providers and immunity claims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(a), the state secrets privilege may impact their ability to defend themselves, potentially warranting immunity from lawsuits. Such lawsuits may be the only recourse for those affected. Telecommunications providers may be the only defense against government abuse and have a duty to protect customer records. Arguments against granting them immunity include the need to vindicate rights and obtain remedies for injuries caused by government activities. Additionally, lack of information sharing by the Administration raises questions about their role in the TSP. The Congress lacks adequate information to determine if relief for telecommunications carriers is warranted in relation to their role in intelligence activities. Proposed section 802(a) of FISA in Title II of H.R. 6304 grants immunity to individuals providing assistance to the intelligence community under certain conditions certified by the Attorney General. The proposed section 802(a) of FISA in Title II of H.R. 6304 grants immunity to individuals providing assistance to the intelligence community under specific conditions certified by the Attorney General, including activities authorized by the President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, aimed at detecting or preventing terrorist attacks against the United States. The proposed section 802(a) of FISA in Title II of H.R. 6304 grants immunity to individuals providing assistance to the intelligence community under specific conditions certified by the Attorney General, including activities authorized by the President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007. The certification must be supported by substantial evidence and can be reviewed by the U.S. district court. The court's written order would be issued in camera and ex parte to protect classified information. The Attorney General can declare that disclosure of certain materials would harm national security, leading to a review in camera and ex parte. Public disclosure would be limited to a statement on case dismissal and legal standards without revealing specific details. Proposed Section 802 of FISA, if enacted into law, would apply to civil actions pending on or filed after the enactment date. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 prohibits covered civil actions in federal or state courts, requiring prompt dismissal if the Attorney General certifies that the electronic communication service provider's assistance was in connection with authorized intelligence activities related to preventing terrorist attacks from 9/11/2001 to 1/17/2007. The proposed Section 802 of FISA would bar covered civil actions in federal or state courts if the Attorney General certifies that the electronic communication service provider's assistance was authorized by the President and determined to be lawful. The certification would be subject to judicial review under an abuse of discretion standard, with limited public disclosure if deemed necessary for national security. The proposed Section 802 of FISA allows the government to intervene in covered civil actions and authorizes parties to submit evidence related to state secrets privilege. The Attorney General's certification of lawful assistance by electronic communication service providers is subject to judicial review under an abuse of discretion standard. The court, under new subsection 802(e) of FISA, can request parties to present briefs and arguments on legal questions raised by submissions related to covered civil actions alleging assistance to the intelligence community. The Attorney General must provide any request or directive related to the allegations to the court. H.R. 6304 differs from prior House and Senate amendments. H.R. 6304 introduces new provisions regarding civil actions against persons assisting the intelligence community. It includes criteria for the Attorney General's certification and allows for judicial review under a substantial evidence standard. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 differs in the standard of review, using an abuse of discretion standard. The House amendment provides for judicial review of submissions related to state secrets privilege without specifying the standard. H.R. 6304 allows the district court to review court orders, certifications, and directives related to state secrets privilege. It permits party participation in legal proceedings without disclosing classified information. This provision differs from the Senate amendment but is similar to the House amendment, which also allows submissions related to state secrets privilege with protections for classified information in civil actions. The House amendment requires the Attorney General to provide the court with any request or directive related to assisting the intelligence community during the September 11, 2001 to January 17, 2007 period. All three bills allow for review of classified information ex parte, in camera. H.R. 6304 and the Senate amendment restrict public disclosure of information regarding certification and court orders."
