    "content": "The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975 under the Social Security Act, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services. It is funded by general revenues and operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and nine tribal nations. Initially focused on recovering welfare costs, the program now includes service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. In FY2005, the CSE program collected $23 billion in child support. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program collected $23 billion in child support in FY2005, benefiting over 17 million children. $21 billion went to families, while $2 billion was retained by states and the federal government for recovered welfare costs. The program aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and help families become self-sufficient. Over 331,000 families ended their enrollment in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program due to child support payments in FY2004. The CSE program has bipartisan support but has historically been tied to controversial changes in other social programs. The 1996 welfare reform law, P.L. 104-193, made significant changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, including ending cash welfare entitlement for needy families, creating the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, setting a five-year time limit on aid, and requiring more work from welfare recipients. President Bush submitted welfare reauthorization proposals to Congress in February 2002. The welfare reauthorization debates from 2002 to 2005 did not result in comprehensive legislation, but a scaled-back version was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This act extended funding for the TANF block grant and increased work requirements for TANF families. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased work requirements for TANF families and included changes to the CSE program. However, it did not incorporate several child support provisions considered during the welfare reauthorization debates from 2002 to 2005. These provisions may be revisited in the future, as some had broad support and were included in the Administration's FY2008 Budget. The child support provisions considered during the welfare reauthorization debates from 2002 to 2005 were not included in federal law, raising concerns about potential removal during the Senate's consideration of the bill. These provisions aimed to expand CSE collection/enforcement tools and were classified into two categories. The CSE agency, second only to the IRS, uses various methods for child support collection including income withholding, interception of tax refunds, liens, garnishment of wages, and seizure of assets. Income withholding is the most effective method, accounting for 69% of total collections in FY2005. All jurisdictions also have contempt-of-court procedures for nonpayment. The CSE program uses various methods for child support collection, including income withholding, tax refund interception, liens, wage garnishment, and asset seizure. Despite its efforts, the program only collected 18% of child support obligations in FY2005. The provisions aim to improve states' ability to collect child support by revising enforcement tools and adding new ones, particularly for veterans' disability compensation benefits. Veterans' disability compensation benefits are exempt from being used to pay child support, except in cases where a disabled veteran chose to receive disability payments instead of retirement pay before 2004. A law enacted in 2003 allows veterans to receive both military retired pay and disability compensation without offsetting benefits for child support. The proposed provision in P.L. 108-136 would have allowed veterans' disability compensation benefits to be intercepted for child support payments, making all veterans' income subject to income withholding. Supporters argue it would increase child support collections for families of disabled veterans, while opponents believe Congress should continue to protect these payments from garnishment. The federal government should protect veterans' disability compensation payments from garnishment or diversion to others. The Treasury Department can offset certain benefits to collect delinquent nontax debt, with a $9,000 annual exemption. The law protects federal benefit payments from offset for delinquent state-enforced child support obligations. Child support arrearage payments cannot be taken from Social Security benefits. Social Security benefits are generally not subject to garnishment, but can be attached for child support purposes. The federal government allows income withholding, garnishment, or legal processes for child support enforcement. There is a proposal to expand the federal offset program to collect past-due child support through the Department of Treasury. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this could yield $65 million annually by 2010. The proposed federal debt collection improvement provision aims to enhance the tax refund offset program for states to collect past-due child support. It would increase child support payments to custodial families with noncustodial parents receiving Social Security benefits, while maintaining a specified income amount for the beneficiaries. Additionally, the 1996 welfare reform law required states to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions to identify delinquent parents' accounts. The Financial Institution Data Match program helps states collect past-due child support by identifying assets of noncustodial parents. In 2004, over 1.9 million financial accounts belonging to 1.1 million noncustodial parents were found, resulting in $98 million in child support collections. State CSE officials consider this program successful but note that it works best when combined with other tools. The Financial Institution Data Match program helps states collect past-due child support by identifying assets of noncustodial parents. State CSE officials note that the program works best when the custodial parent has an account at a bank within the state, as multi-state financial institutions may not honor seizures by a state without branch offices there. Some states only pursue matching when a large financial asset is identified or when the arrearage is longstanding. Congress made it easier for multi-state financial institutions to match records in 1998 by allowing the Federal Parent Locator Service to coordinate information. The Financial Institution Data Match program assists states in collecting past-due child support by matching data with multi-state financial institutions. While the state CSE agency has the authority to seize assets for child support payments, the effectiveness of the program in cases involving multi-state financial institutions has been challenging. Proposed legislation would have allowed for federal seizure of accounts in multi-state financial institutions for child support purposes, but this provision has not been enacted. The proposed provision would have authorized the HHS Secretary, via the FPLS, to assist states in matching data with multi-state financial institutions to seize assets of noncustodial parents owing past-due child support. The Secretary would issue notices of liens or levies to freeze and seize assets in accounts to satisfy child support obligations, with seized assets to be transmitted to the state for distribution. Due process rights of affected account holders would be respected. The proposed provision aimed to give the federal government authority to seize financial assets for child support, resolving jurisdiction issues. Supporters believed it would enhance the financial institution match program, while opponents argued for state laws to be clarified instead of federalizing the process. They were concerned about preempting state property rights. Opponents argue against federalizing the levy process, citing potential customer service issues and lack of conformity. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act provides benefits to maritime workers injured on the job. Benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act can be paid by self-insured employers, insurance carriers, or a Special Fund. Federal benefits can be garnished for child support, while benefits from employers or private insurers are not subject to garnishment. Proposed amendments aim to make all benefits subject to garnishment for child support. The provision in Administration budgets since FY2004 allows garnishment of longshore and harbor workers' compensation for child support. Some argue against this, but supporters say it aligns with federal policy. Senate bills proposed requiring states to adopt 2001 UIFSA amendments for CSE funding. The 2001 changes to UIFSA included clarifications on determining controlling child support orders, enforcement of modified orders, international child support cases, duration of child support, and procedures for telephone hearings. It stipulates that a state with a child support order has jurisdiction to modify it if it's the controlling order and the state is the child's residence or the contestant's residence with consent. The 1996 welfare reform law required states to adopt the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to streamline child support enforcement in interstate cases by moving from a \"multiple-order\" system to a \"one-order\" system for increased efficiency. The 1996 welfare reform law mandated states to implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to simplify child support enforcement across state lines by recognizing past-due child support as final judgments eligible for full faith and credit in every state. This allows individuals with a child support order in one state to receive support if the noncustodial parent relocates to another state without needing a new order. The 1996 welfare reform law mandated states to implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to simplify child support enforcement across state lines. About 33% of all CSE cases involve more than one state, making it important for states to have consistent laws for handling interstate cases. Amendments were adopted in 2001 to improve the processing of interstate child support cases, aiming to make the CSE program more effective by requiring all states to incorporate these changes. The amendments aim to enhance the CSE program by requiring states to adopt the latest version of UIFSA for more effective interstate child support enforcement. Proponents argue that this would create a uniform statutory framework, ensuring equal access to child support regardless of parental location. Additionally, provisions seek to improve state collection of child support payments through enforcement tool revisions and new additions. The amendments to the CSE program include provisions such as allowing states to locate custodial parents, granting access to information in the Federal Parent Locator Service to designated Indian tribes, increasing federal funding for the CSE access and visitation program, and requiring health care plan administrators to notify the state CSE agency when a child loses health care coverage. The seventh provision in the CSE program would reduce federal matching rates for CSE expenditures. Both House and Senate bills have included a provision for reporting on procedures states use to locate custodial parents for undistributed child support. The report must include recommendations on expediting the payment of undistributed child support. Data from FY1999-FY2005 may not be accurate due to different interpretations by state CSE agencies. Automation has helped quantify the issue of undistributed collections. Former Commissioner Sherri Heller stated that automation highlighted the existing problem. Undistributed child support collections increased from $545 million in FY1999 to a record $738 million in 2001, dropping to $479 million in 2004. In FY2005, nearly $497 million in child support was collected but not distributed to custodial parents; 60% was in the process of distribution and 40% ($201 million) was unresolved. Reasons for distribution delays were cited. Some reasons for the delay in distributing child support collections include incomplete information, payment exceeding the amount owed, incorrect address, and legal issues like pending custody determinations. States have made progress in reducing undistributed child support but cite valid reasons for non-distribution. The pending determination of custody and potential loss of funds are key issues in distributing IRS income tax refund intercept collections from joint tax returns. Parents and advocacy groups advocate for reducing undistributed child support collections to prevent funds from going into state and federal treasuries. The National Council of Child Support Directors supports establishing a national goal for reducing undistributed collections, contingent on data availability for setting realistic targets. The National Council of Child Support Directors supports establishing a national goal for reducing undistributed child support collections, contingent on data availability for setting realistic targets. Currently, nine Indian tribes or tribal organizations operate Child Support Enforcement programs with direct federal funding at a 90% matching rate. In FY2005, nine Indian tribes collected $10.9 million for 25,000 families through Child Support Enforcement programs. Tribes cannot directly access the Federal Parent Locator Service but can receive data through state agreements. The FPLS helps locate noncustodial parents for child support obligations. The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) facilitates the enforcement and modification of child support orders, custody, and visitation. It also identifies support cases across different states and has access to external sources like the IRS, SSA, VA, DOD, and FBI. Authorized persons, including child support agencies, courts, and guardians, can access information in the FPLS databases. The provision in House and Senate bills would designate Indian tribes and tribal organizations as authorized to access the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS). This access would help tribal Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs locate noncustodial parents, establish paternity, and collect child support payments, benefiting tribal families. Supporters argue that direct access to the FPLS would enhance the effectiveness of tribal CSE programs. Direct access to the FPLS is beneficial for tribal CSE programs to locate noncustodial parents' assets quickly. Federal law authorized the Department of Education to access the National Directory of New Hires to improve collection on defaulted loans and grant overpayments. A Computer Matching Agreement was negotiated and implemented between OCSE and the Department of Education in December 2000, with the Secretary of Education required to reimburse the HHS Secretary for additional costs incurred. The HHS Secretary shares information from the National Directory of New Hires with various agencies, including state CSE agencies, the Department of Education for defaulted student loans, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for income verification. Other agencies accessing the directory must reimburse the HHS Secretary for any costs incurred. The HHS Secretary shares information from the National Directory of New Hires with various agencies for income verification and debt collection. Agencies accessing the directory must reimburse the Secretary for any costs incurred. The Department of Education only needs to reimburse the HHS Secretary for \"additional\" costs incurred. Proposed amendments would require reimbursement for any costs incurred in providing information on new hires. Noncustodial parents argue for fair consideration of visitation rights for fathers in child support cases. Some argue for reform in federal laws regarding child support, visitation, and custody rights. Congress has emphasized the importance of fathers being involved in their children's lives. The 1996 welfare reform law authorized grants for states to establish access and visitation programs for noncustodial parents. The 1996 welfare reform law authorized grants for states to establish access and visitation programs for noncustodial parents. States can use the grants for activities like mediation, counseling, education, and visitation enforcement. The allotment formula is based on the number of children living with one biological parent in each state. States must monitor, evaluate, and report on their programs as per HHS Secretary regulations. The Senate bills proposed increasing funding for the Access and Visitation program from $10 million annually to $20 million in FY2009 and each succeeding fiscal year. The provision would also extend the program to Indian tribes and tribal organizations receiving child support enforcement payments from the federal government for at least one year, with specified amounts set aside for them. The provision proposed increasing funding for the Access and Visitation program to $250,000 for FY2006, $600,000 for FY2007, $800,000 for FY2008, and $1.670 million for FY2009 or any succeeding fiscal year. It would have raised the minimum allotment to states to $120,000 in FY2006, $140,000 in FY2007, $160,000 in FY2008, and $180,000 in FY2009 or any succeeding fiscal year. The minimum allotment for Indian tribes and tribal organizations would have been $10,000 for a fiscal year. Research shows that children raised by married biological parents have better outcomes in school and life. Supporters argue that families need more than just child support, and Access and Visitation programs help facilitate this. Supporters of Access and Visitation programs argue that families need more than just child support. States are serving more families through these programs, with many on waiting lists. Noncustodial fathers can be held financially responsible for birth costs if the custodial parent lacks medical coverage. Federal law allows states to collect money from noncustodial fathers to reimburse Medicaid for birth costs. Several House and Senate bills included a provision that would have prohibited states from collecting child support from noncustodial fathers to repay Medicaid costs associated with the birth of a child. Reasons for high child support arrearages among low-income noncustodial fathers include default orders, retroactive support for TANF families, and lack of order modifications. Supporters believe this prohibition could prevent significant debt accumulation for low-income noncustodial fathers. Federal law requires a health care plan administrator to notify qualified beneficiaries (i.e., the custodial parent) of their beneficiary rights with regard to health care coverage for the child in specific situations involving the noncustodial parent. The health care plan administrator must notify the state CSE agency if the noncustodial parent with health care coverage experiences certain events like job loss, becoming eligible for Medicaid, or divorce. This provision has been proposed in Senate bills and Administration budgets since FY2005. Supporters argue that continuous health care coverage for children is crucial. The CSE program is a federal-state matching grant program where states receive federal funding for child support enforcement. States must spend money on CSE expenditures to receive federal funding and also receive incentive payments. The CSE program receives federal funding for child support enforcement, with the level of funding allocated by state or local governments determining the total resources available. In 2004, the program was recognized as the most cost-effective among social services. A proposed reduction in federal funding from 66% to 50% was included in the House budget reconciliation bill in 2005, but the Senate opposed this change. The federal funding levels for child support administrative expenses should not be reduced below 66%, as some policymakers argue that states should pay a higher proportion of costs to operate more efficiently. However, others believe that states should not face higher costs due to enforcing federal laws and handling nonwelfare families. The National Governors' Association supports maintaining federal financial commitment to the program. The National Council of Child Support Directors argues that any reduction in federal funding for the CSE system could harm states' ability to serve families. They believe that maintaining stable federal funding is crucial for the timely and effective implementation of reform provisions, which could negatively impact children and families. A decrease in the federal matching rate from 66% to 50% could undo the progress made since the 1996 welfare reform law and affect families who have transitioned off welfare or avoided it due to the CSE program's collections."
