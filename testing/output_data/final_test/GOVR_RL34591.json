These programs include grants for homeless services, affordable housing, first-time homebuyers, and community development, as well as direct assistance programs offering low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to poor families. The federal government provides housing assistance through various programs administered by HUD, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Treasury. This includes grants for homeless services, affordable housing, and first-time homebuyers, as well as direct assistance programs offering low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to low-income families. Additionally, tax credits and mortgage insurance are available to developers and homebuyers. The mortgage interest deduction is a major housing benefit not targeted towards lower-income households. This report focuses on federal housing assistance programs and policies. The federal government provides housing assistance through various programs administered by HUD, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Treasury. This includes grants for homeless services, affordable housing, and first-time homebuyers, as well as direct assistance programs offering low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to low-income families. The focus is on federal housing assistance programs and policies that help lower-income families and communities. The report does not cover regulations on lead-based paint hazards, disaster response assistance, or financial industry regulations. It also does not delve into the government's role in the mortgage market through entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. The federal government's initial housing policy was developed in response to the mortgage market issues during the Great Depression. The Housing Act of 1934 was enacted in response to the mortgage market troubles during the Great Depression. Before this act, mortgages had short terms and required annual payments, with lenders only providing 40% to 50% of the property value. When borrowers couldn't repay, lenders foreclosed on properties. The act aimed to address these issues. The Housing Act of 1934 was enacted to encourage lenders to invest in housing construction and stimulate employment in the building industry. It created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to insure lenders against losses on home improvement loans and established national mortgage associations. FHA also introduced the concept of 20-year mortgages, which eventually evolved into the standard 15- and 30-year mortgage products. In response to the Great Depression, the federal government got involved in providing rental housing assistance through the Housing Act of 1937, which established the United States Housing Agency. This replaced the controversial Housing Division of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration, which built multifamily housing projects for lower-income families. The Housing Act of 1937 established the United States Housing Agency and a Low-Rent Public Housing program, requiring partnerships between the federal government, states, and localities to address unsafe housing conditions and unemployment by funding low-rent housing developments for low-income families. The housing shortage in 1948 was a major issue in the presidential and congressional races, with President Truman's pledge to address postwar housing shortage and urban slums playing a key role in his victory. He highlighted that millions of families were living in slums and firetraps, emphasizing the need for low-rent public housing, slum clearance, and housing research. The Housing Act of 1949 aimed to provide a decent home for every American family by increasing low-rent public housing units to 1 million in 7 years. The act also included urban redevelopment, slum clearance programs, subsidies for low-income housing, and expanded FHA mortgage insurance for home building and ownership. The Housing Act of 1949 aimed to promote home building and homeownership, improve housing conditions in rural areas, and provide federal grants for research. In the 1950s, the focus was on public housing for the poor, leaving a gap for moderate-income families. Congress recognized the need for housing options for this group but faced challenges in creating a new program due to costs. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Congress approved legislation to involve the private sector in developing affordable rental housing for low- and moderate-income households. The Housing Act of 1959 created the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program, offering low-interest loans to nonprofit organizations for building housing for residents aged 62 and older. The Housing Act of 1961 expanded the role of the private sector in providing affordable housing to low- and moderate-income households through the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR housing program. This program insured mortgages and provided loans at low interest rates to private developers, government entities, and nonprofit developers, ensuring affordable rents for tenants. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 introduced rental assistance for private multifamily housing developers in the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program, capping rents at 20% of tenants' incomes. It also created the Rent Supplement Program and Section 23 leased housing program. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 established the Section 236 and Section 235 programs, providing mortgage interest subsidies and rent assistance for some units. Section 236 units received rent subsidies (RAP) to make them affordable. The Section 235 program provided mortgage interest reduction payments for individual homeowners. HUD made subsidy payments to lenders to reduce interest rates on FHA-insured mortgages. Subsidies to private developers resulted in hundreds of thousands of rental housing units by the end of the 1960s. The Section 202 program created over 45,000 units for elderly households. During the 1960s, various housing subsidy programs were implemented, including the Section 235 and Section 23 programs which provided ownership and rental subsidies. Public housing remained the largest program, with around 1 million units subsidized by the early 1970s. An income-based rent structure was introduced, but concerns arose about affordability for the poorest families. The Brooke Amendment in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 addressed this issue. The Brooke Amendment, part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969, limited tenant rent contributions to 25% of income (later raised to 30%). It established an income-based rent structure in federal housing programs. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibits housing discrimination based on various factors and requires HUD to promote fair housing practices. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 aimed to prevent segregation and ensure housing is open to everyone, addressing years of discrimination in housing provision. Policies like those of the Federal Housing Administration limited minority homeownership opportunities and contributed to racial segregation. Presidential orders, Supreme Court cases, and civil rights legislation, including the Fair Housing Act, worked to combat systematic racial discrimination in both private and public housing. The Fair Housing Act and civil rights legislation made it illegal to deny public housing assistance based on race and to segregate residents by race. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires banks to meet credit needs in communities where they operate. In the early 1970s, concerns arose about the cost and effectiveness of construction-based housing subsidy programs. President Nixon criticized existing programs for not serving families equitably, providing poor quality housing, and being too costly. As a result, a moratorium was declared on new activity under major housing subsidy programs, except for the Section 23 leased-housing program. The Housing Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-383) created the Section 8 low-income rental assistance program, combining features of previous rental assistance programs. It provided monthly assistance payments to private property owners for new or rehabilitated rental units. The Housing Act of 1974 created the Section 8 low-income rental assistance program for new or rehabilitated rental units. Property owners agreed to rent to eligible low-income families in exchange for monthly rental payments. The Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 repealed HUD's authority for new Section 8 contracts tied to new construction but retained authority for existing properties and introduced a voucher program. The Section 8 program was modified to include vouchers in 1985, allowing more flexibility for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and families to pay more than 30% of their incomes in rent. By the mid-1980s, federal housing programs faced funding cuts due to shifting priorities towards reducing taxes and increasing military spending. Production of assisted housing with federal funds declined between 1982 and 1988, leading to the loss of affordable rental units. In the late 1980s through the 1990s, federal support for housing decreased, leading to private and state initiatives in developing innovative housing solutions. Congress granted more decision-making authority to state and local governments through block grants and tax credits, including the creation of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was added to the Tax Reform Act in 1986 to incentivize developers to build low- and moderate-income housing. States have control over allocating tax credits based on population and can prioritize projects serving the lowest-income tenants. In 1990, Congress created the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA, P.L. 101-625) which authorized the HOME Investment Partnerships program, a flexible block grant to states and localities for housing and neighborhood revitalization. The HOME Investment Partnerships program, established by the National Affordable Housing Act in 1990, provides funding for various activities such as housing, neighborhood revitalization, and water and sewer grants. Funds are allocated based on a formula to assist families with incomes at or below 80% of the area median income. Recipient jurisdictions can use funds for homebuyers, rental housing, and rental assistance, with requirements to establish spending plans, meet matching funds, and partner with local nonprofits. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans into a single block grant program, simplifying the process. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) aimed to simplify housing assistance and support tribal self-governance. Concerns about public housing conditions in the 1990s led to the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, which deregulated Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and focused on promoting self-sufficiency. The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) aimed to deregulate Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and promote self-sufficiency. It included reforms such as increased income targeting in the voucher program, removal of federal preference categories for housing assistance, and the creation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) included reforms such as the Faircloth Amendment, which limited the development of new public housing units. Over the next 10 years, the number of public housing units decreased by more than 10% due to policy changes like the growth of HOPE VI and mixed finance redevelopment. The Rental Assistance Demonstration in 2012 further accelerated the decline in public housing units. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) introduced in 2012 allowed PHAs to convert public housing properties to Section 8 rental assistance. The 2007 financial crisis led to policy responses addressing mortgage lending practices and housing market turmoil, including federal conservatorship for two housing entities in 2008. In 2008, major reforms led to federal conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Temporary programs were created to address rising foreclosure rates. The recession prompted an economic stimulus package in 2009, including increased resources for federal housing programs. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 introduced new mortgage rules to protect consumers and the financial system. Ongoing debate continues about the effects of these reforms. Today's housing assistance system for low-income families consists of rental housing assistance, federal assistance to state and local governments, and housing finance and homeownership assistance. These categories can overlap, with rental assistance provided through rent vouchers, below-market rental units, and limited new construction. Assistance to state and local governments includes block grants for rental, homeownership, and community development purposes, as well as programs in the tax system. Housing finance and homeownership assistance offer direct aid for home buying costs, tax incentives, and mortgage insurance programs to support underserved populations. This assistance can finance single-family or multifamily housing for eligible homebuyers and developers. Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are a form of rental assistance for low-income families, funded by the federal government and administered by local PHAs. Eligible families can choose housing in the private market, with the voucher covering the difference between their rent contribution and the actual rent. The family pays 30% of their income towards rent, and the PHA makes payments to the landlord based on a maximum subsidy. Payments to the landlord are based on a maximum subsidy set by the PHA, less the tenant's contribution. Families eligible for vouchers are very low-income or low-income and must meet special criteria. PHAs must provide 75% of vouchers to extremely low-income families. Vouchers are nationally portable, allowing families to move anywhere in the country where a voucher program is available. Special forms of Section 8 vouchers, like tenant protection vouchers, are provided to families facing displacement from other HUD programs. Some Section 8 vouchers, like enhanced and project-based vouchers, offer higher values and are attached to specific housing units. Homeownership vouchers allow first-time homebuyers to use vouchers for mortgage payments. Families must apply to their local PHA and are placed on a waiting list. The Section 8 voucher program, funded annually by Congress, is the largest rental assistance program under HUD, serving a significant number of households. Congress renews existing vouchers each year and may create new incremental vouchers. The distribution of vouchers across Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) is based on various allocation methods, with funding determined by the number and cost of vouchers. The project-based Section 8 rental assistance program involves contracts with private property owners to rent units to low-income tenants. Eligibility is based on income, with a portion reserved for extremely low-income families. Existing contracts can be renewed, with roughly 1 million units still receiving assistance. No new contracts have been awarded since the mid-1980s. The project-based Section 8 rental assistance program involves contracts with private property owners to rent units to low-income tenants. Existing contracts were originally for 10- to 40-year periods with multiyear funding from Congress. Congress only needs to provide new funding for expired contracts, leading to a loss of project-based Section 8 units over time. Non-renewed contracts result in tenants receiving Section 8 tenant protection vouchers. Low-rent public housing developments are owned and operated by local public housing authorities and subsidized by the federal government. Public housing is owned and operated by local public housing authorities and subsidized by the federal government. Families must be low-income to be eligible, with 40% of units reserved for extremely low-income families. Tenants pay 30% of their adjusted income towards rent, with funding from HUD to cover the remaining costs. Public housing is funded by the federal government and managed by local housing authorities. Capital funds are used for modernization needs, while Choice Neighborhoods grants can be used for revitalization projects. The number of public housing units has been declining, and PHAs can demolish or sell developments with HUD approval. Since the mid-1990s, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) have been allowed to demolish or sell public housing developments with HUD approval without the requirement to replace those units. The 1998 act also gave PHAs the authority to convert public housing units to the voucher program. Programs like HOPE VI and Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) have led to more demolitions than replacements. Additionally, HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program provides funds for nonprofit organizations to build rental properties for low-income elderly households. The Section 202 program, established under the Housing Act of 1959, funds rental properties for low-income elderly households. It provides capital grants to nonprofit developers since the early 1990s, along with project rental assistance contracts. The program serves very low-income elderly households, with incomes at or below 50% of the area median income. The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program, established in 1990, provides capital grants to nonprofit organizations to create affordable rental housing for very low-income households with a disabled adult. The program also funds project rental assistance contracts to subsidize tenant rent payments for various types of housing. The Section 811 program provides capital grants for affordable housing for very low-income households with disabled adults, including homes, independent living facilities, rental units, and cooperative housing. Tenant-based rental assistance was available until FY2010, and since FY2011 it has been funded through the Section 8 account. Additionally, Section 811 rental assistance funds can now be used with capital funding from other sources. The Section 236 program, part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, encouraged private developers to create affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. It provided mortgage insurance and subsidies to building owners through Interest Reduction Payments (IRPs), allowing them to charge below-market rents. Units also received rental assistance through various programs like Section 8 and Rent Supplement. The Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program, part of the Housing Act of 1961, offered FHA-insured loans with 3% interest rates to create affordable housing. It was replaced by the Section 236 program in 1968. Units under this program had below-market rents and could receive rental assistance. The USDA housing programs, authorized under the Housing Act of 1949, provide grants or loans to farmers and rural residents for constructing, improving, or repairing dwellings. The Section 515 program allows for direct loans for rural rental and cooperative housing. The USDA housing programs offer loans at a 1% interest rate for rural rental and cooperative housing. The Section 538 program guarantees loans for affordable rural rental housing, while the Section 521 program provides rental assistance payments to owners of rental properties. The LIHTC program, enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, provides incentives for affordable rental housing development through federal tax credits. State housing finance agencies distribute the credits to developers who agree to build or renovate housing for low-income households. Developers sell the credits to investors to finance the projects. The LIHTC program provides tax credits to investors to reduce federal income tax liability over 10 years for housing developments. Criteria for qualifying include income thresholds for occupants, allowing for lower rents. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program offers tax credits to investors for affordable housing developments, with rent restrictions based on area median incomes. Units must remain affordable for at least 15 years, with over 2.3 million units in service as of 2018. States can issue private activity bonds, like mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs), to support affordable housing initiatives. Mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) are sold by state or local governments to investors, providing tax-exempt interest earnings. The proceeds finance home mortgages for eligible homebuyers, offering an interest rate subsidy. Borrowers must meet certain criteria, such as not owning a home in the past three years and meeting income limits. In FY2018, MRBs resulted in a $1.3 billion tax expenditure. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, established in 1974, aims to improve urban communities by providing housing and economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals. 70% of CDBG funds are distributed to entitlement communities, while 30% goes to states for use in smaller communities. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program allows recipient communities to use funds for various activities benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, including property acquisition, rehabilitation, public works, urban beautification, historic preservation, and housing development. Congress has also provided additional appropriations through CDBG to assist states and communities in responding to economic crises and disasters. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program, administered by HUD, aims to provide affordable housing through grants allocated via formula to participating jurisdictions and states. Grantees must match 25% of funds and submit a plan detailing housing needs. Funds can be used for owner-occupied housing rehabilitation, homebuyer assistance, rental housing construction, and tenant-based rental assistance. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was established in 2008 under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act to provide rental housing for low-income households. HTF funds are allocated to states based on a formula and must primarily be used for rental housing, with up to 10% allowed for certain homeownership activities. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was created in 2008 to provide rental housing for low-income households. Up to 10% of funds can be used for eligible first-time homebuyers. HTF funds must benefit very low-income households, with 75% for extremely low-income households. Funded by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it has deeper income targeting requirements than the HOME program. Contributions to the HTF began in 2016 due to financial concerns. The Homeless Assistance Grants, established in 1987, fund housing and services for homeless persons. Administered by HUD, the grants consist of the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program, Continuum of Care (CoC) program, and Rural Housing Stability (RHS) program. The grants were reauthorized in the 111th Congress by the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act. The Homeless Assistance Grants fund housing and services for homeless persons through programs like Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC), and Rural Housing Stability (RHS). ESG funds are used for emergency shelter and related services, while CoC program funds support transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, and supportive services. The RHS program, although not yet implemented, would assist rural grantees in similar ways as the CoC program, including homelessness prevention activities and relocation assistance. The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program is the only federal program that provides funding specifically for housing for individuals with AIDS and related illnesses. Established in 1990 as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, the program distributes funding through formula allocations and competitive grants. HUD awards 90% of appropriated funds by formula to states and eligible metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) meeting specific thresholds. The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program provides funding for housing for individuals with AIDS and related illnesses. Recipient states and MSAs can allocate grants to nonprofit organizations or government agencies for a variety of housing and social services. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans into a single block grant program. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) provides federal assistance to Indian tribes for affordable housing activities through block grants. Tribes submit Indian housing plans for review by HUD, and funding is allocated based on need. Tribes can leverage funds for affordable housing activities through the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), established in 1934, insures private lenders against losses on home mortgages, making them more willing to lend to borrowers with low down payments or little credit history. FHA-insured borrowers pay insurance premiums and must meet certain requirements. FHA offers single-family and multifamily mortgage insurance products, including home purchase, refinance, home improvement loans, and reverse mortgages for the elderly. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers single-family and multifamily mortgage insurance products, including home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans, as well as reverse mortgages for the elderly. FHA's programs are administered through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund account (MMI Fund) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI Fund). The MMI Fund provides insurance for single-family mortgages, while the GI/SRI Fund backs insurance for multifamily buildings, hospitals, nursing homes, and special purpose loans. FHA's single-family home mortgage program is its largest, insuring mortgages for both home purchases and refinances. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers single-family and multifamily mortgage insurance products for home purchases and refinances. FHA's share of the home purchase market averaged about 14% in the mid-1990s, fell to 5% in 2005, increased to 33% in 2009 during the housing market turmoil, and was at 20% in 2017. FHA's programs are administered through the MMI Fund and GI/SRI Fund. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 established the VA home loan guaranty program, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It provides insurance for mortgages made by private lenders, available for home purchase, construction, and refinancing. The program is open to veterans meeting specific service requirements, reserves members with at least six years of service, and spouses of veterans who died in action or due to service-connected disabilities. The VA home loan guaranty program provides insurance for mortgages made by private lenders for home purchase, construction, and refinancing. The VA reimburses lenders for a portion of losses if borrowers default, guaranteeing about 25% of the loan amount. The number of VA-insured purchase loans has increased from 2% in FY2005 to 9% in FY2017. The USDA administers loan and grant programs for rural housing, including the Section 502 Rural Housing Loan program. This program offers direct loans with a 33-year term and guaranteed loans with a 30-year term for very low- to moderate-income rural residents. Borrowers with incomes at or below 80% of the area median qualify for direct loans, while those at or below 115% of the area median qualify for guaranteed loans. Priority is given to first-time homebuyers, and borrowers may need to complete a homeownership counseling program. The USDA offers loans and grants through the Section 504 program for very low-income homeowners for home repairs or improvements. Grants may be available to homeowners age 62 or older who are unable to repay the full cost of repairs. In FY2017, USDA provided 3,400 loans totaling $20 million and 4,800 grants totaling $29 million. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) were established in 1932 to provide liquidity to savings and loan associations. Today, they lend money to various financial institutions and are government-sponsored enterprises with tax exemptions. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) were established in 1932 to provide liquidity to savings and loan associations. As government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), they receive tax exemptions and are required to contribute 10% of their net income annually towards an Affordable Housing Program (AHP). Through the AHP, the Banks provide grants and subsidized loans for rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income households, with a portion set aside for homeownership assistance for first-time buyers or rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) were established in 1932 to provide liquidity to savings and loan associations. As government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), they receive tax exemptions and contribute 10% of their net income annually towards an Affordable Housing Program (AHP). The AHP offers grants and subsidized loans for rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income households, including assistance for first-time homebuyers or rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing. Additionally, the Banks operate a Community Investment Program (CIP) that provides advances to member financial institutions at discounted interest rates for housing and community development activities. The Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) was created in 2008 to provide competitive grant funds to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) or eligible nonprofit organizations for financing purposes. The Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) provides grant funds to CDFIs or eligible nonprofits for affordable housing and related community development activities. CMF funds can be used for rental housing or homeownership, benefiting low-income households. Grantees can use funds for loan loss reserves, risk-sharing loans, and loan guarantees. CMF is funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, leveraging other funding sources. Contributions to CMF started in 2016, despite its creation in 2008. The Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) provides grant funds to CDFIs or eligible nonprofits for affordable housing and related community development activities. CMF funds can be used for rental housing or homeownership, benefiting low-income households. Homeownership promotion includes government assistance in financing home purchases and tax preferences favoring homeowners, such as the mortgage interest deduction. This deduction allows homeowners to deduct mortgage interest from their taxable income, reducing their tax liability for those who itemize deductions. In FY2018, the mortgage interest deduction resulted in a $33.7 billion tax expenditure. The Housing Act of 1937 addressed an acute shortage of decent dwellings. Today, the main housing issue is affordability, defined as costing no more than 30% of a household's income. According to data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 18.5 million households were severely cost burdened and 19.6 million households were moderately cost burdened in 2016. Public policy is most concerned with the housing affordability problems of the lowest-income families. In 2016, 70% of households with annual income below $15,000 were severely cost burdened, and 33% of households with annual income between $15,000 and $29,999 were severely cost burdened. In 2017, HUD reported that 8.3 million renter households had worst case housing needs, defined as paying more than half of their income for housing or living in severely substandard housing. This represented an increase from 2013 and a 41% increase since 2007. Prior to 2005, the percentage of households with worst case housing needs had remained steady at around 5%. The percentage of households with worst case housing needs has remained steady at around 5% since HUD began reporting in 1991. The majority are severely cost burdened, with 95.6% experiencing cost burdens only. Public housing, Section 8 vouchers, and project-based Section 8 rental assistance serve roughly 4 million households and target assistance to extremely low-income families. The Section 8 voucher program, public housing program, and project-based Section 8 rental assistance program have differences in evolution, benefit structure, and administration. Household characteristics data shows that the Section 8 voucher program serves more single, female-headed households with children compared to public housing and project-based programs. 40% of voucher households are headed by females with children, while public housing has 34% and project-based has 25%. The project-based Section 8 program primarily serves elderly or disabled households, with over three-fourths of all households served falling into this category. Public housing and the Section 8 voucher program also have a large majority of elderly or disabled households. HUD reports the race and ethnicity of the head of household in these programs. In the Section 8 voucher program and public housing, non-Hispanic blacks make up the largest share of households. In the project-based Section 8 program, non-Hispanic whites are the largest share. Hispanic households make up 15-21% of households served. The programs target low-income households, with many having very low or extremely low incomes. In 2018, national median income was $71,900. Low income is at or below $57,500; very low income, $35,950; and extremely low income, $21,550. Majority of households in Section 8 voucher program, public housing, and project-based Section 8 rental assistance have incomes at or below $14,999. Federal government reduced role in assisted housing creation since the 1980s, ceasing funding for new construction under project-based Section 8 program. Between 1976 and 1982, federal housing programs produced over 1 million units of subsidized housing. Since 1982, federal housing programs have significantly decreased production of subsidized housing units, with only around 25,000 new units annually. Congress created the LIHTC and HOME programs, giving more control to state and local governments in housing policy. States and localities have utilized these programs to create hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units. This shift has led to increased responsibility for affordable housing provision and priority-setting at the local level. The LIHTC and HOME programs have allowed states and localities to prioritize affordable housing using federal funds. This shift has increased the importance of preserving existing affordable housing units and the need for diverse funding sources beyond federal grants. The HOME program allows states to allocate tax credits for housing, including for homeless individuals and persons with disabilities. Funds can be used for new rental housing and rental assistance for low-income households. However, these programs may not effectively reach the neediest households due to income restrictions on affordable units. Many older HUD programs built affordable housing for households below 30% of area median income. States and local governments also support affordable housing through housing trust funds and inclusionary zoning. Trust funds use dedicated funding sources to create a pool of funds for affordable housing, while inclusionary zoning requires housing developers to include affordable units in their projects. Inclusionary zoning supports affordable housing by requiring developers to dedicate a percentage of units as affordable. Developers receive incentives like density bonuses and expedited permits. The decreased federal role in affordable housing production increases pressure to maintain affordability of existing units. Older HUD programs are no longer available to low-income households. Section 8 rental assistance and other federal programs that once supported affordable housing are no longer available to low-income households. Property owners who entered into contracts with HUD to maintain affordability for a certain number of years are now facing expiring contracts, leading to the potential for market-rate rents and unaffordable housing for current tenants. Efforts to preserve affordability in these units are crucial in the face of these changes. Efforts to maintain affordable housing units are known as \"affordable housing preservation.\" Congress has enacted laws like the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act in 1987 and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act in 1990 to prevent owners from prepaying mortgages on certain properties without meeting specific conditions. Preservation of affordable housing remains a concern due to the temporary nature of some measures. The Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act imposed conditions on prepayment and provided incentives for affordability. However, Congress later allowed owners to prepay without HUD permission and discontinued funding for preservation incentives. The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act restructured debt and rental assistance contracts. Developers now need to combine various funding sources for affordable housing projects. Developers of low-income housing now need to combine multiple funding sources, such as LIHTCs, tax exempt bonds, and state or local housing trust funds, due to the decrease in federal grants for affordable housing construction. This shift has made it necessary for building owners to also seek rent subsidies. The interactions among various financing streams for low-income housing, including Section 8 and HOME rent subsidies, can be complex and may require expertise from housing finance professionals. The number of Section 8 vouchers provided by the federal government has increased, while direct subsidies for housing units have declined due to a shift towards tenant-based assistance. Congress's decision to create new vouchers instead of funding new construction projects has contributed to this change. The shift towards tenant-based assistance, including Section 8 vouchers, has been influenced by a decrease in project-based assistance and public housing units. Private property owners can choose to renew contracts with HUD or leave the program, leading to tenant protection vouchers for displaced families. Additionally, since the mid-1990s, PHAs are not obligated to replace demolished or sold public housing units. The decline in public housing units is partly due to the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, which allows PHAs to convert public housing properties to project-based Section 8 rental assistance or vouchers. This shift from project-based to tenant-based assistance offers portability for residents. There is debate over whether voucher portability leads to economic or social mobility. Early research showed promise for low-income black families moving to more integrated neighborhoods using vouchers. Subsequent research had mixed results, but recent studies support the idea that neighborhood effects are significant for young children. Transitioning from public housing to the private rental market with a voucher can be challenging without adequate support. The federal government has provided support for homeownership since the 1930s through various programs and activities. However, there are challenges with voucher portability for low-income families accessing areas of opportunity due to structural barriers in the program and rental markets. The federal government has long supported homeownership through various programs and activities, including favorable tax treatment and grant programs for down payment assistance. Policymakers see these initiatives as crucial for helping households access affordable financing. Efforts have also been made to reduce disparities in homeownership rates, particularly among different racial and ethnic groups. The severe downturn in U.S. housing and mortgage markets starting in 2007 resulted in increased mortgage foreclosure rates and steep declines in home equity. This led to a drop in the overall homeownership rate and widened the gap between white and black householders. The Census Bureau reported a homeownership rate of 63.9% in 2017, down from a peak of 69% in 2004. Disparities exist between white and black householders, with non-Hispanic white householders having a rate of 72.3% compared to 42.3% for black householders. Hispanics had a rate of 46.2%, 26 percentage points lower than non-Hispanic white households. Policymakers are debating the federal government's role in supporting homeownership post-housing market turmoil. Recent experience has shifted focus from increasing homeownership rates to ensuring sustainable homeownership for creditworthy households. Data on federal spending on housing assistance programs since 1980 is presented in Table 15, showing outlays in real and nominal dollars. Loan commitments, tax expenditures, and non-appropriated sources are not included in this data. Outlays for selected housing programs have increased significantly over the past three decades, with a 449% increase in nominal dollars and a 108% increase in real dollars. The number of units eligible for payment/households served under rental assistance programs has grown by 66% since FY1980. Growth was most significant in the 1980s and early 1990s, with fluctuations in unit numbers since then. The number of units eligible for payment/households served under rental assistance programs has fluctuated over the years, with a decline from FY2001 to FY2009. HUD stopped publishing this data after FY2009 and began reporting the number of households served instead. Between FY2010 and FY2016, there was modest growth in assisted households, mainly through increases in vouchers. The trend has shifted towards rental assistance like Section 8 vouchers, with a decline in other housing assistance programs since the 1970s. Since the mid-1990s, public housing units have been demolished and replaced with Section 8 vouchers through programs like HOPE VI."
