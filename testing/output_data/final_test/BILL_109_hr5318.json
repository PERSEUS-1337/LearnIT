Criminal Penalty for Failure to Notify Law Enforcement: Amends Chapter 47 of title 18, US Code to include a new section on concealing security breaches involving personal information. Offense includes failure to notify Secret Service or FBI of a major security breach, punishable by fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both. The term 'breach' refers to a security breach involving the acquisition of means of identification of 10,000 or more individuals, causing a significant risk of identity theft, databases owned by the Federal Government, or data containing means of identification of Federal Government employees or contractors in national security or law enforcement. After a reasonable investigation, if it is likely that identity theft has occurred or will occur due to a breach, there is a presumption that the breach has not caused a significant risk of identity theft if the data is encrypted or rendered unusable. This presumption can be challenged with evidence of compromised encryption. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security will establish rules for notifying individuals of data breaches. The rules will not mandate specific products or technologies for data protection. The rules and regulations for notifying individuals of data breaches will require notifying the United States Secret Service or FBI before informing consumers, with a 14-day deadline. If national security or criminal investigations are at risk, the Secret Service or FBI can delay consumer notification for up to 30 days.

The Secret Service or FBI will notify the Attorney General in each State if the breach may involve espionage, foreign counterintelligence, or other sensitive information. Investigation notifies the Attorney General in each State affected by the breach if the Secret Service or FBI declines to pursue a criminal investigation. No lawsuit can be filed against law enforcement entities or individuals who notify law enforcement of a breach. Failure to notify under section 1039 of title 18, US Code, incurs a civil penalty. The requirement to notify law enforcement is related to State laws. The requirement to notify law enforcement under this section supersedes any other notice required by State law. The notice to law enforcement is in addition to consumer notice laws under State or Federal law. Federal agencies must notify of a major security breach as required by law. Federal agencies must notify the United States Secret Service or Federal Bureau of Investigation of a major security breach in the same way as individuals, as mandated by the United States Code.
