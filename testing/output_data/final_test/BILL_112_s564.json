This section defines key terms such as eligible employee, Fund, Preserve, Secretary, State, and Trust. The Valles Caldera National Preserve is designated as a unit of the National Park System to protect various values. The Secretary will administer the Preserve in accordance with applicable laws, including the National Park Service Organic Act and the Act of August 21, 1935. Management coordination may also be implemented. The Secretary will prepare a management plan for the Valles Caldera National Preserve in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and in accordance with relevant laws. The Secretary of Agriculture, State and local governments, Indian tribes, and the public are involved in the management of the Valles Caldera National Preserve. The Secretary has the authority to acquire land within the Preserve through purchase, donation, or transfer from another Federal agency. Acquired land is to be administered as part of the Preserve. Additionally, there is a Science and Education Program in place. The Secretary is responsible for the Science and Education Program at the Valles Caldera National Preserve, which includes research, interpretation, ecological restoration, and science-based methods. The Secretary oversees the Science and Education Program at the Valles Caldera National Preserve, focusing on research, interpretation, ecological restoration, and science-based management. The program may include establishing a science and education center outside the Preserve boundaries. Grazing of livestock within the Preserve is allowed for scientific research or interpretation of ranching history. The Act does not affect the State's responsibilities for fish and wildlife, with consultation between the Secretary and the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. The Department of Game and Fish permits hunting and fishing in the Preserve according to laws and may designate no-hunting zones for safety and wildlife protection. The Secretary undertakes ecological restoration activities to improve forest, grassland, and riparian areas, including cooperative agreements with adjacent pueblos. The Preserve coordinates activities with adjacent pueblos and all land within its boundaries is withdrawn from public land laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. Volcanic domes and peaks above 9,600 feet are preserved for natural, cultural, and historic resources. Within the area of volcanic domes and peaks above 9,600 feet in elevation, no roads or buildings can be constructed, and no motorized access is allowed. The specific volcanic domes and peaks include Redondo Peak, Redondito, South Mountain, San Antonio Mountain, Cerro Seco, Cerro San Luis, Cerros Santa Rosa, Cerros del Abrigo, Cerro del Medio, Rabbit Mountain, Cerro Grande, Cerro Toledo, Indian Point, and Sierra de los Valles. In the Preserve, construction or motorized access is generally prohibited in areas above 9,600 feet, including specific volcanic domes and peaks like Redondo Peak, Cerro Grande, Indian Point, Sierra de los Valles, and Cerros de los Posos. However, exceptions are made for administrative purposes or emergencies. The Secretary must protect traditional cultural and religious sites in consultation with Indian tribes and pueblos, providing access as required by the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. The Secretary must protect traditional cultural and religious sites in the Preserve for Indian tribes and pueblos, allowing access for traditional uses. Motorized access is prohibited on Preserve land near the Santa Clara Indian Reservation. Additionally, the Secretary may temporarily close specific areas to the public upon request to safeguard traditional cultural practices. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant parties, will study the feasibility of establishing a hiking trail along the rim of the Valles Caldera within the Preserve and adjacent National Forest System land. Agreements will be sought with affected Indian tribes or pueblos to protect cultural and religious sites near the Caldera Rim Trail. The Act does not impact valid existing rights, including the trail and privacy of adjacent pueblo land. SEC. 4. TRANSFER OF ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION. The Preserve's administrative jurisdiction is transferred to the Secretary for management as part of the National Park System. The Santa Fe National Forest boundaries are adjusted to exclude the Preserve. An interim management agreement will be established between the Secretary and the Trust for a smooth transition of administration. Until a management plan is completed, the Secretary can oversee the Preserve. The Secretary may administer the Preserve in accordance with Trust management activities or plans under the Valles Caldera Preservation Act, as long as they align with section 3(b)(1). The Preserve will remain open to public use during the interim management period. The Trust will terminate 180 days after the enactment of the Act unless the Secretary extends the termination date to facilitate transitional management. Upon termination, Trust assets will be handled accordingly. Upon termination of the Trust, all assets will be transferred to the Secretary, and any appropriated amounts will be available for Preserve administration. The Secretary will assume all contracts, obligations, and liabilities of the Trust, including new ones within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Trust and the Secretary will prepare a budget for interim Preserve management. The Trust cannot incur new liabilities without the Secretary's written approval. The Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture can hire Trust employees for comparable positions at the Preserve or other areas. Employees hired from the Trust will be subject to specific pay provisions. Eligible employees will be retained by the Trust for at least 180 days, considered on detail to the Secretary, and under the Secretary's direction. The Secretary has access to Trust records for Preserve management. The Secretary assumes Trust powers over the Valles caldera fund for Preserve management without further appropriation. SEC. 5. REPEAL OF VALLES CALDERA PRESERVATION ACT. On termination of the Trust, the Valles Caldera Preservation Act is repealed. The Secretary of Agriculture's authority to acquire mineral interests is transferred, provisions related to the Pueblo of Santa Clara remain, and the Fund will not be terminated until all amounts are expended. The Valles Caldera Preservation Act is repealed upon termination of the Trust. The boundaries of the Preserve, Santa Fe National Forest, Bandelier National Monument, and land conveyed to the Pueblo of Santa Clara remain unaffected. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Valles Caldera Preservation Act."
