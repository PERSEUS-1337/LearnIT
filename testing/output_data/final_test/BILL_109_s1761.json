    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf Coast Recovery Act\". It includes findings related to the Gulf Coast region. Congress acknowledges that public officials lack the resources to fully implement disaster response and often rely on private contractors for support, who have historically provided valuable services during times of crisis, such as after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Private contractors played a crucial role in the response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by providing expertise and equipment that enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the response. They also supported officials in disaster situations, making it safer for rescue workers to search for and recover individuals and property. Private contractors play a vital role in assisting public officials during disasters to address dangerous conditions, restore public services, and protect safety and health. Despite their valuable contributions, contractors face potential litigation and liability risks, as seen in class action lawsuits following the 9/11 attacks. Private contractors face litigation risks that deter them from assisting in disasters. Clarifying their liability can ensure continued support for government requests and reduce legal expenses in disaster recovery. Private contractors may be insulated from liability under certain Federal laws to enhance Federal agencies' control over disaster response. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"disaster zone\" is defined as the region where major disasters like Hurricane Katrina were declared by the President, or any region where a disaster requiring over $15,000,000,000 in Federal assistance is declared. A \"government contract\" is a contract between entities like a person, proprietorship, or partnership. The curr_chunk states that a contractor can be a person, partnership, corporation, or government agency involved in construction-related activities. It also includes subcontractors at any tier of a contract. The curr_chunk discusses the limitation on liability of federal contractors under certain federal laws. The curr_chunk states that government contractors working in disaster zones are not liable under certain federal laws, administered by specific agencies, for any lawsuits filed by private individuals. This does not affect the application of section 5 of the Act or existing laws for these contractors. The curr_chunk specifies that government contractors in disaster zones are exempt from certain federal laws like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or state fair employment laws when sued by private individuals.
