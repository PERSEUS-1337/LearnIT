    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19322 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require applicants for a state license to first obtain a license, permit, or authorization from the local jurisdiction. Applicants must also electronically submit fingerprint images and related information to the Department of Justice for background checks. The Department of Justice responds to licensing authority requests and charges applicants a fee for processing. Applicants must provide documentation of compliance with local regulations. To apply for a medical cannabis license, applicants must provide proof of legal right to use the proposed location, ensure it is at least 600 feet away from a school, and sign a statement confirming the accuracy of the information provided. Applicants with 20 or more employees must agree to a labor peace agreement, excluding supervisors who have authority over hiring and disciplinary actions. To apply for a cultivation license, the applicant must provide their seller's permit number or indicate they are in the process of applying, submit required information, declare themselves as an \"agricultural employer,\" pay all necessary fees, and show proof of a bond for potential cannabis destruction costs due to licensing violations. Applicants for medical cannabis licenses must provide detailed operating procedures for cultivation, extraction, transportation, inventory, quality control, and security. Applicants with 20 or more employees must commit to implementing an approved employee training program within one year of licensure. Section 19323 of the Business and Professions Code states that a licensing authority can deny an application if the applicant or premises do not meet the requirements. Reasons for denial include failure to comply with regulations, conduct that violates licensing grounds, or failure to provide necessary information. The licensing authority can deny an application if the applicant has been convicted of an offense related to the business or profession. They will review the nature of the crime, circumstances, and evidence of rehabilitation to determine suitability for a license. The licensing authority can deny an application if the applicant has certain felony convictions, including drug-related offenses, violent felonies, serious felonies, or fraud-related felonies. Additionally, if the applicant or any of its officers have been fined for cultivating controlled substances on public or private lands, their application may be denied. The applicant may be denied if they have been sanctioned for unlicensed cannabis activities, failed to obtain a seller's permit, failed to comply with operating procedures, or engaged in conduct warranting disciplinary action. The licensing authority may deny an application for an applicant with 20 or more employees after July 1, 2018, unless the applicant commits to implementing an approved employee training program within one year of licensure. The licensee must provide employee training on compliance with statutory requirements, industry best practices, health and safety standards, and workplace protections. Each licensing authority must establish standards for approving employee training programs, prohibiting programs from apprenticeship programs approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards. Licensees can only provide training programs to their own employees. Workplace training organizations can be approved as third-party providers of employee training programs, with no limitation on approving such organizations. Licensing authorities must approve employee training programs and can charge fees for approval. Licensees with 20 or more employees must implement a training program within one year of licensure or face license revocation. Fees collected must cover regulatory costs, and adjustments can be made once per year. This section will be effective starting July 1, 2018 and no reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts as any costs incurred are related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
