    "content": "Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on developing best practices and retention strategies in nursing staff management, specifically focusing on grants. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities for nursing care demonstrations, best practices, and nurse retention strategies. Eligible entities include partnerships with healthcare facilities and nursing schools, or healthcare facilities with accreditation in outcomes measurement. The term 'health care facility' includes various types of healthcare institutions. 'Nurse leadership' encompasses nurse executives, administrators, and managers. A 'professional nurse' is a registered nurse with a valid license. Grants will be distributed to diverse entities across different regions and types of healthcare facilities. The Secretary will award grants for nursing services based on the number of staffed beds in health care facilities, with maximum amounts ranging from $200,000 to $600,000. Priority will be given to certain criteria when awarding grants. The Secretary prioritizes health care facilities that have not received grant funds before or have shown outcome improvements for grant renewals. Grant funds must be used to improve the work environment, implement nurse retention programs, and reduce workplace injuries. The eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under subsection (a), including a description of the proposed projects to be carried out with grant funds. The eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under subsection (a), including a description of the proposed projects to be carried out with grant funds. The projects should include means to evaluate cost-effectiveness, outcomes related to staff turnover, workplace injuries, and patient care sensitive to nursing care. Additionally, a system of patient outcomes measurement, described by nurse leadership and professional nurses, should be sensitive to nursing care, evaluate patient and educational needs, and be adequately funded by the health care facility. The health care facility must have sufficient funds and organizational processes that involve nursing staff input, including a nurse retention committee, nurse executive participation in management, and a nurse residency training program. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2007 for this purpose."
