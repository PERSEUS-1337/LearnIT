    "content": "In the late 1970s, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to address responsibility for environmental contamination and authorize the federal government to clean up contaminated sites in the United States. CERCLA created the Superfund program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). CERCLA established a liability scheme holding owners and operators responsible for cleanup costs. If responsible parties cannot pay, the federal government can finance the cleanup, known as \"orphan shares.\" The liability scheme of CERCLA holds parties accountable for environmental contamination, with government financing cleanup for \"orphan shares.\" The \"polluter pays principle\" dictates that polluters should cover cleanup costs. The Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund was created to fund cleanup at sites where responsible parties are unable to pay. Funding initially came from industry taxes and the U.S. Treasury, but the authority to collect industry taxes expired in 1995. The Superfund Trust Fund was initially funded by industry taxes and the U.S. Treasury, but the authority to collect industry taxes expired in 1995. Congress increased Treasury contributions to make up for the shortfall. Superfund Trust Fund monies for cleanup are subject to Congressional appropriations. Federal facilities cleanup is not funded by the Superfund Trust Fund but by other federal monies allocated for agency programs. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy oversee most federal facility cleanups, while EPA and states enforce CERCLA implementation. CERCLA directs EPA to establish a National Priorities List (NPL) of contaminated sites, including federal facilities. Potentially responsible parties may be required to clean up sites or EPA may use Superfund money upfront and recover costs later. If parties cannot pay, Superfund money may be used. The Superfund program may use appropriated funds to pay for cleanup costs at sites where responsible parties cannot pay. The report summarizes the major cleanup authorities of CERCLA and discusses the process, financial liability, enforcement, and applicability of the act. The Superfund program can finance the cleanup of contaminated sites, including federal facilities and brownfields properties. Specific cleanup actions are determined on a site-by-site basis, with guidance provided by EPA regulations and agency documents. Other federal agencies have developed additional guidance for cleanup at their own facilities under CERCLA. This report summarizes selected statutory provisions of CERLCA, focusing on amendments made by Congress to clarify cleanup authorities and provide relief from liability for certain parties. Congress has also authorized federal assistance for the cleanup of abandoned or idled \"brownfields\" properties to encourage redevelopment. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 clarified cleanup requirements for federal facilities under CERCLA and renewed funding for EPA's Superfund program. It also established a Defense Environmental Restoration Program for military facility contamination. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 extended funding for EPA's Superfund program and the authority to collect Superfund taxes, but reauthorizing legislation has not been passed. Congress continues to fund the Superfund program with general Treasury revenues. Funding for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program has been authorized and appropriated annually since its establishment. The Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act of 1992 and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1997 amended CERCLA to facilitate the transfer of federal property for cleanup. Amendments have also addressed the fairness of CERCLA's liability scheme. The liability scheme of CERCLA was amended in 1996 and 1999 to protect certain parties from cleanup liability. The Superfund Recycling Equity Act exempted generators and transporters of recyclable materials from liability under CERCLA. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act in 2002 provided relief for those who contributed small quantities of waste. The 2002 act amended CERCLA to exempt certain parties from cleanup liability, including those who contributed small quantities of waste or only municipal solid waste, owners of contaminated property due to migration from a contiguous property, and \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers. Specific criteria were established for exempting \"innocent\" owners who purchased contaminated property without knowledge of the contamination. Persons seeking exemption must have performed \"all appropriate inquiry\" into the property's prior uses before acquisition. The 2002 act amended CERCLA to exempt certain parties from cleanup liability, including those who contributed small quantities of waste or only municipal solid waste, owners of contaminated property due to migration from a contiguous property, and \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers. Specific criteria were established for exempting \"innocent\" owners who purchased contaminated property without knowledge of the contamination. Persons seeking exemption must have performed \"all appropriate inquiry\" into the property's prior uses before acquisition. P.L. 107-118 authorized federal grants to assist in the cleanup of \"brownfields\" properties, which are typically abandoned, underutilized, or idled sites with known or suspected contamination. The EPA established a program in 1993 to assist in the cleanup of brownfields properties, which are less contaminated than NPL sites but may still require cleanup for reuse. P.L. 107-118 provided statutory authority for this program and created a separate Brownfields grant program within EPA. CERCLA authorizes the President to respond to hazardous substance releases, and federal grants are available for brownfields cleanup. The President delegated response authorities of CERCLA to EPA and other federal agencies. EPA can respond to land releases, while the U.S. Coast Guard handles releases into water bodies. Federal facilities can take action for releases on their premises, with oversight from EPA and states. Federal funding for response actions is subject to congressional appropriations. Notification of a release triggering federal response is required under CERCLA. The regulatory limits for hazardous substances, known as \"reportable quantities,\" are set by federal regulations. State or local officials, as well as the public, can report suspected releases. The National Response Center notifies the appropriate federal agency to take response actions under CERCLA, such as cleanup to prevent harmful exposure. Certain types of environmental contamination are excluded from these actions. Congress has excluded certain types of environmental contamination from CERCLA response authorities, which may be addressed under other federal environmental laws. These exclusions are provided within the statutory definitions of key terms like \"hazardous substance,\" \"pollutant or contaminant,\" and \"release.\" In addition, limitations are placed on response actions under CERCLA for releases of hazardous substances. The response authorities of CERCLA do not cover releases of petroleum. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is the primary federal law addressing releases of petroleum, while CERCLA generally excludes petroleum from the definition of \"hazardous substance.\" Other federal laws provide authorities to respond to petroleum releases in specific situations, such as the Clean Water Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act. CERCLA has been applied to clean up wastes containing petroleum only if they also contain hazardous substances. CERCLA excludes certain releases from its response authorities, including specific nuclear materials and radionuclides. EPA designates radionuclides as hazardous substances under CERCLA. CERCLA excludes certain releases from its response authorities, such as workplace exposure, engine emissions, and normal fertilizer application. Liability exemptions include registered pesticide use and federally permitted releases. Response actions are limited to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, excluding naturally occurring substances in their unaltered form. EPA retains response authority but not liability enforcement in certain instances. CERCLA authorizes response actions for releases of hazardous substances in various situations, including public health or environmental emergencies. The President is required to develop a National Hazardous Substance Response Plan to prioritize and respond to releases into the environment. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) incorporates procedures and standards for response actions under CERCLA. The President must develop a National Priorities List (NPL) of hazardous sites, delegated to the EPA, updated annually using a Hazard Ranking System (HRS). The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) evaluates factors like hazardous substances, contamination migration, and proximity to human populations to determine NPL listing eligibility. Contamination severity alone may not be enough for NPL placement. States can designate a high-priority site, and EPA has the authority to list sites based on other mechanisms. EPA may list a site on the NPL if it poses a significant public health threat and remedial action is more cost-effective than removal. Over 1,600 sites have been listed on the NPL, including federal facilities, with over 300 sites deleted once cleanup objectives were met. EPA evaluates risks using the HRS for most listings. CERCLA authorizes two types of response actions: \"removal\" and \"remedial\" actions. Removal may not involve physical contamination removal, while remedial actions may not necessarily treat contamination. NCP allows remedial actions at NPL sites to be funded by Superfund monies, while removal actions can be funded at non-NPL sites for emergencies. The funding restriction in the regulations reserves Superfund monies for costlier remedial actions at NPL sites, prioritizing contaminated sites for remedial actions based on the statutory requirement of CERCLA. Remedial actions are longer term and more costly, requiring a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for in-depth review. The funding restrictions in the regulations prioritize Superfund monies for costlier remedial actions at NPL sites, which require a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for in-depth review. Remedial actions are subject to public participation requirements under Section 117 of CERCLA, while removal actions funded with Superfund monies are restricted to one year and $2 million, with exceptions in certain situations. These limitations ensure removal actions are not pursued on a broader scale to avoid the more in-depth review required for remedial actions. CERCLA does not impose limitations on removal actions funded by responsible parties or federal agencies at federal facilities with dedicated monies. Imposing timing and cost restrictions on removal actions at federal facilities could hinder necessary cleanup efforts. States must agree to share costs of remedial actions at non-federal NPL sites to receive federal Superfund financing. The federal government and states share the costs of assuming responsibility for orphan shares of cleanup costs under CERCLA. States are not required to share costs of removal actions, which can be funded by federal Superfund monies. This cost-sharing requirement aims to reduce the financial burden on federal taxpayers for long-term cleanup commitments. The state must agree to share costs of remedial actions to receive federal Superfund monies. The state's financial commitments are specified in a binding contract or agreement with the federal government. The state must pay 10% of remedial action costs, or 50% if the site was owned by the state. Future maintenance of the remedial actions is also required by the state. CERCLA allows states to delay maintenance responsibilities for groundwater or surface water remedies for the first 10 years to reduce costs burden. During this period, federal Superfund monies can cover maintenance costs. Response actions at contaminated sites aim to achieve acceptable levels of exposure for human health and the environment, while being cost-effective in the short and long term. Remedial actions involving treatment to reduce contamination are preferred over actions that do not involve treatment, such as containment or removal of wastes. Containment methods on-site may pose risks if they fail over time, and regular reviews of remedial actions are required to assess their performance. The President may take additional remedial actions at contaminated sites every five years to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Cleanup decisions are made on a site-by-site basis, considering factors like potential human exposure and feasibility of cleanup alternatives. The required level of cleanup can vary widely from site to site. The level of cleanup required at contaminated sites varies depending on the contaminants present and cleanup standards. CERCLA mandates compliance with applicable requirements to protect human health and the environment, serving as an umbrella statute for other regulations. Waivers for specific standards are allowed if part of a larger remedial action meeting the standard upon completion. CERCLA allows waivers for specific cleanup standards if compliance would pose greater risks, be technically impracticable, or not provide a balance between protection and available funds. Specific standards are not listed, but two sets broadly apply to remedial actions at any site. The law requires remedial actions to achieve Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act and be consistent with water quality criteria under the Clean Water Act. States must share costs for cleanup at non-federal NPL sites to receive federal Superfund monies. Section 121(f) of CERCLA requires states to have \"substantial and meaningful involvement\" in cleanup decisions, but there are limitations for federal facilities. States do not share cleanup costs at these sites and must show that federal agency decisions are not supported by \"substantial evidence\" to challenge them. The public also has a role in commenting on remedial actions, similar to other federal laws. EPA or other federal agencies are responsible for implementing these actions. Section 117 of CERCLA requires EPA to allow public comment on remedial action proposals, with final decisions requiring public notice and response to significant comments. Removal actions are exempt from public comment requirements due to the need for immediate action. EPA typically informs the public about removal actions to provide information on the nature and timing of the actions. Section 117 of CERCLA authorizes technical assistance grants for community groups to understand cleanup decision documents. ATSDR assesses health risks at NPL sites to inform the public and aid decision-makers in evaluating cleanup actions. The ATSDR, under CERCLA, provides toxicological profiles of hazardous substances at NPL sites to identify health effects from exposure. It can also offer medical care during public health emergencies related to toxic substances, with discretion on declaring an emergency. The ATSDR, under CERCLA, educates the public about health risks from hazardous substances and assesses risks at sites for cleanup decisions. CERCLA identifies responsible parties liable for response actions and damages from hazardous substance releases. Under CERCLA, responsible parties are liable for injury, destruction, or loss, as well as public health assessments. Section 107 identifies four categories of potentially responsible parties for costs associated with hazardous substance releases. Under CERCLA, responsible parties are liable for cleanup costs beyond facility boundaries if hazardous substances migrate through the environment. The term \"environment\" includes land, surface water, groundwater, and ambient air. Cleanup actions may be necessary wherever hazardous substances spread, such as into groundwater or surface water. Hazardous substances migrating into groundwater or surface water can travel long distances, leading to cleanup actions over a larger area. Liability under CERCLA is strict, joint and several, and retroactive, allowing parties to be held responsible regardless of negligence. Joint and several liability means one or more parties can be held accountable for full cleanup costs, but Section 113(f)(1) allows for cost recovery from other parties. CERCLA allows parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs through contribution claims in court based on equitable factors. Joint and several liability may not apply if a party can prove their waste did not contribute to contamination. Retroactive liability applies to hazardous substances released before December 11, 1980. Liability for natural resource damages extends only to releases after CERCLA's enactment. This summary provides a brief overview of CERCLA's liability standards. Since its enactment in 1980, CERCLA has been the subject of over 1,000 court decisions interpreting liability standards for cleanup costs. Section 107(b) of CERCLA provides defenses to liability under certain circumstances, allowing parties to avoid liability for the release of hazardous substances if they can prove it was caused solely by an act of. The third party defense, also known as the \"innocent\" landowner defense, allows a party to avoid liability for a hazardous substance release if caused by an act of God, war, or a third party with no contractual relationship. CERCLA defines the conditions for claiming lack of a contractual relationship in order to qualify for this defense. Congress has amended CERCLA to limit liability for certain parties not involved in contamination actions, such as response action contractors and state/local governments acquiring contaminated property involuntarily. Certain parties are exempt from liability under CERCLA, including fiduciaries, financial lenders acquiring property through foreclosure, generators of scrap materials intended for recycling, small waste contributors, service station dealers disposing of uncontaminated recycled oil, innocent landowners, and owners of contaminated property due to migration from a neighboring site. Amendments to CERCLA in 1980 provided limitations on cleanup liability for specific parties, such as bona fide prospective purchasers and parties not subject to liability in certain situations like proper pesticide application or federally permitted releases of hazardous substances. Private contractors hired for cleanup could also face liability as operators or arrangers for disposal. Section 119 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 added protections for cleanup contractors by limiting their liability for injuries, costs, damages, or other liabilities resulting from hazardous substance releases. This was in response to concerns that liability deterred private contractors from cleaning up contaminated sites. Cleanup contractors are not liable under CERCLA or federal law for such incidents, but they are not immune from liability under state law. Section 119 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 limits the liability of cleanup contractors for hazardous substance releases. Cleanup contractors are not exempt from federal liability for negligent, grossly negligent, or intentional misconduct. The President has discretion to indemnify contractors for negligent conduct under certain circumstances. The Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 added Section 107(n) to CERCLA to limit the liability of fiduciaries to the value of assets held. The Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 added Section 107(n) to CERCLA to limit the liability of fiduciaries who hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for another person, excluding financial lenders not involved in facility management from liability for hazardous substance releases. Title VI\u2014Superfund Recycling Equity\u2014of Appendix I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 added Section 127 to CERCLA to exempt certain parties involved in recycling scrap materials from cleanup liability. This exemption applies to those who \"arranged\" for the recycling of scrap materials, addressing concerns of becoming liable as generators or transporters of wastes. The exemption under Section 127 of CERCLA applies to parties involved in recycling scrap materials to avoid liability as generators or transporters of wastes. It covers recyclable materials such as plastic, glass, textiles, rubber, metal, and certain types of batteries, excluding materials with hazardous substances like PCBs. The exemption under Section 127 of CERCLA applies to parties involved in recycling scrap materials to avoid liability as generators or transporters of wastes. It covers recyclable materials such as plastic, glass, textiles, rubber, metal, and certain types of batteries, excluding materials with hazardous substances like PCBs. To qualify for the exemption, the person arranging for recycling must meet specific criteria and demonstrate \"reasonable care\" in ensuring compliance with environmental laws at the recycling facility. Section 127(f) of CERCLA exempts parties involved in recycling scrap materials from liability if they meet specific criteria and exercise \"reasonable care.\" The exemption is unavailable if there is reason to believe the material won't be recycled, if hazardous substances are added, or if the receiving facility is not in compliance with environmental laws. Section 102(a) of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act limits liability for parties contributing certain wastes to NPL-listed sites. Section 102(a) of P.L. 107-118 added exemptions to CERCLA for parties who contributed small amounts of hazardous substances to NPL-listed sites. The exemptions apply to those who generated or transported waste to these sites before April 1, 2001, and contributed less than 110 gallons of liquid materials or 200 pounds of solid materials. Additionally, residential property owners, small businesses, and small non-profit organizations that only contributed municipal solid waste are also exempt from cleanup liability. The exemptions under P.L. 107-118 apply to generators and transporters of household waste, not to disposal site owners or transporters who selected the site. Subtitle B also provides exemptions for \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers and innocent landowners with specific criteria for the third party defense. The exemptions under P.L. 107-118 apply to site owners who meet statutory criteria, regardless of NPL listing. Prior to this, EPA used Section 122 of CERCLA for voluntary settlement agreements with prospective purchasers to limit cleanup liability. After P.L. 107-118, \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers meeting statutory criteria could be exempt from cleanup liability without formal EPA settlement agreements. This exemption applies to those acquiring contaminated property after January 11, 2002, and is not retroactive. The exemption from cleanup liability for \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers under P.L. 107-118 applies to those who acquired contaminated property after January 11, 2002, and is not retroactive. Owners of contaminated property may also be exempt from cleanup liability if contamination resulted from the migration of hazardous substances from a contiguous property owned by another person, provided the owner had no knowledge of the hazardous substance's presence. The criteria for claiming exemptions as a \"bona fide\" prospective purchaser, \"innocent\" landowner, or contiguous property owner under CERCLA require that the owner had no association with the activities causing contamination and no relationship with those responsible for the contamination. The exemptions under CERCLA for \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers, \"innocent\" landowners, or contiguous property owners require proof of no knowledge or reason to know of contamination at the time of acquisition. To claim an exemption, a person must conduct \"all appropriate inquiries\" into the property's history before acquiring ownership. The EPA regulations require a person to conduct \"all appropriate inquiries\" before acquiring ownership of a property to maintain an exemption from liability under CERCLA. The owner must also take steps to address any hazardous substance releases and limit exposure to previously released substances. The owner must provide notices of hazardous substances on the property and comply with land use restrictions. This helps minimize their responsibility for contamination, even if exempt from cleanup liability under CERCLA. They must manage contamination to maintain exemption status as a \"bona fide\" prospective purchaser. CERCLA requires property owners to take steps to maintain exemption status as an \"innocent\" landowner or contiguous property owner in case of contamination. The burden of proof lies on the owner to demonstrate due diligence before and after acquiring the property. The Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund was established to finance cleanup of contaminated sites where responsible parties are unable to pay. The Superfund Trust Fund was created to finance cleanup of contaminated sites where responsible parties are unable to pay. Financial responsibility for \"orphan shares\" of cleanup costs ensures actions to protect human health and the environment. Superfund monies availability is subject to appropriations by Congress and cost-sharing agreements with states. Special taxing authority to finance the Trust Fund expired in 1995, with revenues from dedicated taxes and the U.S. Treasury contributing to the fund. The Superfund Trust Fund, created to finance cleanup of contaminated sites, received contributions from dedicated taxes and the U.S. Treasury. The Superfund excise taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks were authorized to generate revenue, with the tax on imported chemical derivatives added later. The taxing authority expired in 1995, with varying rates for different substances. The Superfund Trust Fund was created to finance cleanup of contaminated sites through dedicated taxes and contributions from the U.S. Treasury. The Superfund excise taxes on chemical feedstocks and imported derivatives varied in rates, with the tax on xylene being the highest. The special tax on corporate income, established by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, expired in 1995. The debate on reinstating Superfund taxes has been ongoing, with Congress considering various bills but none enacted to date. The debate surrounding Superfund taxes revolves around fairness issues. Supporters argue that these taxes are necessary to ensure polluters pay for cleanup, acting as an \"insurance plan\" for the public. Opponents note that not all businesses subject to the tax may be responsible for contamination, as actual polluters are often pursued under liability provisions. The impact on \"innocent\" businesses is a key concern. The Superfund tax on corporate income aimed to generate revenue from businesses linked to hazardous substances, regardless of actual involvement. Controversy surrounds the taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks, as not all companies may have contributed to environmental contamination. The Superfund tax on petroleum has been controversial due to its exclusion from CERCLA cleanup authorities. Congress established separate trust funds for petroleum cleanup, such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Since the Superfund taxing authority lapsed in 1995, there have been differing views on funding contaminated site cleanups. The Superfund Trust Fund's funding sources have evolved since the expiration of the Superfund taxes, with revenues now mainly coming from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Industry still contributes to the fund through corporate income taxes, even though the Superfund taxes have expired. The General Fund contributes revenues to the Superfund Trust Fund, along with cost recoveries from cleanup costs, fines and penalties from CERCLA violations, and interest on the trust fund balance. These sources of funding are relatively small compared to general Treasury revenues. Private settlement funds have been an additional source of monies for the Superfund Trust Fund, deposited into site-specific Special Accounts within the fund for cleanup purposes. EPA can retain funds from private parties under voluntary settlement agreements to perform site cleanups. The EPA has received nearly $4 billion in private settlement funds for cleanup purposes, deposited into over 1,000 Superfund Special Accounts. These funds are not subject to congressional appropriations and can be reclassified for use at other sites once current work is complete. The remaining balance of a Special Account may also be transferred to the general Superfund Trust Fund for future appropriation by Congress. The federal government can enforce cleanup liability under CERCLA through judicial or administrative orders, cost-recovery actions, and voluntary settlement agreements. These enforcement authorities are delegated by the President to EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard. Citizen suits are also authorized under CERCLA for enforcement. Section 106(a) of CERCLA allows EPA to issue orders for cleanup of hazardous substances to address endangerment to public health or the environment. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to $25,000 per day. Section 107(c)(3) allows for punitive damages up to three times the costs incurred by the United States. Punitive damages under CERCLA can be up to three times the costs incurred by the United States for cleanup actions. The party not performing cleanup may be liable for these damages, which are deposited into the Superfund Trust Fund for financing cleanup of other sites. If a party complies with a cleanup order but proves it is not liable or that the order was unjust, they can be reimbursed from the Trust Fund to prevent unfair enforcement costs. EPA may use Superfund Trust Fund monies upfront for cleanup if responsible parties are not identified. Reimbursement can be included in settlement agreements. Recovery of funds can be pursued through judicial actions. States, tribes, and others can also recover costs from cleanup actions. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) allows for the recovery of costs from potentially responsible parties for cleanup actions, health effects studies, and damages to natural resources. There are time limits for initiating cost-recovery actions, with a general limit of three years after completion of a removal action. If a removal action extends beyond 12 months, costs can be sought within six years after the decision to extend the timing. Costs can be sought within six years after the determination was made to extend the timing beyond 12 months. Cost-recovery actions must be commenced within six years after the initiation of the physical construction of a remedial action. If the remedial action is initiated within three years after the completion of the removal action that preceded it, the costs of that removal action may be recovered as part of the recovery of the costs of the remedial action that followed. EPA has the discretion to enter into an administrative settlement agreement with a potentially responsible party under Section 122 of CERCLA instead of pursuing enforcement actions, which can save on litigation costs. EPA has the discretion to include a covenant in settlement agreements, promising not to sue for further liability, which can incentivize parties to perform cleanup actions or make payments in exchange for liability caps. Settlements also provide protection from contribution claims by other parties at the site, encouraging parties to settle to avoid potential future claims. If a potentially responsible party faces a contribution claim, they can voluntarily enter into a settlement agreement with the EPA under Section 122. Once finalized, the party must adhere to the agreement's terms for cleanup actions or monetary payments. Failure to comply can result in civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day. The EPA considers a party's financial capability when determining their share of cleanup costs and may negotiate a reduction in costs for parties with limited financial means. In negotiations with the EPA under Section 122 of CERCLA, parties can request a reduction in their share of cleanup costs by submitting financial information for consideration. EPA's guidance on ability-to-pay considerations aims to balance liability for cleanup with avoiding undue financial hardship. In 2002, Congress amended CERCLA to establish de minimis settlements based on a party's ability to pay for cleanup costs while maintaining basic business operations. EPA considers financial information to determine ability-to-pay and reduce liability for cleanup. The 2002 amendment to CERCLA allows for de minimis settlements based on a party's financial ability to pay for cleanup costs while still operating their business. To qualify for a reduced settlement, the party must provide EPA with necessary financial information. If granted, the party must waive contribution claims against other responsible parties, unless deemed unjust by EPA. The reduced settlement does not exempt the party from future obligations to provide information and site access for cleanup. EPA must notify other parties after finalizing a reduced settlement. After finalizing a reduced settlement, EPA must notify other potentially responsible parties at the site. EPA may decline a party's request for a reduced settlement if they fail to comply with requests for access or impede cleanup actions. If a party is deemed ineligible, EPA must provide written reasons, and the decision is not subject to judicial review. The EPA has final authority to determine a party's ability to pay cleanup costs based on financial information submitted during settlement negotiations. The agency can reduce a party's share of costs to prevent bankruptcy, using various enforcement mechanisms under CERCLA. EPA typically seeks voluntary settlement agreements with parties involved in cleanup efforts. EPA pursues cleanup goals through negotiated settlements or enforcement actions under CERCLA, including Section 106 orders and Section 107 cost-recovery actions. The agency can hold all liable parties responsible for cleanup costs through joint and several liability, even if not all parties are pursued. EPA targets parties with greater contribution to contamination and greater ability to pay for cleanup. Section 113(f)(1) of CERCLA allows parties enforced against to recover costs from other responsible parties not pursued by EPA. Section 113(f)(3)(B) permits parties who settled with EPA to seek contribution from non-participants. Section 113(f)(2) protects parties with settlements from contribution claims. Citizens can challenge cleanup adequacy in court under Section 310 of CERCLA. EPA targets parties with greater contribution to contamination and ability to pay for cleanup. Section 310 of CERCLA allows citizens to challenge the adequacy of a cleanup action in court, but a citizen suit cannot be brought until the selected cleanup action is completed. This limitation is to ensure that cleanup actions are fully implemented before being subjected to judicial review. Once cleanup actions are finished, citizens can initiate a civil action against violators. Section 310 of CERCLA allows citizens to challenge cleanup actions in court, with suits to be brought in the district where the violation occurred. The court can require corrective actions and impose penalties. Prior notification to the President, state, and violator is required before commencing a civil action. Citizen suits are prohibited if the President is already enforcing against the responsible party. Citizens can also sue federal officers for alleged failures to perform duties. Section 310 of CERCLA allows citizens to challenge cleanup actions in court, with suits to be brought in the district where the violation occurred. The court can require corrective actions and impose penalties. Prior notification to the President, state, and violator is required before commencing a civil action. Citizen suits are not available for alleged failure of the President or an officer of the United States to perform a non-discretionary act or duty under Section 311 of CERCLA. After CERCLA was enacted in 1980, questions arose regarding the application of cleanup authorities and liability provisions to federal facilities. Section 101(21) of CERCLA initially included the federal government in the definition of \"person,\" subjecting federal facilities to the statute's regulations. The program established under CERCLA aims to enhance understanding of health risks from hazardous substances, develop detection methods, and reduce environmental contamination through grants and agreements funded by Congress. Section 120 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 clarified that federal departments and agencies are subject to CERCLA requirements, including liability and enforcement provisions. Federal agencies must use their own budget for cleanup of contamination at federal facilities, as Superfund Trust Fund monies cannot be used for this purpose. The Superfund Trust Fund cannot be used to clean up federal facilities, except for providing alternative water supplies in specific cases. Congress appropriates funds to federal agencies for cleanup, fulfilling the liability of the United States as facility owner or operator. The Superfund Trust Fund cannot be used to clean up federal facilities, except for providing alternative water supplies in specific cases. The funds are authorized to pay for the cleanup of federal government facilities by federal agencies, but not for cleanup cost-recovery or contribution claims from other parties. The Judgment Fund of the U.S. Treasury is the source of payments for cleanup claims submitted to the United States under CERCLA. The Superfund Trust Fund is used to pay monetary claims against the United States for cleanup of federal facilities. EPA and states oversee CERCLA implementation at federal facilities, with EPA leading cleanup at NPL-listed sites. States have a role in cleanup decisions for non-NPL sites. CERCLA authorizes EPA and states to oversee cleanup, but certain provisions limit their control over the process. EPA has decision-making authority for selecting remedial actions at NPL-listed federal facilities. The EPA has decision-making authority for selecting remedial actions at federal facilities listed on the NPL, but lacks the power to direct the schedule of those actions or how they are maintained long-term. Enforcement of cleanup requirements at federal facilities is complicated by limited ability to sue another federal agency. States have a role in cleanup decisions but no decision-making authority. These limitations may restrict oversight of cleanup at federal facilities, despite requirements for compliance with CERCLA. Within 6 months of a federal facility being listed on the NPL, CERCLA requires the federal agency to consult with EPA and state authorities to start an RI/FS. This involves investigating contamination and studying remedial alternatives. EPA and states are consulted but do not have decision-making authority. After the RI/FS is completed and reviewed by EPA, the federal agency must enter into agreements within 180 days. The federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over a facility must enter into an interagency agreement with EPA to govern the remedial actions. This agreement formalizes how the cleanup will be carried out to meet CERCLA requirements, including listing remedial alternatives, selecting actions, setting a schedule, and arranging for long-term maintenance. If agreement cannot be reached on remedial actions, negotiations may be necessary. Section 120(e)(4)(A) of CERCLA allows the EPA Administrator to resolve disputes over remedial actions in interagency agreements by selecting the most appropriate actions to protect human health and the environment. The Administrator can delegate this authority but cannot transfer it to other agencies or individuals. This ensures that EPA maintains its role in decision-making for remedial actions at federal facilities listed on the NPL. The EPA Administrator can resolve disputes over remedial actions at federal facilities listed on the NPL. If consensus cannot be reached within 180 days, the federal agency must report the delay to Congress. The timing of cleanup must be done as expeditiously as practicable once actions are selected, with no specific deadline mentioned. The timing of remedial actions at federal facilities depends on technical feasibility and funding availability. Federal agencies must notify Congress of funding needed for remedial actions in their annual budget requests. Individual remedial actions can proceed without a final interagency agreement, especially removal actions addressing immediate risks. Some cleanup actions may proceed without an interagency agreement in place, allowing EPA to address contaminated sites. States and local governments can participate in the cleanup of federal facilities listed on the NPL without an interagency agreement. Section 120(f) of CERCLA allows them to be involved in planning and selecting remedial actions, including reviewing data and developing studies and reports. This participation is to be provided in accordance with Section 121(f), which requires states to have \"substantial and meaningful involvement\" in cleanup decisions at federal facilities. States and local governments can participate in the cleanup of federal facilities listed on the NPL without an interagency agreement. Section 121(d) allows state standards to be applied to remedial actions, with Section 121(f)(3) requiring states to show \"substantial evidence\" to challenge a remedial decision at a federal facility. Unlike Section 120(f), Section 121(f) participation requirements do not extend to local governments. States have a prominent role in overseeing cleanup at federal facilities not on the NPL, as clarified by Section 120(a)(4) of CERCLA. The state cleanup standards for federal facilities not on the NPL must be equivalent to those for non-federal sites in the same state. While formal agreements with states are not required under CERCLA, states have authority to enforce cleanup requirements at federal facilities, especially those handling hazardous waste. Federal facilities that store, treat, or dispose of hazardous waste must comply with permits issued by states under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. These permits may include corrective action requirements to clean up contamination. Section 120(i) of CERCLA ensures federal agencies must adhere to these requirements. State corrective actions under the Solid Waste Disposal Act are similar to CERCLA actions, resulting in comparable cleanup stringency. Solid Waste Disposal Act permits for federal facilities not on the NPL function similarly to CERCLA interagency agreements. Solid Waste Disposal Act permits for federal facilities not on the NPL can formalize and enforce cleanup requirements without needing an interagency agreement with EPA. Section 120(h) of CERCLA mandates the United States to clean up contaminated federal property before transferring ownership, ensuring responsibility for cleanup remains with the government. The agency with administrative jurisdiction over surplus federal property is responsible for cleanup to fulfill the financial liability of the United States. Funds for cleanup are subject to Congressional appropriations and not eligible for Superfund monies. Reuse of surplus federal property is negotiated between the administering agency and the recipient. Disagreements over property reuse can arise if the recipient's cleanup plans are too costly for the federal agency. Cleanup technologies and funding constraints may limit property reuse. The United States remains liable for contamination not adequately remediated after property transfer. The deed transferring federal property out of federal ownership must include a covenant warranting that all necessary remedial actions have been taken to protect human health and the environment. The United States retains the responsibility to conduct any additional remedial actions after the transfer. The deed may also grant the United States access to the property for cleanup actions. Limitations on the continuing responsibility of the United States may be specified in the deed, with cleanup typically warranted only to a level suitable for the negotiated land use. Some deeds may include restrictions on certain unsuitable uses based on the level of cleanup performed. The United States assumes responsibility for additional cleanup only if more work is needed to make the property suitable for the agreed-upon use. New owners may need to cover additional cleanup costs for different purposes, and some deeds may prohibit certain land uses due to limitations in cleanup technologies. Surplus federal properties may contain unexploded ordnance, which can be challenging to detect and remove, especially when concealed beneath the surface or dense vegetation. The Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act (CERFA; P.L. 102-426) allows for the transfer of uncontaminated parcels on surplus federal properties while cleanup continues on contaminated parcels. This approach aims to prevent delays in transferring clean lands for reuse, particularly on closed military installations for economic redevelopment. The Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act allows for the transfer of contaminated parcels on surplus federal properties before cleanup is complete, to prevent delays in transferring clean lands for economic redevelopment. The Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act allows for the transfer of contaminated parcels on surplus federal properties before cleanup is complete, under certain conditions. This authority applies to any surplus federal property administered by any federal agency, not just surplus U.S. military property. The transfer of title to a contaminated parcel can be deferred before cleanup is complete, with assurances that cleanup will still be carried out after the property leaves federal ownership. The cleanup performance must identify funding in annual budget requests and restrict property use for human health and environmental protection. Property transfer may limit certain uses until cleanup is sufficient. After cleanup, a covenant is provided to ensure property suitability. Early transfer of contaminated federal property listed on the NPL requires EPA Administrator's approval. The early transfer of contaminated federal property, whether listed on the NPL or not, requires the concurrence of the governor of the state where the facility is located. Federal agencies proposing early transfers must give the public 30 days' notice and a chance to comment. U.S. military facilities are a significant part of contaminated federal facilities, leading to the establishment of the Defense Environmental Restoration Program by the Secretary of Defense. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program was established by the Secretary of Defense to clean up U.S. military facilities in accordance with CERCLA. Section 211 authorizes funding and requires consultation with the EPA for the cleanup of military facilities under the program. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program includes active and decommissioned military facilities for cleanup, addressing environmental damage that endangers public health and safety. It does not cover cleanup cost-recovery claims submitted by other parties. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program focuses on cleaning up hazardous substances at military facilities. The program was expanded by the 107th Congress to include the cleanup of unexploded ordnance and discarded military munitions on decommissioned training ranges. The Military Munitions Response Program addresses the impact of substances leached from munitions on decommissioned military training ranges and disposal sites in the US. It does not cover operational ranges due to concerns about disrupting training activities and military readiness. The Military Munitions Rule exempts munitions on operational ranges from hazardous waste disposal regulations until they are removed. Removal is only done as needed for safe access, so munitions can remain on ranges indefinitely. Removal may be necessary if contamination migrates off-range and poses a risk. The Military Munitions Rule allows munitions to remain on operational ranges indefinitely, with removal only necessary if contamination migrates off-range and poses a risk. Cleanup of munitions is typically not required until the range is closed and becomes eligible for cleanup under the Military Munitions Response Program. Section 120 of CERCLA allows for exemptions on a case-by-case basis for federal facilities to protect national security. Section 120(j) of CERCLA allows the President to exempt individual facilities under the Department of Defense or Energy from cleanup requirements to protect national security. The exemption must be renewed annually with notification to Congress. No national security exemptions have been invoked to date, with contaminated facilities subject to CERCLA cleanup requirements. EPA established a Superfund program element in 1993 to assist communities with cleanup efforts. In 1993, EPA created a program within the Superfund to help communities clean up brownfield sites that were not on the NPL but needed redevelopment. The program provided financial assistance for properties with contamination that hindered redevelopment. EPA used Superfund money for grants and loans to support cleanup efforts, sparking debate over its authority under CERCLA. In 2002, the Brownfields Act amended CERCLA to establish a separate Brownfields program, authorizing EPA to administer it with its own appropriations apart from the Superfund account. This addressed concerns about diverting Superfund funds from addressing higher-priority health and environmental risks. The Brownfields Act amended CERCLA in 2002 to create a separate program for brownfields cleanup, addressing concerns about diverting Superfund funds. This program allowed federal financial assistance for petroleum contamination cleanup, with two types of grants for property assessment and cleanup. The Brownfields Act of 2002 amended CERCLA to provide financial assistance for brownfields cleanup. Section 201 authorized $200 million annually for grants to assess and clean up individual properties. Eligible entities include state and local governments, Indian Tribes, and redevelopment agencies. Grants are awarded competitively for property characterization, assessment, remediation, or to capitalize revolving loan funds for cleanup. The Brownfields Act of 2002 amended CERCLA to provide financial assistance for brownfields cleanup. Section 231 added Section 128 to CERCLA, authorizing $50 million annually for grants to assist states and Indian Tribes in establishing or enhancing their own cleanup programs. States and Tribes can use these funds to clean up brownfields properties or other contaminated sites within their jurisdictions. The authorization of appropriations for these grants expired in FY2006, but Congress has continued to fund them through annual appropriations. Section 222 of the Brownfields Act exempts \"bona fide\" prospective purchasers of contaminated properties from liability under CERCLA, if they meet certain criteria. This exemption works alongside federal grants from the Brownfields program to promote economic redevelopment of contaminated properties. Bona fide prospective purchasers are eligible for brownfields grants under CERCLA. If a party does not qualify for this exemption or any other liability exemption, they are not eligible for a brownfields grant. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed taxpayers to fully deduct the costs of cleaning up brownfields properties in the year the costs were incurred, providing financial assistance for contaminated site cleanup. This type of deduction is known as \"expensing\" and is different from \"capitalizing\" costs over a period of years. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the brownfields tax incentive to encourage property developers to rehabilitate contaminated sites. Another federal brownfields tax incentive was authorized in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which expired in 2009. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the brownfields tax incentive to encourage property developers to rehabilitate contaminated sites. This provision allowed tax-exempt entities to invest in qualified brownfields sites without treating the gains as taxable unrelated business income. To be eligible, the entity must have cleanup costs exceeding $550,000 or 12% of the property's fair market value in a remediated condition, among other requirements. The incentive was not available to parties potentially liable for cleanup under CERCLA Section 107."
