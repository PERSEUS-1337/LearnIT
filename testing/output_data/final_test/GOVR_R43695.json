    "content": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established by Congress in 1982 to expand the role of small businesses in federal research and development (R&D). Congress found that small businesses are cost-effective performers of R&D and capable of bringing innovations to market. The SBIR program aims to stimulate innovation, meet federal R&D needs, and encourage participation of minority and disadvantaged persons in technology. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program was established in 1992 to facilitate the commercialization of university and federal R&D by small companies. Both the SBIR and STTR programs have been reauthorized multiple times, most recently by the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011. Federal agencies with extramural R&D budgets are required to set aside a percentage of funds for their own SBIR and STTR programs. The Small Business Administration coordinates SBIR and STTR programs across 11 federal departments and 5 agencies. Over 133,000 awards totaling $33.7 billion have been made to small businesses for innovative technologies. The report details legislative foundations, funding levels, recent changes, external reviews, and policy discussions of the programs. The Small Business Administration coordinates SBIR and STTR programs across multiple federal departments and agencies. The report discusses legislative foundations, funding levels, recent changes, external reviews, and policy issues. Data on awards is available up to FY2013, with some inconsistencies in the FY2011 data set. The Small Business Innovation Research program, established in 1982 and reauthorized multiple times, requires federal agencies with R&D budgets over $100 million to allocate funds for small business R&D grants. Objectives include stimulating innovation, supporting disadvantaged individuals, and promoting commercialization of innovations. The Small Business Innovation Research program, established in 1982, requires federal agencies with R&D budgets over $100 million to allocate funds for small business R&D grants. Currently, 11 federal agencies participate in the SBIR program, with a minimum percentage of extramural R&D funds set aside increasing annually. In FY2011, the aggregate level of SBIR funding for all federal agencies was $2.119 billion. The Small Business Innovation Research program requires federal agencies with R&D budgets over $100 million to allocate funds for small business R&D grants. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office found that some agencies did not comply with the spending requirements. Each agency operates its own SBIR program under specific provisions and regulations, allowing for consistency and flexibility in alignment with their mission and priorities. The SBIR program is a three-phase program where Phase I involves soliciting contract proposals or grant applications for feasibility-related research related to agency requirements. Phase I grants are intended to determine the commercial potential of ideas and typically do not exceed $150,000. Agencies have the authority to issue awards that exceed this amount by up to 50%. Phase II grants are meant to further R&D efforts from Phase I that have commercial potential. Only Phase I grant recipients are typically eligible for Phase II grants, with exceptions for STTR Phase I awardees and certain agencies making Phase II grants to small businesses without Phase I awards. Phase II grants are awarded to small businesses that demonstrate scientific and technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential. These grants are based on the results achieved in Phase I, commercialization success, funding commitments, and indicators of commercial potential. The SBIR Program Policy Directive generally limits Phase II awards to $1 million. The SBIR Phase II awards are generally limited to $1 million, with the possibility of exceeding this amount by up to 50%. The performance period for Phase II awards is typically two years, but can be extended for specific projects. Sequential Phase II awards can be granted, subject to the $1 million guideline. Agencies have the discretion to award up to $3 million for a single project. Phase III of the SBIR program focuses on commercializing results from Phase I and II funding, with funding expected to come from the private sector. Some agencies may use non-SBIR funds for Phase III to support additional R&D or contracts for federal government use. The 2011 reauthorization act encourages commercialization through Phase III awards and allows for sole source awards. The 2011 reauthorization act allows agencies to award SBIR Phase I and Phase II recipients up to $5,000 per year for technical assistance. This funding is intended to provide access to a network of scientists and engineers for better technical decisions and commercialization of products. Eligibility for the SBIR program is based on location, number of employees, ownership characteristics, and other factors. Eligibility for the SBIR program is limited to for-profit U.S. businesses with 500 or fewer employees, owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or permanent residents, venture capital firms, or joint ventures meeting specific criteria. Agencies have restrictions on their SBIR funds allocation. Small businesses receiving SBIR funds must meet ownership criteria and progress benchmarks for commercialization. Agencies have limits on funds allocated to businesses owned by venture capital firms. Principal investigators must be employed by the small business during the project. Work under the STTR program must generally be performed in the United States. In FY2011, agencies awarded $2.222 billion in SBIR grants, with a 15% success rate for Phase I proposers and 49% for Phase II proposers. Most funding went to Phase II awards, with DOD and HHS accounting for over three-fourths of total funding. Funding for both Phase I and Phase II has generally increased between FY2000 and FY2011. In FY2011, NASA, DOE, and NSF accounted for 20% of SBIR funding, with the remaining agencies receiving less than 4%. Allocation of funding between Phase I and Phase II awards varied among agencies, with EPA, NSF, and DOC allocating the most to Phase I awards, and DOT, DOD, and DOE allocating the most to Phase II awards. DOD had the highest share of total Phase I and Phase II funding, followed by HHS and NASA. Minority or disadvantaged businesses received 238 Phase I awards in FY2011. In FY2011, minority or disadvantaged businesses received 238 Phase I awards totaling $31.3 million and 107 Phase II awards totaling $90.8 million. Companies in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones) received 87 Phase I awards totaling $11.5 million and 45 Phase II awards totaling $29.8 million. SBIR funding was concentrated among certain states, with California and Massachusetts receiving the largest number and amount of awards during FY2006-2010. During FY2006-2010, California, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Maryland received the highest number of SBIR awards and funding, accounting for 38% of awards and 43% of funding. These four states also received the largest overall amounts of federal R&D funding in FY2010, totaling 44%. The top ten states received over two-thirds of SBIR awards and funding, with nine of them also being among the top 10 states in overall federal R&D funding. In contrast, the ten states with the least federal R&D funding in FY2010 accounted for only about 1% of awards and funding. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, created in 1992, aims to commercialize university and federal R&D by small companies. It was reauthorized in 2011 through the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act. Each federal agency with R&D budgets of $1 billion or more participates in the program. The STTR program requires federal agencies with large R&D budgets to allocate funding for small businesses to conduct cooperative research with eligible institutions. Five agencies participate in the program: DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and NSF. The minimum percentage of funds set aside for the program is increasing annually. In FY2011, total STTR award funding was $238.1 million, accounting for 0.31% of agencies' R&D funding. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program accounts for 0.31% of agencies' R&D funding. Key differences from the SBIR program include intellectual property agreements, R&D percentage requirements, and no requirement for the principal investigator to be employed by the small business. Each agency operates its own STTR program under specific regulations and policies set by the SBA. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, like the SBIR program, has three phases for conducting feasibility-related research aligned with agency requirements. Each agency has control and flexibility in executing its program to meet its mission and priorities. Phase I grants under the STTR program assess the feasibility and quality of small business proposals with a limited agency investment, typically up to $150,000. Agencies have the flexibility to exceed this amount by up to 50% or request a waiver for specific topics. The performance period for Phase I awards is generally one year, but it can be extended for certain projects. Phase II grants aim to further research and development efforts from Phase I that align with program needs and show commercial potential. Phase II grants in the STTR program are awarded based on the results of Phase I projects and the commercial potential of the proposed project. The maximum award amount is typically $1 million, with the possibility of exceeding this by up to 50% for a total of $1.5 million. The performance period for Phase II awards is generally two years, but can be extended for specific projects. Agencies may also request a waiver to exceed the award amount by more than 50% for a particular topic. Phase II awards in the STTR program can be extended with a sequential Phase II award, subject to a $1 million guideline that can be exceeded by up to 50%. Agencies may award up to $3 million for a project, with potential waivers from the SBA. Some agencies require third-party matching for sequential Phase II awards. Phase III focuses on commercialization without funding, relying on the private sector, though non-STTR funds may be used for additional R&D or contracts. The 2011 reauthorization act allows agencies to award STTR Phase I and Phase II recipients up to $5,000 per year for technical assistance. This funding is intended to provide access to a network of scientists and engineers for better technical decisions and problem-solving. The STTR program provides technical assistance to small businesses to make better decisions, solve problems, minimize risks, and develop new products. Eligibility is based on location, number of employees, ownership, and other factors. Participating companies must be for-profit U.S. businesses with 500 or fewer employees, majority owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The STTR program awards technical assistance to small businesses with 500 or fewer employees, majority owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Unlike the SBIR program, STTR does not award to businesses more than 50% owned by venture capital firms, hedge funds, or private equity. However, STTR may award to majority-venture capital backed companies if the VC firm is majority owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Small businesses receiving multiple SBIR/STTR awards must meet commercialization benchmarks for new Phase I eligibility. Principal investigators must be employed by the small business or partnering research institution during the project. R/R&D work under STTR must be mostly done in the U.S., with exceptions for rare circumstances. The partnering research institution must be a U.S.-based nonprofit college, university, research organization, or FFRDC. At least 40% of R/R&D work must be done by the small business in both Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I and Phase II of STTR, 40% of R/R&D work must be done by the small business and 30% by the research institution. Agencies can choose to determine these percentages using contract dollars or labor hours. In FY2011, agencies awarded $251.2 million in STTR grants, with a 22% success rate for Phase I proposers and a 44% success rate for Phase II proposers. The STTR set-aside doubled from 0.15% to 0.30% in FY2004, leading to increased funding for Phase I and Phase II projects. In FY2004 to FY2011, Phase I STTR funding decreased by 25% while Phase II funding increased by 74%, indicating a shift towards commercialization. DOD and HHS accounted for 79% of STTR funding in FY2011. HHS allocated 29% of its funding to Phase I awards, while NSF allocated 95% to Phase II awards. In FY2011, DOD and HHS received the highest share of Phase I and Phase II STTR funding. Minority or disadvantaged businesses received a small percentage of awards and funding. STTR funding was concentrated in certain states. In FY2011, STTR funding was concentrated in certain states, with California, Massachusetts, and Virginia receiving the largest number and amount of awards. The top ten states accounted for over 60% of the awards and funding, while the bottom ten states received only about 1% of the total funding. Tables 3 and 4 provide detailed information on agency STTR obligations and historical award data. The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 authorized the programs through September 30, 2017, with changes allowing small companies majority-owned by venture capital firms to receive grants. NIH, DOE, and NSF can award up to 25% of SBIR funds to such businesses through competitive procedures. The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 allows small companies majority-owned by venture capital firms to receive grants. Other federal agencies are limited to awarding no more than 15% of SBIR funds to such firms. The act also increases the percentages of R&D funding agencies must set aside for the programs and raises award guidelines for Phase I and Phase II SBIR/STTR awards. Agencies cannot exceed these guidelines by more than 50% without a waiver from the SBA. The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 allows small companies majority-owned by venture capital firms to receive grants. Agencies can make sequential Phase II awards with a $1 million guideline/$1.5 million limit. The SBA Administrator may grant waivers for agencies to exceed limits if necessary for research missions. GAO audits agency R&D budgets for consistency in reporting. The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 provides small businesses with more flexibility in applying for Phase II awards from different agencies. Recipients of Phase I awards can now apply for Phase II awards from other agencies. Small businesses can also switch between the SBIR and STTR programs for Phase I and Phase II awards. Agency heads must verify that activities funded by Phase I or Phase II awards have not been previously funded under the SBIR program or STTR. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act allows small businesses to apply for Phase II awards from different agencies and switch between SBIR and STTR programs. It establishes a pilot program for Phase II grants and requires agencies to measure success in technology commercialization. Compliance with performance standards is necessary for advancing from Phase I to Phase II awards. Non-compliance results in disqualification from competition. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act requires agencies to establish systems to measure success in securing Phase III awards, set minimum performance standards, evaluate compliance, and bar non-compliant firms from competing for additional Phase I or II awards for one year. Agencies must report tracking systems and standards to the SBA Administrator for approval. The act also allows agencies to create commercialization readiness pilot programs using up to 10% of funds for awards three times the amount of Phase II awards. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act allows agencies to establish a commercialization readiness pilot program using up to 10% of funds for awards three times the amount of Phase II awards. Agencies must make a written application to the SBA Administrator for approval, detailing the need for additional investment in SBIR or STTR technologies. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act encourages agencies to award grants to small businesses collaborating with federal laboratories or involved in CRADAs. It also allows agencies to provide technical assistance services to awardees, aiming to help them make better technical decisions, solve problems, minimize risks, and develop new products and processes. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act allows agencies to award grants to small businesses collaborating with federal laboratories or involved in CRADAs. It also authorizes agencies to provide technical assistance services to awardees, up to $5,000 per year, to support the development and commercialization of new products and processes. Additionally, the act establishes a \"Phase 0 Proof of Concept Partnership Pilot Program\" at NIH to accelerate the commercialization of research innovations from universities or research institutions participating in the NIH STTR program, with awards of up to $1 million per year for up to three years. These funds can be used for technical validations, market research, intellectual property rights, and exploring commercial opportunities. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act includes provisions for special acquisition preferences for SBIR and STTR award recipients, reporting requirements for agencies making awards over $50 million, protection of small businesses' data rights for at least four years, and directives for the SBA to incorporate agency reports into its annual report to Congress. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act includes provisions for special acquisition preferences, reporting requirements for large awards, and protection of small businesses' data rights for at least four years. The act directs GAO to assess federal agencies' compliance with data rights protections for SBIR awardees and their technologies, the sufficiency of laws and policy directives, and the effectiveness of grievance tracking processes. GAO issued a letter in November 2013 awaiting SBA's policy directive revision for further assessment. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act includes provisions to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the programs. SBA updated its policy directive in February 2014, but GAO has not yet reported on the matter. Congress remains concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act requires each agency inspector general to report fraud, waste, and abuse, directs inspectors general to establish fraud detection indicators, and mandates the GAO to publish reports periodically. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act mandates the establishment of an Interagency SBIR/STTR Policy Committee to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. The committee is tasked with developing policy recommendations on various aspects of the SBIR and STTR programs, including award databases, award sizes, technology commercialization, funding gaps, program assessment, and outreach activities. The committee is required to report to selected committees of Congress after one year and 18 months. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act mandates the establishment of an Interagency SBIR/STTR Policy Committee to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. The committee is required to report to selected committees of Congress every two years. A pilot program allows agencies to use up to 3% of SBIR program funds for administrative activities, oversight, and contract processing. Authorized uses of these funds include supporting program administration, outreach, technical assistance, increasing participation of women-owned and disadvantaged small businesses, and supporting commercialization initiatives. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act mandated the establishment of an Interagency SBIR/STTR Policy Committee to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. The act required the SBA to publish revised policy directives within 180 days of passage, which were updated in February 2014. Final rules for venture capital participation were published in December 2012. Congress supported activities for congressional oversight, prevention of waste, fraud, and abuse, and additional personnel for application reviews. The 2011 SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act mandated the establishment of an Interagency SBIR/STTR Policy Committee to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. Congress seeks to address challenges to the programs' effectiveness, including the debate over ownership requirements for small firms participating in the SBIR program. Experts argue for allowing participation by firms majority-owned by venture capital companies, while opponents maintain that the program is designed to assist where venture capital is not available. The program aims to provide financial assistance where venture capital is lacking, with the objective of enabling new concepts for private sector investment. Compliance issues have been noted with agencies not meeting spending requirements for the SBIR and STTR programs. The GAO reported compliance issues with agencies not meeting spending requirements for the SBIR and STTR programs in FY2012. Program managers misinterpreted the law, believing agencies only needed to spend the total amount reserved or budgeted, regardless of the year. Challenges in calculating set-aside amounts, late appropriations, and differing agency interpretations contributed to non-compliance. The SBIR and STTR set-asides are based on an agency's extramural budget for research or research and development. Agencies must determine their budgets using a methodology that identifies funding and excludes certain items. Congress requires agencies to report their methodology to SBA annually within four months of appropriation enactment. The GAO found that some agencies did not properly itemize and explain exclusions in their SBIR funding calculations, leading to delays in feedback from the SBA. Agencies are urged to submit their methodology reports within four months of appropriation enactment. Additionally, agencies often base their SBIR set-asides on their extramural R&D budgets rather than obligations as required by law. Extramural R/R&D obligations may vary from anticipated levels due to final obligation figures not being calculable until the end of a fiscal year. Enactment of appropriations after the fiscal year starts can also impact agencies' ability to expend SBIR/STTR funds. Delays in calculating the amount to be set aside for SBIR/STTR can occur due to agencies needing time to determine the final funding levels. The time required for agencies to determine extramural research funding can impact the allocation of funds for SBIR/STTR. Agencies may face delays in calculating the set-aside amount, affecting their ability to expend funds. Program managers have noted challenges in meeting statutorily required expenditures due to planning and award decisions made before the enactment of the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that agencies believed they were in compliance by spending the total amount reserved for the program, regardless of the year the funding is spent. However, GAO stated that agencies must \"expend\" the funds in the year they are set aside. SBA was recommended to revise its policy directives to reflect the statutory language accurately. Congress may consider changes to clarify how agencies determine the amount to be set aside each year for SBIR and STTR programs. The goal of these programs is to promote the development and commercialization of new technologies. The 2011 reauthorization act includes provisions focused on improving commercialization in the SBIR program, such as assisting awardees with technical barriers and establishing commercialization readiness pilot programs. Some analysts caution against placing too much emphasis on commercialization as it is just one of the program's goals. The SBIR/STTR program has four main goals, with a caution against focusing too much on commercialization outcomes. Analysts recommend flexibility for agencies with diverse missions, including data collection issues highlighted by GAO reports. The SBA's Tech-Net system, operational since October 2008, has limited new information and inaccurate historical data. Agencies faced challenges in searching for duplicative awards and fraud indicators due to incomplete data and limited search capabilities. The government-use component for capturing commercialization information was not developed. GAO reports in November 2010 highlighted agencies' shortcomings in assessing commercialization success of SBIR awardees. The GAO reports in November 2010 and August 2011 found that agencies lacked complete and consistent data to assess the commercialization success of SBIR awardees. The accuracy of commercialization data collected from award recipients was largely unknown, except for DOD. Comparable data across agencies were not available to evaluate progress in increasing commercialization of SBIR technologies. In December 2013, GAO stated it was unable to assess the extent of technology transition associated with military department SBIR programs. The GAO found challenges in assessing technology transition in military department SBIR programs due to the lack of comprehensive data collection. DOD has not set a timeline for complying with reporting requirements. Recommendations include establishing a common definition for technology transition, developing a plan for improved reporting, and reporting to Congress on the plan. The GAO found challenges in assessing technology transition in military department SBIR programs due to the lack of comprehensive data collection. DOD has not set a timeline for complying with reporting requirements. GAO noted the unknown extent of transition due to gaps in data collection systems, hindering tracking capabilities. Critics of the SBIR/STTR programs express concerns about the lack of detailed information on transition successes. Critics of the SBIR/STTR programs are concerned about firms that continuously receive SBIR grants but show little success in commercializing their work. These firms, referred to as \"SBIR shops,\" are accused of focusing solely on obtaining grants rather than transitioning their projects. Lux Research, Inc. claims that these firms rely on professional grant writers to secure funding from multiple agencies. However, some analysts argue that many multiple award winners do succeed in commercialization by attracting additional investment. Congress responded to concerns about firms continuously receiving SBIR grants without commercializing their work by establishing minimum performance standards in the 2011 reauthorization act. Firms failing to meet these standards may be denied participation in SBIR and STTR programs for one year. Congress has also focused on identifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs, holding hearings, enacting legislation, and directing GAO to monitor agency progress in combatting these issues. In response to concerns about firms receiving SBIR grants without commercializing their work, Congress established minimum performance standards in the 2011 reauthorization act. The issue of waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs has been addressed through hearings, legislation, and monitoring by the GAO. Duplication of research proposals has been a particular concern, with instances of contractors receiving duplicate funding attributed to false certifications and lack of data sharing. The witness highlighted various forms of research fraud involving SBIR funds, including invoicing the government for the same equipment under different grants and subcontracting work without disclosure. NASA's inspector general mentioned investigations into duplicate proposals and deliverables under the SBIR program. The witness testified about various forms of research fraud involving SBIR funds, such as duplicate deliverables, non-compliance with subcontracting limitations, and misrepresentation of eligibility. NASA had taken corrective measures, but similar violations have persisted since 1992. The 2011 reauthorization act directs the SBA to amend its policy directives to address waste, fraud, and abuse. The directives now identify actions constituting waste, fraud, or abuse in SBIR awards, including misrepresentations to obtain funding, misuse of funds, fabrication in reporting results, failure to comply with federal cost principles, extravagant spending, self-dealing, and bribery for grant awards. The 2011 authorization act required GAO to publish reports on agency efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. In November 2012, GAO published a report on Small Business Research Programs, finding that the SBA had revised its policy directives to include new requirements. The SBA revised its SBIR and STTR policy directives in August 2012 to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. GAO found that agencies had tools in place to address the new requirements, but SBA compliance with reporting to Congress has been an ongoing issue. The SBA has not delivered annual reports to Congress for FY2012 and FY2013, potentially hindering Congress's oversight. Delays in data provision and staffing levels at SBA may affect reporting timeliness. Congress may assess the impact of the 2011 reauthorization law on program operation, duplication of awards, and small businesses' data rights. Critics question if SBIR and STTR programs meet their objectives, with some arguing against government support for industrial research and development. The government does not directly support industrial research and development. Debates on issues related to the SBIR and STTR programs will continue until September 30, 2017."
