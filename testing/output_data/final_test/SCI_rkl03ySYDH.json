    "content": "The paper introduces a generative latent variable model called SPACE, which combines spatial-attention and scene-mixture approaches for unsupervised object-oriented scene representation learning. SPACE can provide factorized object representations for foreground objects and decompose background segments effectively, addressing scalability issues in modeling real-world scenes. SPACE is a generative latent variable model that provides factorized object representations for foreground objects and effectively decomposes background segments. It outperforms other models like SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS in experiments on Atari and 3D-Rooms. The structured representation it offers brings advantages in unsupervised learning of visual scenes with multiple objects, occlusion, and complex backgrounds. More details can be found on the project website. Structured representations improve sample efficiency for downstream tasks like deep reinforcement learning and enable visual variable binding for reasoning over relationships in a scene. Recent approaches focus on unsupervised object-oriented scene representation using scene-mixture models and spatial-attention models. Scene-mixture models explain visual scenes with a mixture of component images, providing flexible segmentation maps for objects and backgrounds. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of component-based representations in capturing important physical features like position and scale, as well as the sequential nature of inference in obtaining a complete scene. In contrast, spatial-attention models can explicitly disentangle geometric features like position and scale, grounded in physics semantics, leading to improved sample efficiency. In this paper, a method called Spatially Parallel Attention and Component Extraction (SPACE) is proposed to address the limitations of previous models in capturing complex objects and background segments. SPACE combines spatial attention for foreground objects with component mixtures for morphologically complex objects and background segments, providing an object-wise disentangled representation. SPACE provides a unified model that combines spatial attention for foreground objects with component mixtures for complex background components. It resolves scalability issues by parallelizing foreground object processing and shows significant speed-ups compared to other models. The contributions include introducing a spatially parallel multi-object processing module within a probabilistic latent variable modeling framework. The proposed model, SPACE, combines spatial attention for foreground objects with component mixtures for background components. It decomposes a scene into independent foreground and background latents, showing significant scalability improvements. The model introduces a spatially parallel multi-object processing module within a probabilistic framework. The proposed model, SPACE, combines spatial attention for foreground objects with component mixtures for background components. It decomposes a scene into independent foreground and background latents. The image distributions of foreground objects and background components are combined using a pixel-wise mixture model. The foreground is given precedence in assigning its own mixing weight, while the background is apportioned the remaining weight. The generative model consists of a foreground module and a background module. The model, SPACE, utilizes spatial attention for foreground objects and component mixtures for background components. It divides the input image into cells, computes z where, z depth, and z pres for each cell in the foreground module. The background module segments the scene into components using a pixel-wise mixture model. The reconstructed background and foreground are combined using a pixel-wise mixture model to generate the full scene. The foreground model in SPACE divides the image into cells to model objects, using latents like z pres for object presence, z where for object size and location, z depth for object depth, and z what for object appearance and mask. These latents help compute the foreground image component p(x|z fg). The foreground model in SPACE divides the image into cells to model objects using latents like z pres for object presence, z where for object size and location, z depth for object depth, and z what for object appearance and mask. These latents are used to compute the foreground image component p(x|z fg), modeled as a Gaussian distribution N (\u00b5 fg , \u03c3 2 fg). SPACE imposes a prior distribution on these latents, with z pres i modeled using a Bernoulli distribution and the rest as Gaussian. Training the model involves using a variational approximation due to the continuous latents z fg and z bg 1:K. The true posterior on these variables is approximated to derive the ELBO for training the model using the reparameterization trick and SGD. The SPACE model uses mean-field approximation for inferring cell latents, allowing each cell to act as an independent object detector. This is in contrast to SPAIR, where latents depend on previously traversed cells. The method becomes expensive as the number of objects increases. The claim that lateral connections are crucial for performance is challenged, as each cell should have information about its nearby area due to bottom-up encoding. The SPACE model uses mean-field approximation for inferring cell latents, allowing each cell to act as an independent object detector. In experiments, it shows comparable detection performance to SPAIR with gains in training speeds. Preventing Box-Splitting is crucial to avoid splitting large objects or missing small ones, requiring a balance in bounding box size prior values. Introducing an auxiliary loss helps alleviate this issue. Our proposed model introduces a boundary loss to prevent box-splitting issues in object detection. Inspired by the AIR framework, it uses a recurrent neural network to process objects sequentially with 'what', 'where', and 'presence' variables. The proposed model introduces a boundary loss to address box-splitting issues in object detection. Inspired by the AIR framework, it uses 'what', 'where', and 'presence' variables to process objects sequentially. SPAIR replaces the recurrent network with a convolutional network to handle images with many objects more efficiently. The neural network in our model maps images to a feature volume with a pre-specified grid size. Objects are processed sequentially in each grid cell, with input from nearby cells. Our approach, inspired by SPAIR, allows for parallel processing of foreground objects to scale efficiently. Unlike other methods, we explicitly model the presence, appearance, and location of objects for unsupervised detection. Several recent models like MONet, IODINE, and GENESIS have shown promising results in unsupervised scene-mixture models. These models leverage deterministic recurrent attention networks and variational autoencoders to model scene components. Relationships between components are captured with autoregressive priors, allowing for complete image modeling. The models are evaluated on two datasets, including an Atari dataset. The model is evaluated on two datasets: an Atari dataset with random images from a pretrained agent playing games, and a 3D-room dataset with images of walled enclosures containing objects. The scalability is tested on small (4-8 objects) and large (18-24 objects) 3D-room datasets. Comparisons are made against scene-mixture models (IODINE and GENESIS) and a spatial-attention model (SPAIR), with an additional VAE for processing the background. Our study compares two implementations of SPAIR: one training on the entire image with a 16x16 grid and another training on random 32x32 pixel patches with a 4x4 grid, denoted as SPAIR and SPAIR-P respectively. SPAIR-P addresses slow training by using a different regime demonstrated in previous work. Our improved SPAIR implementation uses parallel processing for rendering objects, making it a stronger baseline. The architecture details are provided in the appendix, and a qualitative analysis of the generated representations is presented. In the study, different models were analyzed with hyperparameter search results presented for the best settings in each environment. Sample scene decompositions from the 3D-Room dataset and results on Atari were shown. SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS were compared, with IODINE able to segment objects and background but occasionally failing to properly decompose objects. More qualitative results of SPACE can be found in the appendix. GENESIS can segment background walls, floor, and sky into components but struggles with capturing foreground objects in the Large 3D-Room and Atari games. IODINE and GENESIS both fail to capture foreground properly in Atari due to smaller, less regular objects. SPAIR detects tight bounding boxes in 3D-Room and most Atari games, while SPAIR-P often fails to detect foreground objects accurately. The patch training method struggles to detect foreground objects accurately due to limited receptive fields, often detecting parts of the background as foreground. In contrast, the SPACE model can accurately detect objects in 3D environments with varying positions, colors, and shapes, while distinguishing background elements effectively. SPACE and SPAIR exhibit interesting behavior when trained on games with dynamic backgrounds. In Space Invaders, both models work well, but in Air Raid, SPACE accurately captures all objects with a two-component segmentation, while SPAIR struggles with splitting and re-detections. In dynamic games, SPAIR fails to model the background effectively, while SPACE can perfectly segment the background and detect foreground objects. Some objects like red shields in Space Invaders and the key in Montezuma's Revenge are detected as foreground in SPACE but considered background in SPAIR. Similar behavior is seen in Atlantis where SPACE detects foreground objects above the water. This unique property of SPACE could be valuable for downstream tasks. By using a spatial broadcast network, SPACE limits the capacity of the background module, favoring modeling static objects as foreground. The addition of boundary loss in the SPACE model helps create correct bounding boxes for objects, unlike SPAIR which sometimes splits objects. Comparison with baselines shows different decomposition capacities, with SPACE excelling in detecting foreground objects in various games. The decomposition capacity of different models like SPACE, SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS is compared based on the number of grid cells and components. Each model decomposes images into the same number of components for fair comparison. The equivalent settings in IODINE and GENESIS for a SPACE grid size with K components would be C = (H \u00d7 W) + K. The equivalent setting in SPAIR would be a grid size of H \u00d7 W. Step Latency is also considered in the analysis. Figure 4 compares the time taken for one gradient step in different models based on decomposition capacities. SPAIR's latency increases with the number of cells due to its sequential latent inference step. Similarly, GENESIS and IODINE's latency grows with the number of components processed sequentially. IODINE has the slowest overall latency due to its iterative inference procedure and data storage requirements for each component. SPACE employs parallel processing for the foreground, making it scalable to large grid sizes and able to detect numerous foreground objects without performance degradation. Comparing gradient step latency, it implies a similar relationship with inference time, a key component in the gradient step. SPACE achieves the lowest MSE and quickest convergence time among all models. SPACE achieves similar quality bounding boxes as SPAIR but with faster inference and gradient step times, quicker convergence, and scalability to a large number of objects without performance degradation. The Average Precision and Object Count Error Rate metrics show that SPACE with boundary loss outperforms its variant without the loss. SPACE is a unified probabilistic model that combines spatial attention for object representation and scene decomposition for background segmentation. It offers faster convergence, scalability to a large number of objects without performance degradation, and intuitive object detection. The model has shown promising results on Atari and 3D-Rooms datasets, with potential future improvements for natural images. Our next plan is to apply SPACE for object-oriented model-based reinforcement learning. Object detection and background segmentation using SPACE on 3D-Room data set with a large number of objects. Deriving the ELBO for the log-likelihood log p(x) and evaluating KL Divergence for the Foreground and Background Latents under the SPACE model. Implementation of the Gumbel-Softmax distribution for modeling the Bernoulli random variable z pres i. The implementation details of the boundary loss involve creating a kernel with negative weights inside the boundary and zero weight outside, penalizing the model when the object is outside the boundary. This loss is used to minimize the mean of the boundary loss map, enforced through back-propagation via RMSProp. The boundary loss is disabled to improve bounding box tightness and average precision. Algorithms for foreground and background inference are presented, with details on background module generation. Gradient clipping is used for optimization with a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for the background module. For Atari games, the learning rate is set to 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for the background module. Images are preprocessed into 128 \u00d7 128 pixels with BGR color channels. Games like Space Invaders, Air Raid, River Raid, and Montezuma's Revenge are included in the results. Additionally, a model is trained on a dataset of 10 games jointly, with specific numbers of training, validation, and testing images for each game. The dataset for Atari games includes games like Asterix, Atlantis, Carnival, Double Dunk, Kangaroo, Montezuma Revenge, Pacman, Pooyan, Qbert, and Space Invaders in a 3D room environment generated using MuJoCo. The images contain randomly sized objects in different colors with varying camera angles. The dataset consists of a training set of 63,000 images, a validation set of 7,000 images, and a test set of 7,000 images for object detection evaluation."
