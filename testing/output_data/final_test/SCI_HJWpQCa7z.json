    "content": "Deep network compression aims to reduce parameters while maintaining performance, while deep network distillation trains a smaller network to match a larger one. However, neither method provides insight into the importance of specific layers. This paper introduces deep net triage, which assesses convolution layers to understand their collective contribution, called \"criticality.\" The study introduces deep net triage to evaluate the importance of different layers in deep learning models. It shows that deep net triage can indicate the relative importance of layers and improve overall accuracy through local structural compression. As deep learning models become deeper, methods like shortcut connection layers are used to prevent overfitting, but there are still redundancies that need to be addressed through deep compression methods. Deep compression methods like BID13, BID2, BID4, and BID9 focus on reducing redundancies in neural networks. Knowledge Distillation, as seen in BID6 and BID14, allows smaller networks to learn from larger models. These methods lead to smaller networks that match the performance of their parent models by reducing parameters, weight quantization, and leveraging soft-max outputs from \"teacher\" networks. Deep net triage independently assesses small blocks of layers for their importance to overall network health, using the parent network as an initialization. This method aims to understand the criticality of specific layers or blocks in deep neural networks. The triage method focuses on compressing and relearning specific blocks of convolution layers in a deep network, such as VGG16, by replacing them with a single layer initialized from the parent network. This approach aims to understand the importance of different layers in the original model. The study investigates the robustness of neural networks when faced with structural alterations and the impact of various learning techniques on different data sets. Five approaches to structural compression for deep net triage are analyzed across four data sets. Fine-tuning the entire network achieves the best performance, matching or exceeding the baseline model's performance. This highlights the importance of retraining a network for superior performance. The study explores the impact of structural alterations on neural networks and the effectiveness of different learning techniques on various datasets. It is found that retraining the entire network is crucial for superior performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation is shown to be effective in transferring learned representations between teacher and student networks, even when layers are altered or compressed. The concept of deep net triage, structural compression, and methods for initializing and training compressed networks are also discussed. The VGG16 network consists of five blocks of convolutional layers separated by max pooling layers. To perform structural compression, one block is selected and the functions learned by the layers within are approximated with a single layer. This process, known as deep net triage, aims to determine the most important structural compressions and experiments. The VGG16 network undergoes structural compression by approximating the functions learned in one block with a single layer. This new layer, f c, is tasked with approximating the final representations learned by the previous layers. Various strategies are explored to promote learning and transfer of knowledge to the compressed network, including different methods of initialization and training. The VGG16 network undergoes structural compression by approximating the functions learned in one block with a single layer. Different strategies are explored for training the compressed model, including retraining with randomly initialized weights, mean-initialized weights, and a Student-Teacher network approach. The goal is to enable the compressed layer to adapt and merge into the already learned model without presuming that the prior block's features are the richest set for later parts of the model. After compressing a block of the trained VGG16 model, the compressed layer is initialized with a zero-mean, Glorot Uniform distribution to allow for new richer features to be learned. The goal is to successfully integrate these features into the overall compressed model by training the entire network. The compressed layer in the VGG16 model is initialized with a zero-mean, Glorot Uniform distribution to learn new features. The structurally compressed layer is then initialized with trained weights from the parent model to approximate the three layers it replaces. Average filters from the parent model are loaded into the compressed layer, and the surrounding weights are frozen before optimizing the compressed layer. The structurally compressed layer in the VGG16 model is trained to mimic the output of the parent network by minimizing the difference between their tensor outputs using a Student-Teacher network approach with L2 Loss evaluation. The compressed VGG16 model is fine-tuned for classification by updating the compressed layer's weights and freezing all others. Deep net triage is applied to compress the VGG16 network at each convolutional block, reducing the number of layers to one. The compressed model is trained with different methods on various datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Stanford Dogs. The study evaluates the validity of structural compression across different datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Stanford Dogs. The best performing compressed models are those with weighted updates across the entire model. Fine-tuning on all weights is necessary for models performing above the baseline accuracy. Layers can be replaced independently with accuracy within roughly 5% of the original. The study found that compressed layer models can relearn representations of the parent network, or even learn richer ones. Training the entire model is necessary to maximize performance, with accuracy within 5% of the baseline. Criticality is consistent across model layers, indicating that parent model accuracy can be surpassed by retraining on the entire model. The study shows that retraining the entire model is crucial for maximizing performance, with criticality consistent across all layers. The number of epochs needed to reach 99% accuracy is directly related to the dataset's complexity. Initializing from a Student-Teacher network speeds up convergence time, indicating valuable knowledge transfer between networks. The study suggests that fine-tuning a compressed network pre-trained via a Student-Teacher network over the entire model can lead to faster convergence and higher accuracy. This novel method, called deep net triage, analyzes deep learning methods by compressing layers one at a time and assessing their ability to learn representations and integrate into the network. Experimentation shows that structurally compressed and fine-tuned models can perform as well as, or better than, uncompressed models. In the study, it is shown that fine-tuning compressed models can outperform uncompressed models in a layer invariant manner. Additionally, applying parent-inspired initialization only at the layer level is not as effective as fine-tuning the entire global model. Student-Teacher models evaluated at intermediate layers from uncompressed parent models can lead to faster convergence, although they may not surpass full model training methods. The research aims to encourage the development and testing of targeted assessments for deep networks to enhance understanding and intuition in the field. Experimentalists must approach the development of networks as optimization and statistical theory progresses."
