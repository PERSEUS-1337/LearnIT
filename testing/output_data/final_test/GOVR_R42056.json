    "content": "Prior to the financial crisis, relaxed mortgage underwriting standards led to borrowers relying on stable financial conditions for loan repayment. When market conditions changed, many loans defaulted, causing significant losses for borrowers and the financial industry. \"Irrational exuberance,\" a term coined by Alan Greenspan, reflects Hyman Minsky's theory that excessive optimism leads to increased credit availability. During the height of a business cycle, lenders become overly optimistic and increase credit availability, leading to excessive debt accumulation. This can result in overinvestment in specific sectors and lack of diversification in financial portfolios. A \"Minsky moment\" occurs when assets fail to generate enough revenue to repay loans, causing a recession. Recessions with high levels of debt can be more severe, leading to an escalation of defaults and debilitated banking systems. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates \"ability to repay\" and risk-retention standards for mortgage originators to ensure borrowers can repay loans regardless of financial conditions. Securitization parties must retain a percentage of credit risk to promote responsible lending practices. The \"ability to repay\" and risk-retention standards aim to promote responsible lending practices by requiring mortgage originators to retain a percentage of credit risk. This measure encourages greater due diligence and reduces risky financial practices that contributed to the financial crisis. It also discourages lenders from relaxing underwriting criteria, ensuring that creditworthy borrowers can obtain loans. The 112th Congress is monitoring the rulemaking stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act regarding mortgage lending reforms. The report examines the implementation of proposed ability to repay and risk-retention standards, addressing risky underwriting practices and potential impacts on access to mortgage credit. Regulatory reforms will require creditors to assess borrowers' ability to repay loans and adhere to stricter underwriting standards when selling loans to securitizers. The Dodd-Frank Act requires lenders to assess borrowers' ability to repay loans and adhere to stricter underwriting standards when selling loans to securitizers. Title XIV of the Act, known as the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, mandates that creditors make a reasonable determination based on verified information that the consumer can repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates stricter underwriting standards for residential mortgage loans, requiring creditors to assess borrowers' ability to repay. The Federal Reserve proposed a rule in April 2011 to ensure lenders make a good faith estimate of a borrower's ability to repay and establish minimum mortgage underwriting standards. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was given authority to finalize regulations on July 21, 2011. The CFPB has re-opened the comment period to seek further comments on the litigation risks that could arise from new requirements. Comments should be narrowly focused and based on mortgage data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac portfolios. The closing date for comments is July 9, 2012. The proposed rule provides four methods for lenders to comply with ability-to-repay standards. Creditors must consider various factors such as monthly payments, debt-to-income ratios, and credit history when assessing mortgage applications. They must use the fully indexed rate for underwriting, even for nontraditional mortgage products. Lenders can also comply by refinancing borrowers into standard mortgage products without negative amortization or balloon payments. The compliance options for streamlined refinances allow borrowers to move into more stable mortgages without income verification if their new payments are lower and they have no delinquencies. The third option reduces regulatory burdens for originators holding \"qualified mortgage\" loans. The Federal Reserve proposed two definitions for QMs to determine legal protection. Alternative 1 operates as a safe harbor for creditors. The second definition of a Qualified Mortgage (QM) loan, Alternative 2, allows borrowers to challenge lender compliance. QM loans under Alternative 1 exclude certain features like negative amortization and have restrictions on points and fees. Borrower income and assets must be verified, and underwriting is based on the maximum interest rate in the first five years. The second definition of a Qualified Mortgage (QM) loan, Alternative 2, requires lenders to consider employment status, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and other debt repayment obligations during underwriting. This option also allows lenders to originate a balloon-payment QM in rural or underserved areas, where the final payment may be considerably larger due to partial or no amortization of the principal balance. Balloon loans can be QMs if they are not higher-priced, have a minimum term of five years, and borrowers are qualified based on the maximum possible payment in the first five years. Title IX Subtitle D of the Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk for non-qualified residential mortgages. The legislation mandates that relevant parties in a securitization transaction have \"skin-in-the-game\" to share potential losses. Regulatory agencies must define qualified residential mortgages based on factors that lower the risk of default. The proposed rule published by six financial regulatory agencies on April 29, 2011, requires securitizers to retain 5% of the credit or default risk of underlying mortgage assets. Exemptions from the risk-retention requirement include loans insured by FHA or GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship. Securitizers may also be exempt if the underlying assets meet the stricter QRM standards. The Qualified Residential Mortgages (QRMs) are exempt from risk-retention requirements and have higher qualification standards for borrowers. QRMs are closed-end first-lien mortgages for one-to-four unit family properties, with the borrower's principal residence in at least one unit. Homebuyers must put down at least 20% of the purchase price, 25% for standard refinancings, and 30% for cash-out refinancings. QRMs exclude certain features like negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, junior liens, prepayment penalties, or terms exceeding 30 years. Total points and fees cannot exceed 3% of the total loan. The borrower's income, assets, employment status, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and repayment obligations are considered and verified for mortgage underwriting. Adjustable rate mortgages have restrictions on interest rate increases. Borrowers must meet front- and back-end ratio requirements and cannot be delinquent on loan obligations or in bankruptcy, short sale, foreclosure, or other federal programs. The QRM requirements for securitized mortgages are stricter than the QM requirements. Errors in mortgage lending can be categorized as \"type 1\" when unqualified borrowers receive loans and \"type 2\" when credit is denied to borrowers likely to repay on time. Extending credit to unqualified borrowers (type 1 errors) can lead to significant costs for lenders and increase overall indebtedness, making both borrowers and lenders vulnerable to economic downturns. On the other hand, not extending credit to qualified borrowers (type 2 errors) may result in missed profit opportunities for lenders. The consequences of type 1 errors are considered more severe for lenders than type 2 errors, as they can lead to federal interventions to stabilize financial markets. However, type 2 errors can limit credit availability for qualified borrowers, hindering economic recovery. This highlights the trade-off between reducing risky lending practices and ensuring borrower access to mortgage credit. Prior to July 14, 2008, high-risk underwriting practices, such as collateral-dependent lending and no-documentation loans, were common in mortgage lending. Borrowers were qualified for adjustable rate mortgages based on initial interest rates, without considering potential rate increases. Institutions holding these mortgages had little capital to withstand defaults, and due diligence in the lending chain was lacking. These practices contributed to an increase in type 1 errors before the financial crisis. Prior to the financial crisis, collateral-dependent lending practices in prime and nonprime markets led to highly leveraged balance sheets for households and financial institutions. Repayment relied more on housing asset values than borrowers' ability to repay with their incomes and savings. If borrowers couldn't meet obligations, selling their homes was the solution. During the 2000s, collateral-dependent lending practices allowed borrowers to take on large amounts of debt that could only be repaid under favorable economic conditions. This included interest-only mortgages, piggyback loans, and low or zero downpayment lending. Borrowers could refinance or sell their homes to meet debt obligations, relying on rising house prices. During the 2000s, borrowers utilized piggyback loans to combine a conventional conforming loan with a secondary loan, taking advantage of tax deductions and potentially lower combined payments compared to a jumbo loan with private mortgage insurance. This financing arrangement was popular for borrowers not using mortgage credit to purchase homes. During the 2000s, borrowers used cash-out refinances to tap into their home equity for various purposes such as home improvements and debt consolidation. This allowed them to reduce monthly payments, lower interest costs, and improve credit scores. However, it also increased default risk for lien holders as highly leveraged borrowers had less capacity to repay their debts in case of a market decline. The proposed QM rules aim to prevent lenders from relaxing underwriting standards based on the assumption of sustainable housing market conditions, which could lead to increased default risk for highly leveraged borrowers. This would discourage speculation in the housing market and make loan repayment more resilient to economic shifts. Under the proposed definition of QRMs, lenders would be exempt from risk retention if borrowers have enough equity to avoid piggyback financing. Distressed borrowers could still repay mortgages by selling homes, given a 20% downpayment requirement. Borrowers must provide proof of employment and income when applying for loans, with self-employed or commission-based borrowers facing challenges in traditional verification. Low- or no-documentation lending may have required higher downpayment but benefitted some borrowers. \"Low-doc\" and \"no-doc\" loans, also known as \"liar loans,\" can misrepresent a borrower's financial capacity to repay a mortgage. Dishonest borrowers or lenders can mislead investors, making full-income documentation necessary to prevent exaggeration of borrower repayment capacity. The use of low- or no-documentation loans during the housing boom increased due to changes in credit score reliability and underwriting practices, posing risks in predicting default probabilities. During 2004-2006, new weights were assigned to borrower characteristics for predicting default probabilities, with credit history gaining importance while income weights decreased. Automated underwriting technology allowed for higher-risk factors if offset by factors reducing default risk, such as rising house prices. The increase in low- or no-documentation lending could be seen as collateral-dependent lending, deviating from proposed income and asset verification rules. During the mid-2000s, nontraditional mortgage products like ARMs, interest-only loans, 2/28s, 3/27s, and Option ARMs became popular, especially in the subprime market. These loans offered initially low rates but could lead to higher payments later on. Borrowers could benefit from these products if they didn't plan to stay in the mortgage for the full term. Nontraditional mortgage products, such as ARMs and interest-only loans, offer lower monthly payments initially, making them attractive for borrowers who do not plan to stay in the mortgage for the full term. These products can increase affordability and reduce repayment problems for borrowers who save the difference between traditional fixed-rate and nontraditional mortgage payments. However, they are more vulnerable to repayment issues during sudden financial or economic changes, as seen with mortgage loans tied to short-term LIBOR experiencing payment increases after a spike in LIBOR. Mortgage loans tied to short-term LIBOR saw payment increases after a spike in rates in 2008. Borrowers lacking liquid assets may face exacerbated repayment problems. Qualifying for nontraditional loans with initially low rates can lead to future repayment issues. The proposed QM rule discourages qualifying borrowers at low rates and includes property taxes in the underwriting process to reduce borrower risk. Failure to escrow for property taxes in mortgage underwriting may lead to repayment problems for borrowers, especially first-time home buyers. This practice was not common in subprime lending, where borrowers often used loans for consolidating debt or home improvements. Including property taxes in underwriting helps reduce borrower risk. The proposed QM rule addresses the oversight of not incorporating property tax escrows for borrowers near their repayment limits. Financial institutions must hold sufficient capital to withstand loan defaults to prevent insolvency and economic instability. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, nonbank institutions and nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies could originate mortgages without regulatory capital requirements, allowing for funding with less oversight. The proposed QM and QRM rules do not directly address issues related to inadequate capital buffers to absorb a sudden rise of delinquencies. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Dodd-Frank Act have called for increased capital buffers for banks. Mortgage financiers, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, held little capital to support their lending activities. Prior to conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had inadequate capital buffers to support their mortgage lending activities, making them vulnerable to sudden financial downturns. Mortgage securitization transactions involve selling mortgage loans to securitizers who issue mortgage-backed securities to investors, with opaque credit risks. The lack of transparency in securitization processes leads to participants relying heavily on credit rating agencies, creating an \"incentive misalignment\" issue. Investors may not have conducted thorough due diligence on underlying credit risks, leading to potential problems in identifying risk exposure to borrower repayment issues during economic downturns. \"Incentive misalignment in securitization pipelines can lead to a lack of due diligence in assessing credit quality, especially during optimistic periods, increasing the risk of errors. Requiring parties to retain \"skin-in-the-game\" could incentivize better examinations. Prior mortgage lending practices contributed to the financial crisis, prompting the need for stricter QM rules to prevent excessive leveraging and aid economic recovery.\" The QM and QRM rules aim to improve lending standards to prevent repayment problems during economic downturns. QRM rules would require sharing losses from nonperforming loans to encourage better underwriting practices. Industry experts are concerned that QRM exemptions could lead to an increase in lending errors. Mortgage industry representatives prefer loans that meet specific quantitative measures to avoid potential legal challenges. Industry representatives advocate for harmonizing QM and QRM rules to reduce legal risks and inconsistencies. This would also impact risk-based pricing strategies, potentially making it harder for disadvantaged borrowers to obtain loans. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of high-cost mortgage loans, making it harder for weaker borrowers to obtain credit. Changes include including all compensation paid to loan originators in points and fees, potentially disqualifying low-credit quality borrowers from meeting QM or QRM standards. The proposed standards for high-cost mortgage loans may provide legal protection to creditors when lending to lower-default risk borrowers, but could lead to less credit availability for qualified borrowers. Meeting the QRM standards may reduce financially unqualified borrowers accumulating large debt, but may also result in the rejection of applicants able to repay non-QRMs. Type 2 errors, or forgone lending opportunities, may impede overall economic recovery, especially during favorable financial conditions. The shift of mortgage credit risk from financial markets to the federal government may increase if higher downpayment requirements are adopted by the mortgage industry. This could make the Federal Housing Administration a more affordable option with a 3.5% downpayment requirement. As a result, the federal government would insure a larger share of mortgage originations in the United States. The QRM standards are unlikely to affect borrowers as long as the GSEs remain under conservatorship, and the federal government bears the default risk for low downpayment mortgage loans."
