    "content": "We propose a new approach for training a summarizer using a secondary encoder-decoder as a loss function to address the limitations of word level training for sequence outputs. Experimental results show improved performance in ROUGE metric and human evaluations, making it competitive with specialized state-of-the-art models for text summarization. The task involves using a neural network, specifically an attentional encoder-decoder network, to generate a concise summary of a piece of natural language text. The encoder scans the input sequence to create an internal representation, while the decoder computes a probability distribution over next words based on previous words. A beam search decoder is used to find the most likely output sequence. The decoder in the neural network is trained using teacher forcing, where the reference sequence prefix is always given at each decoding step. A novel approach is presented to address the discrepancy in training by defining a loss function at the sequence level using an encoder-decoder network. The summarizer's output sequence is fed into another network called the recoder, which is trained to produce the reference summary. Adding the recoder as a loss function improves abstractive summarizer on CNN/DailyMail dataset achieving significant improvements in ROUGE metric and human evaluations. The attentional encoder-decoder model and specific abstractive model of See et al. (2017) are used as baseline models for comparison. The ideas presented in the paper are applicable to various summarizers. The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of a new loss function for training sequence to sequence models. It treats the source article and target summary as sequences of tokens, aiming to train a neural network to predict the next token in the summary sequence. The model discussed does not consider specific summarization problem details, making it suitable for the study. The network is trained using teacher forcing to minimize the maximum likelihood loss. At test time, a beam search decoder is used to generate sequences until the STOP token is output. Each input token is embedded using a weight matrix learned during training. The weights W emb are learned during training and used in an LSTM for forward and backward states. The decoding phase also utilizes an LSTM to output probabilities over tokens. During training, teacher forcing is used, while at test time, beam search decoding is employed. The decoder uses attention to read the encoder's output states and map them into output probabilities. The pointer generator mechanism allows the decoder to copy tokens directly from the input, particularly helpful for out-of-vocabulary tokens. The final distribution is a combination of the attention vector and the next word input. The recoder is a neural network model that takes the decoded sequence from the summarizer as input and outputs the reference summary. It serves as a sophisticated loss function to help improve summarization. The recoder is a neural network model that serves as a loss function to train the summarizer by backpropagating errors. It can be any sequence to sequence model that backpropagates to its inputs, with lower dimensions and a GRU instead of an LSTM in the encoder to reduce memory usage during training. The recoder is a neural network model used to train the summarizer by backpropagating errors. It involves representing the summarizer's decoded outputs as inputs in a differentiable way using a beam search decoder to find high probability token sequences. The chosen token is based on probability distributions, which can be fed into the recoder to ensure the right information is contained. The recoder is a neural network model used to train the summarizer by backpropagating errors. It involves representing the summarizer's decoded outputs as inputs in a differentiable way using a beam search decoder to find high probability token sequences. The chosen token is based on probability distributions, which can be fed into the recoder to ensure the right information is contained. The recoder processes the sequence (w R t) by multiplying P t by a weight matrix to produce a dense representation in a lower dimensional space, reusing the same embedding matrix and mapping back to vocabulary space to avoid increasing parameters. The recoder is trained to output the reference summary by propagating errors to its inputs and can be trained jointly with the summarizer from scratch or added to a pretrained summarizer for continued training. The recoder is trained using teacher forcing to produce the reference summary by minimizing the loss function J R ml. This loss metric focuses on the presence of information but not on brevity, allowing longer sequences to potentially yield better results. The recoder's output is not used for decoding at test time, and training is done jointly with the summarizer to ensure that summaries do not exceed the reference summaries in length. The recoder is trained using teacher forcing to produce the reference summary by minimizing the loss function J R ml, which focuses on information recall. A penalty curve Penalty(t) \u2265 1 is defined for timesteps beyond a desired length, with a hyperparameter \u03bb balancing precision and recall. Other methods to control output length include adding desired length into decoder state, but these require model changes. Malia Obama, unlike most teenagers, received driving lessons from the U.S. Secret Service agents instead of her parents or licensed instructors. First Lady Michelle Obama revealed in an interview that the armed agents, who provide security for the family, taught Malia how to drive. Malia, who is not your average 16-year-old, was reportedly trained by Secret Service agents, as her mother hasn't driven herself in several years. Malia Obama's driving lessons were provided by U.S. Secret Service agents, as revealed by First Lady Michelle Obama. The agents taught Malia how to drive, giving her a sense of normalcy and independence. Michelle Obama herself hasn't driven in years. The pgen cov+recoder model, trained with loss J S + J R, produced a summary mentioning \"malia\", a relevant name in the article. Training only with recoder loss J R may encourage the summarizer to output the right information but with grammatical errors. In this work, the focus is on improving the training of abstractive models based on encoder-decoders, such as the one chosen as a baseline for enhancement. Various techniques, including reinforcement learning, are used to address exposure bias from teacher forcing in sequence learning problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to train actors in making discrete decisions using an encoder-decoder network. The decisions are evaluated based on a reward function defined on the output sequence. The REINFORCE algorithm is one technique used to turn rewards into gradients for training probability distributions. The encoder-decoder network helps in evaluating the quality of the model being trained. The recoder improves the quality of the algorithm by replacing a reward heuristic with an encoder-decoder and its loss function. Different approaches like beam search and a differentiable approximation are used to train the model and define loss based on sequence output. These methods lack flexibility in crediting alternative summaries, unlike the approach discussed. The recoder, a type of summarization network, can generate diverse high-quality summaries. Using a differentiable approximation to beam search enhances backpropagation for future improvements. This approach is similar to Chu & Liu (2019) but differs in training objectives. The recoder, a summarization network, can produce diverse high-quality summaries using a differentiable approximation to beam search for improved backpropagation. Xu et al. (2019) introduced scheduled sampling for machine translation, where a decoded sequence prefix is used in training to predict the next reference word with flexibility in word ordering. The idea of using a second model to assist in training the primary model has been seen in other contexts, such as Sennrich et al. (2016) and He et al. (2016) for machine translation. The backtranslation model serves to generate synthetic training data for machine translation, unlike the recoder which aims to improve the original network directly. The recoder recreates the reference summary, not the original article, similar to sentence compression techniques. Dual learning also utilizes two models for training in a related study. In contrast to dual learning models that share parameters, the recoder in this study does not share parameters with the summarizer. Experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of adding loss functions to the attentional encoder-decoder summarization model. The Tensorflow code used in the experiments will be made public along with trained models. Additional training with recoder losses requires double the memory. The recoder in the study does not share parameters with the summarizer. Additional training with recoder losses consumes double the memory and time, using beam search decoding with a beam width of 4. Test times are unaffected as the recoder is only used during training. Two versions of the model were used as baselines, one with coverage mechanism (pgen cov) and one without (pgen). The comparison models with recoder are trained using additional loss functions. The recoder in the study bypasses backpropagation to the pointer-generator mechanism, yielding similar results faster and with less computational resources. The length penalty is set to a graduated curve based on the reference summary length. Different settings of \u03bb were experimented with, with the final setting of \u03bb = 0.1 selected based on the highest ROUGE-1 score on the validation set. The recoder can capture more complex notions of quality than ROUGE. The recoder in the study improves quality faster and with less resources than backpropagation to the pointer-generator mechanism. Adding the recoder loss results in score improvements for both pgen and pgen cov baseline models. The recoder in the study improves the performance of abstractive summarizers by adding a new loss function, resulting in significant score improvements compared to baseline models. This enhancement is seen in ROUGE-1 scores, with smaller improvements in ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores. The addition of the recoder outperforms using the first 3 sentences from the article as the summary. Comparing to a recently published model, the results are close to the \"hierarchical\" model by Li et al. (2018), which also focuses on sentence-level structure. The recoder enhances abstractive summarizers by improving ROUGE scores, comparable to advanced models like Chen & Bansal (2018) and Celikyilmaz et al. (2018). Eliminating duplicate trigrams in post-processing can further boost ROUGE scores, but a more complex implementation is needed for training. These models are tailored to specific metrics and problems, such as sentence boundaries and ROUGE. The recoder improves abstractive summarizers by enhancing ROUGE scores. Evaluation experiments compared different models against a baseline, with similar summary lengths. Human evaluation was conducted using the CNN/DailyMail test set, showing differences in beam search decoded outputs. The study compared the recoder model to a baseline in abstractive summarization, showing a preference for the recoder in terms of overall quality, readability, and relevance. The recoder was preferred 60.3% of the time over the baseline. The study compared the recoder model to a baseline in abstractive summarization, showing a preference for the recoder in terms of overall quality, readability, and relevance. The recoder was preferred 60.3% of the time over the baseline. If we account for the remaining 4.8% and 4.5% of cases where the models gave outputs identical to the baseline by assigning equal preference to them, the preference ratios would be adjusted slightly to 59.8%, 54.8% overall and 62.1%, 55.1% relevance respectively. The overall improvement may be largely explained by the improvement in relevance. The study compared the recoder model to a baseline in abstractive summarization, showing a preference for the recoder in terms of overall quality, readability, and relevance. The recoder was preferred 60.3% of the time over the baseline, with an overall preference of 59.8% - 54.8% over the pgen cov baseline. The recoder, as an encoder-decoder with a sophisticated loss function, significantly boosts performance in summarization tasks based on experimental results using ROUGE and human evaluations. Training a general abstractive summarizer significantly improves performance without model changes. Future research may explore using a model as a loss function for other problems."
