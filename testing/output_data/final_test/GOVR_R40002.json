    "content": "According to DHS and Pew Research Center estimates, around 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the US in 2012, with 8.1 million unauthorized workers in the civilian workforce. DHS issued new guidance in 2009 focusing on worksite enforcement to target criminal aliens and employers hiring illegal workers. Compliance promotion has become a key aspect of DHS's efforts in worksite enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has increased its role in worksite enforcement efforts, with a focus on addressing unauthorized employment. The Department of Labor (DOL) also plays a significant role in enforcing labor laws in low-wage industries with large numbers of immigrant workers. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) prohibits employers from hiring unauthorized workers. The INA Section 274A provisions, also known as employer sanctions, prohibit employers from hiring unauthorized aliens and require verification of new hires' identity and work eligibility through I-9 forms. Worksite enforcement is carried out by DHS's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The federal government's approach to immigration-related worksite enforcement has evolved over the years, with a focus on enforcing federal immigration laws within the United States. Employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may face civil and/or criminal penalties. Interior enforcement priorities have shifted in response to events such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, worksite enforcement priorities shifted to focus on national security-related investigations and removing unauthorized workers from critical infrastructure facilities. ICE's worksite enforcement program prioritizes investigations related to national security, public safety, and critical infrastructure sectors. ICE also focuses on criminally prosecuting employers who exploit unauthorized workers or engage in human smuggling. Compliance has seen increased emphasis in recent years. ICE has increased its emphasis on compliance and outreach in worksite enforcement, using inspections of business owners' I-9 records to ensure compliance with employment eligibility verification laws. The agency promotes the IMAGE program to reduce unauthorized employment, with civil and criminal penalties for violations of INA prohibitions on unlawful employment of aliens. Civil money penalties can be imposed for failing to comply with I-9 requirements or knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens. Entities found in violation of I-9 requirements may face fines ranging from $110 to $1,100 per individual. Hiring violations can result in fines of $275 to $2,200 for a first offense and $2,200 to $5,500 for a second offense before March 27, 2008. After March 27, 2008, fines increase to $375 to $3,200 for a first offense and $3,200 to $6,500 for a second offense. ICE may issue employers a Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF) for civil violations related to unauthorized aliens. Fines range from $3,300 to $11,000 for each unauthorized alien for multiple offenses before March 27, 2008, and $4,300 to $16,000 for offenses after that date. Employers convicted of knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens may face criminal fines up to $3,000 per violation. Employers may face fines up to $3,000 per unauthorized alien for civil violations. Criminal investigations could lead to charges for document fraud or harboring unauthorized aliens, with penalties for those violations. Assessing the performance of the DHS worksite enforcement program is challenging due to data reporting issues. Data provided to the Congressional Research Service by ICE lacks historical context due to limited pre-ICE worksite enforcement program data. The INA Section 274A establishes civil penalties for violations of I-9 requirements and unlawful employment. Table 1 shows annual data on Final Orders for civil money penalties from FY1999 to FY2014, with a decrease in fines from FY2000 to FY2004 and a subsequent increase since FY2006. The new DHS worksite enforcement strategy emphasizes the use of civil fines, as discussed in a 2009 House hearing by Marcy Forman, then director of the ICE Office of Investigations. ICE has restructured the worksite administrative fine process to impose penalties on employers who hire unauthorized workers. Despite increases in recent years, the number of Final Orders for civil money penalties remains very low. Administrative arrests are also used for civil violations of the INA. Administrative arrests are for civil violations of the INA, such as being illegally present in the United States. Criminal arrests include arrests for illegal hiring, identity theft, alien harboring, and money laundering. Both citizens and noncitizens can be subject to criminal arrests. The number of administrative and criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations increased each year from FY2003 to FY2008. In 2008, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff highlighted the progress made by ICE in worksite enforcement operations. However, between FY2008 and FY2009, the number of arrests plummeted, with a steady decline since FY2011. The reasons for the decrease in arrests between FY2008 and FY2014 are unclear, but may reflect ICE's renewed focus on employers. In 2011, ICE Deputy Director Kibble addressed concerns about the diminished number of administrative arrests in worksite enforcement operations. ICE's worksite enforcement efforts have been part of a broader strategy resulting in record numbers of individuals being removed from the United States. In FY2009, out of 1,647 administrative arrests, 96% were non-managerial employees. Position titles were available for 1,153 individuals arrested. In FY2010, out of 1,217 administrative arrests, 92% were non-managerial employees while 8% were managerial employees. For worksite enforcement criminal arrests, in FY2009, 72% were non-managerial employees and 28% were managerial employees. In FY2010, 49% were non-managerial employees and 51% were managerial employees. In FY2010, the number of managerial employees among criminal arrestees in worksite enforcement operations increased from 114 to 196, in line with ICE's focus on prosecuting employers who hire unauthorized workers. The representation of managerial employees among those arrested varied in FY2012 and FY2013, with about half being managerial employees in both years. In FY2012 and FY2013, managerial employees accounted for a significant portion of criminal arrests in worksite enforcement investigations conducted by ICE. In FY2013, 40% of the 452 individuals arrested on criminal charges were owners, managers, supervisors, or human resources personnel. Despite these arrests, the overall number of administrative and criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations remains relatively low compared to the total population of potential violators. For example, in FY2008, there were 5,184 administrative arrests in worksite operations, while there were an estimated 8.3 million unauthorized aliens in the U.S. civilian labor force. The number of criminal indictments and convictions related to worksite enforcement investigations increased from FY2005 to FY2008, then decreased between FY2008 and FY2009. Data on criminal fines and forfeitures imposed from FY2003 to FY2014 are also provided. Time lags between arrests, indictments, and convictions make it challenging to draw direct conclusions about the worksite enforcement program in any specific year. ICE data shows that worksite enforcement-related criminal fines and forfeitures varied significantly from FY2003 to FY2014, remaining consistently above FY2003 levels. These include fines from U.S. District Courts, ICE seizures forfeited to the government, payments to ICE in lieu of property seizure, and restitution to unauthorized alien employees for labor law violations. The annual variability is attributed to different types of fines and time lags. The data presented offers a limited means to examine ICE's worksite enforcement program. Some measures showed a downward trend after 2000 and then an upward trend after FY2006. Other measures increased until FY2008, then decreased significantly from FY2008 to FY2009. From FY2011 to FY2014, there was a steady decrease in arrests, with no consistent pattern in criminal arrests and indictments. FY2014 values for all measures were below FY2011 levels. The data on criminal fines and forfeitures imposed show no discernible pattern. The values of the various measures for the years shown are relatively small compared to the estimated size of the unauthorized workforce. DOL has the authority to review I-9 verification forms and enforce federal labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act. Wage and Hour Division administers and enforces the FLSA for private sector workers. The Department of Labor (DOL) enforces the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for private sector workers and collaborates with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on worksite enforcement. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) outlines their roles in enforcing labor and immigration laws to ensure proper wages and working conditions for all workers, regardless of immigration status. Effective enforcement of immigration law is crucial to protect the rights of all workers, whether citizens or non-citizens, and to deter illegal migration to the United States. The MOU between DOL and DHS aims to coordinate worksite enforcement activities and avoid conflicts. ICE agrees not to conduct civil worksite enforcement at a site under DOL investigation of a labor dispute, defined as a conflict over employee rights such as wages, workplace safety, and discrimination. ICE can still enforce during a pending labor dispute in certain circumstances. ICE and DOL agree to coordinate worksite enforcement activities and prevent manipulation of the enforcement process. ICE can enforce during a pending labor dispute if necessary for national security, critical infrastructure protection, or other federal crimes. DOL's role in immigration-related worksite enforcement is limited, but it indirectly helps reduce unauthorized employment by enforcing labor laws. Employers who hire unauthorized workers violate labor laws by exploiting their labor. They may pay cash salaries, avoid paying social security taxes, and prefer unauthorized workers who are less likely to complain about mistreatment. Enforcement of minimum wage and other labor laws can reduce the economic incentives to hire unauthorized workers. However, some experts, like former WHD Administrator Maria Echaveste, point out the limitations of using labor law enforcement to address unauthorized employment. Echaveste highlights the challenges of using labor law enforcement to tackle unauthorized employment, noting that many employers who hire unauthorized immigrants still comply with other labor standards. She emphasizes the need to reduce the supply of unauthorized workers to improve the economic conditions of low-income workers. WHD investigations in low-wage industries may be crucial in addressing unauthorized employment. In FY2014, WHD collected $79.1 million in back wages for FLSA violations, benefiting 109,000 workers in low-wage industries, with restaurants and health care leading in back wage collections. The number of cases in low-wage industries fluctuated between FY2003 and FY2014, with a peak in FY2013 followed by a decrease in FY2014. Back wage collections and the number of employees receiving back wages showed overall increases during this period. Back wages increased between FY2003 and FY2012, reaching high points, but decreased in FY2013 and FY2014. Despite the decreases, values for back wage collections and employees receiving back wages were higher than FY2003 levels. The data on Final Orders, fines, arrests, indictments, and prosecutions provide insight into DHS's worksite enforcement strategy. The numbers in the tables are relatively small compared to the potential number of employers violating FLSA requirements. The effectiveness of worksite enforcement by DHS or DOL is ultimately measured by its impact on reducing the unauthorized labor force in the United States."
