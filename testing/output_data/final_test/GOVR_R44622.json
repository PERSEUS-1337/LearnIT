    "content": "The report provides an overview and analysis of two patent cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court during its October 2015 Term, focusing on enhanced damages in patent infringement cases and claim construction standards in patent revocation proceedings. It discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's opinions in Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc. and Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee on current patent law, emphasizing the importance of providing economic incentives for research and development in the United States. Patent protection grants inventors a limited monopoly over their inventions, allowing them to profit from their research and development efforts. Without patents, competitors could easily copy new inventions without incurring development costs. Inventions eligible for patent protection include processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issues patents for new inventions after examining patent applications to ensure they meet patentable subject matter criteria and other requirements. An application includes a specification describing the invention and claims defining the inventor's rights. To be patentable, an invention must be novel, nonobvious, and useful. Novelty requires the invention to be different from prior art, nonobviousness means it cannot be obvious to a person skilled in the relevant field, and usefulness entails providing a significant benefit. The invention, once patented, provides exclusive rights to the patent holder to prevent others from using or selling it without authorization. Infringement can lead to civil action and injunctions. The Patent Act grants exclusive rights to patent holders to prevent unauthorized use or sale of their invention. Infringement can result in civil action and injunctions, with federal courts able to award damages or royalties to compensate for infringement. Patents last for 20 years from the filing date, after which others can use the invention freely. Patent holders can sell their rights through an assignment or grant licenses for limited use in exchange for royalty payments. A patent holder can grant a licensee the right to practice the invention through a patent licensing agreement, which may include conditions and restrictions. If the licensee exceeds the scope of the license or fails to comply with the agreement, they may be liable for breach of contract and patent infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases. Parties dissatisfied with its rulings may petition the U.S. Supreme Court for review, but the Supreme Court has discretion in granting certiorari. The law allows for enhanced damages in patent infringement cases, with the amount being up to three times the original damages, at the district court's discretion. The Federal Circuit has limited enhanced damages awards to cases of \"willful infringement,\" stating that intentional disregard of legal rights warrants deterrence. Willfulness is determined by factors such as deliberate copying, concealment of conduct, and motivations of the infringer. The willful infringement doctrine from the 1980s to 2007 required courts to assess whether the infringer knew of the patent before being charged or acted with a reasonable belief of non-infringement. Federal Circuit decisions emphasized the duty of someone with notice of a competitor's patent to exercise due care. Prior to 2004, invoking attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer interrogatories was allowed. In 2004, the Federal Circuit rejected the principle of drawing adverse inferences in cases of willful infringement when the defendant invokes attorney-client privilege or work-product privilege. This decision eliminated the burden on the attorney-client relationship in patent cases. The Federal Circuit made significant changes to the willful infringement doctrine in its 2007 decision, In re Seagate Technology, overturning two decades of precedent by abandoning the affirmative duty of due care. Congress codified this change with the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011, specifying that the failure to obtain legal advice cannot be used to prove willful infringement. The Federal Circuit overturned two decades of precedent by abandoning the affirmative duty of due care in willful infringement cases. Accused infringers are not obligated to obtain an opinion of counsel, and willful infringement now requires a showing of objective recklessness. The state of mind of the infringer is not relevant, and a patent holder must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood of infringement. This two-prong analysis, known as Seagate, also requires demonstrating that the infringer knew or should have known of the risk of infringement. The Seagate standard requires a two-prong analysis for increasing damages under Section 284 of the Patent Act. The Federal Circuit has a multipart standard for reviewing enhanced damages in patent cases. The Supreme Court's decision in Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc. changed the application of the Seagate standard. Halo Electronics accused Pulse of patent infringement related to electronic components. Despite Halo offering to license its patents, Pulse continued selling the components without obtaining legal advice on the patents' validity. Halo filed a lawsuit in 2007, resulting in a jury awarding $1.5 million in damages for patent infringement. The jury awarded Halo $1.5 million in reasonable royalty damages for Pulse's willful patent infringement. The district court found no willful infringement due to Pulse's defense claiming Halo's patents were invalid, which was not objectively baseless. The Federal Circuit affirmed the decision, stating Pulse did not willfully infringe. Halo petitioned the Supreme Court for review, which was granted in June 2016. The Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Circuit's Seagate test for enhanced damages was inconsistent with the Patent Act. They rejected the requirement of proving recklessness by clear and convincing evidence, instead opting for a preponderance of evidence standard. The Court also clarified that district court's discretion to award enhanced damages is reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion. This decision overturned the application of the Seagate framework in the Halo case. The Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit's judgment in the Halo case, which had applied the now-invalidated Seagate framework. The Court relied on its 2014 opinions in Octane Fitness LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness, Inc. and Highmark, Inc. v. Allcare Health Management Systems, Inc. to determine when a case was \"exceptional\" under Section 285 of the Patent Act for awarding attorney's fees. The Federal Circuit's two-part test for exceptional cases was invalidated by the Supreme Court in Octane Fitness. The Supreme Court invalidated the Federal Circuit's test for exceptional cases in Octane Fitness, allowing district courts more discretion in awarding attorney's fees. The Court also changed the burden of proof to a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. In Highmark, the Court ruled that district court determinations must be reviewed on appeal under an abuse-of-discretion standard. The Halo Court found the Octane Fitness and Highmark rulings \"instructive\" for its analysis of the Seagate test. The Supreme Court found that the Seagate test for enhanced damages is too rigid and can shield patent infringers from liability. The Court criticized the requirement for a finding of \"objective\" recklessness before awarding enhanced damages, stating that it hinders district courts' discretion. The Supreme Court criticized the Seagate test for enhanced damages, stating that it can shield patent infringers. The Court emphasized that subjective willfulness, not just objective recklessness, may warrant enhanced damages. The Halo opinion allows district courts more discretion in awarding enhanced damages for egregious cases of misconduct. The Supreme Court criticized the Seagate test for enhanced damages, stating that subjective willfulness, not just objective recklessness, may warrant enhanced damages. The Halo opinion allows district courts more discretion in awarding enhanced damages for egregious cases of misconduct beyond typical infringement. Justice Breyer issued a concurring opinion, emphasizing the limits on district courts' discretion to award enhanced damages based on willful misconduct. The Supreme Court criticized the Seagate test for enhanced damages, allowing more discretion in awarding enhanced damages for egregious cases of misconduct. Justice Breyer emphasized the limits on district courts' discretion to award enhanced damages based on willful misconduct, citing the high costs to small businesses and inventors in obtaining counsel for patent infringement cases. Congress has left it to potential infringers to decide whether to consult counsel without the threat of treble damages influencing that decision. Justice Breyer criticized the Seagate test for enhanced damages, warning that readily available increased damages for intentional infringement could hinder innovation. He highlighted the risks small businesses face from \"demand letters\" sent by patent assertion entities, questioning how they can react to such letters carrying the threat of treble damages. The Halo decision in patent law has raised concerns about the potential for increased lawsuits and forum shopping among technology companies like Amazon, Cisco, and Google. The decision may incentivize patent assertion entities to file more cases and encourage patent holders to seek out favorable district courts. The Federal Circuit's Seagate test had previously made it difficult for patentees to recover enhanced damages for willful infringement, but the Halo decision has been seen as a victory for patent owners. Senator Orrin Hatch filed a \"sense of Congress\" amendment expressing disagreement with the Supreme Court's Halo decision and affirming that the Seagate standard should continue to govern enhanced damages analysis in patent cases. The Senate has not voted on legislation regarding enhanced damages analysis under section 284 of title 35, United States Code. Senator Hatch filed an amicus brief in the Halo case, urging the Court not to alter the Seagate standard. The Halo decision may make it easier for patent holders to receive enhanced damages in certain circumstances. The Federal Circuit is unlikely to overturn a district court's decision to award enhanced damages under Halo. The Halo decision may make it easier for patent holders to receive enhanced damages in certain circumstances, but the Federal Circuit is unlikely to overturn a district court's decision under the \"abuse of discretion\" standard. The challenge for patent holders and third parties lies in predicting the line between typical infringement and egregious cases. Future cases will require courts to determine the range of \"egregious misconduct\" that warrants enhanced damages under the Halo standard. The impact of the Supreme Court's June 2016 opinion in Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee on reexamination proceedings and the ability of accused infringers to challenge the validity of patents. The constitutionally based \"case or controversy\" requirement limits public challenges to USPTO's patent grants. In 1980, Congress established an administrative reexamination mechanism for the USPTO to reconsider approved patent applications. This allows the public to challenge patent validity without needing a federal court's involvement. Reexamination proceedings are faster and cheaper alternatives to judicial determinations, with outcomes including confirming patentability or amending the patent. The Optional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of 1999 renamed the reexamination proceeding as an \"ex parte reexamination\" and introduced an \"inter partes reexamination\" allowing the challenger to participate more fully. The effectiveness of these proceedings was questioned, leading to the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011, which made significant changes to the USPTO's reexamination procedures. The AIA introduced the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) within the USPTO to handle reexamination proceedings. PTAB consists of the USPTO director, deputy director, Commissioners for Patents and Trademarks, and administrative patent judges. It replaced inter partes reexamination with inter partes review (IPR) and introduced post-grant review (PGR) where challengers can dispute patent validity within nine months of grant. To initiate a Post-Grant Review (PGR), a petition must be filed with the USPTO within nine months of the patent grant. The USPTO director must determine that the petitioner has presented information demonstrating that it is likely that at least one claim is unpatentable. A PGR must be completed within a year, with a possible six-month extension for good cause. In an Inter Partes Review (IPR), challengers can challenge patent validity based on prior art like patents or publications, focusing on novelty and nonobviousness. The USPTO director must determine if the petitioner has a \"reasonable likelihood\" of prevailing on at least one claim to authorize an IPR. An accused infringer cannot petition for an IPR if they have already filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the patent in federal court or more than a year has passed since being served with an infringement complaint. If the patent survives the IPR, the petitioner and their privies are barred from raising related issues in the future. The IPR must be completed within a year, with a possible six-month extension for good cause. The USPTO allows challenges to patents within specific timeframes and on certain grounds. A patent can be challenged within nine months of issuance through a PGR proceeding, and thereafter only on novelty and nonobviousness through an IPR. The burden of proving unpatentability lies with the petitioner in these proceedings. Appeals can be made to the Federal Circuit if dissatisfied with the PTAB's decision. A patent application includes a specification and claims defining the subject matter. The USPTO allows challenges to patents within specific timeframes and on certain grounds. A patent application includes a specification and claims defining the subject matter. Claim construction refers to interpreting the language of patent claims to establish the boundaries of the invention. The AIA is silent on the claim construction standard in IPR and PGR proceedings, but the USPTO issued a regulation in 2012 for claim construction in an IPR. The BRI standard, also known as the \"broadest reasonable interpretation,\" is used in PTAB proceedings to interpret patent claims. This standard may make it easier for the PTAB to find a patent claim obvious or not novel compared to a court proceeding using the \"plain and ordinary meaning\" standard. The AIA prevents challenges to the USPTO's decision on instituting an IPR from being appealed. The Supreme Court considered elements of the IPR process, including claim construction standards, in the Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee case. In the recent case Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, the Supreme Court considered the validity of Cuozzo Patent's claims challenged by Garmin in an IPR petition to the USPTO. The PTAB agreed to review claims 10, 14, and 17 of the patent, even though Garmin did not specify the grounds for challenging claims 10 and 14. The PTAB found that Garmin implicitly challenged claims 10 and 14, leading to the cancellation of those claims in the Cuozzo Patent. Cuozzo appealed, arguing that the USPTO improperly instituted IPR and that the PTAB used the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standard in construing patent claims. The Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB's use of the BRI standard in claim construction, stating that the USPTO's regulation requiring such a standard was a reasonable exercise of the agency's rulemaking authority granted by the AIA. The Federal Circuit upheld the USPTO's use of the broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) standard in claim construction, stating that it has been applied for over 100 years and was implicitly adopted by Congress in enacting the AIA. Cuozzo's petition for rehearing en banc was denied by a narrow vote, leading to a petition to the Supreme Court. In October 2015, Cuozzo petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Federal Circuit's judgment on the Patent Act. The Supreme Court held that Section 314(d) bars judicial review of the Patent Office's decision to institute inter partes review, with the exception of constitutional questions. The Court also unanimously ruled that the USPTO has the authority to apply the broadest reasonable interpretation standard in construing patent claims in an IPR proceeding. The Supreme Court agreed with the Federal Circuit that the USPTO's decision on whether to institute an IPR is nonappealable, citing Congress's intent in the AIA to make such decisions final and nonappealable. The Court's ruling applies specifically to IPR proceedings and not constitutional questions. The Supreme Court's ruling on the nonappealability of USPTO's decision to institute an IPR applies specifically to IPR proceedings and not constitutional questions or other federal statutes. Justice Alito dissented, disagreeing with the majority's view on shielding the USPTO's compliance from judicial scrutiny. Justice Alito disagreed with the majority's view that the USPTO's decision to institute an IPR proceeding is shielded from judicial scrutiny. He interpreted Section 314(d) to make the institution decision nonappealable but allowed for review of institution-related issues in an appeal from the Patent Office's final written decision. This means that while a court cannot prevent an IPR proceeding from starting, the legality of instituting the review can still be subject to judicial scrutiny. Justice Alito disagreed with the majority's view on the USPTO's authority in instituting IPR proceedings. He argued that Section 314(d) should not bar judicial review of the Patent Office's compliance with statutory limits, including the requirement for IPR petitioners to state claim challenges with particularity. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that the USPTO can apply the BRI standard in IPR claim construction. The Court upheld the USPTO's authority to use the BRI standard in IPR proceedings, citing the delegation of rulemaking authority in the Patent Act. The statute's ambiguity allows for reasonable rulemaking by the agency, and there is no indication that Congress considered the standard when enacting the law. The Court upheld the USPTO's authority to use the BRI standard in IPR proceedings, citing the delegation of rulemaking authority in the Patent Act. The BRI regulation is considered a reasonable exercise of the USPTO's rulemaking authority, as it helps protect the public interest by encouraging precise and narrowly drafted patent claims. The Court upheld the USPTO's authority to use the BRI standard in IPR proceedings, citing the delegation of rulemaking authority in the Patent Act. It stated that the USPTO's long-standing use of the BRI standard supports the reasonableness of its regulation. The Court downplayed concerns about inconsistent results between the USPTO and courts, stating that the patent system provides different tracks for review and adjudication. The Cuozzo decision upheld the USPTO's use of the BRI standard in IPR proceedings, with different burdens of proof for challengers. This may benefit companies seeking to invalidate patents quickly, but could negatively impact those valuing strong patent protections. Congress may consider legislative changes in response. The PTAB in IPR proceedings may need to use the same claim construction standard as federal courts, construing patent claims based on ordinary meaning and prosecution history. This legislation has not been enacted into law."
