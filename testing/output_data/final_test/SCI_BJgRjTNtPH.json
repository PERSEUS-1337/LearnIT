    "content": "One challenge in applying graph convolutional neural networks to gene-interaction data is understanding the vector space they belong to and representing interactions in lower dimensions. A method called iSOM-GSN transforms multi-omic data onto a two-dimensional grid using Kohonen's self-organizing map. This grid is used to predict disease states like breast and prostate cancer with high accuracies of 94-98% using gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number alteration data. The study utilized DNA methylation and copy number alteration to predict tumor stages of breast cancer and Gleason scores of prostate cancer with high accuracy using just 11 input genes. The scheme also offers improved representation learning, visualization, and dimensionality reduction methods for analyzing multidimensional data from projects like \"The Cancer Genome Atlas\" (TCGA). Shen et al. previously introduced algorithms iCluster and iCluster+ for dimensionality reduction and representation learning in diverse multi-dimensional data. Several studies have utilized various methods such as latent variable models, principal component analysis, heatmaps, and self-organizing maps to cluster cancer data into sub-types and classify cancer types. These studies have aimed to deduce biological insights and generate clusters using gene expression data, with some incorporating DNA methylation data as well. The work of Hopp et al., 2018 combines gene expression and DNA methylation to identify cancer subtypes similar to Roy et al., 2018. Kartal et al., 2018 uses SOMs for a regression neural network, while Yoshioka and Dozono, 2018; Shah and Luo, 2017 use SOMs for document classification. DeepDriver (Luo et al., 2019) predicts driver genes based on mutations and gene networks. Deep neural networks for multi-omics data integration are still in early stages. The iSOM-GSN method proposed in this paper integrates multi-omic data using SOMs to predict disease states by transforming the data into a gene similarity network (GSN). This approach combines gene expression data with other genomic features to improve prediction accuracy and visualization, making it the first deep learning model to use SOMs for representation learning in multi-omic data. The study introduces a model using SOMs to transform multi-omic data into a GSN for representation learning and CNNs for disease classification. Key contributions include predicting tumor aggressiveness with iSOM-GSN, deriving gene similarity networks, identifying biomarkers without manual feature engineering, interpreting multi-omics data efficiently, and graph representation learning. Two datasets, TCGA Prostate Adenocarcinoma and TCGA Breast Invasive Carcinoma, were used to classify patients based on Gleason scores and tumor stage. The study classified patients based on Gleason scores for PRCA and tumor stage for BRCA using multi-omic data. A variance threshold was applied to reduce the feature set size, and data normalization was done. The combined data for PRCA and BRCA contained all three required omic data for 387 and 392 patients respectively. Imbalance was observed in the PRCA dataset, so only three distinct Gleason scores were considered. In the PRCA dataset, only three distinct Gleason scores were considered due to imbalance. Samples with Gleason score 7 were split into 3+4 and 4+3 classes. MultisigCV algorithm identified top 14 mutated genes for further analysis. Distribution of tumor groups for BRCA was shown in Table 2. The study proposed a three-step approach for integrating multiple omics data. The three-step approach proposed for integrating multiple omics data involves creating a gene similarity network (GSN) using gene expression data, integrating all data types for each sample, and applying a CNN for classification. The input data consists of matrices representing samples, genes, and types of omics. The text discusses the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) learning algorithm for gene expression data. The SOM is a lower-dimensional representation of complex data that groups samples based on similarities in gene expression values. The main steps include initializing neurons with random weights and calculating distances among vectors to construct the SOM. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) learning algorithm for gene expression data involves calculating the Euclidean distance between genes and neurons to identify the winning neuron. The winning neuron, or best matching unit (BMU), is updated using a neighborhood function. This process is repeated for a set number of iterations until convergence is achieved. The iSOM-GSN algorithm involves obtaining neurons representing genes in a two-dimensional space using a learning rate regulation function. A SOM is created where genes are organized based on similarity, forming a GSN. The algorithm visualizes complex gene relationships on a two-dimensional map. The iSOM-GSN algorithm integrates multiple data types by using a template image generated in the first step. Genes are indexed with numbers and represented by circles colored based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and CNA data views. The iSOM-GSN algorithm integrates multiple omics data types using a template image. The final step involves feeding the generated images into a CNN to predict the disease state. The CNN architecture is effective in learning visual representations and outperforms human visual processing. The CNN's usage in any method involves variations in how convolution and pooling layers are combined and how the network is trained. The network design in Figure 7 of the Supplementary Material includes two convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers with a small number of neurons. The choice of a smaller network design aims to reduce over-fitting and simplify classification. RGB color channels are processed directly, followed by 32 filters of size 3 \u00d7 3 pixels in the first convolutional layer, ReLU, Max-pooling, and local response normalization. The second convolutional layer also has 32 filters of size 3 \u00d7 3 pixels. The network architecture includes two convolutional layers with 32 filters of size 3 \u00d7 3 pixels, followed by ReLU, Max-pooling, and local response normalization. Two fully connected layers with 128 and 3 neurons respectively, along with dropout layers, are used. Soft-max layer assigns probabilities to classes for prediction. Dropout learning is applied to prevent over-fitting. The network architecture includes dropout learning with a 50% dropout ratio and data augmentation using Adam optimizer. The data is divided into training and test datasets, scaled using Minmax scaling, and performance measures are calculated. iSOM-GSN is evaluated on two multi-omic datasets. The iSOM-GSN model was evaluated on PRCA and BRCA multi-omic datasets, showing almost perfect predictive performance with various parameters. The number of genes retained for effective classification was consistent across both datasets. The ROC and AUC plots indicated predictive performance in the range of 94-98%. The proposed model effectively classified clinical variables using only 14 significantly mutated genes. These genes were identified as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, with TP53 and PTEN being highly mutated in both PRCA and BRCA datasets. The model achieved 96% accuracy with these 14 genes, showcasing their importance as potential biomarkers for biological and clinical aspects. The genes TP53 and PTEN are highly mutated in both PRCA and BRCA datasets, serving as potential biomarkers for cancer. Additionally, genes MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 are strong predictors of MEK inhibitors in breast, prostate, and colon cancers, suggesting they could be targets for drug development. Co-occurring mutations of PIK3CA and MAP3K1 are significant in breast cancer, with MAP3K1 mutational status potentially predicting efficacy in PI3K pathway inhibitor trials. Expression of genes GATA-3 and FOXA1 can differentiate breast carcinoma from other types of cancer. The genes GATA-3 and FOXA1 are excellent biomarkers for differentiating breast carcinoma. They are associated with a less aggressive phenotype and better prognosis in HR-positive or HER2-negative breast cancer patients. The challenge lies in validating this framework due to the lack of independent datasets with all data types. Comparing with methods using gene expression and DNA methylation, the effectiveness of a single data type in classification is questioned. The study by Hopp et al. (2018) utilized gene expression and DNA methylation data separately for a single disease. They found that gene expression data alone achieved 90% accuracy, while DNA methylation and CNA data alone achieved 87% and 89% accuracy, respectively. The study highlights the benefits of combining multi-omics data and using self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for data integration, representation learning, and classification in cancer genomics. The framework introduced a new method for creating gene similarity networks. The study introduced a new method for creating gene similarity networks and visualizing high-dimensional, multi-omics data onto a two-dimensional grid. It also proposed an approach to integrate different types of multi-omic data for predicting clinical aspects of diseases. The approach can be used for unsupervised clustering and can be extended to classify Pan-cancer data. Additionally, it can be applied to other domains such as predicting music genres based on user preferences.
