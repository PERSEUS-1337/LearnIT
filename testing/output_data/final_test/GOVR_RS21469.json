It aims to increase access to telecom services, support U.S. efforts in foreign markets, advise on international negotiations, fund research grants, and aid non-profits in digital conversion. Congressional policymakers have backed NTIA's objectives through appropriations. The NTIA budget history from FY2000-FY2007 is detailed. The NTIA budget history from FY2000-FY2007 shows consistent funding from Congress, with a notable increase in appropriations in FY2001. The Bush Administration proposed a reduction in the NTIA budget for FY2009, focusing on eliminating the program for constructing and maintaining public telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the Administration emphasized NTIA's role in national emergency planning. The NTIA budget history from FY2000-FY2007 shows consistent funding with a notable increase in appropriations in FY2001. The Bush Administration proposed a reduction in the NTIA budget for FY2009, focusing on eliminating the program for constructing and maintaining public telecommunications facilities. NTIA's role in national emergency planning is emphasized, with a request for $19.2 million for FY2009 to sustain research and management efforts in the telecommunications and information sectors. The NTIA advises on telecommunications policy, international treaties, and the digital divide. It also oversees the transition of the Internet domain name system to the private sector. The NTIA oversees the transition of the Internet domain name system to the private sector, manages the U.S. spectrum for federal use, advises on national spectrum policy, and maintains oversight over ICANN. ICANN, under the authority of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Commerce and NTIA, oversees the domain name system transition to the private sector. NTIA also manages the U.S. spectrum and administers a Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund. The NTIA began setting reimbursable funds at $45 million in FY2007 for various programmatic functions, including a digital-analog converter box program, public safety interoperable communications grants, New York City 9/11 digital transition funding, assistance to low-power television stations, a national alert and tsunami warning program, and funding to enhance a national alert system. The PTFPC program assists public broadcasting stations, state and local governments, Indian tribes, and non-profit organizations in constructing facilities for educational and cultural programs. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides grants to public broadcasting organizations for new broadcast equipment and services. The goal was to convert all television broadcasts to digital by May 31, 2003. The Bush Administration requested zero funding for FY2009 to close out existing digital construction projects. Funding for public broadcasting facilities and analog to digital conversion is now under the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Bush Administration requested termination of NTIA's Technology Opportunity Program (TOP) in FY2005, a grant program for emerging technologies. Congress agreed and eliminated funding, citing successful pilot programs. No new legislation for funding has been introduced, as policymakers debate NTIA's role in supporting programs. The role of NTIA in supporting programs and policies is being examined by policymakers, along with budget considerations. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 created a de-regulatory environment for telecommunications. The growth of the Internet has made access nearly ubiquitous. NTIA's role has evolved in policy areas such as domain name registration and spectrum use. Concerns have been raised about the expiration of the MOU with ICANN and the potential renewal of the agreement. Some are concerned about NTIA's potential expanded policy role in spectrum management due to funding cuts in other program areas. Questions arise about coordination with other federal institutions like the FCC. NTIA's role in spectrum auction and management is also under scrutiny. The Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund, funded by the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act, supports NTIA's programmatic functions, including the digital-analog converter box program. Congress closely monitors NTIA's role in the transition period, with concerns raised about changes in mission and the elimination of funding for the TOP program. The Bush Administration's decision to eliminate funding for the TOP program and reduce funding for the PTFPC program has raised concerns. The Administration believes the private sector and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting will take over the efforts of these programs. Questions remain about whether all areas of information infrastructure development have been covered by the TOP program, and if industry will find it profitable to provide telecommunications and Internet connections in underserved areas. There are also concerns about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's ability to administer a facilities construction program. The ultimate question is how this change will impact the conversion of national broadcasting to digital transmission."
