It also allows state, tribal, and local governments to regulate nuisance dust. The \"Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2011\" excludes nuisance dust from the Act unless it causes significant public health and welfare effects and the benefits of regulating it outweigh the costs. The \"Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2011\" excludes nuisance dust, defined as particulate matter primarily from natural sources, from regulation unless it poses significant health and welfare effects and the benefits of regulation outweigh the costs. Nuisance dust consists of soil, natural or biological materials, not emitted from combustion, and not residuals from coal combustion. The \"Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2011\" excludes nuisance dust, which does not include radioactive particulate matter from uranium mining or processing. The Congress believes the EPA should have a transparent approach to excluding uncontrollable events from air quality standard compliance assessments for coarse particulate matter. Additionally, there is a focus on minimizing regulatory and cost burdens for States, tribes, and local governments. The impact of EPA regulatory activities on employment and economic activity in the agriculture community is also being considered. Before taking a covered action, the Administrator must analyze the impact on employment levels and economic activity in the agriculture industry, utilizing the best available economic models. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit an annual report to Congress on this analysis. States must submit a report to Congress on the economic models used by the Administrator for carrying out covered actions. The Administrator is required to make the analysis available on the EPA and Department of Agriculture websites, and request Governors to post it in states with significant negative impacts. Public hearings are also mandated. The Administrator must hold public hearings in states where a covered action will have a significant negative impact on agricultural employment or economic activity. The hearings must be held at a convenient time and location for impacted residents, with priority given to locations experiencing the greatest job losses. If a covered action will significantly impact agricultural employment or economic activity in a State, the Administrator must notify the State's Congressional delegation, Governor, and Legislature 45 days before the action takes effect. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and a \"covered action\" includes certain actions related to agriculture under the Clean Air Act. The national secondary ambient air quality standard for particulate matter involves issuing regulations or implementing new programs. A \"more than de minimis negative impact\" includes a loss of over 100 jobs in the agriculture industry or a decrease in agricultural economic activity. The national secondary ambient air quality standard for particulate matter involves regulations or new programs. A \"more than de minimis negative impact\" includes a loss of over 100 jobs in agriculture or a decrease in agricultural economic activity of more than $1,000,000 in any calendar year. Offset economic activity from new technologies or government employment cannot be used in the calculation. The House of Representatives passed the bill on December 8, 2011."
