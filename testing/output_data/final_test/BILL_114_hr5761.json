The \"Train the Future Act\" encourages mentors to train future professionals by allowing early distributions from qualified retirement plans for mentors aged 55 and still employed. The \"Train the Future Act\" allows mentors aged 55 and still employed to take early distributions from qualified retirement plans if they meet specific criteria related to reduced hours of employment and engagement in mentoring activities. The \"Train the Future Act\" allows mentors aged 55 and still employed to take early distributions from qualified retirement plans if they meet specific criteria related to reduced hours of employment and engagement in mentoring activities. A pension plan trust can make distributions to employees aged 62 or serving as mentors without losing its qualified status. The \"Train the Future Act\" permits mentors aged 55 and employed to receive early distributions from retirement plans under certain conditions. The distribution amount for mentors cannot exceed what would have been payable if they had left employment instead of reducing hours for mentoring activities. The \"Train the Future Act\" allows mentors aged 55 and employed to receive early retirement plan distributions based on a formula that considers the reduction in hours for mentoring activities compared to total hours worked per pay period. This provision is in line with ERISA regulations. The ERISA Act is amended to allow early retirement plan distributions for mentors. The amendments apply to distributions after December 31, 2015."
