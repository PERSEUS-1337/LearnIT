    "content": "Since 1975, the federal government has paid incentives to states through the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program to encourage efficient and effective operations. Incentive payments reward states for achieving program goals, while penalties are imposed on states that fail to meet performance levels. This system motivates states to focus on providing essential CSE services. The federal government used to match incentive funds for the CSE program, but this was prohibited by P.L. 109-171 in 2005. States can no longer receive federal reimbursement for reinvesting CSE incentive payments, leading to concerns about the fiscal impact on states and the need to modify the incentive payment system. The report discusses the current CSE incentive payment system, financial penalties for unreliable data or not meeting performance standards, state incentive payment derivation, trends, and policy issues. It includes appendices with legislative history and state tables showing incentive payments and performance scores. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, collects child support payments and serves families. In FY2011, it collected $27.3 billion in child support payments and served 15.8 million cases. Total program expenditures were $5.7 billion, with $513 million in incentive payments. In FY2011, the CSE program collected $5.12 in child support for every dollar spent. The program is funded by both state and federal dollars, with the federal government bearing the majority of expenditures and providing incentive payments to states. There are five funding streams for the program, including state funding and federal reimbursement of 66% of allowable expenditures. The federal government provides open-ended funding for the CSE program, matching state and local expenditures with no limit. It is the program's largest revenue source and offers incentive payments to states, which must be reinvested back into the program. Federal matching of state expenditures of incentive payments was prohibited in 2007 but temporarily reinstated in 2009. Starting in FY2011, states must reinvest incentive payments into the CSE program to be eligible for federal matching funds. States collect child support on behalf of families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to reimburse themselves and the federal government for TANF cash payments. Families receiving TANF must assign their child support rights to the state and cooperate to establish paternity. Child support payments go to the state, except for amounts that states may choose to \"pass through\" to the family as additional income. The distribution of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families between states and the federal government is based on old AFDC reimbursement rates. States have the option to pass through some of the collected child support to TANF families, with limits set by federal law. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program collects child support payments for TANF families, with a fee of up to $25 for nonwelfare families applying for services. States can also recover additional costs from either the custodial or noncustodial parent. The CSE program collects child support payments for TANF families and nonwelfare families. States can recover costs from either parent. A $25 annual user fee is required for successful enforcement efforts, separate from the application fee. Incentive payments were provided to states by the federal government to operate effective CSE programs. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 replaced the old incentive payment system with a new revenue-neutral system based on state CSE collections and performance measures. Incentive payments were phased in and required reinvestment into the CSE program. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 implemented a new revenue-neutral incentive payment system for state CSE programs. This system included a cap on annual incentive payments, with amounts set by Congress for each fiscal year starting in FY2000. The capped aggregate incentive payment amount has been adjusted for inflation since FY2008. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 revised the incentive payment system to reward states for good performance in five major areas related to child support payments. This system aimed to provide real incentives for states to improve the CSE program and support societal goals like paternity identification. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 revised the financial penalty system for the CSE program to focus on paternity establishment, child support order establishment, and current child support collections. States now compete for a fixed amount of incentive payments, adding uncertainty to their income. The revised incentive system for the CSE program involves states competing for capped funds based on various factors like collections, performance criteria, data reliability, and comparison with other states. Unlike the old system, states must reinvest their incentive payments into the CSE program or activities to enhance its efficiency. The CSE program's incentive payment structure is complex and based on state collections of child support payments and performance in five areas. These areas include establishment of paternity, child support orders, collection of current support, arrearages, and cost-effectiveness. Federal matching funds are no longer available to increase incentive payments. States must reinvest their incentives to improve program efficiency. The CSE program's incentive payment system is based on five performance measures: establishment of paternity, child support orders, collection of current support, collection of arrearages, and cost-effectiveness. States must meet specific performance thresholds to receive incentives, with upper and lower limits set for each measure. Incentive payments are calculated based on a state's performance percentage for each measure. The applicable percentage for each performance measure is determined based on specific thresholds. If the performance percentage is above the upper threshold, the applicable percentage is 100%, below the lower threshold it is 0%, and in between, it is determined using tables specified in federal law. For example, if a state's performance percentage for establishing child support orders is 70%, the applicable percentage would be 80%. The applicable percentage for each performance measure is determined based on specific thresholds. The resulting amount is then multiplied by the collections base for an individual state and further multiplied by either 100% or 75% depending on the performance measure. The maximum incentives for each performance measure are calculated and added together to obtain the total dollar amount. The maximum incentive base amount is calculated by adding the five maximum incentives for each performance measure. States' maximum incentive base amounts are then totaled, and each state's individual maximum base amount is compared to the total. The state's share of the total determines their actual incentive payment, for example, if a state's share is 17%, they will receive 17% of the capped incentive payment for that fiscal year. The federal government provides incentive payments to states based on their performance data. States must provide reliable data in a timely manner to receive these payments, as mandated by P.L. 105-200. Incentive payments are calculated quarterly using state estimates and audited performance data. Under the old system, audits focused on administrative procedures, but now states are accountable for performance outcomes to receive incentives. The data reliability provisions in P.L. 105-200 ensure the integrity of the incentive payment system. The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement conducts audits to evaluate data completeness, accuracy, and reliability. States must provide verifiable data to earn incentive payments and avoid penalties. Estimated payments are sent quarterly, but states risk zero payments if data is incomplete or unreliable. The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement conducts audits to ensure data integrity for incentive payments. States risk losing payments if they fail the audit on a performance measure. Audits start after the fiscal year ends and are completed by early summer. States provide case data for auditing, and a sample of at least 150 cases is selected for review. Auditors assess documentation to determine compliance with requirements. The auditor reviews sample cases to verify data accuracy, meeting a 95% reliability standard. Findings are reviewed by auditors from different offices and OCSE headquarters staff. States can contest findings during audits. Penalties are imposed for incomplete or unreliable data affecting state performance calculations. Penalties may be imposed on states for incomplete or unreliable data affecting performance measures in the child support program. If performance measures and data reliability are not achieved, a corrective action year is initiated in the following fiscal year. Failure to improve performance may result in a financial penalty, such as a reduction in the state's TANF block grant. Currently, the governor of a state must certify an approved CSE program to receive TANF block grant funding. Poor performance in the CSE program can lead to penalties or a reduction in Title IV-A funding. Penalties range from 1%-5% of the federal TANF block grant for noncompliance with performance standards set by the HHS Secretary. Penalties for noncompliance with CSE program standards set by the HHS Secretary can range from 1% to 5% of the TANF block grant. The penalty amount increases each year for consecutive deficiencies. Incentive payments for states depend on various factors unique to their population and CSE caseload. The effectiveness of CSE programs in collecting child support payments depends on factors like paternity establishment and order enforcement. Performance measures are interdependent, with paternity needing to be established before a support order can be enforced, and arrearage payments relying on current support being paid. States with more cases requiring these services may face challenges in meeting CSE standards. In FY2011, states with cases requiring paternity establishment, child support order establishment, and payment of arrearages faced challenges in collecting child support. The aggregate incentive payment amount was $513 million, with payments ranging from $59.6 million in Texas to $77,575 in the Virgin Islands. Incentive payments are not directly correlated with performance measures. The data presented in this report show that states with high incentive payments are also top performers in collecting child support. States have improved data reliability over the years, with only a few failing audits. Performance scores from FY2002 to FY2011 indicate progress in the CSE program. The comparison of FY2002 to FY2011 performance score data shows improvement in CSE program performance across all five measures: paternity establishment, child support order establishment, current child support collections, child support arrearage cases, and cost-effectiveness. The national averages for these measures have increased over the years. The CSE program aims to establish paternity for those in need, with a focus on ensuring all children have a legal relationship with their parents. States have options for determining the Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) based on CSE program data. The Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) compares paternities established during the fiscal year with the number of nonmarital births in the previous year. A PEP of 100% or more indicates that the state has established paternity for more than just newborns born outside of marriage. The median PEP score among CSE programs was 86.64 in FY2002, increasing to 97.32 in FY2011. The maximum PEP score rose from 130.75 in FY2002 to 126.33 in FY2011, while the minimum PEP score started at 50.83 in FY2002 and increased to 81.26 in FY2010. According to the CSE FY2010 Annual Report, states are facing challenges in maintaining high performance levels in paternity establishment. The incentive/penalty structure has led to states reducing or eliminating their backlog of cases, making it harder to achieve the 90 percent performance level for PEP. Despite normal annual variations in performance, more states may struggle to meet the acceptable performance level in the future. The Child Support Enforcement Program aims to ensure all children in the caseload have child support orders. The median child support order establishment score increased from 71.28 in FY2002 to 82.90 in FY2011 across 54 jurisdictions. The maximum score fluctuated between 92.03 and 96.00, while the minimum score rose over the years. The median child support current collections score among 54 jurisdictions with CSE programs increased from 57.10 in FY2002 to 60.79 in FY2011, with the maximum score reaching 83.90 and the minimum score rising to 50.97 during the same period. The median child support arrearage cases score among 54 jurisdictions with CSE programs fluctuated from 60.71 in FY2002 to 61.57 in FY2011, with the maximum score increasing from 71.58 to 50.97 during the same period. The child support arrearage cases score among 54 jurisdictions with CSE programs fluctuated from 60.71 in FY2002 to 61.57 in FY2011. The maximum score increased from 71.58 to 83.77 in FY2011. The minimum score rose from 30.21 in FY2002 to 45.37 in FY2011. The cost-effectiveness score among the jurisdictions also varied, with the median score increasing from 4.49 in FY2002 to 5.30 in FY2011. In FY2010, the child support arrearage cases score was 1.42, increasing to 1.98 in FY2011. CSE incentive payments were awarded to all 54 jurisdictions in FY2002, FY2005, FY2010, and FY2011. Some jurisdictions did not receive incentives due to poor performance on certain measures. Overall, the 54 jurisdictions improved their performance over the years. In FY2002, 46 out of 54 jurisdictions received incentives for all five performance measures, while 3 received incentives for four measures and 5 received incentives for three measures. In FY2005, 53 jurisdictions received incentives for all five measures, with one jurisdiction receiving incentives for four measures. In FY2010, 53 jurisdictions received incentives for all five measures. In FY2011, out of 54 jurisdictions, 53 received incentives for all five performance measures, while 1 jurisdiction (the Virgin Islands) received incentives for four measures. Individual performance measures may affect incentive payments. The tables show performance measures by state for selected years. Relationship between performance and incentive payments not always clear. Child support collections crucial for determining incentive payments. The relationship between performance levels and incentive payments is not always direct due to the heavy reliance on child support collections in the calculation. This results in more populous states receiving larger incentive payments, regardless of their actual performance. For example, California received high incentive payments but ranked low in cost-effectiveness. California received the highest amount of incentive payments in FY2002 and FY2005 and the second highest amount in FY2010 and FY2011 for collecting child support, mainly on behalf of TANF families. The performance-based incentive payment system is part of the CSE program's strategic plan to measure results, despite concerns about meeting future expectations due to reductions in federal funding. Some in the CSE community are concerned about states not receiving incentive payments that reflect their performance due to various factors like declining CSE collections, biased performance scores, limited indicators, and a cap on incentive payments causing competition among states. Some argue that the current CSE incentive payment system rewards states for their performance in critical areas and sets achievable targets, encouraging competition among states. The annual cap on incentive payments is seen as promoting state motivation to improve performance. According to OCSE, all states received a CSE incentive payment in FY2011, indicating a certain level of program performance. For all five performance measures, states achieved scores earning them incentives. A comparison of FY2002 to FY2011 data shows overall improvement in CSE program performance. The comparison of FY2002 to FY2011 data indicates improved performance in all five CSE program measures. Paternity establishment score increased from 73% to 98%, child support order establishment score increased from 70% to 81%, current child support collections score increased from 58% to 62%, child support arrearage cases score increased from 60% to 62%, and cost-effectiveness score increased from 4.13 to 5.12. Concerns are raised about the CSE incentive payment system being heavily based on child support collections and the impact of artificial thresholds on performance levels. The amount of a state's CSE incentive payment depends on its child support collections, which can vary due to factors like state population, number of single parents, successful paternity determinations, and effectiveness of the CSE program. The state's CSE program's performance measures, including caseload, interstate cases, per capita income, child poverty rate, and unemployment rate, determine incentive payments based on sliding scales with upper and lower thresholds. If a state establishes paternity or child support orders for at least 80% of its caseload, it receives a percentage score. In FY2011, Illinois and Arizona both received a paternity establishment percentage score of 100%, despite a significant difference in performance. South Dakota and Illinois both received a maximum score for child support order establishment, even though their percentages varied. The performance measure for current child support collections in FY2011 ranged from 51.11% in Nevada to 83.90% in Pennsylvania, with most states falling between the upper threshold of 80% and the lower threshold of 40%. In FY2011, Pennsylvania exceeded the upper threshold for arrearage child support collections with a score of 100%, while Hawaii had the lowest percentage at 45.37%. South Dakota had a cost-effectiveness score of 10.41, and Louisiana had a score of 5.05. In FY2011, the upper threshold for arrearage child support collections was exceeded by Pennsylvania with a score of 100%, while Hawaii had the lowest percentage at 45.37%. There have been criticisms of the CSE performance thresholds, suggesting that they are outdated and should be adjusted to challenge states to improve their performance. Adjustments for population size have also been proposed. Some suggest adjusting CSE performance thresholds for population size and social/economic factors. Supporters argue against raising the bar, stating states are already doing well with limited resources. The current CSE incentive payment system recognizes the need for multiple indicators to evaluate program performance. Incentives are based on achieving various goals, not just cost-effectiveness. The CSE incentive payment system rewards states for achieving goals like paternity establishment, child support order establishment, and collection of child support payments. Some argue for additional performance indicators like medical child support and interstate collections, but many states find the current five measures sufficient. The 1998 law required the development of a medical support incentive measure for the CSE program, but a report recommended postponing its implementation. Currently, medical support data is collected by states but not used for incentive payments or penalties, with no immediate plans to do so. The medical support incentive measure for the CSE program has been put on hold by OCSE. Incentive payments for state CSE programs are no longer matched with federal dollars, reducing their impact. The Affordable Care Act is expected to expand health insurance coverage, raising questions about its impact on medical child support. Many child support advocates argue that interstate child support enforcement remains challenging despite federal tools. About 33% of CSE cases involve more than one state, highlighting the need for better performance indicators to measure successful establishment and enforcement. Some argue that a performance indicator measuring interstate child support cases would enhance the CSE program's effectiveness. Interstate collections increased by 52% from FY1998 to FY2011, but still only comprised a small percentage of total CSE collections. The program aims to transfer private funds to nonwelfare families, emphasizing personal responsibility for noncustodial parents. The CSE program holds noncustodial parents accountable for their financial obligations to their children, reducing government spending on programs like TANF. Reliable child support payments lead to fewer welfare cases and lower federal costs for programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Some analysts suggest that tracking interstate child support cases could improve the program's effectiveness. Some analysts suggest adding a performance indicator to measure the impact of child support enforcement (CSE) collections on reducing costs in public benefit programs. State policymakers and advocates want to evaluate CSE programs based on a broader set of factors, including payment processing performance and promoting self-sufficiency. Several persons commented on federal regulations for the implementation of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) incentive payment and audit penalty provisions. They noted that incentive payments and financial penalties affect different programs (CSE and TANF) as they come from federal CSE funding and state's TANF funding, respectively. Congress historically linked the CSE program and the TANF program, with the Governor of a state required to certify operation of an approved CSE program as a condition. The Governor of a state must certify operation of an approved CSE program to receive TANF block grant funding. Federal law links poor performance in the CSE program with a reduction in Title IV-A funding. States with low performance may still qualify for an incentive payment if they show significant improvement. Federal law requires states to meet specific performance levels in paternity establishment, child support order establishment, and current support collections to avoid penalties. Failure to meet these requirements can result in a 1% to 5% reduction in federal TANF block grant funds. The incentive payment and financial penalty systems interact but affect different programs. The financial penalty system affects different programs, and states must meet specific performance levels in paternity establishment to avoid penalties. If a state's incentive payment exceeds penalties, the state cannot easily reconcile the difference as incentive payments must be reinvested into the CSE program. An alternative to reducing TANF funding for CSE program inadequacies could be deducting penalties from the state's incentive payment or federal matching funds. The paternity establishment indicator has two separate standards, including a 90% Paternity Establishment Percentage requirement. The Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) must meet a 90% standard according to federal law. States failing to meet this requirement face financial penalties unless they show improvement. The required increase in performance varies based on the state's PEP score, with higher scores needing less improvement to avoid penalties. For example, a state with a PEP below 40% needs a 6 percentage point increase, while a state with a PEP between 75% and 90% needs a 2 percentage point increase. The Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) must meet a 90% standard according to federal law. States failing to meet this requirement face financial penalties unless they show improvement. The penalty for not increasing the PEP by the required percentage points is a 1%-5% reduction in federal TANF funding. Additionally, states can receive incentive payments if their PEP meets certain requirements, with higher incentives awarded for higher PEP scores. The Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) must meet a 90% standard according to federal law. States failing to meet this requirement face financial penalties unless they show improvement. If a state has a PEP of less than 50%, they must increase it by at least 10 percentage points to receive an incentive payment. States can be eligible for incentives even if subject to penalties for not meeting performance standards. The existing statutory PEP standard of 90% was considered too high by the work group developing the incentive payment system. The work group disagreed with the 90% PEP standard, overlaying a provision for states with a PEP of 80% or higher to receive full incentive payments. This new provision created inconsistency in CSE law, with the National Council of Child Support Directors recommending setting the upper threshold at 80% for paternity establishment penalties to align with incentive funding. If enacted, states would need to establish paternity for at least 80% of children, aligning with the existing incentive formula. The CSE incentive payment system introduces uncertainty and competition among states for capped funds. The CSE incentive payment system creates competition among states for funds based on performance in various areas, leading to adjustments in payments based on state performance relative to others. Some analysts argue that each state's CSE program is unique, and improvements should be measured against their own past performance rather than compared to other states. However, all states must share capped funding for incentive payments, leading to comparisons between states with different caseloads and demographics. Some argue that states should have the autonomy to increase federal funding for the CSE program if they feel they have not received enough incentive payments. They believe the federal government bears too much of the financial burden, matching state funds at a 66% rate and providing incentive payments. In the past, CSE incentive payments were crucial for states to meet their funding requirements. The previous law allowed for a substantial increase in state CSE funding, with the federal government matching state investments by about $2 for every dollar spent. The federal government matched state investments in the CSE program by about $2 for every dollar spent before FY2008. In FY2010, actual incentive payments to states amounted to $504 million, with a federal match of $978 million. The elimination of federal reimbursement for incentive payments may reduce CSE financing in the future, impacting program performance. Studies show that state spending significantly affects program performance, with well-funded programs performing better. The elimination of federal reimbursement for incentive payments is expected to reduce overall CSE program expenditures and child support collections. Some states may increase their contributions, but overall expenditures will be reduced. State officials used incentive match funds to sustain program operations and avoid layoffs during tight budgets. In prior years, incentive match funds were used for long-term projects due to predictable funding, but now they are needed to sustain program operations and prevent layoffs during budget uncertainties. State officials are concerned about funding uncertainty with the expiration of the incentive match in fiscal year 2011 and worsening state budget situations. Planning has become more difficult without knowing if the incentive match will be extended or the future state CSE appropriations. Some states may not be able to maintain expenditure levels as many budget situations have worsened since the economic recession. Delivery of services beyond the core mission of the CSE program, such as job skills, is also at risk. The delivery of services beyond the core mission of the CSE program, such as job skills training and fatherhood initiatives, is uncertain. Officials believe these services are necessary to increase collections, especially from noncustodial parents facing employment barriers. However, budget shortfalls may lead to a reduction in these services to preserve core functions. Many in the CSE community argue that a decrease in federal funding could harm states' ability to support families, potentially impacting the effectiveness of the program and the well-being of children and families it serves. Before the CSE program in 1975, the federal government was reimbursed for AFDC payments when child support was collected. Congress saw fiscal sharing as an incentive for localities to collect child support. The Social Security Amendments of 1967 provided for the development of a program where state agencies would determine paternity and secure financial support from noncustodial parents for children receiving AFDC. This was seen as a strong incentive for local governments to improve their CSE activities. The Title IV-A program included child support enforcement provisions, with cost sharing ranging from 50% to 83%. States collecting child support for AFDC families were reimbursed by the federal government at the state's FMAP rate. P.L. 93-647 required states to receive a bonus incentive payment for child support collected on behalf of AFDC families. The Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977 and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 changed the incentive payment rates for child support collections on behalf of AFDC families. The incentive payment was simplified to a flat 15% of child support collections, coming out of the federal share of the recovered funds. P.L. 97-248 reduced the incentive payment rate from 15% to 12% of child support collections for AFDC families. P.L. 98-378 revised incentive payments to be made directly to states, which then passed them through to local CSE agencies. The incentive payment formula was changed to ensure states received a minimum of 6% of child support collections for both AFDC and non-AFDC cases. States could earn up to 10% of collections based on cost-effectiveness. The federal government paid the incentives from its share of retained collections for AFDC families and capped non-AFDC incentives at 115% of AFDC payments. The Family Support Act of 1988 authorized the creation of a U.S. Commission on Interstate Child Support to improve the child support program. The 1996 Welfare Reform Law required the HHS to make changes to the federal funding formula and implement a new performance-based incentive system. The Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) mandated the HHS Secretary, in consultation with state CSE program directors, to propose a new incentive funding system for state CSE programs based on performance. The Incentive Funding Workgroup, comprising state and federal representatives, was formed in October 1996 to develop this system. The Incentive Funding Workgroup, consisting of state and federal partners, recommended a new incentive funding system based on the CSE National Strategic Plan. State partners consulted with CSE programs to reach a consensus on the recommendations, which were endorsed by the Secretary and presented to congressional committees. These recommendations were largely included in the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998, included in P.L. 105-200, replaced the old incentive payment system with a revised revenue-neutral system. It provides incentive payments based on state collections, incorporates performance measures, phases in the system by FY2002, mandates reinvestment of payments into the CSE program, and weights the formula in favor of TANF families. The HHS Secretary is required to make payments to states, with a cap of $422. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998, under P.L. 105-200, replaced the old incentive payment system with a new one that provides payments based on state collections, incorporates performance measures, mandates reinvestment of payments into the CSE program, and favors TANF families. The aggregate incentive payment to states had specific amounts allocated for each fiscal year up to FY2008, with adjustments for inflation in subsequent years. P.L. 109-171 eliminated the federal match on CSE incentive payments in FY2008, but P.L. 111-5 temporarily reinstated federal matching for FY2009 and FY2010. Appendix B includes detailed state tables showing incentive payments received by all states in FY2002, FY2005, FY2010, and FY2011, along with unaudited performance scores for each fiscal year."
