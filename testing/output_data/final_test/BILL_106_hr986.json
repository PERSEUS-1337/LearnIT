    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. John Walsh, host of Fox Television's ``America's Most Wanted'' program, dedicated his life to pursuing felons and fugitives who committed heinous crimes. His son, Adam Walsh, was abducted and murdered in 1981, leading John to become an advocate for victims' rights. Despite the lack of closure for his son's case, John Walsh continued his mission to seek justice for victims. John Walsh, a tireless advocate for victims' rights, testified before Congress multiple times, leading to the passage of key legislation in 1982 and 1984. He also lobbied for a constitutional amendment and established the TV program \"America's Most Wanted\" to expose fugitives' criminal activities. Just four days after its debut in 1988, the FBI announced significant progress. John Walsh's TV program \"America's Most Wanted\" led to the capture of several fugitives, including David James Roberts in New York City, three new fugitives added to the FBI's Most Wanted list, and Robert Wayne Fisher just 33 minutes after being profiled. Additionally, Walsh helped capture a New Jersey mass murderer who had been on the run for 18 years. John Walsh, through \"America's Most Wanted,\" has profiled 1,455 fugitives, leading to the capture of 914 individuals. He also helped recover missing child Nicole Ravesi and reunited 150 missing persons with their families. Walsh has identified 24 criminal suspects unknown to law enforcement, aiding in their identification. John Walsh has profiled 17 unidentified victims of foul play, resulting in the identification of eight victims. His contributions to crime victims and law enforcement have been at no cost to taxpayers. Through \"America's Most Wanted\" and other efforts, Walsh continues to serve by pursuing dangerous fugitives, protecting children, and bringing closure to crime victims in the United States. John Walsh is authorized to receive a Congressional Gold Medal for his contributions to law enforcement and victims' rights. The medal will be designed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and $30,000 is authorized for this purpose. Additionally, duplicate medals may be created. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to strike and sell duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering all costs. The proceeds will reimburse the appropriation used for the medals. The medals created under this Act are considered national medals."
