These waivers are the first in over 15 years and aim to test welfare-to-work strategies. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a new initiative in July 2012 to waive federal work participation standards under the TANF block grant for states to experiment with innovative strategies to improve employment outcomes for needy families. Some in Congress have opposed the Administration's waiver initiative, with measures passed in the House and introduced by Senator Hatch to block the waivers. Opponents question the legality and process of the initiative. The controversy surrounding the waiver initiative questions its legality and impact on work requirements. The discussion reflects a long-standing debate on welfare-to-work strategies, focusing on quick employment versus education and training. This report provides context on the HHS initiative to waive TANF work participation standards, without offering a legal analysis. It outlines the history of welfare waivers and factors to consider in evaluating the initiative. TANF is a block grant providing funds to states for cash welfare programs for needy families with children. The federal grant is $16.5 billion annually, with states required to meet a maintenance of effort requirement. For a comprehensive overview of TANF, refer to CRS Report R40946, and for welfare-to-work issues, see CRS Report R42767. Under the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement, states must spend a minimum of $10.4 billion annually from their own funds in addition to federal funds on TANF programs. The purpose of TANF is to provide assistance to needy families, promote job preparation and work, prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encourage two-parent families. States have flexibility in how they use TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF provides states flexibility in designing cash assistance programs, with federal standards for time limits and work participation. States must meet minimum work participation standards or face penalties. The TANF statute requires a percentage of families to be engaged in work, with reductions for caseload reduction or state spending exceeding requirements. Not all families receiving cash assistance are included in the participation rate calculation, as some may not have a \"work-eligible\" individual. Work-eligible individuals must participate in specific activities for a minimum number of hours per week to be considered \"engaged in work.\" Single parents with a pre-school aged child must participate for at least 20 hours per week, while other single parents must participate for at least 30 hours per week. Two-parent families must participate for more hours. Most welfare-to-work activities count towards participation standards, including educational and rehabilitative activities. There are limits on counting pre-employment activities towards work standards. States have limitations on counting certain activities towards work participation standards for cash assistance recipients. Single mothers with pre-school children are only required to participate for 20 hours per week, which may not count towards GED programs. Vocational training can only be counted for 12 months in a recipient's lifetime. The combination of job search and rehabilitative activities is limited to 12 weeks in a fiscal year. Work requirements apply to states, not individual recipients, and states have the authority to determine individual work requirements and financial sanctions for non-compliance. States may also engage recipients in activities that do not count towards federal participation standards. States have limitations on counting certain activities towards work participation standards for cash assistance recipients. Caseworkers in some states have discretion to determine suitable activities for recipients, such as extended job search or education beyond time limits. States that allow non-countable activities do not receive credit for participation. The 1996 welfare reform law created TANF work participation standards, but did not specify how states should verify hours of participation. A 2005 GAO report found some states lacked accurate reporting methods. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required states to establish procedures to count and verify work hours. HHS regulations mandated supervised participation in all activities. States are required to file work verification plans with HHS to verify participation in activities. Failure to comply results in a penalty of 1% to 5% of the state's block grant. The caseload reduction credit reduces work participation standards by one percentage point for each percent reduction in caseload since FY2005. States may also receive credits for exceeding spending requirements under the MOE requirement. Most states receive varying credits based on caseload reduction and state spending. Majority of states could meet TANF work participation standards with less than 25% participation rate, except for FY2007. National average work participation rate from FY2002 to FY2009 shows TANF families engaged in work. The TANF participation rate has remained below 50% since FY2002, with most states meeting standards due to caseload reduction and MOE credits. Unsubsidized employment is the most common work activity for TANF recipients, allowing families to work while still receiving assistance. States have adjusted eligibility rules to support families with working members, who can count towards participation standards. Some states also allow assistance for a limited time for families with working members. In FY2009, unsubsidized employment was the most common work activity for TANF recipients, with 19.1% of families having a member engaged in this type of work. Job search and vocational educational training were also common pre-employment activities, with 5.0% of families participating in job search. Time-limited assistance is provided for families with working members to meet participation standards. In FY2009, 4.5% of families had a member engaged in vocational educational training. Unpaid work experience was the most common activity aside from unsubsidized employment. The TANF statute allows the Secretary of HHS flexibility in assessing financial penalties for noncompliance with work participation standards. After changes in work standards in 2005, some states failed to meet TANF work standards for FY2007-FY2009. The Obama Administration offered waivers for federal TANF work participation standards in 2012 under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act. HHS announced an initiative in response to President Obama's memorandum to allow states to implement alternative welfare-to-work strategies and substitute performance measures for TANF work standards. Waivers could be granted for state-wide initiatives or specific populations, with a typical duration of five years. HHS announced an initiative to allow states to implement alternative welfare-to-work strategies through waivers of TANF work participation standards. Waivers may last five years and aim to test innovative strategies to improve employment outcomes for needy families, including career pathways models and support for individuals with disabilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced an initiative to allow states to implement alternative welfare-to-work strategies through waivers of TANF work participation standards. States can test innovative strategies to improve employment outcomes for needy families, including strengthening strategies for individuals with disabilities and extending the period for pre-employment activities. States must apply for a waiver with specified elements, but as of June 3, 2013, no state had requested a waiver. HHS requires states to track performance and outcomes during welfare-to-work demonstration projects. States must set interim targets and develop improvement plans if targets are not met. Failure to meet targets repeatedly will result in the end of the waiver demonstration. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated that states must increase the number of people moving from welfare-to-work by at least 20%. HHS prefers random assignment experiments to evaluate programs but will consider alternative methods. Waivers will not reduce access to assistance or employment, and some TANF provisions are not subject to waivers. The legal authority to waive requirements in public assistance programs dates back to 1962 with the Public Welfare Amendments of 1962. This law established Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, allowing the waiver of requirements for federal-state public assistance programs. The House Ways and Means Committee report emphasized the importance of these requirements for the administration of such programs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a surge in experimentation with welfare-to-work strategies through waivers of pre-1996 federal requirements. These waivers allowed for state-initiated changes in the AFDC program, ranging from small demonstrations to larger statewide modifications. The Clinton Administration continued to approve waivers until the enactment of the 1996 welfare law. Between January 1993 and August 1996, the Clinton Administration approved 83 waiver applications from 43 states and the District of Columbia. These waivers tested various program features such as enhancing financial incentives for single mothers to work, allowing families to have more savings while retaining eligibility for assistance, expanding work requirements for mothers with young children, increasing sanctions for non-compliance with work requirements, establishing time limits on aid, and tightening child support enforcement. The 1996 welfare reform law allowed states to \"grandfather in\" their waiver rules for TANF work requirements and time limits. AFDC waivers, along with the National Evaluation of Welfare to Work Strategies (NEWWS), provided valuable research on welfare-to-work programs. The National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) required states to conduct structured evaluations of their programs, including impact analysis on employment, earnings, and child well-being indicators. Evaluations used qualitative and quantitative methods like surveys and interviews. Findings showed that mandatory welfare-to-work programs could increase employment and reduce welfare receipt. The research found that mandatory welfare-to-work programs could increase employment and raise the income of recipient families. Programs combining financial incentives with work requirements also increased employment but did not always reduce welfare receipt. Such programs could improve the well-being of children in recipient families, reflecting key changes in low-income assistance programs in the mid-1990s. The Family Support Act of 1988 mandated the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) to compare different welfare-to-work strategies. The National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) compared \"work-first\" programs emphasizing job search with \"education-focused\" programs. Both types of programs increased employment and reduced welfare receipt. Over five years, labor force attachment programs had larger impacts, especially for those without a high school diploma. The program in Portland, OR had the largest impacts in the evaluation. The Portland, OR program in the NEWWS evaluation was a \"mixed\" model emphasizing employment as a goal, allowing caseworkers to assign participants to education if needed. It focused on finding a \"good job\" and extended job search. The final report was issued in 2001 and its findings supported the \"work-first\" approach in TANF programs. States that continued their work-related waivers under TANF were able to assess their programs based on waiver rules instead of federal standards. They could count certain activities towards participation that would not meet the federal definition of \"engaged in work,\" such as extended job search and education. Additionally, states could exclude certain families from the participation rate calculation if they were exempted from the welfare-to-work program under the waiver. States had to certify by October 1, 1999, whether they intended to continue their waivers. Regulations required states to certify by October 1, 1999, if they would continue their waiver policies. 20 states continued their waiver policies for work requirements. The number of states with \"grandfathered\" waivers declined from FY2000 to FY2007 as waivers expired. States with waivers assessed welfare-to-work programs using waiver rules instead of federal standards. HHS calculated work participation rates based on waiver rules and federal rules for FY2000 to FY2006. In FY2001 and FY2002, waivers increased the national average participation rate by 4.5 percentage points compared to statutory TANF work standards. The number of states with waivers declined over the years, with the Bush Administration proposing to end grandfathered waivers in 2002. However, the proposal was not adopted, and the last remaining waiver expired in 2007. The Bush Administration's 2002 TANF reauthorization proposal aimed to end grandfathered waivers, but also introduced a \"superwaiver\" proposal allowing states to seek new waivers for integrating funding and program rules across various assistance and workforce development programs. This proposal passed the House multiple times and would have allowed TANF work participation standards to be waived, with states required to develop integrated performance objectives and outcomes. The Obama Administration's initiative to allow waivers of the TANF work participation standards raises legal, procedural, and substantive issues. Questions are raised about the likelihood of achieving goals, potential compromises in pursuing the initiative, and alternative ways to achieve similar goals. The Administration's goals include testing alternative strategies, measuring employment outcomes, and program integration. The Obama Administration's initiative allows waivers of TANF work participation standards to test alternative strategies and measure employment outcomes. States have flexibility in designing welfare-to-work programs, but the era of large-scale experimentation in strategies ended with TANF's enactment. States are encouraged to consider new, more effective strategies through the waiver initiative. The Obama Administration's waiver initiative encourages states to explore new strategies for helping parents find and keep employment. This includes innovative policies like Career Pathway models that combine education and work for job advancement in specific sectors. These policies have not been tested in welfare-to-work programs before. Programs integrating adult basic education with college-level career and technical skills have shown positive employment impacts. New models like the I-Best program in Washington state combine adult basic and post-secondary education. \"Drop-out recovery\" programs aim to re-engage high school dropouts in separate settings. Community college programs target low-income students, offering financial incentives for completion and support through \"learning communities.\" Community college programs, including \"learning communities,\" group disadvantaged students together for support. TANF work standards allow cash assistance recipients to participate in these programs, potentially counting towards participation requirements. States may hesitate to use these strategies if they exceed durational limits or face other restrictions. Waivers may be needed to test various activities beyond education and training programs. States may consider testing different job search strategies under a waiver, including alternative methods of enforcing job search requirements and experimenting with activities like subsidized employment and on-the-job training. The rise of social networks and Internet searches has changed the nature of job search since the enactment of TANF. The waiver allows for various welfare-to-work strategies, including employment, training, and community service. Congress could revisit TANF work participation standards to provide more flexibility for states. However, there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of new strategies, and the Administration may consider projects with superior employment outcomes. The TANF program imposes work requirements indirectly through numerical standards to ensure states align with federal goals. Performance measures can have intended and unintended consequences, affecting states' behavior and employment outcomes. Performance measures, including alternative outcome measures like President Obama's waiver initiative, can have unintended consequences on states' behavior in welfare-to-work programs. This includes concerns about states manipulating expenditures to meet standards and focusing on achieving better scores on outcome measures like leaving welfare for work and job attachment. States may focus on improving outcomes like moving recipients from welfare to work by using outcome measures. This shift could lead to unintended behaviors such as \"cream skimming,\" where only the most likely to succeed are served, leaving behind the hardest-to-serve individuals. The TANF performance measure, the work participation rate, assesses engagement in work or activities in exchange for assistance. Welfare work requirements aim to move recipients off welfare rolls by obligating them to engage in activities similar to those in the workforce or education. This was a response to concerns about welfare dependency and enabling behaviors. The work participation rate measures engagement in work or training for welfare recipients to transition into employment. Outcome measures do not directly assess program effectiveness as external factors can influence outcomes. Evaluating the impact of a welfare-to-work program involves comparing outcomes attributed to the program with those measured independently. The effectiveness of state welfare-to-work programs is not fully assessed by the TANF work participation rate alone. Different measures offer different perspectives and complement each other. Criticisms include the fragmentation and overlap of federally-assisted workforce programs, leading to questions about resource efficiency and effectiveness. States are encouraged to improve coordination with other programs. The announcement suggests states should consider projects to improve coordination with the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) for TANF recipients. Congressional interest in promoting coordination between TANF and WIA has been ongoing. One obstacle to integration is the different assessments required for TANF recipients compared to WIA performance measures. The Obama Administration's waiver initiative aims to align TANF welfare-to-work efforts with WIA services by assessing them using similar outcome measures. While there are arguments for program integration, the mandatory work requirements of TANF and voluntary services of WIA present challenges in using the same measures. The Obama Administration's waiver initiative aims to align TANF welfare-to-work efforts with WIA services by identifying barriers to efficiently using tax dollars. States may have similar goals in mind as the Administration, especially for low-participation-rate states to reconsider their programs. The waiver initiative allows states to substitute alternative performance measures for the work participation rate in TANF programs, giving low-participation-rate states a chance to show program effectiveness. However, the waiver imposes additional costs on states for tracking and evaluation. TANF incentivizes states to minimize assistance rolls, with successful states reducing expenditures by moving families quickly from welfare to work. The 1996 welfare law and subsequent changes aimed to reduce cash assistance expenditures by moving families quickly from welfare to work. Various measures were implemented to make work more financially rewarding, such as expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit, increased child care funding, and improved health care coverage through Medicaid. The 1996 welfare law and subsequent changes led to a decline in cash assistance rolls for needy families with children. By 2001, the number of families receiving cash assistance had decreased significantly. Child poverty also decreased during this time, with the overall child poverty rate dropping from 21.8% in 1994 to 16.2% in 2000. The child poverty rate declined from 21.8% in 1994 to 16.2% in 2000, with a decrease in poverty for children in female-headed families as well. However, children remained the most likely age group to be poor. In the 2000s, the decline in cash assistance slowed, leading to a reversal in child poverty rates even before the 2007-2009 recession. The child poverty rate increased to 18.0% by 2010, with a rise in poverty among children in female-headed families to 43.0% in 2007. The child poverty rate increased to 18.0% by 2010, with a spike to 47.7% for children in single-parent families in 2010. Policymakers are debating changes to welfare-to-work policies and TANF work participation standards, with some concerns about weakening work requirements. The current debate over the Obama Administration's waiver initiative focuses on the balance between work and education in welfare programs. The initiative's emphasis on measuring outcomes raises philosophical and technical questions, shifting the focus from engaging recipients in activities to meet their obligations to solely measuring success in moving families off welfare and into jobs. Critics argue that the performance of TANF work programs has been lacking, with concerns about weakening work requirements. The TANF work participation rate has been criticized for hovering around 30%, below the 50% target. Participation in supported work activities like subsidized employment and on-the-job training is low. Vocational educational training is the third most common activity. The debate over the Obama Administration's waiver initiative focuses on the balance between work and education in welfare programs. Critics argue that TANF work programs have been lacking in performance. The Obama Administration's waiver initiative presents an opportunity for Congress to re-examine welfare-to-work programs. Congress has options to either allow the initiative to proceed, retain current rules, or craft new TANF work performance standards. They can also create their own welfare-to-work experimentation program with congressionally prescribed goals and boundaries."
