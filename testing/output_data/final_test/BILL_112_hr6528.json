    "content": "The \"Audit the Pentagon Act of 2012\" aims to strengthen national security by ensuring sound financial controls in military planning, operations, and weapons development. It also seeks to promote accountability at the Department of Defense to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The 2011 Financial Report of the United States Government highlighted that most Federal agencies received clean audit opinions, except for the Department of Defense which lacked auditable reporting. The Department of Defense's financial management has been on the \"High-Risk\" list of the Government Accountability Office, citing issues with cost control, accountability, budget forecasting, performance measurement, funds control, and fraud prevention. The Department of Defense has spent billions on improving financial information but still lacks audit readiness. The Constitution requires all Federal agencies to publish statements of public money receipts and expenditures. The Department of Defense has not complied with various laws requiring auditable financial statements, despite spending billions on improving financial information. The Department of Defense has failed to comply with laws mandating auditable financial statements, despite significant efforts and expenditures to improve financial information. The FIAR Directorate was established to enhance Department business processes for accurate financial information. The National Defense Authorization Act requires regular reports on the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan to ensure audit-ready financial statements by September 30, 2017. SEC. 4. SPENDING REDUCTIONS FOR AGENCIES WITHOUT CLEAN AUDITS. This section applies to Federal agencies required to have audited financial statements. Military departments and defense agencies are treated separately. Definitions for \"financial statement\" and \"external independent auditor\" are provided. Adjustments for financial accountability are specified annually. In fiscal year 2013 and onwards, Federal agencies must adjust their discretionary budget authority based on their financial statement audit status. Failure to submit or receive a qualified audit opinion results in a 5% budget reduction, with the amount retained in the general fund. In fiscal year 2013 and onwards, Federal agencies must adjust their discretionary budget authority based on their financial statement audit status. Failure to submit or receive a qualified audit opinion results in a 5% budget reduction, with the amount retained in the general fund for deficit reduction. Excluded from these reductions are military personnel, reserve personnel, National Guard personnel, and the Defense Health Program account of the Department of Defense. The President may waive reductions if it would harm national security or combat troops. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must report adjustments to Congress within 60 days. SEC. 5. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nWithin 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) must submit a report to Congress listing reports required by law that may no longer be necessary if the Department of Defense's financial statements were audited with an unqualified opinion. Additionally, a list of reports that may hinder the Department's ability to achieve a clean audit opinion must be included.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress believes that as the defense budget is reduced, wounded warrior accounts and essential protection for troops should not be compromised. The Department of Defense should simplify the valuation of legacy assets without compromising controls. The Act should not require the declassification of accounting details for classified defense programs, and financial accountability should be maintained using proven practices."
