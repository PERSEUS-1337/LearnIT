Amendments include a health warning label requirement. In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled against a provision restricting alcohol content disclosure on beer labels, citing First Amendment violations. The Supreme Court found a provision violating the First Amendment by banning beer brewers from competing based on alcohol content. The ban was deemed irrational as it did not apply to beer advertisements and required alcohol content disclosure on wine and spirits labels. The Distilled Spirits Council lifted a voluntary ban on hard liquor advertising on radio and television in 1996. In 2001, NBC announced it would accept liquor ads with restrictions, but later in 2002, they decided to no longer accept them. In 2007, WNBC-TV in New York started running liquor ads. Tobacco advertising is regulated by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act requires warning labels on cigarette packages and advertisements in the US. It also prohibits cigarette advertising on electronic media under the FCC's jurisdiction. The FDA tried to restrict cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising in 1996 to reduce youth usage, but a court ruled against it. The FDA attempted to restrict tobacco advertising in 1996 to reduce youth usage, but a federal court ruled against it due to lack of statutory authority. The proposed rule would have banned outdoor advertising near schools and playgrounds, limited advertising to black text on white background, and prohibited sponsorship of events using brand names. The attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories signed an agreement with major tobacco companies on November 23, 1998, settling lawsuits to recover public health costs. The settlement limits tobacco advertising, including banning cartoons and public transit ads, and restricting billboard and retail-store advertising. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive advertising, including limiting billboard and retail-store advertising. An amendment in 1980 restricted the FTC's authority to regulate children's advertising, specifically targeting television ads for sugary foods aimed at children. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive advertising, including limiting billboard and retail-store advertising. A 1994 amendment to the act states that an act is illegal if it causes substantial injury to consumers that is not avoidable and not outweighed by benefits. Consumers can file complaints with the FTC for legal action. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive advertising, including limiting billboard and retail-store advertising. It does not apply to certain entities like banks, savings and loan institutions, and Federal credit unions. The act allows consumers to file complaints with the FTC for legal action against misleading advertisements. Additionally, a federal statute allows recipients of sexually provocative mailings to request the Postal Service to stop further mailings and seek legal action if necessary. The federal statute allows individuals to request the Postal Service to stop sexually oriented advertisements through the mails. If violated, the Attorney General can take legal action in federal court. Additionally, unordered merchandise sent through the mails can be treated as a gift, and the sender cannot bill for it. Various federal statutes prohibit mail fraud and deceptive mailing practices. The Federal Trade Commission's trade regulation rule \"Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise\" mandates sellers to ship ordered merchandise within the stated time frame or within 30 days if no time is specified. The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999 and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 impose restrictions and disclosure requirements on mailed sweepstakes promotions and telephone calls to residential lines, respectively. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act prohibits unsolicited calls and faxes, allowing victims to file complaints with the FCC and seek damages. The Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 amended the law to allow unsolicited fax ads to recipients with an established business relationship. Senders must include a notice on the first page of fax advertisements. The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, enacted in 1994, requires fax advertisers to include an opt-out notice on the first page. The Act also prohibits coercive telemarketing practices and requires disclosure of the purpose of the call for goods or services. The Telemarketing Sales Rule prohibits telemarketers from calling before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. It also prohibits calling individuals on the \"do-not-call\" registry. Congress ratified the FTC's authority to create a national do-not-call registry in response to a court ruling. Congress ratified a law (P.L. 108-82 (2003)) to establish a national do-not-call registry. A federal court initially blocked the registry, citing First Amendment concerns, but an appeals court later allowed it to continue. The appeals court ultimately ruled that the registry does not violate the First Amendment, citing the greater issues with commercial solicitation compared to charitable or political calls. The Federal Communications Commission addresses the do-not-call issue by requiring procedures for maintaining a list of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations. The Do-Not-Call Implementation Act mandates the FCC to issue a final rule by September 7, 2003, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission. Over 20 states have also enacted statutes for statewide do-not-call registries. The Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992 and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 establish rules and penalties for pay-per-call services and commercial emails, respectively. The FTC requires clear disclosure of costs and odds of receiving prizes in advertisements for pay-per-call services. The CAN-SPAM Act imposes penalties for unauthorized access to protected computers and the transmission of multiple commercial emails. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 prohibits the transmission of deceptive commercial emails, false header information, lack of functioning return email address, sending emails after recipient's request to stop, and sending sexually oriented emails without prior consent. The FTC implemented a final rule on April 19, 2004, requiring exclusion of sexually oriented material in commercial emails starting May 19, 2004. The CAN-SPAM Act prohibits deceptive commercial emails and requires exclusion of sexually oriented material in commercial emails. Emails must include \"SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT:\" at the beginning of the subject line and specific information visible to the recipient upon opening the message. The CAN-SPAM Act requires a mechanism for recipients to opt-out of future commercial emails."
