    "content": "The report provides an overview of the current Child Support Enforcement (CSE) system, including how international CSE cases are handled. It discusses the challenges faced by CSE workers in international cases due to lack of standards and communication methods. The 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support is mentioned, along with the provisions in P.L. 113-183 related to enforcement of child support in international cases. The provisions in P.L. 113-183 aim to enforce child support in international cases by implementing the Hague Convention on International Recovery of Child Support. Supporters argue that noncustodial parents living abroad should still provide child support for their children in the United States. The U.S. had not ratified any treaty on child support previously due to jurisdictional differences. In most foreign countries, jurisdiction in child support cases is based on the habitual residence of the custodial parent. In the United States, child support enforcement relies on obtaining personal jurisdiction over the noncustodial parent. President Obama ratified the Hague Convention on International Recovery of Child Support in 2016 to strengthen the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program enacted in 1975. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and help families remain self-sufficient. It provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, and collection of child support payments in all 50 states and three U.S. territories. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories with federal matching funds. State programs are run at the county level and must meet federal requirements to receive funding. The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) administers the program at the federal level. State CSE programs have authority to use various methods to collect child support payments, including income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, liens against property, and reporting to credit bureaus. The 1996 welfare reform law required states to implement expedited procedures for securing assets to satisfy arrearages. The 1996 welfare reform law authorized various methods for collecting child support payments, including income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, and liens against property. It also required states to implement procedures to withhold licenses and passports of debtor parents who owe past-due support. Interstate child support enforcement is challenging due to jurisdictional issues between state and local governments. The federal CSE law mandates states to cooperate in interstate child support enforcement, but issues arise due to local court autonomy. P.L. 104-193 required states to adopt the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) drafted by NCCUSL. UIFSA limits jurisdiction for establishing and modifying child support orders, resolves jurisdictional issues in multi-state cases, and determines which state's laws apply. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) is crucial for dealing with desertion and nonsupport by implementing uniform laws across all states. It ensures that only one state has jurisdiction over a child support case, allowing for effective pursuit of interstate cases. UIFSA establishes rules for establishing, enforcing, and modifying child support orders, following a \"one-order system\" where only one state's order governs an obligor's support obligation at any given time. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) ensures that only one state has jurisdiction over a child support case, allowing for effective pursuit of interstate cases. UIFSA establishes rules for establishing, enforcing, and modifying child support orders, following a \"one-order system\" where only one state's order governs an obligor's support obligation at any given time. UIFSA's provisions on continuing, exclusive jurisdiction limit duplicate and conflicting orders, reducing \"forum shopping\" by parents seeking to adjust child support payments. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) ensures one-state jurisdiction over child support cases, reducing duplicate orders and \"forum shopping\" by parents. P.L. 104-193 mandated the adoption of the 1996 version of UIFSA, which has been adopted nationwide. Additional amendments were approved in 2001 and 2008, with only 21 states and D.C. adopting the 2001 amendments. P.L. 113-183 required states to include NCCUSL amendments as of September 30, 2008, to receive federal CSE funding. Before 1996, there was no mandate for states or the federal government to be involved in international child support arrangements. States used their own systems for interstate child support cases before P.L. 104-193. The arrangements with foreign countries were based on principles of comity and reciprocity. All 54 jurisdictions, including states and territories, have adopted UIFSA 2008, allowing for immediate implementation of the Convention. P.L. 104-193 established procedures for international enforcement of child support, allowing the Secretary of State to declare foreign reciprocating countries. These countries must have procedures for establishing paternity, support orders, enforcement, collection, distribution of payments, and providing assistance without cost to U.S. residents. The CSE program has reciprocal agreements with 14 countries and 12 Canadian provinces/territories for child support enforcement. State-level arrangements may exist in the absence of federal-level agreements, but they may not be as comprehensive. State-level arrangements for child support enforcement may not be as comprehensive as federal-level agreements. Less than 1% of CSE cases are international cases, with the United States recently ratifying the Convention related to child support obligations. The U.S. had not joined long-standing multinational treaties due to differences in jurisdictional rules. In foreign countries, jurisdiction is based on the custodial parent's habitual residence, unlike in the U.S. where jurisdiction varies. The Convention on international child support cases aims to provide uniform, efficient, and cost-free procedures for U.S. citizens seeking child support in other countries. It allows countries to recognize and enforce each other's child support orders, similar to procedures in place for interstate cases in the United States. Joining the Convention would save time and expenses compared to negotiating bilateral agreements. The Convention on international child support cases aims to provide uniform, efficient procedures for U.S. citizens seeking child support in other countries. It allows countries to recognize and enforce each other's child support orders, saving time and expenses compared to negotiating bilateral agreements. The United States will be able to obtain reciprocity from other signatory countries under the Convention. The Convention on international child support cases allows countries to enforce each other's child support orders, providing a uniform and efficient process. It addresses jurisdictional barriers and allows for flexibility in establishing new orders when jurisdictional requirements are not met. Central authorities will coordinate the enforcement of international child support cases among contracting countries. The Convention on international child support cases allows for efficient enforcement of child support orders between contracting countries through central authorities. These authorities will facilitate the transfer of documents and case information electronically for quick resolution. U.S. citizens can access cost-free services for child support enforcement in contracting countries, although some countries may assess minimal fees based on the child's income. This is a significant improvement from the current practice where custodial parents often need to hire local counsel for support orders. The Convention on international child support cases allows for efficient enforcement of child support orders between contracting countries through central authorities. The focus is on uniform procedures for enforcement of CSE decisions and cooperation among countries. HHS will be the central authority for the United States under the Convention, designating state CSE agencies to carry out many central authority functions. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance was adopted in 2007, with the United States being the first country to sign. Amendments to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act were approved in 2008 to integrate the Convention with U.S. law. Senate consent is required for treaties in the United States. The Senate in the United States must consent to treaties, requiring a two-thirds majority vote. In 2010, the Senate approved the Resolution of Advice and Consent for the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support. Further steps include Congress enacting implementing legislation and states adopting UIFSA 2008. The implementing legislation for the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support requires states to make minor revisions to their CSE state plan. The President must sign the instrument of ratification for the Treaty. Once these steps are completed, the United States can deposit its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. H.R. 4980, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, was passed by the House and Senate in 2014, enacting provisions to reduce sex trafficking and increase adoptions as well as implement the Convention. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support was enacted into law as P.L. 113-183 on September 29, 2014. The United States completed all steps for ratification of the Convention by depositing its instrument of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on September 7, 2016. The treaty will enter into force for the United States on January 1, 2017. Title III of P.L. 113-183 includes provisions implementing the Convention. The provisions in Title III of P.L. 113-183 focus on improving the enforcement of child support in international cases. It requires the Secretary of HHS to ensure compliance with multilateral child support conventions. This provision is expected to reduce federal spending by $1 million over 11 years. The Convention only applies to cases where the custodial parent and child live in one country and the noncustodial parent lives in another country. Other countries participating in the Convention will have access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. The FPLS is a system operated by OCSE to assist in locating noncustodial parents and enforcing child support obligations. P.L. 113-183 expands the definition of an \"authorized person\" to include entities from foreign reciprocating or treaty countries for international child support enforcement. The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) assists in enforcing child support by identifying overpayments, fraud, and assessing benefits. It includes the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), Federal Case Registry (FCR), Federal Offset Program (FOP), Federal Administrative Offset Program (FAOP), and Passport Denial Program (PDP). The Passport Denial Program (PDP) denies passports for child support debts over $2,500. The Multistate Financial Institution Data Match (MSFIDM) helps locate assets for child support. The FPLS accesses external sources like IRS, SSA, VA, DOD, NSA, and FBI for information. P.L. 104-193 established federal responsibility for international child support enforcement. The Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to establish reciprocal agreements with other countries for child support enforcement. OCSE serves as the central authority for international child support cases in the U.S. States have the option to require individuals in foreign countries to apply for child support services through their country's central authority. If the individual resides in a non-reciprocating country, the state may choose to accept or reject the application. P.L. 113-183 amends the Social Security Act to include these provisions. P.L. 113-183 amends the Social Security Act to include requests for child support enforcement services from foreign treaty countries as if they were requests from states. It also exempts foreign treaty countries and individuals from providing applications or being assessed costs for these services. The law defines \"foreign reciprocating country,\" \"foreign treaty country,\" and the \"2007 Family Maintenance Convention\" to establish procedures for support enforcement at little to no cost. The 2007 Family Maintenance Convention defines a \"foreign treaty country\" as one where the convention is in force. P.L. 113-183 amends the Social Security Act to include foreign treaty countries in child support enforcement, with the HHS Secretary responsible for facilitating support enforcement between the U.S. and these countries. P.L. 113-183 amends federal law to allow states to enter into reciprocal arrangements with foreign reciprocating countries and foreign treaty countries for child support enforcement. This includes using the federal income tax refund offset program to collect past-due child support payments from noncustodial parents. The program is a collaboration between OCSE, the IRS, and state CSE agencies. States must adopt the 2008 amendments of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act to receive federal child support enforcement funding. This ensures consistency in procedures and facilitates the collection of child support across state lines. Congress mandated that all states adopt the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to streamline the collection of child support across state lines. This ensures consistency in handling interstate cases, aiming for a \"one-order\" system where children receive support regardless of their parents' state of residence. Federal law requires states to treat past-due child support as final judgments, recognized in every state. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA) was passed in 1994 to address disputes between parents living in different states regarding child support. It required all U.S. territories, states, and tribes to recognize and enforce child support orders issued by other jurisdictions. This aimed to prevent noncustodial parents from evading their obligations by moving across state lines. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA) of 1994 aimed to address disputes between parents in different states regarding child support. It required all U.S. territories, states, and tribes to recognize and enforce child support orders from other jurisdictions to prevent noncustodial parents from evading their obligations by moving across state lines. P.L. 113-183 clarified court jurisdiction for modifying child support orders, stating that a state court with the controlling order has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction if the state is the child's residence or if the parties consent to jurisdiction. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA) of 1994 aimed to address disputes between parents in different states regarding child support. P.L. 113-183 clarified court jurisdiction for modifying child support orders, stating that a state court may modify a child support order issued by a court of another state under certain conditions. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance of November 23, 2007, and P.L. 113-183 amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738B. States must include amendments to UIFSA verbatim to receive federal CSE funding. The amendments must be adopted by NCCUSL as of September 30, 2008. States must enact laws related to UIFSA no later than the first day of the first calendar quarter after the close of the first regular session of the state legislature following the enactment of P.L. 113-183. In a state with a two-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session of the state legislature."
