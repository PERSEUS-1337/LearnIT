    "content": "In the past four fiscal years, Congress has directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to reduce its acquisition workforce. This includes a reduction of 15,000 people by October 1, 1996, and a total reduction of 25% over five years. Congress also required the Secretary of Defense to report on restructuring functions within DOD's acquisition departments and agencies. In FY1998 and FY1999 defense authorization acts, Congress directed the Administration to reduce the acquisition workforce by 25,000 personnel by specific dates, with provisions for waivers if adverse impacts on military readiness or acquisition efficiency are certified. DOD was also required to submit reports outlining future acquisition policy and opportunities for restructuring. Congress mandated reductions in the DOD acquisition workforce to align with budget declines, aiming to eliminate wasteful spending and allocate funds to other priorities. Outside reports, like the May 1995 DOD Commission on Roles and Missions, have fueled congressional interest in downsizing the workforce to improve efficiency. DOD exceeded congressional mandates for reducing the acquisition workforce in FY1996, leading to concerns about further personnel reductions impacting operations. DOD exceeded mandated acquisition personnel reductions in FY1996, leading to concerns about further impacts on military readiness. DOD appealed to Congress to reconsider additional reductions of 70,000 defense acquisition personnel by October 1, 2001. The General Accounting Office (GAO) found that personnel cuts outside the budgeting system could lead to Reductions-in-Force separations and unprogrammed costs. DOD reduced its acquisition workforce by 50,334 FTEs in 1997, exceeding Congress's requirements. The House National Security Committee requested GAO to review DOD's progress in reducing the acquisition workforce by 25% by fiscal year 2000. DOD is on track to meet this goal, but the exact savings from these reductions are difficult to track in the budget. Some savings may be offset by costs like contracting with private entities for services previously done by government personnel. The debate over the size and definition of the DOD acquisition workforce has led to confusion and contentious discussions. Multiple attempts have been made to define the workforce, but there is no commonly accepted definition. This lack of clarity has made it challenging to determine the workforce's size, composition, and potential impact of further reductions. The size of the defense acquisition workforce has been a topic of debate, with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 582,000 personnel over the years. Currently, the most accepted estimates range from 106,000 to 270,000 personnel, taking into account changes in defense policy. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) is the basis for DOD's education, training, and career development programs for the acquisition workforce. It was enacted in the FY1991 Defense Authorization Act and currently estimates 270,000 personnel. Members of the acquisition workforce can be identified by occupational codes like GS-1102, Contracting Specialist. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) governs DOD's acquisition workforce, which includes personnel involved in buying goods and services, managing contracts, and developing policy. Some individuals have dual roles, like managers overseeing base operations while supporting acquisition activities. Identification is based on occupational codes and organizational affiliations, such as the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS). The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) is responsible for DOD's surplus and excess property programs. Workers within DRMS acquire goods and services for disposal within federal agencies. Some personnel are directly involved in buying and selling, while others support the process. There are also personnel performing acquisition-related functions in organizations without an acquisition mission. The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) handles DOD's surplus and excess property programs, with personnel involved in acquiring goods and services for disposal. Organizational codes may not always accurately identify responsibilities. The direct identification method involves a \"desk audit\" to determine if a worker is part of the acquisition community based on their tasks and duties. This method is reliable but time-consuming. Military and civilian positions in the DOD acquisition system fall into 14 acquisition position categories. The DOD acquisition system categorizes positions into 14 categories based on complexity. Congress requested a new definition of the defense acquisition workforce to clarify the number of positions and duties. DOD hired Jefferson Solutions Group to create a new definition of the acquisition workforce, using data from various sources including the Defense Manpower Data Center and interviews with officials from different departments and committees. The report by analysts from the GAO and CBO examined two approaches for classifying acquisition workforce personnel: identifying personnel in DOD acquisition organizations and those designated under DAWIA. The report found that relying solely on acquisition organizations led to a broad definition, including non-acquisition related personnel, while excluding non-qualifying organizations overlooked personnel performing acquisition-related functions. The Jefferson Solutions Report proposed a new definition for the acquisition workforce, expanding on the 1986 Packard Commission's definition. It includes all personnel in certain defense acquisition occupations and acquisition support roles. The report recommended DOD to adopt this new definition uniformly and validate the data results. The Jefferson Solutions Report recommended a new definition for the defense acquisition workforce, expanding on the 1986 Packard Commission's definition. It suggested DOD adopt this new definition uniformly and validate the data results through an independent agency like the DMDC. The report also recommended broadening the definition to include all members of the newly-defined workforce, totaling 189,158 personnel. The study focused on defining the acquisition workforce, revealing that scientists and engineers made up the largest group. However, it lacked statistics on the use of private-sector contractors, hindering cost estimation and policymakers' understanding. The GAO reports highlighted that staff reductions in defense acquisition organizations may not result in savings due to increased spending on private-sector contractors. Lack of data on contractor support complicates cross-service comparisons and suggests that a blanket reduction in the DOD acquisition workforce could have unintended consequences. The DOD must decide whether to adopt the recommendations of the Jefferson Solutions Report for defining the defense acquisition workforce. Regular audits by the Defense Management Data Center could help track the impact of workforce reductions and movement of displaced workers within DOD. In the FY 1998 and FY 1999 defense authorization bills, Congress will address key issues regarding the defense acquisition workforce, including whether to adopt the definition proposed in the Jefferson Solutions Report. This decision could lead to a reduction in the DOD's official count of acquisition personnel and help identify redundancies, streamline the workforce, and achieve savings. Congress must ensure the accuracy and thoroughness of the report's findings and reach agreement on the overall number and diversity of skills within the acquisition workforce. The FY 1998 and FY 1999 defense authorization bills will address the acquisition workforce, considering a new definition that could reduce personnel count and lead to savings. Questions remain on how savings will be achieved, potential inefficiencies with less experienced workers, and the impact on overtime costs. Additionally, concerns arise about personnel absorption into non-acquisition-related functions and potential offsetting costs. DMDC will play a role in defining the workforce. The FY 1998 and FY 1999 defense authorization bills will address the acquisition workforce, considering a new definition that could reduce personnel count and lead to savings. DMDC, the defense agency responsible for automated databases on manpower, personnel, training, and financial movement, can collaborate with DOD to validate findings and make adjustments to personnel figures if necessary. This coordination would facilitate periodic audits to track growth and attrition of acquisition personnel within DOD and the military services. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to report on acquisition workforce reductions since FY1989 and specify workforce definitions used. The Secretary of Defense was required by Congress to define the defense acquisition workforce uniformly across DOD and submit a report on workforce reorganization. The goal was to create a roadmap for future acquisition policy, including restructuring opportunities and identifying areas of overlap, duplication, and redundancy. DOD was also tasked with exploring consolidation options, improving industry oversight, and shortening the procurement cycle. Additionally, DOD was directed to investigate cross-service and cross-functional arrangements within the military services. The Secretary of Defense was required to establish cross-service and cross-functional arrangements within the military services and defense agencies, assess recommendations in the Jefferson Solutions Report, and propose legislative changes for policy implementation. In April 1998, the Secretary submitted a report to Congress outlining new workforce initiatives for the future acquisition workforce. The Secretary of Defense proposed restructuring research, development, and testing, sustainment, increasing education and training for the acquisition workforce, integrating paperless operations, and focusing on future areas. The report suggested forming task forces and focus groups to study these issues instead of providing a comprehensive review as mandated. DOD did not endorse the report or its recommendations, and one factor to consider is whether the study methodology can be tracked and duplicated by DMDC. The methodology used in the study should be trackable and duplicable by DMDC for easier audits by DOD. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gansler issued a memorandum on the recommendations of the Acquisition Workforce Identification Working Group. The study provided a broader view of acquisition-related activities in the total life cycle of weapons. The acquisition workforce, now referred to as the \"acquisition and technology workforce,\" was redefined based on the Packard workforce definition. Agencies were required to conduct a workforce analysis and report their findings by December 30, 1998. The Jefferson Solutions Report recommended broadening the definition of personnel covered under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA). This could have funding implications as DAWIA is crucial for DOD's acquisition-related education and training. DAWIA is essential for DOD's acquisition-related education and training programs. Congress may need to appropriate more funds to accommodate the increase in DAWIA membership. While there are costs involved initially, investing in a better trained DOD acquisition workforce will be beneficial in the long run. DAWIA provides a systematic approach to career development and training opportunities with certification requirements serving as benchmarks for all acquisition personnel. The DAWIA certification serves as a benchmark for acquisition personnel training and development. All acquisition support personnel will now have greater access to opportunities for promotion and growth, leading to a more efficient defense acquisition workforce. Congress will assess if the Department of Defense has met the requirements outlined in legislation for innovative changes in the acquisition process. The DOD's acquisition organizations are being examined for potential overlap and duplication of processes. Congress will determine if changes have been made and if the acquisition workforce has been adjusted accordingly. Various reports have been submitted to Congress regarding workforce reductions and the movement towards a new workforce vision. The Department of Defense is mandated to reduce the defense acquisition workforce by 25,000 personnel positions by October 1, 1998, compared to the previous year. This reduction is part of the efforts to streamline and optimize the acquisition organizations within the DOD. The Department of Defense is required to decrease the defense acquisition workforce by 25,000 personnel positions by October 1, 1998. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to specify a lower number, not less than 10,000, if it is deemed necessary for cost-effective management and military readiness. The term 'defense acquisition personnel' refers to military and civilian personnel excluding those at maintenance depots. The Secretary of Defense must report on reductions in the defense acquisition workforce since fiscal year 1989, detailing specific job title, classification, or position eliminations. This includes reductions made pursuant to law and those carried out as a result of base closures. The Secretary of Defense must report on reductions in the defense acquisition workforce since fiscal year 1989, detailing job title eliminations. A plan to streamline acquisition organizations, workforce, and infrastructure must be submitted by April 1, 1998, including legislative change requests for implementation. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on reductions in the defense acquisition workforce since fiscal year 1989 and submit a plan to streamline acquisition organizations, workforce, and infrastructure by April 1, 1998. This includes consulting with key officials and conducting a review of acquisition organizations and functions to identify opportunities for improvement. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to report on reductions in the defense acquisition workforce and submit a plan to streamline acquisition organizations by consulting with key officials and reviewing areas of overlap and redundancy. This includes exploring opportunities to enhance the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, consolidate acquisition organizations, improve industry oversight, shorten procurement cycles, and optimize organizational arrangements for future acquisition needs. Additionally, the adequacy of the Program, Plans, and Budgeting System in meeting acquisition requirements and the impact of technology on management are also key considerations. The Secretary of Defense is required to achieve reductions in the defense acquisition workforce by fiscal year 1999. This involves consulting with officials to streamline acquisition organizations, enhance oversight, and optimize arrangements for future needs. The impact of technology on management and the adequacy of the Program, Plans, and Budgeting System are also important considerations. The Secretary of Defense must reduce the defense acquisition workforce by fiscal year 1999. The applicable number for this reduction is 25,000, but the Secretary can specify a lower number, not less than 12,500, if it is deemed necessary for cost-effective management and military readiness. Certification to Congress by May 1, 1999, is required for any deviation from the initial number. The Secretary must provide a detailed report explaining the rationale behind the reduction and how it will be allocated among defense acquisition and support positions. The Secretary of Defense must reduce the defense acquisition workforce by fiscal year 1999, with a target reduction of 25,000 personnel. The reduction can be lower, but not less than 12,500, if necessary for cost-effective management and military readiness. The Secretary must provide a detailed report on the rationale and allocation of reductions among defense acquisition and support positions, with delegation authority limited to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. The Department of Defense aims to reduce the defense acquisition workforce by fiscal year 1999, with a target reduction of 25,000 personnel. This includes individuals assigned to acquisition organizations and other organizations with acquisition missions. There are seven acquisition functions, 12 career fields, and 14 position categories in the DoD Acquisition Education, Training, and Career Development Program. Oversight and Education, Training, and Career Development do not have separate education, training, and experience standards specified in DoD 5000.52-M. Personnel in these positions come from other career fields and must meet those career development requirements. One position category, Education, Training, and Career Development, does not belong in any of the seven functions and may belong in either an acquisition or non-acquisition function. The curr_chunk lists various organizations within the Department of Defense, including the Navy Strategic Systems Program Office, Air Force Materiel Command, and U.S. Special Operations Command, Acquisition Center."
