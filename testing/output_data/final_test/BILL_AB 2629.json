    "title": "AB 2629",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore are paid under a dual compensation structure to avoid overtime liability. Fees for transcripts have not been adjusted in 26 years. The fees for transcripts prepared by official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore need to be revised to ensure fair compensation and attract skilled professionals. The amendment to Section 69950 of the Government Code sets the fee for transcription at ninety-three cents ($0.93) for each 100 words from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, inclusive. The fee for transcription from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, is twenty-one cents ($0.21) for each 100 words for a first copy, and sixteen cents ($0.16) for each additional copy purchased at the same time. Trial courts with established transcription fees as of January 1, 2012, based on word estimates, will maintain those fees. This section is effective until January 1, 2019, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. From January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020, the fee for transcription of the original printed copy is $1.03 for each 100 words. For each additional copy purchased at the same time, the fee is $0.18 for each 100 words. If a copy is purchased separately, the fee is $0.23 for each 100 words, with additional copies at $0.18 for each 100 words. Section 69950 of the Government Code establishes transcription fees for trial courts based on 2012 rates until January 1, 2019. The policy for determining fees cannot be unilaterally changed. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. On January 1, 2021, transcription fees for trial courts will be $1.13 for every 100 words for the original copy, and $0.20 for each additional copy purchased simultaneously. For those not purchasing the original, the fee is $0.26 for the first copy and $0.20 for each additional copy. On January 1, 2021, transcription fees for trial courts will be set at $1.13 for every 100 words for the original copy, with additional fees for extra copies. Additionally, existing transcription fees established before January 1, 2012, based on word or folio estimates, will remain unchanged, and any changes must not be made unilaterally. On January 1, 2021, the Judicial Council will report recommendations to increase uniformity in transcript rate expenditures in California to the Legislature. The report aims to maintain reporter pay and collective bargaining agreements. Collaboration with key stakeholders is required. This section is effective until January 1, 2025, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 69951 of the Government Code is also amended. Section 69951 of the Government Code is amended to increase the fee for transcription by 50 percent for special daily copy service."
