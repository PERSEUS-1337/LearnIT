    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" and extends the publicly traded partnership ownership structure to energy power generation projects, transportation fuels, and related energy activities. The \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include income and gains derived from minerals, natural resources, renewable energy, and electric power generation exclusively utilizing certain resources. The curr_chunk describes the acceptance or processing of energy resources, including electricity storage devices and combined heat and power generation. The curr_chunk discusses the generation, storage, or distribution of thermal energy utilizing renewable resources or waste heat to power. The curr_chunk focuses on renewable fuel infrastructure and renewable fuels, including production, storage, and transportation of renewable fuels described in specific sections of the Clean Air Act and Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The curr_chunk discusses various incentives for renewable chemicals, energy-efficient buildings, and gasification with sequestration under specific sections of the Clean Air Act and Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for projects to sequester at least 75 percent of qualified carbon dioxide in secure geological storage for power generation facilities under specific sections of the Clean Air Act and Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for power generation facilities to capture and dispose of at least 50 percent of qualified carbon dioxide in secure geological storage under specific sections of the Clean Air Act and Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The curr_chunk specifies that power generation facilities placed in service before January 9, 2013, must capture and dispose of 30 percent or more of qualified carbon dioxide in secure geological storage. The curr_chunk discusses the sale of goods or services from qualified facilities that dispose of captured carbon dioxide in secure geological storage. It also mentions an amendment related to renewable chemicals in the tax code. The curr_chunk introduces a new paragraph defining \"qualifying renewable chemical\" as a product produced in the US or its territories from renewable biomass through biological or thermal conversion with a biobased content of 95%. The qualifying renewable chemical must have a biobased content of 95% or higher, be used for chemical production or as chemicals/plastics, not for food/feed/fuel, and include specific substances like acetic acid and algae oils. The curr_chunk lists various renewable chemicals such as algae sugars, aromatics, butanediol, carboxylic acids, cellulosic sugar, ethyl acetate, farnesene, glucaric acid, isoprene, ketals, olefins, polyols, propanediol, succinic acid, and terpenes. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of biobased content percentage for renewable chemicals and the requirement to test representative samples using ASTM D6866. It also mentions the deadline for listing other qualifying renewable chemicals. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to consider applications for listing chemicals under a specific section. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of enactment, in taxable years ending after that date."
