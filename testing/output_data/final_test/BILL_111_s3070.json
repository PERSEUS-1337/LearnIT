The Florida National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2010 releases deed restrictions on lands in Florida acquired under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, allowing for better management of State forests and alleviating future Federal responsibilities. The Florida National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2010 releases Federal responsibilities by conveying lands to the State of Florida, subject to certain terms and conditions. The Florida National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2010 authorizes the Secretary to convey lands to the State of Florida at reasonable costs, excluding administrative overhead. The State must use proceeds from property sales for acquiring lands within or adjacent to state forest and park systems, address boundary encroachments, and indemnify the United States. The Florida National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2010 authorizes the Secretary to convey lands to the State of Florida at reasonable costs. The State must use proceeds from property sales for acquiring lands within or adjacent to state forest and park systems, address boundary encroachments, and indemnify the United States for any boundary disputes related to released parcels. The Florida National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2010 allows the Secretary to transfer lands between the National Forest System and the State of Florida. The Congress finds that there are intermingled Federal and State lands in Florida of comparable quantity and quality, and interchanging these lands would facilitate more efficient public land management. \"Approximately equal value\" is defined as a comparative estimate of the value between lands to be interchanged. The State of Florida is authorized to offer to convey lands to the United States. The State of Florida offers to convey designated State lands for interchange to the United States, subject to approval by the Secretary of Agriculture. In return, the Secretary will convey National Forest System lands in the Ocala and Apalachicola National Forests designated for interchange. Maps of the designated lands will be available for public inspection for at least five years. Any land interchange will be subject to terms and conditions. Terms and Conditions: Land interchanges under this section must be mutually acceptable to the Secretary and the authorized officer of the State. Replacement Land: If designated lands are found unsuitable for interchange due to various reasons, substitutions or modifications can be made as long as the lands are of comparable quality and value. SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL LAND DISPOSAL UNDER FLORIDA NATIONAL FOREST LAND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2003. The Secretary of Agriculture may convey a 114-acre parcel of land in Leon County, Florida, for sale or exchange. Proceeds from the sale will be used to acquire land for the Apalachicola National Forest and cover disposal costs. The Secretary may use proceeds from the sale of certain tracts to acquire administrative improvements for National Forest units in Florida."
