    "content": "The Act titled \"Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act of 2005\" is abbreviated as such. Congress finds that coastal and ocean observations are crucial for protecting lives and property, enhancing national security, predicting weather and climate change, improving ocean health, and ensuring the sustainable use of coastal resources. Immediate action is needed to strengthen observation and communication systems to warn coastal residents of tsunamis, hurricanes, and other marine hazards. The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States is at risk. The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States is vital to the nation's economy, supporting jobs for over 200,000 Americans and handling billions in waterborne commerce. Safeguarding homeland security, responding to coastal hazards, and managing fisheries require improved monitoring of the nation's waters and coastline. The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national commitment to a sustained and integrated coastal and ocean observing system to assist in understanding the oceans. The purposes of this Act are to assist the Nation and the world in understanding the oceans and the global climate system, enhancing homeland security, improving weather and climate forecasts, strengthening management of coastal and ocean resources, improving the safety and efficiency of maritime operations, and mitigating marine hazards. In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in affirming the importance of global observations for decision-making and called for cooperation in establishing a Global Earth Observation System of Systems. The Act aims to develop and maintain an integrated coastal and ocean observing system for national security, economic development, marine ecosystem sustainability, scientific advancements, and education. It also focuses on research, education programs, and data management to maximize the benefits of the system. The Act aims to establish a system of regional coastal and ocean observing systems to address local needs for ocean information. The Act aims to establish a system of regional coastal and ocean observing systems to address local needs for ocean information. Section 3 defines key terms. The Act defines key terms related to ocean policy, including the Committee, Council, observing system, National Oceanographic Partnership Program, and interagency program office. SEC. 4. INTEGRATED COASTAL AND OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM. The Committee, through the Council, will establish an integrated system for coastal and ocean observations, data management, analysis, modeling, research, and education. This system aims to detect and predict changes impacting the Nation's social, economic, and ecological systems, including improving coastal and ocean health, protecting lives and livelihoods from hazards, and supporting national defense and homeland security efforts. The curr_chunk focuses on supporting national defense, understanding human activities and natural variability on coasts and oceans, measuring environmental changes, providing for sustainable use of resources, educating the public about oceans, tracking climate change, and supplying information to marine-related businesses. The curr_chunk discusses the elements of a national observing system for coastal and ocean resources, including a national program and regional associations to collect and disseminate data. The curr_chunk outlines the components of a national observing system for coastal and ocean resources, including data management, research and development, outreach programs, and Council functions. The Council oversees the design and implementation of the observing system, adopts plans and standards, coordinates with other observing activities, administers research and development programs, and establishes pilot projects for technology development. The Council oversees the development of the observing system, supports institutional mechanisms, provides representation at international meetings, and coordinates Federal activities with other nations. An interagency program office named \"Oceanus\" is established to carry out these responsibilities. The interagency program office, known as \"Oceanus,\" is responsible for planning and coordinating the observing system. It prepares annual and long-term plans for the design and implementation of the system, promotes collaboration among Federal agencies and regional associations, and coordinates agency priorities and budgets for implementation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the lead agency for implementing and operating the observing system. It is responsible for establishing standards, protocols, and quality standards for data management and communications. Additionally, it oversees the certification and periodic review of regional associations and establishes an external technical committee for system review. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's administrator is responsible for coordinating the observing system, allocating funds, implementing technological advances, integrating programs, and certifying regional associations that meet requirements. Regional Associations of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems are also addressed. Regional associations are responsible for developing and operating coastal and ocean observing systems to meet user needs in the region while following national standards. They must have an organizational structure, strategic plan, provide information products, and collaborate with governmental entities for timely warnings. The regional coastal and ocean observing system must meet certification standards developed by the interagency program office in conjunction with regional associations and approved by the Council. Any system designated as part of a certified regional association will be deemed part of the National system for liability purposes. For liability purposes, any employee of the regional coastal and ocean observing system, while carrying out the purposes of this Act, will be considered a Government employee as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. SEC. 5. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION. The Council will establish programs for research and education on the coastal and ocean observing system, including basic and focused research projects, large-scale computing resources, and public education efforts. The Council will establish programs for research and education on the coastal and ocean observing system, including ongoing activities like the National Sea Grant College Program and the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence program. The Council authorizes interagency financing for administrative and programmatic projects under the Act and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. Funds can be shared, transferred, and expended among departments and agencies for the coastal and ocean observing system. Authorization of appropriations is also granted. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of Commerce for the implementation of an integrated coastal and ocean observing system and research program. Sums are allocated for fiscal years 2006 through 2010, with at least 50 percent going to regional associations. Reporting requirements are also specified. The President must submit a report to Congress by March 31, 2010, detailing the activities, effectiveness, and recommendations for reauthorization and funding levels of programs established under sections 4 and 5."
