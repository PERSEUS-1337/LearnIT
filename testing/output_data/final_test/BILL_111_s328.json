    "content": "The \"DTV Delay Act\" postpones the DTV transition date. The DTV Delay Act amends various sections of the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005, extending deadlines for the transition to June 13, 2009, and the coupon program to July 31, 2009. Conforming amendments adjust dates in related legislation. The DTV Delay Act extends license terms for recovered spectrum by 116 days, amending the Communications Act of 1934 to update dates to June 12, 2009. SEC. 3. Modification of Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Program. Amends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act to allow replacement coupons for expired ones. Conforming amendment updates language regarding coupon redemption. SEC. 4. Implementation. Permissive early termination allows television broadcast stations to switch to digital broadcasting before the mandated date, as long as it follows FCC requirements. The FCC permits the use of cleared spectrum for public safety radio services if a television broadcast station stops analog broadcasting before June 12, 2009, and the spectrum becomes available for non-television broadcast use. The FCC allows the use of cleared spectrum for public safety radio services if it does not interfere with television stations. The Commission can expedite the process for public safety agencies to begin using the spectrum within two weeks of application. The FCC and NTIA must adopt or revise rules within 30 days to implement the provisions of the Act and its amendments. SEC. 5 extends the Commission auction authority to 2012. SEC. 6 designates funds under the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 as emergency requirements. The bill, S. 328, was passed by the Senate on January 26, 2009. The act aims to delay the DTV transition date."
