    "content": "The federal government provides homeownership incentives based on the belief that high homeownership rates benefit society. Critics question whether homeownership causes positive behaviors or is just correlated with them. Some argue that homeownership can limit mobility and place financial risks on homeowners. Critics also debate the government's role in intervening in housing markets. The federal government supports homeownership through programs that insure, guarantee, or provide mortgages to eligible homebuyers, reducing lender's losses and increasing capital for mortgage lending. The federal government supports homeownership through programs that insure, guarantee, or provide mortgages to eligible homebuyers. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA are federal programs that provide guarantees to lenders or investors on certain types of mortgages, with varying maximum mortgage amounts eligible under each program. The Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service (RHS) offers two mortgage programs with income and home value limits. The federal mortgage guarantee programs have different missions and target populations. The programs have limits on the dollar amount of eligible mortgages. Other restrictions and eligibility criteria exist but are not covered in this report. The conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is adjusted annually based on the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house price index. Different limits apply for one-unit structures, high-cost areas, and structures with two, three, and four units. Limits in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are 150% of the baseline limit. The baseline limit increases yearly based on the HPI, with high-cost area limits recalculated accordingly. FHFA publishes these limits in advance. The 2017 conforming loan limits were the first increase since 2006, with specific limits for high-cost areas. FHA insures eligible mortgages against borrower default, encouraging lenders to offer mortgages to first-time, low- and moderate-income homebuyers. To be eligible for FHA insurance, a mortgage must not exceed a specified maximum loan amount. To be eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, the maximum loan amount is set at 115% of the area median house price, with a national floor and ceiling based on the conforming loan limit. The floor is 65% of the conforming loan limit, while the ceiling is 150% of the conforming loan limit. FHA can insure mortgages up to the floor amount in areas where 115% of the median house price is below the floor, and only mortgages up to the ceiling amount in areas where it exceeds the ceiling. The FHA loan limits for 2017 were announced in December 2016, with higher limits in many areas compared to the previous year. The nationwide floor is set at $275,665 for a one-unit property, while the ceiling is set at $636,150. FHA loan limits are determined based on local house price data and conforming loan limits, with adjustments for different unit structures. The FHA loan limits for 2017 were announced with higher limits in many areas compared to the previous year. In lower-cost areas, the conforming loan limit will be higher than the FHA-insured mortgage limit. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase mortgages up to $424,100 in these areas. The VA loan guaranty program assists eligible veterans by guaranteeing mortgages made by private lenders, often without a down payment requirement. The VA loan guaranty is available for home purchase, construction, and refinancing. The VA limits its guaranty based on loan amounts, ranging from 25% to 50% for loans at or below $144,000. For loans exceeding this amount, a maximum guaranty amount is set, tied to conforming loan limits. If a loan exceeds this maximum amount, a veteran may need to make a down payment equal to 25% of the excess amount to qualify. The VA sets guaranty limits based on loan amounts, with down payment requirements for loans exceeding the maximum amount tied to conforming loan limits. The USDA's Rural Housing Service administers housing loan and grant programs with income limits for eligible borrowers. The USDA's Section 502 direct loan program provides loans to low- and very-low-income applicants for safe and affordable housing in eligible rural areas. The maximum loan amount is based on the applicant's income and repayment ability, with no statutorily mandated mortgage limits. Borrowers must be creditworthy, but generally do not need to make a down payment. Loan amounts are determined by the cost to construct a modest home in the county and vary more than FHA and conforming loan limits. Fixed interest rates are offered, with modifications by payment subsidies. The Section 502 direct loan program by USDA provides loans to low- and very-low-income applicants for housing in rural areas. Payment subsidies can lower interest rates, and borrower income must not exceed 115% of the national median income. USDA-approved lenders offer loans with a 90% guarantee for adequate, modest, safe housing. Loan limits are based on affordability, and applicants can build, rehabilitate, or relocate a dwelling in eligible rural areas. The VA, FHA, GSEs, and USDA mortgage programs aim to make homeownership more affordable by addressing different market imperfections. The VA program was initially for WWII veterans but now includes more recent service members. FHA, GSEs, and USDA programs were created to address various market issues. The FHA, GSEs, and USDA programs were established during the Great Depression to stimulate the mortgage market and housing. Government support made the mortgage market more national, but interstate banking restrictions persisted until 1994. These programs aim to increase liquidity in the mortgage market and support middle-class homeownership and affordable housing. The FHA, GSEs, and USDA programs support middle-class homeownership and affordable housing. The USDA programs focus on financing rural housing, which can be riskier for lenders due to difficulty in finding comparable home sales. USDA programs aim to either assume or reduce this risk for lenders. USDA's rural development program supports essential rural services like housing, economic development, and health care. Loan limits vary by region to address equity concerns and benefit homebuyers with lower interest rates. The geographic distribution of federal mortgage guarantee programs is uneven, with high-cost areas like New York, San Francisco, and Miami potentially being less able to benefit. Variations in house prices across neighborhoods also impact program accessibility. Government programs control costs by limiting availability, risks, and operating efficiently through underwriting mortgages to reduce the risk of loss. The FHA, conforming loan limits, and VA aim to reduce mortgage default risk by limiting guaranteed mortgage sizes. Borrowers pay fees for participation, covering some costs, but Congress appropriates administrative expenses. The government faces risks of programs' fees not covering costs, leading to potential transfers from Congress. FHA, VA, and USDA programs may require additional funds due to insufficient reserves. GSEs have implicit federal guarantees, with Treasury providing $187 billion in support since 2008. The federal government has provided $187 billion in support to FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Some policymakers believe the government is too involved in the mortgage market and want to reduce its role while increasing private capital. Reducing federal government's role in mortgage market by lowering loan limits for some programs could decrease financial risks but limit credit availability for borrowers."
