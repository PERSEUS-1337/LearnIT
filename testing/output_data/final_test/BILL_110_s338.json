The Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital Improvement Act of 2007 recognizes the valuable role of long-term care hospitals in providing care to medically complex patients. Additional certification criteria for LTCHs aim to ensure appropriate patient placement, and quality of care reporting is essential for all Medicare providers, including LTCHs. The Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital Improvement Act of 2007 aims to align quality initiatives for LTCHs with short-term acute care hospitals in the Medicare program. The Act calls for annual updates, reweighting of LTCDRGs, and wage adjustments to promote payment stability. It also prohibits one-time budget neutrality adjustments and extending the 25-percent limitation. The Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital Improvement Act of 2007 aims to align quality initiatives for LTCHs with short-term acute care hospitals in the Medicare program. It prohibits extending the 25-percent limitation on reimbursement of co-located hospital patient admissions to freestanding LTCHs. LTCHs co-located in underserved areas should have greater relief from the 50 percent limitation on reimbursement of co-located hospital patient admissions. The Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital Improvement Act of 2007 aims to define a Long-Term Care Hospital with specific facility and patient criteria under the Social Security Act. The term 'long-term care hospital' is defined as an institution primarily providing diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitation services to medically complex inpatients with long hospital stays. It must have an average inpatient length of stay exceeding 25 days and meet specific facility criteria outlined in the Social Security Act. The long-term care hospital must have a patient review process documented in the medical record, apply a standard patient screening tool to measure severity of illness, and assess discharge options when patients no longer meet continued stay criteria. The long-term care hospital must measure severity of illness and service requirements for patients to determine medical necessity, with active physician involvement, daily progress review, and an interdisciplinary team in place. The long-term care hospital must have interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals to create individualized treatment plans for patients and maintain adequate staffing levels to provide intensive care for medically complex cases. The hospital must also meet patient criteria for patient mix and severity appropriate for long-term care hospitals. To be eligible for prospective payment as a long-term care hospital, a majority of discharged patients must be medically complex with high severity of illness and specific medical conditions determined by the Secretary. The Secretary shall determine a list of medical conditions associated with high severity of illness for patients appropriate for treatment in long-term care hospitals, including circulatory, digestive, endocrine, metabolic, infectious, neurological, renal, respiratory, skin conditions, and other medically complex conditions. The Secretary will establish regulations through a negotiated rulemaking process for LTCH facility and patient criteria. The amendments will be effective for discharges on or after October 1, 2007. LTCH Quality Improvement Initiative. The Secretary will conduct a study to establish quality measures for Medicare beneficiaries in LTCHs and choose 3 measures to be reported. LTCHs must collect and submit data on these measures to the Secretary. The Secretary may expand the number of quality indicators required for LTCHs to report, with consensus among affected parties. The Secretary can replace measures if all hospitals are compliant or if measures do not reflect best clinical practice. Procedures will be established for making quality data submitted under this section available to the public. SEC. 5. Conforming LTCH PPS updates to the inpatient PPS. Annual updates of base rates, wage indices, and reweighting of LTCDRGs are required under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. This update includes adjustments to payment rates, wage indices, and classification of diagnosis-related groups in a budget-neutral manner. The Secretary shall annually update and reweight the LTCDRGs or an alternative patient classification system in a budget neutral manner, consistent with the updates applied under the Social Security Act. Wage levels for LTCHs will also be updated annually in a budget neutral manner. The Secretary will update wage levels for LTCHs annually in a budget neutral manner, consistent with the Social Security Act. There will be no one-time budget neutrality adjustment for LTCH prospective payment system rates during the transition period. The 25 percent patient threshold payment adjustment will not apply to freestanding LTCHs. The Secretary will update wage levels for LTCHs annually in a budget neutral manner, without a one-time budget neutrality adjustment for LTCH prospective payment system rates during the transition period. The 25 percent patient threshold payment adjustment will not apply to freestanding LTCHs under section 412.534 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations. SEC. 6. Relief for certain long-term care hospitals and satellite facilities co-located with other hospitals. The Secretary allows up to 75 percent of discharged Medicare patients from urban single, MSA dominant, and rural hospitals to be admitted without adjustment to the hospital's LTCH prospective payment system payment. Applicable Long-Term Care Hospital is defined as a long-term care hospital meeting specific criteria outlined in federal regulations. This includes both standalone long-term care hospitals and satellite facilities."
