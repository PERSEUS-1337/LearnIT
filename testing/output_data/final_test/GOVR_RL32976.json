    "content": "Funding authorization for the Victims of Child Abuse Act programs expired in FY2005, but Congress provided FY2006 funding with a 1.28% reduction due to budget constraints. The report discusses the impact of a 1.28% reduction in funding for Children's Advocacy Centers and Court Appointed Special Advocates programs. Despite the President's request for reduced funding, Congress allocated $14.8 million for Children's Advocacy Centers in FY2006, with $12.6 million for the centers and $2.2 million for training and assistance. The Administration requested $11.679 million for FY2007. The House, Senate, and President proposed similar funding levels for the Court Appointed Special Advocates program in FY2006, with an estimated final funding level of $11.745 million. The Training for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners program saw a decrease in funding for FY2006 to $2.258 million, with a proposed budget of $2.263 million for FY2007. The budget request for the Children's Advocacy Centers program is $2.263 million. Legislation to reauthorize grants for this program has not been introduced in the 109th Congress, but the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act includes an authorization of $7.5 million for specialized technical assistance and training programs. The Victims of Child Abuse Act also provided an authorization of $5 million for grants to national organizations for improving the quality of criminal prosecution in child abuse cases. P.L. 109-162 authorizes training and technical assistance funding for FY2006-FY2010 in addition to other funding for Victims of Child Abuse Act, specifically for grants to APRI. Congress has historically granted funds to APRI, but the funds have not been exclusively for that organization. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to ensure funds go to APRI. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-162) approved funding for the National Center for the Prosecution of Child Abuse and the National Child Protection Training Center at Winona State University. The act also reauthorized funding for the Court Appointed Special Advocates program for FY2007-FY2011. The funding for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program was reauthorized under P.L. 109-162, maintaining the funding level at $12 million for five years starting in FY2007. The legislation also allows funds to be used for initiating, sustaining, and expanding CASA programs, and authorizes state and local programs to request criminal background checks for volunteers from the FBI. Programs making such requests must cover the associated costs. P.L. 109-162 reauthorized funding for the CASA program at $12 million for five years starting in FY2007. The legislation allows funds to be used for CASA programs and authorizes criminal background checks for volunteers, with costs covered by the programs. Additionally, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice is required to prepare a report on the CASA program's activities and outcomes, and funds provided under this authority cannot be used for lobbying. No legislation has been introduced for grants to provide Training for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners during the 109th Congress. The Victims of Child Abuse Act committees have jurisdiction over programs like CASA and the Training Program for Judicial Personnel. Reauthorizations for these programs have been included in legislation like the Violence Against Women Act. The 2005 VAWA reauthorization extends CASA funding but not for the judicial training program. Children's Advocacy Centers reauthorization is not included in VAWA reauthorizations, but training funds for the centers are (FY2006-FY2010). Past reauthorizations for Children's Advocacy Centers have been separate. The 1992 amendments to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act authorized Children's Advocacy Centers and related training programs. The program's funding authorization expired from FY2001 to FY2003 but continued to receive funding. In 2003, funding was reauthorized for FY2004 and FY2005 through the PROTECT Act. Children's Advocacy Centers, authorized under the Victims of Child Abuse Act, coordinate a multi-disciplinary response to child abuse to ensure victims receive necessary support services. The Department of Justice funds the National Children's Alliance to develop local advocacy centers. The National Children's Alliance provides funding for local children's advocacy centers, along with four federally supported regional centers. Funding is authorized under the Victims of Child Abuse Act and is administered by the Department of Justice in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services. In FY2005, $15 million was authorized for the centers, with approximately $12.5 million appropriated. In FY2005, $15 million was authorized for local children's advocacy centers under the Victims of Child Abuse Act. Congress appropriated an estimated $12.6 million for these centers. Additionally, funding for specialized technical assistance and training programs for attorneys involved in child abuse cases was authorized at $5 million, with Congress allocating about half that amount. Despite no authorization for FY2006, Congress allocated an estimated $2.2 million for this purpose. The American Prosecutors Research Institute's National Center for the Prosecution of Child Abuse has received funding under this grant authority since FY1992. The Prosecution of Child Abuse has received funding under grant authority for publication services, training, and technical assistance. Funding has also been directed to other organizations like the National Children's Alliance and the National Children's Advocacy Center. Federal funding for these purposes has increased from $1.5 million in FY1992 to an estimated $14.8 million in FY2006. Federal funding for the Prosecution of Child Abuse and related organizations has increased significantly from $1.5 million in FY1992 to an estimated $14.8 million in FY2006. Funding history for Children's Advocacy Centers and training/technical assistance shows appropriations with certain reductions in FY2003-FY2006. In FY1991, P.L. 101-647 authorized $20 million for child abuse programs, with a requirement for 90% to be used for multi-disciplinary programs. However, funding in FY1992 and FY1993 did not meet this requirement. In FY2003, P.L. 108-7 reduced funding by 0.65%, resulting in $10.9 million allocated. In FY2004, P.L. 108-199 further reduced funding by 0.59%, bringing total program funding down. In FY2004, program funding was reduced by 0.465% on Justice programs, totaling $12.9 million. The omnibus funding bill for FY2005 included an across-the-board reduction of 0.80% and an additional 0.54% reduction on Commerce-State-Justice programs, bringing total funding to $14.8 million. In FY2006, discretionary funding for Justice programs was reduced by 0.28%, resulting in an estimated $14.8 million appropriation. This funding authorization is provided in freestanding law. Federal funding for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) was increased to $14.8 million in FY2006. CASAs are volunteers who provide representation for children in foster care or at risk of placement in foster care. The National CASA Association, founded in 1982, supports CASA programs nationwide. The 1990 Victims of Child Abuse Act authorized funds for CASA programs to ensure representation for children in dependency proceedings. Over 950 CASA programs exist in 49 states, serving almost 200,000 children in FY2005. Approximately 89,700 children were served by federally supported centers with 15,600 volunteers recruited. Federal funding for CASA programs has grown significantly, from half a million dollars in 1989 to nearly $12 million in FY2006. The National CASA Association awards funds to support new local program development, state organizations, urban demonstrations, and diversity initiatives. Funding reductions have been applied in some legislation. The legislation appropriated funds for the CASA program from FY2003 to FY2006, with reductions due to across-the-board funding cuts. Funding data is based on appropriations acts, with additional transfers between programs not included. Source: Congressional Research Service. Funding for CASA has increased significantly since 1989. The Victims of Child Abuse Act authorized funding for CASA starting in FY1991, with appropriations from the Crime Victims Fund. Funding for CASA faced reductions in FY2003 and FY2004 due to across-the-board cuts. The omnibus funding bill for FY2004 to FY2006 included reductions in funding for CASA due to across-the-board cuts, bringing the actual appropriations down to $11.629 million in FY2004, $11.738 million in FY2005, and an estimated $11.745 million in FY2006. An increase in abuse and neglect cases linked to drug-related maltreatment of children has led to new requirements for juvenile and family courts under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 mandates the Department of Justice's OJJDP to provide enhanced technical assistance and training to improve the handling of child abuse and neglect cases by the judicial system. Funding for grants under this act has not been separately allocated to state courts. Funding under the Authorization and Appropriations Act is awarded to the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges for grants to state courts. The National Council provides technical assistance and training programs to improve handling of child abuse and neglect cases nationwide. Funding reductions were applied in legislation for FY2003 to FY2006, not reflected in the funding history table. The funding for training programs for judicial practitioners and personnel authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act is detailed in Table 3. Funding reductions were not reflected in the table. The statute required a certain percentage of funding to be allocated to state courts, but all funds were designated for training and technical assistance in FY1991 through FY1994. Funding authorization levels were lowered starting in FY1996. The omnibus funding bills for FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005 included across-the-board funding reductions on discretionary accounts, with additional reductions on Commerce-State-Justice programs. These reductions were not reflected in the table. Additionally, P.L. 109-108 appropriated $2.287 million for the program, subject to a 0.28% across-the-board reduction. The Victims of Child Abuse Act funding was appropriated $2.287 million under P.L. 109-108, with a final estimated funding of $2.258 million after a 1% reduction. Programs within HHS, like the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), have similar purposes in preventing child abuse. CAPTA supports multi-disciplinary approaches to investigate child abuse, similar to Children's Advocacy Centers. The program provides formula grants to states to enhance child protective services, including the creation of multi-disciplinary teams for child abuse investigations. In FY2006, $27.0 million was appropriated for CAPTA state grants to improve child protective services, with a request for the same funding level in FY2007. Section 107 of CAPTA includes authorization for Children's Justice Act grants, formula grants to states for programs related to investigating and prosecuting child abuse cases. The Children's Justice Act grants provide funding for handling child maltreatment cases, including child sexual abuse and exploitation, child fatalities, and cases involving children with disabilities or serious health issues. State eligibility requires a multi-disciplinary task force to make recommendations for improving laws and protocols for child abuse cases. The grants are administered by HHS. The Children's Justice Act grants provide funding for handling child maltreatment cases, including child sexual abuse and exploitation, child fatalities, and cases involving children with disabilities or serious health issues. The grants are administered by HHS in consultation with the Department of Justice. Funding is provided through the Victimsof Crime Act of 1984, with an annual set-aside of up to $20 million. In recent years, $17 million has been allocated to states and $3 million to tribes. P.L. 109-162 allows the Department of Justice to set aside an additional 5% for tribes, reducing state grants to $16 million and making $4 million available to tribes. The Children's Justice Act grants provide funding for handling child maltreatment cases, including child sexual abuse and exploitation, child fatalities, and cases involving children with disabilities or serious health issues. P.L. 109-162 allows the Department of Justice to set aside an additional 5% for tribes, reducing state grants to $16 million and making $4 million available to tribes. Amendments to CAPTA in 1996 and 2003 specified the duties of a guardian ad litem for abused or neglected children in judicial proceedings, including receiving training appropriate to the role. P.L. 106-314 authorized an additional $5 million for FY2001 through FY2005 for the Department. The Act of 2000 authorized $5 million for the Department of Justice to expand CASA programs in urban and rural areas, provide training for volunteers, and improve court handling of child abuse cases. The Court Improvement Project, created in 1993, aims to enhance court effectiveness in handling child abuse and neglect cases. The Court Improvement Project (CIP) aims to assess and improve the handling of child welfare proceedings by courts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 added new court grants for training judicial personnel and ensuring timely action on children's safety and permanency needs. Funds for these grants are allocated from the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, with a total of $100 million appropriated for FY2006-FY2010. Eligible state highest courts can apply for one or all three CIP grants in FY2006. The Court Improvement Project (CIP) distributes funds to state highest courts for child welfare proceedings. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 enacted measures to enhance collaboration between courts and child welfare agencies. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 aimed to improve collaboration between courts and child welfare agencies by authorizing grant programs to enhance court efficiency in handling child abuse and neglect cases. This included funding for reducing backlogs and implementing computer data collection systems. The Department of Justice administered systems under SANCA with a $2 million appropriation in FY2002. Grants were awarded to courts in six states for automated case tracking. S. 1679 and H.R. 3758 focus on court/child welfare issues, proposing specific performance measures for courts. H.R. 3758 proposes specific performance measures for courts in foster care, including tracking court performance and conducting a study comparing states on various issues related to child welfare. The final report of the study would be due within one year of the legislation's enactment. S. 1679 proposes mandatory court and child welfare agency collaboration in future reviews, reserves 2% of funds for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, and requires the creation of a multi-disciplinary Commission on Child Welfare in each state. It also includes provisions for student loan forgiveness for attorneys working on child abuse and neglect cases. S. 1679, like S. 1431, requires state child welfare agencies to develop practice standards for child welfare attorneys. H.R. 3576 allows agencies to seek federal reimbursement for training costs for court staff and attorneys. The Victims of Child Abuse Act details these provisions, excluding amendments from the PROTECT Act. The PROTECT Act did not include amendments extending funding authorization for Children's Advocacy Centers and related training and technical assistance. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Court Act, and Court Improvement Project details are available on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Children's Bureau website. The compilation includes various acts such as the Victims of Child Abuse Act, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Act, and certain Social Security Act programs.
