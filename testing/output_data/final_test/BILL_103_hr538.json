    "content": "The \"Classroom Safety Act of 1993\" is the short title of this Act. The Congress finds that violence in elementary and secondary schools has increased dramatically in the past decade, with millions of youth affected by poverty and disenfranchisement. Nearly 3,000,000 crimes occur on or near school campuses annually, and 20 percent of teachers have reported being threatened with violence by students. Greater efforts are needed for counseling and training teachers in potentially hostile school environments to prevent violence. The Act aims to provide assistance to local educational agencies to prevent and reduce violent crime in schools nationwide. Schools are overwhelmed with responsibilities, leading to teachers having to referee fights instead of teaching. Teachers' unions are protesting the violence, which hinders students' learning opportunities. Financially devastated agencies need Federal funds to address the increased need for safety measures in schools. The Secretary of Education is authorized to make grants to local educational agencies affected by crime and violence. A model for classroom safety in English and Spanish will be developed and provided to agencies upon request. Grants under this Act will be used for various purposes including funding anticrime measures, developing education programs for crime prevention, counseling programs for victims, conflict resolution programs, purchasing crime prevention equipment, and reducing student participation in organized crime and drug-related activities in schools. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary with specific information. The application must include a request for funds, details about the schools and communities to be served, assurances that federal funds will supplement non-federal funds, and statistical information on crime. The application for a grant under this Act must include information on crime problems in schools, projects to be developed, available resources, gaps in the plan, how the grant will be used, crime prevention system, and educational materials in Spanish. SEC. 6. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS; LIMITATIONS ON GRANTS. The Secretary can use up to 5% of funds for administration. Grants can be renewed for 2 years if funds were used as required and if additional grant is needed for crime prevention program. SEC. 7. AWARD OF GRANTS. SEC. 7. AWARD OF GRANTS.
