    "content": "States have the power to tax residents on online purchases, even if the seller is located outside the state. However, there must be a sufficient nexus between the state and the out-of-state business for tax obligations to be imposed. This nexus is required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause. The dormant Commerce Clause requires a nexus to prevent burdening interstate commerce. Congress can allow state taxation that violates the dormant Commerce Clause but cannot change due process standards. The Supreme Court requires physical presence for the dormant Commerce Clause and purposeful contact for due process. This standard was established in National Bellas Hess v. Dept. of Revenue of Illinois in 1967. The Supreme Court established the physical presence requirement in the 1967 case National Bellas Hess v. Dept. of Revenue of Illinois for state taxation, grounded in both due process and Commerce Clause principles. The Court limited a state's authority to impose use tax collection obligations to when the seller had a physical presence in the state. By the late 1980s, it seemed physical presence might no longer be required for use tax obligations. The Supreme Court modified its analysis of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, no longer requiring physical presence for use tax obligations. Liability could be imposed based on intentional contact with a state. A flexible test was developed to assess tax burdens on interstate commerce. Technological advances may have reduced the complexity of collecting use taxes. In the 1992 case Quill v. North Dakota, the Supreme Court rejected the idea that physical presence was no longer required for use tax collection liability. The Court found that collecting the tax would burden interstate commerce and that due process no longer required physical presence, as long as the seller had directed sufficient action toward the state's residents. The Supreme Court in Quill v. North Dakota found that physical presence was not required for use tax collection liability as long as the seller had directed sufficient action toward the state's residents. Pre-Quill cases provide guidance on when a state may impose use tax collection obligations on out-of-state retailers, such as those with \"brick and mortar\" stores or offices in the state. The Supreme Court upheld the power of states to impose use tax collection liabilities on remote sellers with in-state offices generating significant revenue, even if not related to the company's main business. The Court rejected the argument that a nexus was required between the company, state, and sales activity, stating that in-state offices benefited from municipal services. Previous cases supported states imposing tax obligations on out-of-state retailers with local agents or salespeople. In Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, the Supreme Court upheld a state's ability to impose use tax collection liability on an out-of-state company with no physical presence in the state but had independent contractors soliciting business locally. The Court found that the continuous local solicitation by these contractors created a sufficient nexus between the company and the state, allowing for tax collection. The Supreme Court upheld a state's ability to impose use tax collection duties on a remote seller in Scripto, Inc. v. Carson. This case represented a significant legal development in state taxation of Internet sales, with states enacting laws like \"Amazon laws\" to capture uncollected use taxes. One approach is \"click-through nexus,\" where online retailers collect taxes based on referrals from associates or affiliates. State click-through nexus laws require online retailers to collect use taxes based on their associates or affiliates' physical presence. New York's law, for example, presumes that a retailer must collect use taxes if they have an agreement with a New York resident who refers customers to them for compensation. Courts have examined the constitutionality of these laws, such as New York's click-through nexus law and Colorado's notification law, with some challenges raised regarding due process and the dormant Commerce Clause. In a 2012 case, New York's highest court rejected facial constitutional challenges to the state's law. The court upheld the constitutionality of New York's click-through nexus law, which requires online retailers to collect use taxes based on referrals from in-state affiliates. The court found that the law met the standard of \"demonstrably more than a slightest presence\" and \"continuous and widespread solicitation of business within a State.\" The law was deemed constitutional under the Commerce Clause and due process. The court upheld New York's click-through nexus law, requiring online retailers to collect use taxes from in-state affiliates. The law was found constitutional under the Commerce Clause and due process, as it presumed affiliates would solicit in-state acquaintances to increase compensation. In contrast, a federal court struck down Colorado's notification law in 2012, which required retailers to inform customers about potential tax owed on purchases. The federal district court struck down Colorado's notification law in 2012, which required retailers to inform customers about potential tax owed on purchases. The court ruled that the law was unconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause due to insufficient nexus and discrimination against out-of-state vendors. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a case in August 2013 regarding tax collection and compliance, citing the federal Tax Injunction Act. The Supreme Court later ruled in March 2015 that the TIA does not apply to the suit, but raised concerns about the comity doctrine potentially barring the case. The Supreme Court unanimously instructed the Tenth Circuit to determine if the comity doctrine applies to a case involving state fiscal operations. Justice Kennedy raised the possibility of reconsidering the Quill decision due to technological advances and the Internet's development. Congress has the power to authorize state taxation without physical presence under its commerce regulation authority. Congress may allow state taxation without physical presence but cannot change the due process standard. Legislation like S. 698, the Marketplace Fairness Act, aims to authorize states to require remote vendors to collect sales taxes regardless of physical presence. States must meet certain requirements to impose this obligation on vendors with over $1,000,000 in U.S. remote sales. The Marketplace Fairness Act, S. 698, allows states to require remote vendors to collect sales taxes on U.S. remote sales over $1,000,000. States must meet specific requirements for tax administration and sourcing sales. SSUTA member states can enforce tax collection 180 days after notice, while non-SSUTA states source sales based on delivery location. H.R. 2775 (Remote Transactions Parity Act of 2015) authorizes SSUTA member states and qualifying non-member states to require remote sellers to collect sales taxes, with differences in audit limitations and small seller exceptions compared to S. 698. The small seller exception threshold under H.R. 2775 starts at $10 million in gross annual receipts, reducing to $5 million in subsequent years. The Wireless Telecommunications Tax and Fee Collection Fairness Act of 2015 (H.R. 1087) aims to restrict state sales and use taxation on wireless telecommunication services. It would prevent states from requiring collection or remittance of fees, taxes, or surcharges unless a financial transaction occurs between the parties involved. This legislation could impact entities using electronic marketplaces for sales, regardless of their size. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) imposes a moratorium on state and local governments imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce and taxes on Internet access. The moratorium has been extended several times, with the current resolution extending it until December 11, 2015. It only applies to taxes and not user fees. The definition of \"taxes\" includes the tax itself and the obligation for a seller to collect and remit sales or use tax. Certain government charges are excluded, such as franchise fees under the Communications Act of 1934. A \"multiple tax\" for electronic commerce is any tax on the same transaction subject to tax by another state without a credit for taxes paid elsewhere. It does not include sales or use tax on tangible personal property or services imposed by a state and political subdivision. The exemption's scope for tangible personal property is determined by state law. Sparse case law interprets \"multiple\" taxes for electronic commerce. A \"discriminatory tax\" treats electronic commerce differently than other types of commerce. This includes taxes imposed only on e-commerce, applied at different rates, or with different collection obligations. Discriminatory taxes also target Internet access or online service providers, taxing them at higher rates than similar providers. Taxes with nexus requirements for remote sellers are considered discriminatory. A remote seller's tax collection obligation may be influenced by the presence of their information on an out-of-state computer server. Discriminatory taxes in electronic commerce include those that target specific types of products or sellers, such as a state retail telecommunication excise tax. However, not all taxes on electronic commerce are considered discriminatory, as seen in a case involving a local privilege tax on businesses utilizing electronic machines for games of chance. The court ruled that a local privilege tax on businesses using electronic machines for games of chance was not discriminatory, as it applied to all cyber-gambling establishments regardless of whether they were internet-based. This decision was in line with previous rulings that taxes are not discriminatory if they are generally applicable and any differing treatment is business-related. The court upheld that different tax treatment was not discriminatory based on a company's business decisions. Courts also found that hotel occupancy taxes were not discriminatory, as they are based on the amount paid by the renter, regardless of whether it is through online travel companies or traditional agents. The moratorium prohibits states from taxing Internet access, regardless of the terminology used. Internet access can be taxed if charges are not separated from taxable telecommunications charges, unless they can be identified from the provider's records. \"Internet access\" includes services that enable users to connect to the Internet for content or services. The moratorium prohibits states from taxing Internet access, including services like email and instant messaging. It does not apply to taxes on Internet access that were imposed before October 1, 1998. Prior to October 1, 1998, for a tax to be authorized on Internet access services, a provider must have had a \"reasonable opportunity to know\" about the tax authority's interpretation or the tax must have been generally collected by a state or local government. One court ruled that simply having broad language in an ordinance was not enough to apply the tax to Internet access services; the city must specifically and publicly state that the tax applies. The grandfathering provision of the Internet Tax Freedom Act applies to Internet access in certain states, scheduled to expire on October 1, 2015. It only restricts state and local governments' taxing power, not the federal government's. The \"sense of Congress\" provision in the Internet Tax Freedom Act clarifies that no new Federal taxes similar to those on Internet access should be enacted during the moratorium. This language is not legally binding but can help interpret other provisions in the law. Some states have enacted \"click-through nexus statutes\" requiring retailers to collect use taxes if affiliates have a physical presence in the state. The Illinois Supreme Court struck down its state's click-through nexus law in 2013 as discriminatory. The Illinois Supreme Court overturned the state's click-through nexus law in 2013, deeming it discriminatory. The law applied to retailers who entered contracts with individuals in the state for commission-based sales referrals through internet links. The court found the law problematic as it only targeted online marketing arrangements, while similar arrangements in print and broadcast media were not covered. The state argued that other arrangements were addressed in a separate provision, but the court did not find this solution satisfactory. The Illinois Supreme Court overturned the state's click-through nexus law in 2013, deeming it discriminatory as it only targeted online marketing arrangements. The court found that the law was preempted by the ITFA moratorium on discriminatory taxes since it did not apply to national or international performance-based marketing. This case does not suggest that click-through nexus laws inherently violate the ITFA. The ITFA moratorium is set to expire on December 11, 2015, with bills introduced in Congress to make it permanent. H.R. 235 passed the House, aiming to allow states to tax Internet access. Other legislation related to the ITFA has been introduced in the 114th Congress. The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2015 (H.R. 1643 and S. 851) would create a moratorium similar to the ITFA, prohibiting multiple or discriminatory taxes on digital goods and services. Taxes on digital goods and services could only be imposed by the state or local jurisdiction where the customer resides."
