The \"Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000\" was enacted by Congress to preserve the historical significance of Governors Island, which played a crucial role in defending the United States during various conflicts, including the Battle of Long Island and the War of 1812. The excavation of the Lexington Avenue Subway in Manhattan increased Governors Island from 90 to 172 acres. It played a significant role in the Civil War, World War I, and World War II, serving the United States Army until 1966. In 1966, the Army relocated, and the United States Coast Guard took over, contributing to the Coast Guard's efforts on the Atlantic coast for 30 years. The Coast Guard ceased operations at Governors Island in 1997, leaving 225 buildings unoccupied and exposed to the elements. Castle Williams is named after Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, who built the fort. Fort Jay, named after John Jay, complements Fort Wood on nearby Bedloe Island. Castle Williams and Fort Jay, part of the Governors Island National Historic Landmark District, are crucial to US history and should be protected as a unit of the National Park System. The State of New York and the city of New York have agreed on a redevelopment plan for Governors Island. The Development Corporation offers the opportunity to ensure public access to Governors Island, preserve historic structures, involve local officials and organizations in redevelopment, and provide educational and recreational facilities.
