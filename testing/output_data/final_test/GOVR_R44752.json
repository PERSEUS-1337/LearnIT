    "content": "On February 28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed a resolution into law (P.L. 115-8) that overturned a final rule by the Social Security Administration regarding firearms restrictions for certain individuals. The resolution also prohibits the SSA from issuing a similar rule in the future without new statutory authorization. The NIAA mandates federal agencies to share records of persons prohibited from possessing firearms with the FBI for inclusion in the NICS. These records include findings of \"mental incompetency\" from processes administered by the VA and the SSA. Persons adjudicated as a mental defective are prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition. Congress has considered redefining \"mental incompetency\" for gun control purposes to only include involuntary commitments or findings by judicial authorities. The House passed a bill clarifying conditions for veterans and survivors receiving VA benefits to be treated as \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" The Gun Control Act of 1968 requires background checks for unlicensed persons buying firearms from licensed dealers. The FBI's NICS system allows for background checks before transferring firearms. Nine classes of persons are prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition. The Gun Control Act of 1968 requires background checks for unlicensed persons buying firearms from licensed dealers through the FBI's NICS system. Nine classes of persons are prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition, including those defined in the Controlled Substances Act, persons adjudicated as \"mental defective\" or committed to mental institutions, unauthorized immigrants, persons dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces, persons who have renounced their U.S. citizenship, persons under court-order restraints related to harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child, persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and persons under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. It is also illegal to sell or dispose of firearms or ammunition to these prohibited persons. The Brady Act requires background checks for firearm transfers to prohibited persons, including those adjudicated as \"mental defective.\" The ATF defined this term as someone deemed a danger to themselves or others due to mental illness or incompetence. The term \"committed to a mental institution\" refers to a formal court-ordered commitment of a person to a mental institution due to mental illness, defectiveness, or other reasons, excluding voluntary admissions for observation. The ATF's final rule includes definitions of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" to encompass individuals deemed \"mentally incompetent\" by the Veterans Benefits Administration. This aligns with the 1968 Gun Control Act's legislative history, following the Newtown, CT, mass shooting in December 2012. The ATF issued proposed regulations after the Newtown, CT mass shooting in 2012 to clarify individuals who might be prohibited from possessing firearms due to mental incompetence. The NICS index is not meant to be a registry of all mentally ill individuals. Congressional members have questioned the ATF's interpretation of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" following the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007. After the Virginia Tech mass shooting in 2007, the state law was revised to include both court-ordered inpatient and outpatient mental health care subjects in the NICS index. This change was prompted by the assailant's previous evaluation and outpatient treatment before the shooting. Congress later passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 in response to the tragedy. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 encourages states to provide records related to firearm disqualifications, including mental health adjudications and domestic violence convictions. The act allows the Attorney General to waive grant match requirements or reduce law enforcement grants based on state compliance. Some Members opposed the act due to concerns about veterans with PTSD being labeled as a danger to themselves. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 requires agencies to inform individuals diagnosed with mental incompetency that they may lose their gun rights. States and the VA have established disability relief programs under the act to restore gun rights if the individual overcomes their incapacities. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has awarded $94.9 million in NICS. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has awarded $94.9 million in NICS improvement grants to state, local, and tribal governments. As of December 31, 2016, there were 4,658,573 active prohibiting records related to mental incompetency in the NICS index, with state and local authorities contributing 96.3% of those records. Federal agencies, including the VA, had contributed 171,083 records to the NICS index by the end of 2016. The SSA final rule established a program similar to the VA's for submitting disqualifying records to the FBI for inclusion in NICS. NIAA (P.L. 110-180) strengthens the Attorney General's authority to obtain information on individuals prohibited from possessing firearms. Departments and agencies are required to provide this information quarterly. The NIAA requires departments and agencies to submit disqualifying records to the Attorney General quarterly for inclusion in NICS. The Attorney General must update, correct, and remove records as needed, and submit an annual compliance report to Congress. Additionally, the Attorney General is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and confidentiality of information in NICS, removing obsolete and erroneous names, and working with states to develop electronic notification systems for court order changes. The NIAA requires departments and agencies to notify the Attorney General of court order changes or mental health adjudications. It prohibits sharing mental health records if certain conditions are met. The NIAA requires government agencies to establish a process for individuals to apply for relief from mental health-related firearm possession disabilities within 365 days. Failure to resolve an application triggers de novo judicial review. The NIAA requires federal agencies to provide notice to individuals adjudicated as mentally defective about the prohibition on firearm possession. Relief from disability under the act deems underlying events not to have occurred for firearms eligibility purposes under federal law. In the 114th Congress, the Senate considered amendments related to firearms provisions following mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando. Despite blocking these amendments, Congress included a provision in an enacted bill addressing VA procedures regarding veterans deemed mentally incompetent. The Manchin-Toomey amendment required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify beneficiaries deemed mentally incompetent for VA purposes about their firearms eligibility under federal law and establish a review board to assess their ability to possess firearms under the GCA. The Manchin-Toomey amendment required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a review board to assess VA beneficiaries' ability to possess firearms under the GCA. A beneficiary could request a review from the board or a court to determine if they \"cannot safely use, carry, possess, or store firearms due to mental incompetency.\" Judicial review in federal court was also allowed. Until the review process was complete, a person would not be considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for firearms eligibility, and the Secretary would not be permitted to make a NICS referral during this time. The Manchin-Toomey amendment required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a review board for VA beneficiaries to assess their ability to possess firearms under the GCA. If a beneficiary did not request review within 30 days, they would be considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" The amendment also mandated the Secretary to provide written notice of review and appeal opportunities to beneficiaries previously determined mentally incompetent by the VA. Additionally, all policies for determining mental incompetency would need to be reviewed and revised. The Secretary was required to review and revise policies for determining mental incompetency of beneficiaries, ensuring that those who voluntarily turn over financial management to a fiduciary are not considered \"adjudicated mentally defective.\" Senator Murphy proposed an amendment to codify the ATF's definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" during Senate consideration of an appropriations bill. In the 114th Congress, Senator Charles Grassley proposed amendments to replace the term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" with \"mentally incompetent\" in the Gun Control Act. These amendments aimed to narrow the scope of who could be referred to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file. In the 114th Congress, Senator Charles Grassley proposed amendments to narrow the scope of who could be referred to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file. Grassley submitted an amendment (S.Amdt. 4120) during consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (S. 2943) to restrict the VA Secretary from making NICS referrals without judicial authority. Congress later included a provision in the 21st Century Cures Act that codified VA implementation of NIAA, highlighting the VA's significant contribution to federal records in the NICS index. The VA has the authority to determine the competency status of beneficiaries receiving benefits and may appoint a fiduciary for those deemed incompetent. Beneficiaries determined to be mentally incompetent are referred to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS. VA regulations define a mentally incompetent person as one lacking the mental capacity to manage their affairs. VA only determines incompetency with clear and convincing medical evidence. The VA determines competency status of beneficiaries with clear and convincing medical evidence or a definite expression by medical authorities. If there is reasonable doubt, the beneficiary is considered competent. Beneficiaries must be notified of proposed determinations of incompetency, including the impact on firearm rights. Those submitted to the FBI for inclusion in NICS can contest the determination. The VA's determination of incompetency allows beneficiaries to contest the decision through due process and appeals procedures, including the opportunity to present evidence and be represented by counsel at no cost. A beneficiary dissatisfied by the VA's decision on competency has the right to a hearing before the BVA and judicial review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Relief from being reported to the FBI for NICS inclusion can be sought separately, with burden of proof on the beneficiary. Failure to meet burden of proof is sufficient cause for the request. When deciding on a veteran's request for relief, the VA must consider evidence from their mental health physician and reputation. Relief can be denied if there is evidence of danger to self or others. Granting relief requires clear evidence that the beneficiary is not a danger to the public and it is not against public interest. The VA must consider evidence from a veteran's mental health physician and reputation when deciding on relief. Relief can be denied if there is danger to self or others, but granting relief requires clear evidence that the beneficiary is not a danger to the public and it is not against public interest. The decision of the VA can be judicially reviewed by a U.S. District Court. DOJ guidance requires SSA to report certain beneficiaries with a fiduciary appointed due to mental impairment to the Attorney General for inclusion in NICS. SSA issued a final rule on NIAA implementation on December 19, 2016. The SSA issued a final rule on December 19, 2016, outlining conditions for reporting Social Security or SSI disability beneficiaries' disqualifying records to NICS. The rule became effective on January 18, 2017, with compliance required by December 19, 2017. Individuals would be considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" if they filed for disability benefits, met specific impairment criteria, and had a mental disorder listed by SSA. The SSA's final rule outlines conditions for appointing a representative payee for adult Social Security and SSI disability beneficiaries with mental impairments. If evidence shows incapability, SSA may certify benefit payments to a representative payee in the beneficiary's best interest. The final rule by SSA outlines conditions for appointing a representative payee for adult Social Security and SSI disability beneficiaries with mental impairments. The rule would have affected new disability beneficiaries and required reporting to the NICS for existing beneficiaries who later meet all five requirements. The Obama Administration estimated that about 75,000 individuals annually would be affected by the rule. SSA planned to notify individuals meeting criteria for reporting to NICS about firearms prohibition and relief options. The Attorney General would be informed for record removal under certain circumstances. Relief request would require proof of non-threatening behavior. Affected individuals denied relief by SSA would have been able to file a petition seeking judicial review in U.S. district court for inclusion in the NICS index for individuals deemed mentally incompetent. Congress has passed legislation to encourage governments to submit prohibiting records to the FBI. The VA and SSA have different interpretations of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for submitting prohibiting records to the FBI. The SSA's final rule tied adjudications to \"mental impairments\" and the ability to handle day-to-day affairs, while the VA only tied it to the ability to manage day-to-day affairs. Some Members of Congress oppose NICS referrals based on mental capacity. Opponents argue that mental impairment alone is not sufficient for referrals without judicial authority. Reporting incapacitated individuals without considering their propensity for violence reinforces stereotypes. Proponents argue for the necessity of NICS referrals based on incapacity. Proponents argue that measures to prevent mentally incompetent individuals from acquiring firearms are justified to address public safety concerns. They believe that firearms amplify violence to unacceptable levels in the United States. Opponents of the SSA final rule argue that it was not substantive enough to justify restricting the Second Amendment right to bear arms. The SSA final rule was criticized for being unbalanced, as it required a higher standard for beneficiaries to regain their Second Amendment rights compared to the initial determination of mental incompetency."
