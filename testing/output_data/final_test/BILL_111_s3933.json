    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Electricity Reliability Protection Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to electricity reliability. Congress finds that the United States consumes over 1 billion tons of coal annually, with most used for electricity generation. The Environmental Protection Agency has delayed Clean Water Act permits for 190 coal mining operations, impacting the production of over 2 billion tons of coal and around 17,806 jobs. The Environmental Protection Agency's actions are putting coal mining jobs, small businesses, and electricity reliability at risk in the Appalachian region. Over 2 years of the Nation's coal supply is in jeopardy, impacting roughly 17,806 jobs and 81 small businesses. The Environmental Protection Agency's guidance on improving EPA review of Appalachian surface coal mining operations could harm small businesses, reduce electricity reliability, and drive up energy prices by expanding its authority beyond state and federal regulations. The June 2009 memorandum and April 2010 guidance by the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency may violate the Administrative Procedure Act by not going through notice and comment rulemaking. The Environmental Protection Agency's actions regarding Clean Water Act permits could lead to higher energy prices and harm national security by limiting domestic energy production and reliance on foreign sources. The Environmental Protection Agency's actions on Clean Water Act permits could impact energy prices and national security by restricting domestic energy production and increasing reliance on foreign sources. The funds allocated to certain agencies cannot be used to enforce specific policies related to coal mining operations until further notice. The funds allocated to certain agencies cannot be used to enforce specific policies related to coal mining operations until regulations are promulgated by relevant authorities after providing notice and an opportunity for comment."
