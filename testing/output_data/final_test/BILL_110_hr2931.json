    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act may be cited as the \"Osteoporosis Early Detection and Prevention Act of 2007.\" Congress finds that osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass, leading to bone fragility and increased fracture risk, often undiagnosed until a fracture occurs, with no cure but drug therapy can reduce new hip and spine fractures. Therapy reduces new hip and spine fractures by 50%. Nutrition therapy is also effective. Osteoporosis affects 44 million Americans, with 80% being women. 1.5 million bone fractures are caused by osteoporosis annually. The cost of treating osteoporosis was $17 billion in 2001. The average cost of repairing a hip fracture due to osteoporosis in the US is $37,000, while an osteoporosis screening test costs $59 to $300. Fractures from osteoporosis often lead to disability and institutionalization. Preventing fractures in postmenopausal women before they reach Medicare age can significantly reduce osteoporosis-related costs. Bone mass measurement is a reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis. Bone mass measurement is a painless and reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis before costly fractures occur. Low bone mass is as predictive of future fractures as high cholesterol or high blood pressure are of heart disease or stroke. Medicare provides coverage for bone mass measurement for qualified individuals at risk of developing osteoporosis. SEC. 2. REQUIRING COVERAGE OF BONE MASS MEASUREMENT UNDER HEALTH PLANS. This section mandates coverage for bone mass measurement under group health plans to improve early diagnosis of osteoporosis. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals. This includes radiologic or radioisotopic procedures approved by the FDA to identify bone mass, detect bone loss, or determine bone quality, with a physician's interpretation of the results. No specific facility type is required for these measurements. The term 'qualified individual' refers to individuals at clinical risk for osteoporosis, with vertebral abnormalities, receiving certain therapies, or being monitored for osteoporosis drug therapy efficacy. The frequency of bone mass measurements is limited based on established standards. The Secretary will establish standards for the frequency of bone mass measurement benefits for qualified individuals based on clinical and risk-related characteristics. Group health plans can impose deductibles and cost-sharing for bone mass measurement, with limitations on such costs. The text chunk discusses limitations on cost-sharing for bone mass measurement under group health plans and health insurance coverage. It also prohibits denial of eligibility based on avoiding these requirements and incentivizing individuals or providers to avoid bone mass measurements. The section prohibits providers from withholding bone mass measurements from qualified individuals, discussing preventive techniques, or penalizing providers for providing measurements. It also clarifies that individuals are not required to undergo bone mass measurement and requires group health plans to comply with notice requirements. The section allows negotiation of reimbursement for care provided under this provision and does not preempt state laws providing greater benefits for osteoporosis detection or prevention. Section 2723(c) of the Act is amended to include sections 2704 and 2707. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by adding a new section to Subpart B of part 7 of title I, by inserting sections 2704 and 2707. SEC. 714. STANDARDS RELATING TO BENEFITS FOR BONE MASS MEASUREMENT. Requirements for Coverage of Bone Mass Measurement include coverage for qualified individuals in group health plans and insurance coverage. Bone mass measurement refers to approved procedures for identifying bone mass, detecting bone loss, or determining bone quality, including a physician's interpretation of the results. Conducting the measurement is not restricted to a specific facility. The term 'qualified individual' refers to individuals at risk for osteoporosis or with certain medical conditions. Standards for bone mass measurement coverage apply to group health plans and insurance, without restrictions on where the measurement can be conducted. The restrictions on cost-sharing for bone mass measurement under group health plans or insurance coverage are outlined in section 2707(c) of the Public Health Service Act. Deductibles, coinsurance, and limitations must not exceed those applied to similar services. The Public Health Service Act prohibits group health plans and insurance issuers from denying eligibility based on avoiding requirements, providing incentives to avoid bone mass measurements, or prohibiting providers from discussing osteoporosis preventive techniques with patients. The Public Health Service Act prohibits group health plans and insurance issuers from denying eligibility based on avoiding requirements, providing incentives to avoid bone mass measurements, or prohibiting providers from discussing osteoporosis preventive techniques with patients. Additionally, providers cannot be penalized for providing bone mass measurements to qualified individuals. The section does not mandate individuals to undergo bone mass measurement and requires notice of any modifications related to these requirements under group health plans. The Public Health Service Act prohibits group health plans and insurance issuers from denying eligibility based on avoiding requirements, providing incentives to avoid bone mass measurements, or prohibiting providers from discussing osteoporosis preventive techniques with patients. Additionally, providers cannot be penalized for providing bone mass measurements to qualified individuals. The section does not mandate individuals to undergo bone mass measurement and requires notice of any modifications related to these requirements under group health plans. The provisions of this section do not preempt State law relating to health insurance coverage to the extent such State law provides greater benefits with respect to osteoporosis detection or prevention. Section 731(c) and Section 732(a) of the Act are amended accordingly. The table of contents in the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new item after section 713. Standards relating to benefits for bone mass measurement are added to Part B of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2707 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements and state laws on osteoporosis detection or prevention. The amendments made to section 2762 of the Act apply to group health plans starting in 2008 and to health insurance coverage in the individual market."
