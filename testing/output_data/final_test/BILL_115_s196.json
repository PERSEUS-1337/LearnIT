    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act\". It pertains to public health emergencies. The Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act amends Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act to include reporting requirements for public health emergencies. Upon the determination of a public health emergency, the Secretary must request the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to convene a group of officials to prepare monthly reports for Congress. The Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act requires monthly reports to Congress on public health emergencies. The reports include the proposed budget, updates, use of best practices, collaboration strategies, acquisition of supplies, and identification of additional authorities needed for the emergency response. The Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act mandates monthly reports to Congress on public health emergencies, including budget proposals, updates, best practices, collaboration strategies, supply acquisition, and identification of additional authorities needed for the response. The Act also specifies the period for reporting and funding definitions for public health emergency relief. The term 'public health emergency relief' refers to expenditures to address a public health emergency determined under subsection (a) from amounts made available by emergency supplemental appropriations to appropriations accounts of the Department of Health and Human Services. The term 'target amount' refers to the rolling annual average of expenditures for public health emergency relief over the 14 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year of a public health emergency determination. This excludes the highest and lowest years. Appropriations are made to the Public Health Emergency Fund upon the determination of a public health emergency, with reporting requirements applying to the allocated amounts. Amounts appropriated under clause (i) are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to specific legislative acts. The resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010 includes a limitation where clause (i) does not apply if the amount in the Public Health Emergency Fund equals or exceeds the target amount. The formula determines the difference between the target amount and the available funds in the Public Health Emergency Fund. The Public Health Emergency Fund's use of funds is subject to a report by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 30 days of enactment, detailing the rolling average for determining the target amount. The Public Health Emergency Fund appropriations are to be used by the Secretary for any ongoing public health emergency, providing immediate assistance for response needs at various levels and for determined activities. The Public Health Emergency Fund appropriations are available for activities determined appropriate by the Secretary to improve preparedness and response to protect human health in any public health emergency under subsection (a). Amounts appropriated shall remain available as long as any public health emergency is determined under subsection (a) and has not terminated. The Secretary has the authority to transfer funds, enter contracts, utilize flexible hiring mechanisms, and exemptions from administrative restrictions when expending funds for public health emergency preparedness and response. The Public Health Emergency Fund is exempt from sequestration, allowing for flexible compensation for responders and the utilization of flexible transaction mechanisms. Additionally, GAO reports are required within 180 days of the enactment of this section. The Comptroller General of the United States will prepare a report within 180 days of the Act's enactment, reviewing the capacity of the public health system to respond to infectious disease outbreaks, identifying areas for improvement in coordination between government entities, and making recommendations on resource allocation for public health. The Comptroller General of the United States will review the allocation of resources for public health emergency response, including the use of the emergency fund established under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, a post-emergency report will be conducted within 6 months after the termination of a public health emergency to assess response efforts by government entities at Federal, State, and local levels. The government entities will submit a report to Congress evaluating the compliance, effectiveness, cost, areas for improvement, and incorporation of best practices in response efforts to infectious disease outbreaks. The report to Congress will evaluate compliance, effectiveness, cost, areas for improvement, and incorporation of best practices in response efforts to infectious disease outbreaks. It will also include an audit on how funds for public health emergencies have been spent in the previous 2 years. SEC. 3. APPLICABILITY. This Act does not impact the applicability of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in the event of a public health emergency."
