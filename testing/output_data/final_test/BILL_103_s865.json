    "content": "The \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993\" aims to improve employment rates and earnings in central cities by enhancing residents' access to high job growth areas, meeting labor needs in suburban locations, and testing different approaches to achieve these goals through demonstration grants. The \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993\" defines key terms such as \"area of high job growth,\" \"central city,\" and \"community-based organization\" to clarify its objectives in improving employment rates and earnings in central cities. The \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993\" defines terms like \"eligible metropolitan area,\" \"Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area,\" and \"suburban job location\" to specify criteria for job growth and locations within metropolitan areas. The \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993\" establishes a program to assist residents of central cities in eligible metropolitan areas to commute to job locations in high job growth areas, especially suburban locations. Grants will be provided through the Mobility for Work Demonstration Program. The \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993\" establishes a program to assist residents in eligible metropolitan areas to commute to job locations in high job growth areas. The program will provide grants to up to six entities to carry out demonstration projects utilizing specific program models. A peer review panel will be established by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, comprised of individuals with experience in designing successful mobility programs for work. The \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993\" establishes a program to assist residents in eligible metropolitan areas to commute to job locations in high job growth areas. A peer review panel will be established by the Secretary of Labor to review and make recommendations on grant applications for demonstration projects. The panel will recommend a design for project evaluation to the Secretaries of Labor and Transportation. To apply for a grant under the \"Mobility for Work Act of 1993,\" an entity must submit an application to the Secretary of Labor, including details on program models, data collection procedures, and project capabilities as required by the Secretary. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will make grants to entities for demonstration projects using specific program models. One model involves adding transportation services to existing job training programs to increase access to job locations in areas of high job growth. The entity will increase access to job locations in areas of high job growth by establishing new transportation services, providing counseling and assistance for residents to promote carpooling and educate on public transit routes. Improving public transit systems to increase access to job locations in areas of high job growth by modifying routes and schedules, and providing express bus services to business parks. The text chunk discusses the implementation of transit services to improve access to job locations in high job growth areas. This includes modifying routes and schedules, providing express bus services to business parks, and offering reduced fare programs. Employers may also be requested to contribute to the costs of implementing these transit services. Establishing regional coalitions to improve central city access to jobs involves creating a coalition of various entities to implement strategies for enhancing job access for low-income residents in a central city within a metropolitan area. This includes identifying and addressing transportation barriers through modifications in job training and placement services. The entity providing job training and placement services should also offer support services like child care and transportation. They should aim to connect program participants with job opportunities across the eligible metropolitan area. The evaluation of these projects will assess the impact of adding transportation services to job training programs. In accordance with subsection (d)(1), the addition of transportation services in demonstration projects will be evaluated for their impact on employment rates, job retention, and earnings. Entities improving public transit systems (d)(2) and establishing regional coalitions (d)(3) will also be assessed for their effects on employment outcomes. Nothing in this section prevents entities from receiving additional funding for demonstration projects. Authorization of Funds: $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding as needed for fiscal years 1995 through 1998 to carry out demonstration projects."
