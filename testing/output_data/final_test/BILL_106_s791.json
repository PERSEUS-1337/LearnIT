The Senate recognizes the importance of government procurement access for women-owned small businesses due to their significant growth in the economy. The number of women-owned small businesses in the United States increased significantly, with total sales and employment also experiencing substantial growth. Women-owned small businesses in various industries showed impressive rates of growth, with construction leading at 171 percent. Approximately 8 million women-owned small businesses in the United States contribute to job creation for 15.5 million individuals and generate nearly $1.4 trillion in sales annually. However, their participation in the Federal Government procurement market is limited, despite the government being the largest purchaser of goods and services in the country. The majority of federal purchases are for items costing $25,000 or less, with only a 2.2 percent rate of procurement for women-owned small businesses. The Senate urges an audit of the Federal procurement system within a year of enacting this Act. The Senate urges an audit of the Federal procurement system to increase contracts awarded to women-owned small businesses. The audit will analyze trends and recommend ways to boost contracts, considering suggestions from Federal employees. A report will be submitted to Congress with the findings. The Senate calls for an audit of the Federal procurement system to enhance contracts for women-owned small businesses. The audit will examine trends, propose methods to increase contracts, and address barriers created by legal or regulatory procurement requirements. The Act and its amendments will be effective starting October 1, 1999."
