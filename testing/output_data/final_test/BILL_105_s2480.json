    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Invasive Pest Control Act of 1998\". Congress finds that the importation of unprocessed logs, lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles into the United States may introduce nonindigenous pests and pathogens to native North American forests, leading to devastation of tree species, habitat, and the economy of affected forest areas. The potential economic disruption from these pests costs an estimated $41 billion annually. Commercial forestry loses an estimated $4 billion annually due to nonindigenous pests and pathogens introduced into inland forests through various means. Examples of these pests include Dutch Elm disease. Dutch Elm disease was introduced into the United States in the 1920s with European logs delivered to the Port of New York and spread throughout the country, affecting an estimated 1,000,000 trees. The disease has decimated American elm species. The Gypsy Moth, with no natural predators in the US, has rapidly infested Northeast forests covering approximately 200,000 square miles. The Asian Long-Horned Beetle is a new exotic pest discovered at ports across the United States, with no natural enemies and attacking valuable trees like Norway and sugar maples in the Northeast. The Asian Long-Horned Beetle is a serious threat to valuable trees in the Northeast, including maple sugar and lumber industries, homeowner property values, and tourism. Other nonindigenous pests and pathogens causing economic and ecological degradation in US forests include Port Orford Cedar Root Rot, Pine Wilt disease, Eurasian poplar rust fungus, and pine shoot beetle. Preventive management measures are necessary to address these issues. If preventive measures are not taken in the United States to stop nonindigenous pests and pathogens from entering on unprocessed wood products, further introductions and infestations will occur. The purpose of this Act is to prevent the unintentional introduction of nonindigenous pests and pathogens into US forests through the importation of unprocessed wood products, protect the health of forests and native tree species, coordinate research and activities related to forest pests, and minimize the economic and ecological impact of nonindigenous pests and pathogens. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"treatment\" involves debarking and heating wood articles over 14 centimeters in diameter to 71.1 degrees Celsius for 75 minutes, and fumigation or kiln drying for wood articles under 14 centimeters in diameter. The term \"wood article\" refers to various unprocessed or minimally processed wood products, including logs, lumber, tree parts, bark, and wood packing materials. Wood articles can be treated through kiln drying, pressure treatment with preservatives, or other methods to meet specified standards. SEC. 5. RESTRICTIONS ON MOVEMENT OF PLANTS, PLANT PRODUCTS, BIOLOGICAL CONTROL ORGANISMS, PLANT PESTS, NOXIOUS WEEDS, WOOD ARTICLES, AND MEANS OF CONVEYANCE. The Secretary has the authority to prohibit or restrict the importation, entry, exportation, or movement of various items to prevent the introduction or spread of nonindigenous pests, pathogens, or noxious weeds. Imported wood articles must undergo treatment before and after importation into the United States. During a 5-year interim period, all wood pallets, packing materials, and dunnage used to import articles into the United States must be treated and marked with an international symbol. After this period, the importation of wood pallets, packing materials, or dunnage into the United States is prohibited. SEC. 6. PLANT HEALTH AND ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION TASK FORCE. Established a \"Plant Health and Ecosystem Protection Task Force\" with membership including the Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and representatives from various Federal agencies responsible for managing natural resources. The Plant Health and Ecosystem Protection Task Force includes representatives from federal agencies like the Agricultural Marketing Service, Natural Resource Conservation Service, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as representatives from state agencies and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in plant health and ecosystem protection. The Task Force is responsible for developing criteria for establishing guidelines. The Plant Health and Ecosystem Protection Task Force, comprised of representatives from various federal and state agencies, is tasked with developing criteria for precautionary phytosanitary procedures to prevent the spread of nonindigenous pests and pathogens through international or interstate commerce and travel. SEC. 7. FEES. The Secretary of the Treasury requires importers of wood articles to obtain a permit and pay an application fee determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. All fees collected are transferred to the Fund established under section 8. A revolving fund called the \"Pest Reduction in Wood Articles Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States. It consists of appropriated amounts and interest earned on investments. Amounts collected as fees under section 7 are transferred to the Fund. The Secretary of Agriculture can request transfers from the Fund for determined purposes. The \"Pest Reduction in Wood Articles Fund\" supports certifying treatment facilities and research for controlling nonindigenous species on wood products. Up to 10% of the Fund can be used for administrative expenses. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess Fund amounts in US interest-bearing obligations. The Fund invests in US interest-bearing obligations, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchase. Obligations may be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the Fund."
