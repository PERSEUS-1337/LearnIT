    "content": "Federal highway and public transportation programs are primarily funded by motor fuel taxes that go into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Tax rates, set per gallon, have not increased since 1993, leading to insufficient receipts to support transportation programs since FY2008. The rise in vehicle fuel efficiency and electric vehicles questions the long-term viability of fuel taxes. Economists suggest mileage-based user charges as an alternative, where motorists pay fees based on distance driven and other road use costs. This concept aims to fund surface transportation and is not a new idea. Recent technological developments and the shortcomings of motor fuel taxes have sparked interest in a road user charge system. This system would assess vehicle owners on a per-mile basis for the distance driven, with potential adjustments based on factors like time of day, location, vehicle weight, and emissions. Studies suggest a single per-mile charge for road use. Proposed road user charge systems involve metering miles traveled, billing for fees owed, and enforcing correct payment. Fees would be charged to vehicle owner's credit or bank card, similar to toll roads. Enforcement actions ensure correct charging and fee payment. Enforcement actions for road user charges include checks for tampering with OBUs, verifying tax payments, and ensuring correct emissions-based charges for trucks. Implementation of a nationwide road user charge would involve structuring and collecting fees, with a key issue being whether vehicle owners could opt out and how they would contribute to costs. The proposed system for road user charges involves installing an on-board unit (OBU) on each vehicle to receive GPS signals for real-time fee calculation. The OBU can adjust charges based on various factors, but privacy concerns arise due to the ability to track vehicle movements. This system differs from existing tolling systems like E-ZPass. A new approach to distance-based user charges for drivers, similar to fuel taxes, has been tested in two states. In Nevada, mileage was estimated based on fuel efficiency and gasoline purchased, with a transponder transmitting information to calculate road user fees. Oregon conducted similar tests with and without transponders. Oregon tested mileage-based user charges with and without GPS devices. Participants had privacy concerns about GPS devices, but systems without them can't charge variable rates based on time or road congestion. Pay-at-the-pump systems could allow a mileage-based user charge alongside fuel taxes, but it may be administratively complex. Federal fuel taxes are collected at the wholesale level, not retail gas stations, so implementing a mileage-based user charge would require thousands of new collection points. An odometer-based user charge system, like Oregon's OReGO, collects revenue at 1.5 cents per mile using a plug-in device. This system offers a choice between a device with GPS for in-state miles only or one without GPS for all miles driven. However, fraud and limitations such as inability to charge peak times or avoid double-charging on toll roads are major concerns with this system. The New Zealand system allows drivers to purchase a license or card based on odometer readings for a certain number of miles, with no location information collected. Various charging methods are offered to make road user charges more acceptable, such as installing OBUs or opting for annual odometer readings. Choices are provided to motorists, including the option to continue using the federal motor fuels tax for those who reject road charging systems. The federal motor fuels tax collection system has been in place since 1986, with revenue collected from 850 registered taxpayers at the refinery or tank farm. Shifting to a road user charge system would increase administrative costs and reduce net revenue per dollar collected. This change would complicate tax administration by assessing taxes at gasoline stations and individual vehicle owners, increasing costs significantly. A mileage-based road user charge for all private vehicles could require 256 million points of collection. Administrative and enforcement costs for collecting user fees range from 5% to 13% of collections, similar to toll road agencies in the U.S. The New Hampshire Turnpike system reported E-ZPass processing fees at 7.3% of total revenues in FY2015. The cost of operating a federal system for equipping vehicles with standardized OBUs with GPS technology is likely to be above 5% of revenue. Credit card and bank fees are unavoidable in any road user charging system. Evaluations have shown that credit card fees on toll collections range from 2.7% to 3.45% of revenue. Any electronic user charge scheme relying on credit and bank cards would be more than double the cost of collecting the federal motor fuels tax. A significant portion of U.S. households are unbanked or underbanked, making it difficult for them to participate in a charging system based on electronic payments. Allowing these motorists to pay road user charges through a cash alternative would increase administrative costs. Paying road user charges through a cash alternative would increase administrative costs. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service could handle billing and tax evasion prevention for a mileage-based road user charge. A nationwide federal road user charge could benefit from economies of scale. Enforcement and billing could be outsourced to a commercial account manager for a reasonable profit. Enforcement costs are challenging to assess due to the lack of reflection of on-road enforcement costs by state police in turnpike fees. The cost of enforcing road user charges is around 5% of toll revenues, but could vary based on trip factors. Administrative and enforcement costs are crucial as they impact revenue generation. If a road user charge is more costly to administer, it would generate less money for transportation purposes. Conversely, a charge designed to raise the same net revenue as the current motor fuels tax would need to generate significantly more gross revenue. A mileage-based road user charge could cover all non-government vehicles or specific categories, with lower charges for more vehicles covered. Congress may exempt electric vehicles or vehicles owned by nonprofits or disabled individuals, impacting revenue generation. Multiple categories with different charges could increase complexity and affect revenue. Implementing mileage-based road user charges for trucks, categorized by weight, number of axles, or emissions, could lower privacy concerns and implementation costs. However, a federal road user charge may raise federal-state relation issues and face legal challenges regarding federal authority. A nationwide mileage-based road user charge could face legal challenges over federal authority, but providing states with financial incentives to implement it voluntarily may address concerns. This charge would be similar to a national toll, potentially resulting in double charges for toll road users. Replacing existing tolls with a road user charge could complicate bond servicing. The Highway Trust Fund has financed federal transportation programs since 1982, and using a distance-based charge for highways only could be seen as a user fee. The Highway Trust Fund has financed federal transportation programs since 1982. Congress may need to find another source of funds if it wishes to continue supporting public transportation. Legislation establishing a road user charge would have to clearly identify how the charge would be spent. President Barack Obama signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act in 2015. The FAST Act authorized $95 million for grants to states to demonstrate user-based alternative revenue mechanisms for the Highway Trust Fund. The program aims to test and improve future user-based mechanisms, increase public awareness, and reduce administrative costs. Grant awardees will address hurdles to adoption of these mechanisms. The pilot program aims to address hurdles to the adoption of user-based alternative mechanisms, privacy protection, use of third-party vendors for fee collection, congestion mitigation, equity concerns, compliance ease, and technology reliability. It will study the ability of a distance-based charging system to handle vehicles crossing jurisdictional lines and determine per-mile charges in different jurisdictions. The program will likely track thousands of vehicles to test this capability. The cost of a pilot study for a mileage-based road user charge system is estimated to be $2,000 to $4,000 per participant. With $95 million in federal funds matched by state funds, a pilot program could accommodate 45,000 to 90,000 participants. However, geographic diversity requirements may limit the number of participants in each state. Several states have conducted small-scale trials of similar systems, but none provide significant insights. Few small-scale tests have been conducted on mileage-based road user charge systems, with limited insights on administrative costs for large-scale implementation. Interstate issues have not been fully addressed in trials, and privacy concerns have impacted state-run studies, leading Oregon and Nevada to avoid GPS-based systems due to worries about tracking and disclosure of personal information. Oregon conducted a study on mileage fees with GPS-equipped vehicles, where participants were charged varying rates per mile based on travel times. The study showed that drivers responded by reducing travel, especially during rush hours, while privacy concerns were addressed to protect participant information. Oregon responded to privacy concerns by allowing drivers to choose metering technologies, including one that hid travel location. A pilot program ended in March 2013, leading to the enactment of Senate Bill 810 in July 2013. This bill created OReGO, a road charging system where volunteers pay 1.5 cents per mile instead of a gas tax. OReGO started in 2015, managed by a commercial account manager. The California legislature enacted SB 1077 directing the California Department of Transportation to establish a road charge pilot by July 2016. The pilot aims to analyze alternative means of collecting road usage data, protect data integrity, and safeguard driver privacy. Recommendations to the legislature are expected in December 2017. A GPS mileage-fee system was tested in vehicles of 2,600 volunteers from 2008 to 2010, computing hypothetical mileage fees for different jurisdictions. Researchers found that mileage-based road user charges were feasible with current technology, but installing charging equipment in existing vehicles could be challenging. Additionally, meters using GPS technology were installed in roughly 500 vehicles in 275 households between 2005 and 2006. Participants in the study agreed to pay tolls for using freeways in the Seattle area, with toll rates displayed on an OBU based on time of day. Data was transmitted to a central office for payment withdrawal. Drivers changed travel behavior in response to congestion charges. Minnesota tested a distance-based fee system using smartphones with GPS for 500 cars, with variable charges for peak and off-peak times. Nevada also conducted pilot tests. Nevada is running pilot tests for a pay-at-the-pump system using a wireless transponder connected to vehicles to transmit mileage data. The central office calculates charges based on miles traveled and sends the fee to be printed on the fuel receipt. Foreign countries have implemented distance-based road user charges, with New Zealand taxing automobiles and other countries taxing only large commercial vehicles. In some European countries, proposals have been made to implement mileage-based road user charges for automobiles, but no such measures have been put in place yet. Road user charges in the United States focus on revenue generation, while in other countries, they are adopted mainly for environmental reasons like reducing emissions and minimizing noise and vibration from heavy vehicles. Within the EU, enforcing traditional economic measures to meet environmental goals can be challenging due to truck owners registering their vehicles in different member states. Road user charges are attractive because they apply to all trucks passing through a country. Since January 1, 2001, Switzerland has imposed \"performance-related fees\" on heavy goods vehicles weighing more than 3.5 metric tons. The fees aim to reduce road damage and environmental harm caused by foreign trucks transiting Switzerland. Switzerland encourages rail freight by basing fees on vehicle weight and engine emissions. Switzerland imposes performance-related fees on heavy goods vehicles based on weight, engine emissions, and kilometers driven. Fees range from 0.31 to 0.80 Swiss francs per kilometer. Certain vehicles are exempt, and all heavy vehicles must have an OBU installed by an approved installer. The OBU is linked to the tachograph and displays lights to indicate its operation. The OBU is linked to the tachograph in heavy goods vehicles in Western Europe. It is automatically switched off at the border if the vehicle leaves Switzerland and turned on upon reentry. Data must be downloaded periodically and sent to Swiss Customs for payment collection. Vehicles from other countries can use Swiss roads by registering at the border. The Swiss road user charge system requires truck drivers to insert an identification card at border crossings, providing vehicle weight and odometer readings. Upon exit, drivers must pay for kilometers traveled. The system costs 290 million Swiss francs to install, with annual operating costs at 5-6% of receipts. Truck owners must purchase an OBU for 1,000 Swiss francs and have it installed for 300-700 francs. The German charging system covers trucks over 7.5 metric tons on expressways and four-lane roads. It will expand to all federal motorways in 2018. The toll-collection system is complex due to EU regulations on foreign truckers. OBUs with GPS track a truck's location for toll payment. Trucks without OBUs can pay tolls at kiosks or online. Surveillance efforts include overhead cameras due to toll variations based on axles and engine emissions. The German toll system for trucks over 7.5 metric tons requires extensive surveillance with cameras, roadside stations, and random checks to ensure correct toll payment. Rates vary based on emissions and number of axles, ranging from \u20ac0.125 to \u20ac0.214 per kilometer. The fee structure incentivizes maximum vehicle weight for efficiency but may impact road maintenance. Germany's truck toll system raises billions in revenue, with foreign trucks contributing significantly. The toll reduces direct taxes on German trucks and compensates states for lost revenue. Operating costs for Toll Collect are undisclosed, but the government paid $664 million annually to manage the system from 2007 to 2011. The German truck road user charge system costs about $740 million annually to assist trucking firms in compliance. The 2011 law includes privacy protections, prohibiting disclosure of toll payment data and requiring immediate destruction of data after payment. Austria's mileage-based road user charge system for trucks and buses over 3.5 metric tons requires payment by the kilometer on expressways. Rates vary based on vehicle size and engine age, with older engines paying higher fees. The system uses a microwave transponder for tracking instead of GPS. The Austrian road user charge system for trucks and buses over 3.5 metric tons uses a microwave transponder for toll collection, not GPS. It is compatible with Swiss OBUs but not with Austrian transponders in Switzerland or Germany. There are proposals to extend mileage-based charges to all highways to address revenue and usage concerns. This change would require Austria to switch to a GPS-based system like Germany's. Other EU countries also have mileage-based charges for trucks. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary have implemented different road user charge systems for trucks and buses. Poland has separate rate scales based on vehicle weight and emissions, with lower rates on national highways. The Czech Republic uses a microwave system with charges based on axles and emissions classes. Slovakia has a GPS-based system covering a large network of roads. Hungary also uses a GPS-based system for road user charges. Hungary has 17,770 kilometers of roads with a GPS-based charging system for road user charges. The European Commission found the charges disproportionate and required them to be reviewed every six months. EU directives in 2004 and 2011 mandate interoperable tolling systems and charges reflecting environmental burdens for trucks. New Zealand imposed road user charges in 1977 on diesel vehicles and those over 3.5 metric tons. In 1977, New Zealand implemented road user charges on diesel vehicles and those over 3.5 metric tons, based on distance driven and nominal vehicle weight. Charges also applied to diesel passenger cars and heavy goods vehicles. Revenue from road user charges, road tax, and annual registration fees is used for surface transportation. Charges aim to make individual users pay the long-run marginal social cost. The road user charge in New Zealand aims to make users pay the long-run marginal social cost, with a focus on road wear. Charges vary based on vehicle weight and axle count to account for road wear. Adjusting charges for road wear has been challenging due to complexity and enforcement issues. Road users must purchase distance licenses in 1,000 km units. The road user charge in New Zealand requires vehicles to display a license with odometer readings. A hub odometer must be installed for inspection. Costs vary based on vehicle type, with a standard car paying 62 NZD per 1,000 km and a tractor-trailer paying 361 NZD. The charge represents about 10% of truckers' total costs. The New Zealand road user charge requires vehicles to display a license with odometer readings. A transaction fee of 4.80 NZD is charged for online license purchases, with higher fees for other methods. Continuous licensing is mandatory, with a new license needed after every 1,000 kilometers driven."
