    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the northwestern coast of Maui, Hawaii has experienced destructive algal blooms, impacting coral reefs and coastal areas. The blooms are exacerbated by chemicals like fertilizers and insecticides entering the ocean through freshwater runoff. The Department of Health of the State of Hawaii lacks resources to determine the cause of algal blooms. Extensive research is needed to identify factors contributing to algal growth, including sewage disposal, runoff from agricultural lands, and urban areas. Long-term environmental impacts of the blooms are unknown, but reefs exposed to algae are being destroyed. The deterioration of coral reefs due to algal blooms has detrimental effects on marine wildlife and local fishermen. The Maui Algae Task Force, consisting of community activists, aims to collaborate with the Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency to address and eliminate the causes of algal blooms. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 2. STUDY.\" The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will conduct a study to determine the causes of algal blooms off the northwestern coast of Maui, Hawaii, and research better management of chemicals in wastewater and runoff. The study will involve surveying seaweed populations, monitoring surface water runoff sediments, and examining inputs from subsurface sources, including the Lahaina wastewater treatment plant. The study conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency aims to investigate algal blooms off the northwestern coast of Maui, Hawaii. It involves surveying seaweed populations, monitoring water runoff sediments, and examining inputs from sources like the Lahaina wastewater treatment plant. The Administrator is authorized to acquire monitoring equipment and establish a grant program for eligible entities participating in the study. The Administrator may receive applications from various entities to conduct study activities, including the Department of Health of the State of Hawaii, the Maui Algae Task Force, and other appropriate federal, state, or county departments. Demonstration projects can be established to identify best management practices for controlling nonpoint source pollution. An interim report is required within one year of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will submit an interim report to Congress with study results and recommendations, followed by a final report by January 31, 1996. $500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 1994 and 1995 for the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out this section."
