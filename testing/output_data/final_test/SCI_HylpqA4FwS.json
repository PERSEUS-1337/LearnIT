    "content": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are difficult to train due to vanishing or exploding errors over time. A novel incremental RNN (iRNN) tracks incremental changes in hidden state vectors, approximating state-vector increments of continuous-time RNNs. iRNN shows identity gradients and effectively handles long-term dependencies. It is computationally efficient and outperforms existing methods without performance degradation, competing with standard LSTMs on long-term dependencies. The iRNN model effectively handles long-term dependencies and competes with standard LSTMs on various tasks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) store a hidden state vector and update it over rounds using input vectors. The model parameters are learned by minimizing a loss function. Training RNNs can be challenging, especially for tasks requiring long-term dependency. The continuous-time RNN (CTRNN) introduced by Rosenblatt in 1962 mimics activation propagation in neural circuitry, with dynamics governed by a differential equation. The model parameters impact the rate of a neuron's response to the input signal, and recent RNN works drawing inspiration from ODEs are special cases of CTRNN. Works inspired by ODE's are special cases of CTRNN. The dynamics of CTRNN reveal a vanishing gradient issue due to rapid attenuation. CTRNN acts as a low-pass filter, suppressing high frequency components, allowing fidelity of discrete samples with continuous time dynamics. The combination of low pass filtering and slowly time-varying input in CTRNN allows for fidelity of discrete samples with continuous time dynamics. Incremental updates are proposed to address gradient attenuation issues, evolving the state vector and discrete samples close to equilibrium. The proposed Incremental RNN (iRNN) achieves Identity Gradient by discretizing the system dynamics to address gradient attenuation issues and approximate continuous dynamics. The proposed Incremental RNN (iRNN) addresses the vanishing/exploding gradient issue by discretizing system dynamics. iRNN converges rapidly and efficiently handles slowly varying inputs, outperforming standard LSTMs in accuracy and training time on LTD datasets. Our method, Incremental RNN (iRNN), improves LSTM accuracy on LTD datasets and is robust to time-series distortions. It extends to Deep RNNs and focuses on single-layer architectures. Gated mechanisms like LSTM and GRU are widely used in RNNs, with recent proposals like UGRNN and FastGRNN addressing gradient issues but incurring higher costs. Unitary and Deep RNN models focus on improving performance by designing well-conditioned state transition matrices and incorporating nonlinear transition functions. However, these models can incur increased costs, model size, and training time. Mujika et al. (2017) proposed combining multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs to learn complex transition functions effectively. Deep RNNs with residual/skip connections aim to learn complex transition functions effectively, but struggle with gradient decay issues. Linear RNN models have also been explored for performance improvement. Linear RNNs have been studied for speeding up recurrent neural networks by replacing recurrent connections with light weight linear components, leading to reduced training time but increased model size. Some works inspired by ODEs aim to address stability issues in RNNs but struggle with vanishing/exploding gradients. Various approaches, such as modified weight initialization strategies and ODE-based RNN architectures, have been proposed to improve training effectiveness. The Antisymmetric-RNN proposes a family of ODE-RNNs with a key idea of expressing the transition matrix as a difference. Despite similarities to FastRNN, the Euler discretization leads to instability, requiring damping. This approach aims to eliminate vanishing gradients and evolve over the equilibrium manifold, demonstrating identity gradients. Neural ODEs have also been proposed for time-series prediction with irregularly sampled inputs. The ODE-RNN introduces incremental updates to avoid gradient issues and uses Euler's method for discretization. It includes a learnable parameter and can be initialized with the previous state. The single-step-incremental-RNN (SiRNN) is also discussed, with K=1 showing good performance. The SiRNN model, depicted in Figure 1, uses K recursions for transitions. Unlike Graves (2016), it employs gated units for transition functions. The indices k and m represent fixed-point recursion and time index, respectively. The model iterates over k to converge to equilibrium at each time step m. The SiRNN model uses K recursions with gated units for transitions. The model iterates over k to converge to equilibrium at each time step m. The recursion runs for K rounds, terminates, and resets for new input x m+1. Eq. 5 is a root-finding recursion with a correction term for convergence to equilibrium. Proposition 2 guarantees geometric rate of convergence. Partial gradients are identity for sufficiently large K. The architecture involves structured connections driven by the error term for dynamics. The SiRNN model uses structured connections with gated units for transitions, ensuring equilibrium and identity gradient. Unstructured skip connections lack these guarantees. Equilibrium solutions are denoted by h_eq(x, \u03bd) for arbitrary inputs and state-vectors. Proposition 1 states conditions for convergence to equilibrium with a 1-Lipshitz function. The iRNN model converges to a unique equilibrium point, as shown by the Banach fixed point theorem. Experimental results demonstrate convergence with a Gaussian matrix initialization. The iRNN also converges at a linear rate, following Proposition 1. The iRNN model converges at a linear rate, following Proposition 1, which accounts for various activation functions and deep RNNs. The partials of hidden-state vectors on the equilibrium surface are unity, assuming a continuously differentiable activation. Overcoming technical issues with ReLU activations requires invoking the implicit function theorem. Recent results suggest that the implicit function theorem can be applied to everywhere differentiable functions, including ReLUs, despite violating the requirements of the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT). The equilibrium point of the iRNN model can be viewed as a function of the previous hidden state, with the partial gradients converging to identity as K approaches infinity. The smoothness of the equilibrium point function is ensured as long as the Jacobian is non-singular. Taking partial derivatives at equilibrium points yields a specific equation involving the activation function and the hidden state. The equilibrium points in the iRNN model are determined by a specific equation involving the activation function and the hidden state. Replacing certain variables does not affect gradient magnitudes, allowing for different choices to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients during training. The norm-preserving property is not sensitive to the choice of alpha as long as the non-singular condition is met. Theorem 1 guarantees identity gradients on the equilibrium surface, while Proposition 2 ensures proximity to the equilibrium surface for finite K, potentially leading to a vanishing gradient problem for large T. The iRNN model addresses the gradient problem for large T by adjusting K values. The trajectory of iRNN is smooth and projects the initial point onto the equilibrium surface, suggesting a low-dimensional manifold. The equilibrium points are determined by an equation involving the activation function and hidden state. The norm-preserving property is not sensitive to certain variable replacements. Theorems guarantee identity gradients on the equilibrium surface, while Propositions ensure proximity to the equilibrium surface for finite K, potentially avoiding vanishing gradient problems for large T. The equilibrium point in the iRNN model moves in a transformed span of Low Rank Matrix Parameterization when the input varies slowly. Constraints are expressed as U = \u03b1I + V H with low-rank matrices V and H. The parameter matrix P maps input and hidden states onto the same space to decrease model size. The iRNN model uses a parameter matrix P = U = (I + V H) to map input and hidden states to the same space for model size reduction. Competing algorithms are described, and an ablative analysis is presented to justify experimental choices. Experimental results on benchmark datasets are plotted and tabulated. Competing methods are chosen based on specific criteria to benchmark against iRNN. The iRNN model is compared against standard RNN, LSTM, AntisymmetricRNN, and FastRNN. Leaky ReLU activations are attributed to improved performance in memory tasks. The experiments were conducted using TensorFlow on an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. The experiments were conducted using TensorFlow on an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. Performance was evaluated on datasets with pre-processing and feature extraction details provided in the appendix. Hyperparameters were set using grid search and fine-grained validation, with ReLU activation and Adam optimizer used consistently. Ablative analysis was performed on the benchmark results. Ba (2015) used Ba (2015) as the optimizer for experiments on the add-task benchmark. Ablative analysis was done for sequence length 200 for 1000 iterations, focusing on mean-squared error. Results show that iRNN accuracy is linked to identity gradients, with increasing K improving gradients and accuracy. Different models can achieve identity gradients, but this doesn't always lead to better test accuracy. Fast convergence is associated with effective identity gradients. The identity gradient in iRNN leads to faster convergence with larger loss gradients, as shown in figure 3(a). iRNN with K = 10 converges within 300 iterations, outperforming other methods. SiRNN is faster than competitors but has higher computational overhead. Accuracy improves with K in SiRNN, but it requires more computational resources. The iRNN model achieves state-of-the-art performance in various benchmark experiments, showcasing its ability to learn long-term dependencies rapidly. It excels in tasks requiring effective gradient propagation across different types of datasets, including conventional benchmark tasks, vision tasks, noise-padded vision tasks, and short-duration activities embedded in larger time-windows.

It achieves zero average cross entropy in the copying task and shows rapid convergence in the addition task. iRNN outperforms baselines in tasks like addition and copy tasks, showing faster convergence and stability in performance across training samples. It easily learns long-term dependencies and achieves zero MSE faster than other methods. In experiments on sequential vision tasks like classification of MNIST images, FastRNN trains faster than LSTMs, with iRNN showing a 9x speedup relative to LSTMs and matching Antisymmetric in test accuracy with fewer parameters. In experiments, iRNN outperforms existing baselines in tasks with fewer parameters and converges faster. The model shows superior performance by suppressing noise and recalling informative states, making it resilient to perturbations like Noisy-CIFAR and Noisy-MNIST datasets. iRNN outperforms LSTMs on tasks with noise, showing resilience and ability to capture longer dependencies. It excels in detecting activity in longer sequences with small footprint RNNs, as demonstrated in Google-30 and HAR-2 datasets. iRNN outperforms baselines on activity recognition tasks, showing accuracy improvements with larger K values. It fits within IoT/edge-device budgets and allows for deep multi-layered networks within a single time-step. The framework is general, accommodating shallow and deep nets with small and large time steps. The trick to transform hidden states in iRNN is key to avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients. Theorem 1 shows that the partial differential of hidden states is identity, allowing for unlimited time steps. Using subroutine 1, hidden states can be generated and model parameters learned in deep learning frameworks. The Euler method converges to equilibrium locally with a linear rate if a certain condition is met. The Euler method connects to inexact Newton methods, leveraging Thm. 2.3 in Dembo et al. (1982) for stability. Google Speech Commands dataset includes 30 short words sampled at 16KHz with 32 filter responses for a 1-second audio clip. The Human Activity Recognition dataset was collected from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope, with 6 activities merged into 2 classes. The Penn Treebank dataset used 300-word sequences for language modeling. The vocabulary had 10,000 words, and word embeddings matched the hidden units. The Pixel-MNIST dataset was normalized and a Permuted-MNIST version was created by shuffling pixels. Noisy-MNIST introduced long-range dependencies by inputting each row of an image at every time step with added Gaussian noise. The task involves inputting each row of a CIFAR-10 image at every time step, with added Gaussian noise after the first 32 time steps. This creates long-range dependencies for the model to remember information from a long time ago. The total number of time steps is set to 1000, with only the first 32 containing salient information. The task involves inputting each row of a CIFAR-10 image at every time step, with added Gaussian noise after the first 32 time steps. The model needs to remember information from a long time ago to correctly classify the input image. This task is more challenging than pixel-by-pixel CIFAR-10. The Addition Task involves two sequences of numbers, with the output being the sum of the two entries of the first sequence. The Copying Task involves remembering a sequence of categories with a delimiter, testing over different values of T. The task is outlined following a similar setup to previous studies. The Copying Task requires reproducing an initial sequence of 10 categories after a delimiter. The goal is to minimize cross entropy by remembering the sequence for T time steps. A baseline strategy involves predicting a specific category for T + 10 entries and then predicting the final 10 categories randomly. The categorical cross entropy of this strategy is 10 log (8) T +20 10. The dataset is based on Daily and Sports Activity (DSA) detection from a resource-constrained IoT wearable device with Xsens MTx sensors. The Yelp-5 Sentiment Classification dataset consists of 500,000 train points and 500,000 test points from 1 million reviews. Each review was clipped or padded to be 300 words long with a vocabulary of 20,000 words and 128 dimensional word embeddings. Some potential baselines were removed in the experiments section due to experimental conditions enforced in the setup. In the experiments section, certain baselines were removed due to setup constraints. Cooijmans et al. (2016) and Gong et al. (2018) were excluded as they are add-ons applicable to any method. Deep transitioning methods like Zilly et al. (2017), Pascanu et al. (2013a), and Mujika et al. (2017) were also considered add-ons for recurrent cells. Gating variants of single recurrent cells were removed as iRNN can be extended to a gating variant. Results for remaining experiments on addition tasks and baselines for Pixel-MNIST and permute-MNIST tasks are presented in Figure 5 and Table 7. Results for various tasks including Yelp star rating prediction, activity recognition tasks, and PTB language modeling with difficult sequence lengths are presented in tables 8, 9, and 10 respectively. The experiments excluded certain baselines and focused on different tasks such as Pixel-MNIST and permute-MNIST. Table 10 presents evaluation metrics for the PTB Language modelling task with 1 layer setup by Kusupati et al. (2018), including test time and number of parameters. Empirical verification of local convergence to a fixed point with linear rate is shown through comparison of approximate solutions and fixed points.
