    "content": "The United States has seen improvements in secondary school participation over the last century, but over a quarter of first-year high school students fail to graduate in four years. By age 24, more than 10% still lack a high school diploma. Dropout rates during the 2003-2004 school year were nearly 5%, with disparities in graduation rates by race/ethnicity and immigration status. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, includes provisions to address high school graduation and dropout issues. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, includes requirements for state and local education agencies on calculating graduation, completion, and dropout rates. Federal programs like the Neglected and Delinquent program, Dropout Prevention Program, and Migrant High School Equivalency Program aim to prevent high school dropouts. Additional programs also support dropout prevention efforts. The government supports various programs, including Trio programs, GEAR UP program, and programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, for dropout prevention. These efforts are part of larger federal programs like ESEA, Title I-A, and HEA. Reauthorization of major federal dropout prevention programs is expected in the 110th Congress. Authorization for HEA programs is extended through June 30, 2007, under the Third Higher Education Extension Act of 2006. The 110th Congress is likely to reauthorize federal programs related to high school graduation, completion, and dropouts. This report provides background on these issues, including NCLBA provisions, latest data on high school outcomes, federal programs to improve outcomes, and potential issues for Congress to consider during reauthorization. The NCLBA requires reporting of high school outcomes, including graduation and dropout rates. The Education Sciences Reform Act charged NCES with compiling completion rates. High school graduation rates were added to Title I, Part A requirements for state-developed standards of AYP. State AYP standards must include an additional academic indicator, with high schools required to meet graduation rate criteria. The NCLBA defines graduation rate as the percentage of students graduating with a regular diploma in the standard number of years determined by each state. There is no minimum graduation rate required, and states are not mandated to report rates to the Education Department. The NCLBA requires states to include graduation rate criteria in their AYP standards, with no minimum rate required. The Secretary of Education is tasked with assessing the impact of Title I on states, districts, schools, and students, including an independent study on assessment systems and their effect on graduation rates. The provision requires schools to use the annual event school dropout rate for calculating high school dropout rates, as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics. The event dropout rate is the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who leave school without earning a diploma or completing an approved program. The rate is calculated using the October 1 enrollment count for the relevant grades. The event dropout rate for grades 9-12 is calculated using the October 1 enrollment count. Dropouts are defined as individuals who were enrolled in the previous school year but not on October 1 of the current year, have not graduated, and do not meet exclusionary conditions. Rates were calculated for 45 states and the District of Columbia for the 2001-2002 school year. The NCES high school completion rate is based on CPS data and represents the percentage of 18- through 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in high school and have earned a high school diploma or equivalent credential. Unlike the Title I-A graduation rate, the NCES completion rate includes all those with a high school credential. The NCES completion rate includes individuals with a high school credential, such as a GED certificate, aged 18 to 24. It is estimated using survey data from a nationally-representative sample, unlike the Title I-A graduation rate which is tabulated by each state. NCES has introduced a new high school indicator called the average freshman graduation rate (AFGR), which estimates the percentage of public high school students graduating on time with a regular diploma. This rate is calculated by dividing the number of graduates by the size of the incoming freshman class 4 years earlier. The size of the incoming freshman class is estimated by summing the enrollment in eighth, ninth, and tenth grade, then dividing by three. Graduates include diploma recipients, not GED recipients, except in states with in-school GED programs. NCES adjusts for ungraded students by redistributing them across grades. Each high school indicator provides a different perspective on outcomes and applies to different policy issues. The Title I Graduation Rate mandated by the NCLBA sheds light on school performance at the state and local level. The Event Dropout Rate aims to measure high school outcomes nationally but lacks consistency. The CPS Completion Rate provides a consistent estimate of educational attainment nationwide. The Average Freshman Graduation Rate is a recent comprehensive measure of high school success. The Average Freshman Graduation Rate is a recent national estimate of high school completion, achieved through a major undertaking by NCES and expert researchers. The United States has seen a significant increase in secondary school participation since the early 20th century, with 84.1% of adults holding a high school diploma by the end of the century. Note that the completion rates in Figure 1 differ from the NCES completion rate mentioned earlier. The high school completion rates in Figure 1 prior to 1993 are for those completing 12 years of schooling, with a population base of those 25 years old and older. The NCES estimate for 2004 was 86.8%, while the Census Bureau's estimate was 85.2%. The data used for these estimates are from the October supplement to the CPS. Hispanics have a lower high school completion rate compared to other racial/ethnic groups, with only 69.8% completing high school by age 24 in 2004. This is largely due to over 40% of Hispanics being foreign-born immigrants. The high school completion rate among 18- to 24-year-old, foreign-born Hispanics in 2004 was 54.7%, while native-born Hispanics had a higher rate of 80.8% for first-generation and 82.0% for second-generation and higher. States participating in the DPP are required to provide dropout data to the Secretary in accordance with NCES requirements. Currently, all but five states are reporting appropriate dropout data, but some states still report data incompatible with CCD requirements, hindering NCES from estimating a national dropout rate. This section presents dropout data from the CPS as the only annual source of national estimates. Dropout data is extracted from the CPS, with state-level data for states meeting CCD criteria. The event dropout rate is the percentage of students leaving high school without a diploma or GED between school years. In 2003-2004, 4.7% of students dropped out, with higher rates among Hispanic and low-income students. NCES provides state dropout rates in Table 3 for selected years. The table in Table 3 shows state dropout data for selected years in the past decade, indicating a trend towards more comprehensive reporting. In 2001-2002, event dropout rates ranged from 1.9% in Wisconsin to 10.5% in Arizona. Nine states had rates below 3%, while nine states had rates of 6% or higher. In 2001-2002, event dropout rates ranged from 1.9% in Wisconsin to 10.5% in Arizona. Nine states had rates below 3%, while nine states had rates of 6% or higher. States are not required to report graduation rates to ED under NCLBA, only include them in public report cards. State report card data for the 2002-2003 school year were compiled by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center. AFGR was chosen as the best method for estimating state-level graduation rates. The AFGR was 74% in 2002-2003, with New Jersey having the highest rate at 87%. States like North Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Nebraska also had rates above 85%. The District of Columbia had the lowest rate at 60%, with South Carolina being the lowest state at 60%. Other states had rates at or below 65%. The difference between state-reported graduation rates and the AFGR varies significantly across states. Federal programs aim to assist dropouts and at-risk students in completing their secondary education. These programs focus on preventing dropouts, helping them re-enter or complete high school, and have varying levels of funding for FY2008. The FY2006 appropriation for ESEA Title I-A grants for local educational agencies (LEAs) was $12,713,125,000. If only 0.04% of these funds were used for dropout programs, they may have served more students than the DPP, which received $4,851,000 in FY2006. The DPP aims to coordinate a national strategy for reducing dropout rates and provides grants to state educational agencies (SEAs) and LEAs to establish programs. The DPP authorizes grants to SEAs and LEAs for dropout prevention programs, professional development, counseling, and school reform. Grants are awarded competitively or on a formula basis depending on appropriation levels. The program received $4,851,000 in FY2006 but was not funded in FY2008. Part D provides grants to SEAs and LEAs for instructional services for youth in delinquent, community day, or correctional institutions and at-risk youth. Subpart 1 grants are awarded to SEAs based on the number of youth in state-operated institutions, while Subpart 2 grants are for youth in locally-operated institutions. SEAs reserve funds from Title I-A to award grants to LEAs. The FY2008 appropriation for Subpart 1 grants was $48,927,000. The federal Trio program Talent Search provides grants to institutions of higher education and organizations to support educational programs for migrant students aged 16 and up. The program offers academic and support services to help students obtain their high school equivalency certificate and transition to employment or higher education. The FY2008 appropriation for Talent Search was $18,226,000. Talent Search and Upward Bound are federal Trio programs that provide grants to institutions and agencies to support disadvantaged students aged 11-27. Talent Search focuses on encouraging high school dropouts to reenter education, while Upward Bound offers residential programs for students aged 13-19 to improve academic skills and motivation. In FY2008, Talent Search received $142,884,000 and Upward Bound received $303,928,000 in appropriations. In FY2008, Upward Bound received $828,178,000 in appropriations, with an additional $57,000,000 earmarked in the appropriations bill. GEAR UP awards grants to increase high school completion and postsecondary enrollment, with FY2008 appropriations at $303,423,000. WIA grants aim to increase adult literacy and employment skills. The Youth Activities program (WIA Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 4) awards formula grants to states to assist eligible youth in achieving academic and employment success. Eligible participants are between 14 and 21 years old, low-income individuals deficient in basic literacy. At least 30% of funds must be spent on out-of-school youth activities. FY2008 appropriations for this program were $554,122,000. The Youth Activities program provides formula grants to states to assist disadvantaged youth aged 14-21 in achieving academic and employment success. The program includes dropout prevention, secondary educational completion, and Job Corps for individuals aged 16-24 meeting specific criteria. The FY2008 appropriation for Youth Activities was $924,069,000. The Job Corps program provides education, vocational training, and counseling to help individuals succeed in school or find employment. Job Corps centers in all 50 states offer opportunities for participants to earn high school equivalency certificates. The program received $1,528,427,000 in funding for FY2008. Additionally, the program awards grants to entities that support migrant and seasonal farmworker families with workforce development and related services. These services include dropout prevention, English literacy, and education assistance for economically disadvantaged migrant farmworkers. YouthBuild program provides education and employment skills to disadvantaged young adults aged 16-24. It offers competitive grants to organizations for GED or high school diploma attainment and job skill development through building affordable housing. In FY2008, the program received $58,952,000 in funding and transitioned administrative responsibility from HUD to DOL. In FY2008, YouthBuild received $58,952,000 in funding. The ESEA Title I-A LEA grant program provides assistance to state and local educational agencies for disadvantaged children, with an appropriation of $13,898,875,000. The Migrant Education Program (MEP) received $379,771,000 in FY2008 to assist migratory children. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program supports educational centers in inner-city and rural public school buildings. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities state grants program, ESEA Title IV, Subpart 1, provides funding for after-school centers in inner-city and rural public school buildings. The program targets communities with low achieving students and high rates of juvenile crime, school violence, and student drug abuse. Appropriations for FY2008 were $1,081,166,000. Priority for funding goes to programs serving children and youth not normally served by state or local educational agencies, or populations needing special services. The HEA Title V, Part A program provides competitive grants to Hispanic-serving institutions to improve services for Hispanic and low-income students, including dropout prevention and academic achievement. Priority is given to institutions collaborating with LEAs or community organizations. Appropriations for FY2008 were $93,256,000. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, authorizes Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), providing cash assistance to low-income families with children. Recipients must work within 24 months and can engage in educational activities to meet requirements. FY2008 appropriations were $17.050 billion. Reauthorization of these programs is likely in the 110th Congress, with issues related to dropouts being discussed. The ESEA, HEA, and WIA programs are up for reauthorization, with funding extensions in place. Coordination between dropout programs in the Department of Education is questioned for cost-effectiveness and student service. The Department of Education proposed replacing multiple dropout prevention programs with a new high school reform program to improve graduation rates. The idea was to streamline coordination under one office, but the interagency working group for program coordination has not been established as authorized by the Dropout Prevention Act. The Aspen Commission on NCLB recommended improving federal, state, and local dropout prevention coordination. Congress may consider establishing a working group to address dropout prevention effectiveness. Research shows mixed results for federally supported programs, with more promising outcomes at the district and school levels. Determining dropout rates and effectiveness of services may help Congress take action. Should states report graduation rates to ED? Congress may require better quality data reporting on graduation, dropout, and enrollment. Some states still report dropout data inconsistently. NCES has to manipulate data to estimate the AFGR due to inconsistent reporting. The ED and other groups advocate for accurate reporting of high school graduation rates. Data suggests that high school attainment is nearly universal for white non-Hispanics. Congress may need to strengthen requirements for reporting high school outcomes. The educational system may be reaching a \"ceiling effect\" in high school completion rates, with certain groups like Hispanic immigrants having the lowest rates. Existing programs may not be effectively targeting at-risk individuals in these groups, and there is a need for more precise federal efforts to prevent dropouts. Some argue that dropout prevention programs should focus on students who have already left school, while others believe they should target at-risk students who haven't dropped out yet. The issue of dropouts is debated as either a result of educational system problems or family/economic hardships. Concerns are raised about whether frequent testing under NCLBA may lead some students to drop out to avoid poor performance shame. The Aspen Commission report highlights the issue of schools pushing out low-performing students to improve assessment scores. The NCLBA mandated a national assessment of Title I programs, but the impact on dropouts has not been addressed. Congress may seek more information on this as they consider changes to the ESEA assessment and accountability provisions."
