    "content": "Article I, Section 8, clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to create uniform bankruptcy laws nationwide. Bankruptcy, governed by Title 11 of the U.S. Code, offers relief to debtors by discharging some or all of their debts. While it provides a fresh start for debtors, certain debts cannot be discharged, hindering their ability to move forward. Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code lists debts that cannot be discharged, but there are other debts with limited or prohibited discharge under separate legislation. Some debts are limited or prohibited from discharge in bankruptcy under legislation outside of Title 11 of the United States Code. This can cause confusion as these exceptions are not included in the Bankruptcy Code. Two bills in the 111th Congress aim to limit the dischargeability of certain debts in bankruptcy without amending the Bankruptcy Code. One bill, H.R. 3962, would amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, leaving the Bankruptcy Code unchanged. The Health Care Improvement Act would not amend the Bankruptcy Code to include limitations on discharge. H.R. 4364, the Citizen Participation Act of 2009, aims to make certain court-awarded fees or costs ineligible for discharge in bankruptcy under Sections 523 and 1328 of the Bankruptcy Code. This includes fees awarded as a result of dismissed claims or quashed subpoenas. No specific provision is included to amend the Bankruptcy Code. The bill does not amend the Bankruptcy Code to include limitations on discharge. Debts owed to the United States are mostly not dischargeable in bankruptcy, except for support obligations assigned to a state or municipality. Prohibitions on discharge within a five-year period are common in extra-Title 11 limitations, with some exceptions. Time-related provisions may allow discharge after a specified period if the court deems nondischarge of the debt unconscionable. The court has found that nondischarge of the debt would be unconscionable. Extra-Title 11 provisions limit discharge in bankruptcy, with four provisions completely prohibiting discharge. These include debts related to the Troops-to-Teachers Program, support obligations assigned to a state or municipality, debt owed to the United States for local television loan guarantees, and debts owed for life insurance premiums and interest guaranteed by the United States. The subsection U.S.C. \u00a7 303a(e) states that debts owed to the United States are not discharged in bankruptcy if less than five years have passed since the termination of the agreement or service. Provisions outside the Bankruptcy Code also limit or prohibit discharge of debts in bankruptcy, such as debts related to specific programs or obligations assigned to a state or municipality. The search initially focused on Titles 10, 14, 32, 37, 38, 42, and 50 for provisions related to bankruptcy. Specific language regarding the impact of bankruptcy on certain types of debts was found. Further searches revealed ten additional provisions outside the Bankruptcy Code related to discharge of debts. The search for provisions related to bankruptcy initially focused on specific titles of the U.S. Code. This search revealed instances outside of title 11 where the U.S. Code limits the effect of bankruptcy on discharge of indebtedness. 53 instances were identified in Titles 20, 25, and 47. The provisions are listed in numerical order of the title and section, including original and redesignated section numbers. The table lists provisions related to bankruptcy, including original titles, code sections, public laws, enactment dates, and discharge limitations. It also notes changes in language and previous code sections with the same number.
