    "content": "The Act titled \"Concussion Awareness and Education Act of 2014\" includes sections on findings, purposes, surveillance of sports-related concussions, research, biological sample repository, rules of play, dissemination of information, and a Concussion Research Commission. The Congress finds a lack of comprehensive data on sports-related concussions in youth, with an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries annually in the US. Reported concussion rates in collegiate sports have doubled from 1.7 to 3.4 per 1,000 athletes. The rate of concussions in youth sports has doubled over the past 15 years, with an increase in emergency room visits for concussive injuries by 57% between 2001 and 2009. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data on sports-related concussions and no accurate estimation of the incidence across different sports and age groups. The Act aims to increase awareness and knowledge about concussions through collaborative research efforts involving various sports associations, high school associations, trainers, federal entities, parents, coaches, and students. There is a lack of accurate data on the incidence of sports-related concussions across youth age groups and sports, highlighting the need for more research on diagnosis and treatment protocols. The Act aims to change the culture surrounding concussions among youth and their stakeholders, including parents, coaches, and students, by considering demographic variations. SEC. 4. SURVEILLANCE OF SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS. This section adds a new provision for monitoring sports-related concussions under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the CDC Director, will establish a national system to track sports-related concussions in individuals aged 5-21, including demographic information and pre-existing conditions. This is in accordance with the Concussion Awareness and Education Act of 2014. The national system will track sports-related concussions in individuals aged 5-21, including pre-existing conditions, concussion history, protective equipment use, personnel qualifications, and details of the concussive injury. The national system will track sports-related concussions in individuals aged 5-21, including details of the concussive injury such as impact nature and signs and symptoms consistent with a concussion. SEC. 5. RESEARCH. The Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Secretary of Defense will conduct research to establish metrics for concussion diagnosis and guidelines for management in youth. Studies will assess the consequences of concussions and head impacts over a lifespan. Research will focus on the effects of concussions and head impacts on quality of life, predictors of outcomes, and biomechanical determinants of injury risk in youth. The Secretary of Defense will also oversee research on sports and physical training for military personnel. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a scientific evaluation on techniques to reduce concussions in military service academies and personnel. Congress suggests that sports organizations should also evaluate techniques to reduce sports-related concussions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a national brain tissue and biological sample repository for concussion research within a year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, rules of play will be implemented. The Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Secretary of Defense will develop standards, best practices, and guidelines for sports, athletic, and military training to prevent concussions. This includes standards for protective equipment and recommendations on impact-monitoring systems. Development of these rules will begin within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Act requires the periodic review and updating of rules of play once finalized. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and disseminate information on concussions to the public through various entities. Additionally, a Concussion Research Commission will be established. The Concussion Research Commission is established with nine members appointed by various officials based on specific qualifications related to research and treatment experience. The Concussion Research Commission consists of members appointed based on their expertise in research, treatment, and prevention of concussive injuries. Each member serves for the life of the Commission, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment process. The Concussion Research Commission members serve without pay, receive travel expenses, and meet at least 4 times a year. The Secretary ensures resources are provided for the Commission's responsibilities. The Concussion Research Commission may request staff from Federal agencies to assist in their work. The Commission is tasked with studying programs related to the Act, formulating recommendations, reviewing a National Academies report on concussions in youth, and providing interim reports every 6 months. The Concussion Research Commission will submit interim reports every 6 months to Congress and a final report within 36 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission will terminate upon submitting the final report, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services decides to extend its duration."
