    "content": "The Senate has shown interest in the time taken for lower federal court nominations to be confirmed, especially compared to nominees of past Presidents. Concerns include the increase in vacant judgeships and the impact of nomination delays. This report aims to provide an overview of confirmation times, potential consequences of delays, and the current debate on the issue. The report discusses the average and median waiting times for U.S. circuit and district court nominees from nomination to confirmation for the five most recent Presidents. It also addresses potential consequences of delays in the confirmation process and suggests policy options to shorten the time from nomination to confirmation. The 113th Congress adopted a new standing order to facilitate negotiations for floor consideration of district court nominees, potentially shortening their wait time for confirmation. The report also discusses policy options to expedite the nomination to confirmation process for circuit and district court nominees, without advocating for all nominations to be processed quickly. The confirmation process for Article III judges can lead to long waiting times due to the Senate's deliberate processing to avoid rubber stamping nominations by the President. Article III of the Constitution grants life tenure to judges, including those on the Supreme Court, with no minimal qualifications or term limits. Article III courts in the federal system include the U.S. courts of appeals, U.S. district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. This report focuses on nominations to the U.S. circuit courts of appeals and district courts. Appeals from federal district court decisions are heard by the courts of appeals, which consist of judges sitting in three-member panels. The federal court system includes U.S. courts of appeals, U.S. district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. There are 13 appellate courts with 179 judgeships authorized by law. The First Circuit has 6 judgeships, while the Ninth Circuit has 29. Nominations to these judgeships are referred to as \"circuit court nominations.\" U.S. district courts are federal trial courts with 91 Article III district courts. The federal court system includes U.S. courts of appeals, U.S. district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. There are 91 Article III district courts in the U.S., with each state having at least one district court. Some states have as many as four district courts. Altogether, there are 673 authorized U.S. district court judgeships, with Congress authorizing between 1 and 28 judgeships for each district court. Additionally, there are three U.S. territorial courts established by Congress. The federal court system includes U.S. courts of appeals, U.S. district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. There are 673 authorized U.S. district court judgeships, with each state having at least one district court. Some states have as many as four district courts. In total, there are 677 judgeships, including territorial judgeships. This section provides statistics on the time taken for circuit and district court nominees to be confirmed by the Senate, showing an increase in confirmation time since President Reagan's tenure. President George W. Bush's circuit court nominees had the longest average wait time of 350.6 days from nomination to confirmation. President Obama's nominees had the second-longest wait time of 257 days, followed by President Clinton's nominees at 238.2 days. Various factors can affect the time taken for confirmation, including opposition from the minority party, scheduling decisions, and delays in background information. President Obama's circuit court nominees had the longest median wait time from nomination to confirmation at 229 days, followed by President George W. Bush's nominees at 216 days, President Clinton's at 139 days, President George H.W. Bush's at 85.5 days, and President Reagan's at 45 days. President Obama's confirmed nominees for district courts waited an average of 220.8 days from nomination to confirmation, while President G.W. Bush's nominees waited 178.8 days. President Clinton's nominees waited 135 days on average, G.H.W. Bush's nominees waited 103.8 days, and Reagan's nominees waited 67.9 days. The median waiting times ranged from 215 days for Obama to 41 days for Reagan. The remaining Presidents had median waiting times of 141.5 days (G.W. Bush), 99 days (Clinton), and 93 days (G.H.W. Bush). The Senate adopted a new standing order in the 113th Congress to expedite floor consideration of district court nominations. This new procedure allows for quicker final action on nominations with majority support, reducing post-cloture consideration from 30 hours to 2 hours. The Senate adopted a new standing order in the 113th Congress to expedite floor consideration of district court nominations, reducing post-cloture consideration from 30 hours to 2 hours. The majority leader indicated the intent to continue negotiating unanimous consent agreements for such nominations. Insufficient data is available to determine the effectiveness of the standing order in shortening the confirmation process. Scholars and others have suggested the possibility of renewing the standing order in the future. Scholars have identified consequences of long waiting times for judicial nominees, including increased vacancy rates for U.S. circuit and district court judgeships. Vacancy rates have been historically high during presidencies with longer confirmation times. President Obama is the only president mentioned in the context. President Obama is the only president since President Reagan to see an increase in district court vacancy rates during a first term without creating new judgeships. This increase in vacancy rates coincided with historically long waiting times for district court nominees, which could impact federal court management and caseloads. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., and former Chief Justice William Rehnquist have both highlighted the negative impact of judicial vacancies on the quality and efficiency of judicial administration. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the uneven distribution of vacancies across judicial districts, leading to burdensome caseloads for sitting judges. He called for urgent action from the political branches to address this issue. Similarly, former Chief Justice Rehnquist warned that high vacancy levels could result in case backlogs, delays, and the need for temporary measures, ultimately eroding the quality of justice. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., and former Chief Justice William Rehnquist have highlighted the negative impact of judicial vacancies on the quality and efficiency of judicial administration. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the need to quickly fill vacancies to maintain effective and efficient federal courts. He urged the President to nominate qualified candidates promptly and the Senate to act promptly on their confirmation. The prolonged nomination process may deter qualified individuals from accepting nominations, affecting the judiciary's staffing and quality of justice. Such interference in the nomination process for federal judgeships, especially for nominees from private practice, can deter qualified individuals from accepting nominations due to financial disincentives and potential loss of clients during the confirmation wait. The prolonged confirmation process is stressful and costly for nominees and their families, impacting the quality and efficiency of judicial administration. The delay in the confirmation process for federal judgeships can be financially burdensome for nominees, leading to stress and potential loss of clients. This extended wait may also politicize the confirmation process, giving the impression that ideological or partisan considerations are the primary factors in nominee selection. The confirmation process for federal judgeships can be financially burdensome and lead to stress for nominees. There is concern that a highly partisan selection process may undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of the courts. Former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach argues that trial judges' political or ideological views are not as important as their experience and fairness in rulings. The confirmation process for federal judgeships can be burdensome and stressful for nominees. A prolonged confirmation process with partisan or ideological conflicts may politicize judiciary issues that typically have bipartisan support. This section discusses proposals to shorten the time from nomination to confirmation for U.S. circuit and district court nominees, aiming to prevent politicization and intrusions on adjudicatory functions. These proposals are not mutually exclusive and could be combined in a Senate policy to expedite judicial nominee confirmations. The Senate could adopt a time table with deadlines for judicial nomination process, as proposed by Presidents G.W. Bush and Obama. This aims to expedite the confirmation process for lower federal court nominees. President Bush proposed deadlines for judicial nominees to (1) have a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee within 90 days of nomination, and (2) receive a Senate vote within 180 days. He argued that strict deadlines ensure prompt and fair consideration. President Obama called for a Senate rule requiring nominees to receive an up-or-down vote within 90 days. Senator Arlen also supported similar proposals in 2004. In 2004, Senator Arlen Specter proposed time tables for Senate action on judicial nominations, including deadlines for hearings and votes. The proposal allowed for extensions up to 30 days, with a maximum timeline of 90 days from nomination to final Senate action. The Senate's concerns about adopting time tables for judicial nominations include enforcement, potential influence on nominee selection, and possible lengthening of the confirmation process. For example, Jane Kelly's nomination to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals took 83 days from nomination to confirmation. The Senate is considering implementing fast-track procedures for judicial nominations to expedite the confirmation process, especially for uncontroversial nominees like Jane Kelly, whose confirmation took 83 days. One proposal involves giving fast-track consideration to nominees recommended by bipartisan commissions in their home states. The Senate is considering fast-track procedures for judicial nominations, especially for uncontroversial nominees like Jane Kelly. One proposal involves giving fast-track consideration to nominees recommended by bipartisan commissions in their home states. The Senate adopted a new confirmation process for nominations to 272 positions across various agencies, boards, and councils. S.Res. 116 allows nominations to bypass formal committee consideration unless a single Senator objects. These positions are typically uncontroversial and require little debate for confirmation. Once nominated, positions are placed on the Senate's Executive Calendar as \"privileged nominations.\" The nomination process under S.Res. 116 allows nominations to bypass formal committee consideration unless a Senator objects. The nomination remains on the list of \"privileged nominations\" for 10 session days before moving to the list of \"nominations\" on the Executive Calendar. Any Senator can request that the nomination be referred to committee before it is placed on the calendar. S.Res. 116 allows nominations to bypass formal committee consideration unless a Senator objects, expediting the process for uncontroversial nominations. The Senate Judiciary Committee retains its information-gathering function, but removing the need for committee action may shorten the time from nomination to confirmation, particularly for U.S. district court judgeships. The Senate may give privileged status to nominations for U.S. district court judgeships based on various criteria, such as recommendations from a bipartisan commission, support from a home state Senator of the opposite party, or designation as a \"judicial emergency.\" They could also set a fixed percentage of nominations as privileged, like allowing 25% to streamline the confirmation process for uncontroversial nominees. This approach aims to ensure consistency, predictability, and prompt approval by all Senators. Some Senators may have concerns about treating certain judicial nominations as privileged, as it could bypass the Judiciary Committee's review process. Senators may also hesitate to remove a nomination from the privileged list to avoid signaling potential issues. Additionally, a Senator could delay the confirmation process by objecting after nine days on the privileged list, restarting the process. The Senate could address concerns about expediting the confirmation process by requiring more than one Senator to object to a nomination being listed as privileged. Another option is to treat district court nominations differently than circuit court nominations to relieve pressure on the district courts. The proposal suggests three changes to expedite the confirmation process for district court nominees: streamlining the Judiciary Committee questionnaire to focus on legal experience, eliminating routine committee hearings, and requiring more than one Senator to object to a nomination being listed as privileged. The proposal aims to expedite the confirmation process for district court nominees by eliminating routine committee hearings. Instead, nominees would follow a process similar to U.S. attorney positions, with a minimum referral time and a vote at the next business meeting. The proposal suggests expediting the confirmation process for district court nominees by eliminating routine committee hearings and ensuring a prompt vote shortly after being reported by the Judiciary Committee. This aims to streamline the process similar to U.S. attorney positions. The proposal aims to expedite the confirmation process for district court nominees by allowing the majority leader to call for an 'expedited' confirmation vote after a nomination has been on the floor for one week. This procedure would require a higher threshold for confirmation, potentially reducing individual Senators' leverage in withholding consent. The Senate could consider creating time frames to shorten the judicial confirmation process for district court nominees, potentially standardizing the process across presidencies. Enforcement of these time frames could be a challenge. The Senate may fast-track certain judicial nominations, such as \"privileged\" nominations for district court vacancies deemed emergencies or uncontroversial. However, concerns exist about preserving the Judiciary Committee's role in the nomination process. The Senate may fast-track certain judicial nominations for district court vacancies by streamlining the Judiciary Committee questionnaire, eliminating routine hearings, and expediting floor consideration. Senators may be hesitant to change the process for district court nominees due to concerns about assessing nominees' competence or temperament."
