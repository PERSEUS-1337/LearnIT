    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teacher Education for Autistic Children Act of 2007\" or the \"TEACH Act of 2007\". It includes findings, purpose, and definition. The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has increased from 1 in 500 to 1 in 150 in the past decade. Autism is a complex developmental disability affecting social interaction and communication, with varying degrees of severity. Individuals with autism process and respond to information uniquely, sometimes exhibiting aggressive or self-injurious behavior. The rising number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder poses challenges for families and educators. Factors influencing education services for individuals with autism include their unique information processing, variability in how autism affects each person, success in regular classrooms, and communication and socialization deficits. The purpose of this Act is to increase the number of teachers and teaching assistants with expertise in autism spectrum disorders by providing a refundable tax credit for qualified education expenses. Autism spectrum disorders are defined as Pervasive Developmental Disorder by the DSM-IV-TR. Children with autism who receive appropriate educational services show significant functional improvements. The Act aims to boost the number of educators with autism spectrum disorder expertise through a refundable tax credit for education expenses. This includes training and education related to autism spectrum disorders. The tax credit allows eligible individuals to claim qualified expenses for education related to autism spectrum disorders, up to $10,000 per year. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and interest on education loans. The tax credit allows individuals to claim qualified expenses for education related to autism spectrum disorders, up to $10,000 per year. Courses or programs must be approved by the State to qualify, and no double benefits are allowed. Total qualified expenses are reduced by amounts taken into account for other education provisions. The tax credit for education expenses related to autism spectrum disorders is subject to certain exclusions and deductions under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The provision does not apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2012. Additionally, a technical amendment is made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding new items and making technical and clerical amendments to specific sections. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include education and training for autism spectrum disorders and overpayments of tax. These amendments will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
