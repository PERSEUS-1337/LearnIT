    "content": "Modification of death gratuity payment scheme for Armed Forces members. Congress found that the death gratuity for deceased members of the Armed Forces was initially meant to provide immediate financial assistance to survivors before other benefits kick in. The gratuity was originally six months of a service member's pay and was capped at $3,000 until 1991. After the events of September 11, 2001, Congress decided to significantly increase the death benefits for survivors of Armed Forces members. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 substantially increased the death gratuity to $100,000 retroactively to October 7, 2001. Service members cannot choose beneficiaries other than those designated in the law. The Survivor Benefit Plan, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, and death gratuity provide support to deceased Armed Forces members' next of kin. Members should have the right to choose beneficiaries for death benefits, especially before deployment. Currently, some members designate beneficiaries not allowed by law, leading to their wishes not being fulfilled to the detriment of their loved ones. Members of the Armed Forces should have the opportunity to choose who receives the death gratuity. The Secretary of Defense and military departments should ensure members can make written elections about the gratuity's disposition and receive counseling on how the proceeds will be administered. Subsection (a) of section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to allow individuals designated in writing to receive the death gratuity. The amended section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, allows for the designation of recipients for the death gratuity in the following order: designated individual, surviving spouse, children and descendants, parents, executor or administrator of the estate, and other next of kin as per the laws of domicile at the time of death. The amended section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, allows for the designation of recipients for the death gratuity in a specific order. The amendments include changes to subsections (b), (c), and (d), with a focus on defining parents for the purposes of subsection (a)(4). The amendments will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. The provisions of section 1477 of title 10, United States Code, will continue to apply until January 1, 2008, or until a member makes a specific designation. The Secretary of Defense must implement regulations by April 1, 2007, to enact the amendments. The regulations required by subsection (c) include forms and instructions for members of the Armed Forces to make a specific designation under section 1477(a) of title 10, United States Code."
