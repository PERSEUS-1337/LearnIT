    "content": "Health care reform is a top priority for the 111th Congress due to concerns about the uninsured and rising healthcare costs. Both the House and Senate have passed comprehensive legislation, with the House approving the Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) on November 7, 2009. This legislation aims to improve access to care and control costs by making changes to healthcare financing and delivery. The House and Senate have passed health reform bills, with the Senate passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) on December 24, 2009. The House is preparing to vote on H.R. 3590 and an accompanying reconciliation bill (H.R. 4872) to amend the legislation. If approved, H.R. 3590 will be sent to the President for signing into law. The House and Senate have passed health reform bills, with the Senate passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) on December 24, 2009. The House is preparing to vote on H.R. 3590 and an accompanying reconciliation bill (H.R. 4872) to amend the legislation. If approved, H.R. 3590 will be sent to the President for signing into law. The report summarizes the workforce, prevention, quality, and related provisions in H.R. 3962, focusing on improving patient safety and eradicating disparities in care. The challenges in healthcare include reducing disease burden, improving access and quality of care, addressing chronic diseases, and eliminating unnecessary and ineffective care. Health reform proposals aim to encourage healthier lifestyles, change treatment approaches, and expand the primary care workforce. The current healthcare system values specialty care over primary care, leading to fragmented care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Care coordination is crucial to avoid waste and improve outcomes. Health workforce policy is a key aspect of the health reform debate, aiming to transform the delivery system towards more comprehensive and coordinated care. Transforming the healthcare system to prioritize primary care, disease prevention, and chronic illness management requires significant changes in health professions education. While concerns about a future physician shortage exist, simply increasing physician numbers may not improve accessibility or quality of care. Physician distribution is influenced more by personal preferences than patient needs, and higher physician supply does not necessarily lead to better patient outcomes or satisfaction. Many health policy analysts suggest focusing on improving care quality rather than solely increasing physician supply. Expanding the use of clinical preventive services, such as immunizations and screening tests, is a key goal of delivery reform to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs. Proponents also advocate for training more primary care physicians and developing integrated care systems to enhance the overall quality of care. The concept of a medical home aims to improve care quality through partnerships between patients and primary care physicians. Disease management programs, focused on specific conditions like diabetes, help patients manage their care through education and treatment adherence. These programs are similar to medical homes but are typically run by health plans. Health care delivery reform focuses on driving change in care systems through performance measurement, public dissemination of performance information, comparative effectiveness research, adoption of health information technology, and aligning payment incentives with high-quality care. Improvements in healthcare quality require providers to have financial incentives to change how they deliver services, moving away from fee-for-service towards linking provider payments to performance on quality measures. The use of performance measures to track the quality of care is expanding in both private and public health sectors. Public reporting of quality information is crucial for helping patients make informed choices about healthcare services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) aimed to reform the healthcare delivery system by promoting the adoption of health information technology. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) aimed to promote the widespread adoption of health information technology (HIT) for electronic sharing of clinical data among healthcare stakeholders. It included $2 billion for HIT grant programs authorized by the HITECH Act, emphasizing the importance of HIT in healthcare reform. HIT encompasses electronic health records (EHRs), computerized systems for ordering tests and medications, and a national health information network for secure data exchange among providers. HIT is seen as a tool to improve care delivery efficiency by eliminating paper-based processes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act aimed to promote the adoption of health information technology (HIT) for electronic sharing of clinical data among healthcare stakeholders. HIT includes electronic health records (EHRs) and computerized systems for ordering tests and medications. It can improve care efficiency by eliminating paper-based processes and identifying harmful drug interactions. H.R. 3962 consists of four divisions, addressing private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid programs. It aims to improve healthcare quality through HIT and provide data for research and performance measurement. The bill H.R. 3962 aims to improve healthcare quality through HIT and expand Medicaid eligibility. Division C focuses on increasing the primary care workforce, promoting preventive services, and strengthening quality measurement. Division D includes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2009. The provisions related to a new national insurance program for purchasing community living assistance services and supports are discussed separately. The House bill H.R. 3962 covers various healthcare provisions including Public Health Investment Fund, Health Centers, Health Workforce, Prevention and Wellness, Maternal and Child Health, Behavioral Health, Quality, Health Disparities, Health Information Technology, Emergency Care, Pain Care and Management, FDA regulations, 340B Drug Pricing, Health Provider-Industry Financial Relationships, and Miscellaneous topics. Each section provides background on current law and describes the bill's provisions. The House bill H.R. 3962 includes health, workforce, and quality provisions. References to \"the Secretary\" pertain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A companion report summarizes Senate-passed health reform legislation comparable to the House provisions. Additional reports discuss insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid provisions in H.R. 3962. The House bill H.R. 3962 includes health, workforce, and quality provisions. References to \"the Secretary\" pertain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A companion report summarizes Senate-passed health reform legislation comparable to the House provisions. Additional reports discuss insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and Indian Health Care provisions in H.R. 3962. H.R. 3962 includes new authorizations of appropriations for PHSA programs, creating a Public Health Investment Fund for additional funding. The legislation also includes provisions for appropriation of amounts from the Fund for specified programs. The bill includes provisions for a Public Health Investment Fund, with deposits from general revenues totaling $4.6 billion for FY2011 to $9.0 billion for FY2015. These amounts are authorized for specific programs in addition to regular appropriations. The bill establishes a Public Health Investment Fund with deposits from general revenues totaling $4.6 billion for FY2011 to $9.0 billion for FY2015. The Fund would be authorized for specific programs including Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Health Service Corps, community health centers, and workforce programs under PHSA Titles VII and VIII. Appropriation levels in the Fund would be scored as direct spending and incorporated into future budget baseline projections. The Public Health Investment Fund established by H.R. 3962 appropriates funds for specific programs including community health centers. These centers play a vital role in providing primary care and preventive services to uninsured and underinsured individuals, regardless of their ability to pay. They are located in medically underserved areas and offer sliding scale fee arrangements for patients. The Public Health Investment Fund appropriates funds for community health centers in medically underserved areas. These centers provide primary care and preventive services to uninsured individuals. Health centers receiving Sec. 330 funding have liability protection from medical malpractice claims under FTCA. However, this coverage does not extend to volunteer healthcare providers. Barriers to provider volunteerism include lack of time, licensure costs, misperceptions about litigiousness, and limited capacity of health centers to recruit and retain volunteers. The Health Care Safety Net Act of 2008 reauthorized the program for community health centers, which have increased from 3,500 sites in 2002 to 9,000 sites in 2009. The Act also mandated a study on the economic costs and benefits of school-based health clinics. Health centers improve access to primary care services, reducing disparities and costs by preventing expensive emergency room visits. Proposed amendments would authorize necessary funding for the health center program from FY2013 to FY2015. The proposed amendments would authorize additional funding for the health center program from FY2011 to FY2015, including liability protections for volunteer practitioners and grants for School-Based Health Clinics. The Secretary would issue regulations for third-party reimbursement at School-Based Health Clinics funded through the grant program. Priority given to applicants with a history of serving underserved children and adolescents. $50 million authorized for FY2011, with additional funding for FY2012 to FY2015. New section added for Nurse-Managed Health Centers. The new section would establish a program to award grants for Nurse-Managed Health Centers. Eligible entities must match 20% of the grant amount from nonfederal sources and use funds to supplement other sources. The Secretary can award planning grants to assess the needs of the underserved population. The Nurse-Managed Health Centers program would provide grants to serve medically underserved populations, offering primary care regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. Funding would be authorized for FY2011 through FY2015, supporting services by various healthcare providers. This initiative complements existing health professions education programs aimed at promoting community-based and rural practice, primary care, and opportunities for minority and disadvantaged students. In the 1970s, annual funding for Title VII programs reached over $2.5 billion (in 2009 dollars), but in recent years, it has been about $200 million. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program provides scholarships and student loan repayments for medical students, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others who agree to work in Health Professional Shortage Areas. However, there is high demand for NHSC clinicians compared to available scholarships. The NHSC program faces high demand for clinicians seeking scholarships or loan repayment opportunities, exceeding the program's budget. Currently, NHSC fills only 8% of the total need for primary care practitioners in HPSAs. Medicare covers GME costs through DGME and IME payments to teaching hospitals. Medicare provides GME payments to teaching hospitals through DGME and IME payments, which compensate for higher patient care costs in teaching hospitals due to factors like sicker patients and inexperienced residents. IME payments are a percentage add-on based on resident-to-bed ratio, while DGME payments include time spent in patient care and non-patient care activities. In 2008, over $9 billion in DGME and IME payments were made to 1,100 teaching hospitals to train 90,000 residents. The Medicare GME payments are seen as crucial for shaping future health workforce policy by linking subsidies to delivery system reform and encouraging training in nonhospital settings. A proposed amendment would allow NHSC service obligations to be fulfilled on a half-time basis with a longer service commitment or reduced loan repayment. The section proposes amendments to the NHSC program, including increasing the maximum annual loan repayment amount to $50,000 and allowing teaching to count as clinical practice for up to 20% of the service period. It also authorizes appropriations for NHSC program operations through FY2015 and from the Public Health Investment Fund for specific amounts in subsequent years. The section proposes amendments to the NHSC program, including increasing the maximum annual loan repayment amount and authorizing appropriations for NHSC scholarships and loan repayments through FY2015. It also establishes a demonstration program for incentive payments to NHSC clinicians in high-need areas. The section authorizes appropriations for student loan programs for health professions students and grants for health professions schools to develop training programs. It also includes provisions to increase the supply of primary care providers through new loan repayment programs. The PHSA Title III would establish the Frontline Health Professional Loan Repayment Program for individuals serving in medically underserved areas. It would define eligibility requirements and primary health services, such as family medicine and mental health. The Frontline Health Professional Loan Repayment Program requires individuals to serve in health professional needs areas for two or more years. The Secretary would pay a portion of their educational loan, and unobligated funds would be transferred to the NHSC for recruiting participants. PHSA Sec. 340J mandates an annual report to Congress on the Frontline Health Professional Loan Repayment Program. PHSA Sec. 340K specifies fund allocation for loan repayments, with 90% for primary health professionals and 10% for non-primary health professionals. PHSA Sec. 735 outlines provisions for student loan fund administration, including considering financial contributions from family members. The new Sec. 747, Primary Care Training and Enhancement, would require loan applicants to submit financial information and consider their financial independence. It aims to support training programs in primary care such as family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or geriatrics through grants or contracts with eligible entities like hospitals, schools of medicine, and physician assistant training programs. The new section focuses on capacity building grants for schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine, with preference given to those training primary care providers for underserved populations. The Secretary must submit an annual report on the program and create a new section for training residents in community-based settings. The Secretary must award grants for primary care residency training programs in community-based settings, giving preference to FQHCs, rural health clinics, and programs serving vulnerable populations or individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Annual reports to Congress are required. This section amends PHSA Title VII, Part C. The new PHSA Sec. 749 would require the Secretary to make grants or enter into contracts with dental schools and other specified entities to support training programs for dental students, residents, hygienists, or practicing dentists in general, pediatric, or public health dentistry, with a preference for programs placing graduates in underserved communities. The new PHSA Sec. 799C authorizes funding for training programs in general, pediatric, or public health dentistry, with a preference for disadvantaged backgrounds and underserved areas. $240 million for FY2011 and $253 for other purposes. Annual report to Congress required. The bill authorizes funding for training programs in dentistry with a preference for disadvantaged backgrounds and underserved areas. It also requires a study on the effectiveness of NHSC and Frontline Health Provider programs, evaluating scholarships vs. loan repayments for incentivizing primary care providers. PHSA Title VIII supports nursing workforce development programs. The House bill proposes modifications to existing nursing education funding programs, including the deletion of the cultural competency grant program and the addition of two new programs. It also expands eligibility for nursing workforce development programs to include nurse-managed health centers. The House bill proposes changes to nursing education funding programs, including deleting the cultural competency grant program and adding new reporting requirements. It also expands eligibility for nursing workforce development programs and revises grant activity priorities. The House bill proposes changes to nursing education funding programs, including increasing loan funds for students and expanding eligibility for nurse faculty programs. Loan limits would be raised and adjusted for inflation, while eligibility for loan repayment and scholarship programs would be extended to individuals serving as nurse faculty. The Nurse Faculty Loan Program limit would also be raised. The section in the House bill proposes changes to nursing education funding programs, including increasing loan funds for students and expanding eligibility for nurse faculty programs. It would authorize appropriations for various nursing grants and programs through FY2015, as well as establish a new section for appropriations from the Public Health Investment Fund. The House bill proposes increasing funding for nursing education programs through FY2015, including a new partnership grant program to support nurse education, practice, and retention. Eligible entities can receive matching grants for nurse training programs, with a focus on improving nurse retention, workforce diversity, and quality of nursing. The House bill proposes a partnership grant program to support nurse education, practice, and retention. Grants would require a dollar-for-dollar match and be available for FY2011 through FY2015. The Secretary of Education would establish a demonstration grant program to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools, with special consideration for high-need applicants. The House bill proposes a partnership grant program to support nurse education, practice, and retention. Grants would require a dollar-for-dollar match and be available for FY2011 through FY2015. Eligible local educational agencies would be those with a student-to-school nurse ratio of 750 or more students. High-need agencies serve at least 10,000 children from low-income families or have 20% of children from low-income families. The Secretary of Education could require non-federal matching contributions from grant recipients. Authorized funding for this program would be available for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Public Health Workforce Corps (PHWC) to address critical public health workforce shortages. This new program would be similar to the National Health Service Corps and would focus on shortage areas in state, local, and tribal health departments, as well as FQHCs. The Secretary of Health would be required to use the PHWC to address workforce shortages. The Public Health Workforce Corps (PHWC) would provide scholarships and loan repayment for service in shortage areas. It would replace PHSA Sec. 765 with a grant program for health professions schools and entities training professionals for underserved communities, minority groups, public health specialties, and governmental public health. This section proposes amending the Public Health Training Centers to align with the National Prevention and Wellness Strategy instead of the Healthy People goals. It also replaces the current preventive medicine residency training program with new language for awarding grants or contracts. The proposal includes amending residency training programs in preventive medicine and public health by awarding grants or contracts to eligible entities such as accredited schools of medicine, hospitals, and health departments. It authorizes appropriations for various public health workforce training programs through FY2015 and establishes a Public Health Investment Fund for these provisions. The Public Health Investment Fund would authorize appropriations for public health workforce provisions, including programs to promote diversity in the health workforce. Amounts authorized to be appropriated from the Fund are $51 million for FY2011, $54 million for FY2012, $57 million for FY2013, $59 million for FY2014, and $62 million for FY2015. Title VIII, Sec. 821 authorizes grants to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Title VII, Part D authorizes grant programs to support interdisciplinary, community-based health workforce training. The House legislation includes amendments to existing workforce diversity and training programs, such as increasing the annual loan repayment amount to $35,000 and eliminating certain requirements for nursing workforce diversity grants. The new section in the legislation would require the Secretary to coordinate health workforce diversity programs and amend existing grant programs for training healthcare professionals in cultural and linguistic competency. Grants would be awarded to develop, test, and implement training programs in health professions schools and academic health centers. The legislation would require the Secretary to award grants for training programs promoting interdisciplinary care models. It also includes provisions for workforce information analysis and evaluation of pediatric rheumatologists. The legislation includes two sections establishing an Advisory Committee on Health Workforce Evaluation and Assessment, recommending classifications and methodologies for the health workforce. The Secretary must consult with the Secretaries of Education and Labor for these activities. The legislation establishes an Advisory Committee on Health Workforce Evaluation and Assessment to collect data on the health workforce and individuals in specified programs. The Secretary can collaborate with entities and federal agencies for data collection activities. Annual reports to Congress are required on Advisory Committee activities and data collection efforts. The section authorizes appropriations from the Public Health Investment Fund for health professions training, diversity, interdisciplinary training programs, and activities related to data collection. Amounts allocated for specified PHSA sections range from $90 million to $113 million annually through FY2015. The section authorizes appropriations from the Public Health Investment Fund for various health workforce programs under the PHSA, including Centers of Excellence, scholarships for disadvantaged students, faculty loan repayments, and grants for cultural competency training. Medicare caps the number of residents used for GME payments at 1996 levels, with a one-time redistribution option introduced in 2003. Medicare allows teaching hospitals to redistribute resident positions based on specific priorities, with rural teaching hospitals exempt from this redistribution. The payment formulas for these positions differ from those used for other residents. Medicare does not dictate the type or mix of resident physicians trained by hospitals, and GME payments are not tied to specific educational goals. Teaching hospitals can receive payments for residents rotating in non-hospital settings if certain conditions are met. H.R. 3962 includes regulations on stipends, fringe benefits, and supervision costs for resident physicians in hospital settings. Time spent in non-patient care activities is not counted for payment calculations. Hospitals are discouraged from rotations in non-hospital settings, but there is value in residents gaining experience in community health centers and nursing facilities. Residency programs are mainly based in acute-care teaching hospitals. H.R. 3962 aims to make changes to Medicare regarding residency positions in teaching hospitals. Criteria would be established to reduce resident limits for hospitals with unused positions, redistributing 90% of them to other qualifying hospitals. Qualifying hospitals can receive up to 20 additional residents, with a focus on training primary care residents. Preference is given to hospitals filling positions promptly. The proposed changes to Medicare regarding residency positions in teaching hospitals include criteria for redistributing unused positions to qualifying hospitals based on various factors. Payments for redistributed positions would be the same as existing positions, with a focus on primary care training and preference for hospitals filling positions promptly. All time spent by residents in patient care activities would count towards payments, regardless of the setting. The HHS Office of the Inspector General would assess the increase in time spent by medical residents training in non-hospital settings. A demonstration project would allow approved teaching health centers to contract with teaching hospitals for primary care residency training, covering residents' costs and making them eligible for payments. Residents training at approved teaching health centers would be eligible for DGME payments to cover costs, not counted towards contracting hospital's cap on residents. Resident time spent in non-patient care activities at non-hospital settings would be counted towards DGME payment, including leave time as long as it doesn't extend training program duration. Medicare would adopt similar rules for counting residents' leave when calculating IME payments. When calculating IME payments, Medicare would adopt rules for counting residents' leave time, including time spent in hospital settings on non-patient care activities. The Secretary would establish a process to redistribute medical residency slots from closing hospitals to increase residency limits for other hospitals in the same state. Goals for medical residency training programs would be established. The government would establish goals for medical residency training programs, including training residents to work in various settings, coordinate patient care, understand costs, work in teams, identify errors in healthcare delivery, and use electronic health records. The GAO would evaluate the programs' compliance within 18 months and make recommendations for curriculum requirements and accreditation processes. H.R. 3962 includes workforce provisions for health sciences training in secondary schools, medical school development, direct care workforce, family caregivers, and grants for online health workforce programs. The Secretary can establish a grants program for developing health sciences curricula at the secondary school level in partnership with specified entities to prepare students for health professions. The section authorizes grants for developing medical schools in designated areas, with funds for construction, equipment, faculty development, and operations. Grantees must secure nonfederal funding and $100 million is authorized annually for FY2011-FY2015. Additionally, Title II, Sec. 202 of the Older Americans Act authorizes functions of the Administration on Aging and the Assistant Secretary for Aging. The Older Americans Act (OAA) would be amended to require the Assistant Secretary for Aging to make recommendations on investments in the direct care workforce and establish a Personal Care Attendant Workforce Advisory Panel. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) provides support to family caregivers of the elderly through various services. Funding for the NFCSP is authorized for FY2007 through FY2011. Sec. 303(e) authorizes funding for the NFCSP from FY2007 to FY2011. OAA Sec. 303(e)(2) would increase funding to $250 million for FY2011 through FY2013. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with HRSA's NCHWA, will establish a website for health care labor market information. WIA provides job training services through DOL's ETA. WIA Title I, Sec. 171 establishes pilot programs for innovative employment and training approaches. The section proposes new grants for online health workforce training programs, with funding of $50 million for FY2011 through FY2020. It also includes grants for technical assistance and data dissemination to postsecondary educational institutions. The Online Health Professions Training Program Clearinghouse would be authorized to receive $1 million annually from FY2011 through FY2020. Prevention interventions can be clinical (e.g., cancer screenings) or community-based (e.g., exercise campaigns), with employer \"wellness\" programs utilizing both. While these interventions can improve health, some clinical services like cancer screenings may not result in cost savings for payers. There is ongoing debate on whether preventive services could save money in a broader context and the overall impact on work productivity. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services recommends reducing beneficiary cost-sharing to increase utilization of screening mammography. However, there is insufficient evidence to make the same recommendation for cervical or colorectal cancer screening. Current law addresses prevention through coverage of clinical preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid, community-based research, disease prevention, and health promotion programs funded through federal grants. The federal government supports evidence review processes for clinical and community-based prevention interventions, regulates certain employer-provided wellness programs, and funds health promotion programs through federal grants. Medicare Part B covers various clinical preventive services, including screenings and vaccines, while Medicare Part D covers FDA-licensed vaccines. Congress has waived cost-sharing for some Medicare covered services. Title II of Division A of this bill would establish requirements for \"qualified health benefits plans\" that cover preventive services for Medicare beneficiaries, including waiving cost-sharing for some services. Medicaid state plans must cover preventive services for beneficiaries under 21 years of age, but coverage for adults is not explicitly required by current law. Medicare Advantage plans have flexibility in cost-sharing for preventive services. Title II of Division A of this bill would establish requirements for \"qualified health benefits plans\" (QHBPs), including coverage of preventive services with waived cost-sharing for certain services. QHBPs must meet federal requirements for consumer protections and cover a specified list of services in an \"essential benefits package\" starting in 2013. The bill establishes requirements for \"qualified health benefits plans\" (QHBPs) to cover preventive services with waived cost-sharing. Coverage would begin in 2013 for new private health plans and by 2018 for existing group health plans. The bill also amends SSA Sec. 1861 to define \"Medicare covered preventive services\" and waives cost-sharing for colorectal cancer screening services starting in 2011. The curr_chunk discusses Medicare Part B coverage for federally recommended vaccines, Medicare reimbursement for preventive services at FQHCs, and designation of certified diabetes educators for diabetes self-management training services. It also mentions Medicaid state plans covering preventive services for all beneficiaries. The curr_chunk discusses amending Medicaid state plans to cover preventive services recommended by the Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services or vaccines recommended by the CDC for all beneficiaries, without cost-sharing. It also mentions amending Medicaid law to include all drugs with rebate agreements and removing prescription smoking cessation products from the list of drugs states can exclude from coverage. The curr_chunk discusses amending Medicaid state plans to cover prescription and FDA-approved nonprescription smoking cessation products for which rebate agreements are in effect. It also mentions amending SSA Sec. 1928 to add VFC-eligible children criteria. This section proposes amending SSA Sec. 1928 to include public health clinics as providers for administering vaccines to eligible children under the VFC program. Employer-sponsored wellness programs are subject to HIPAA's nondiscrimination rules and may be affected by statutes like the ADA. HIPAA generally prohibits health plans from denying enrollment based on health status, but allows exceptions for plans offering incentives to join wellness programs. Wellness programs offering incentives for achieving health-related outcomes must meet certain requirements to be considered nondiscriminatory under HIPAA. These requirements include having a program designed to promote health, offering it to all eligible employees, and providing reasonable alternatives for those who cannot meet the goals. The ADA also prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment and benefits. Health programs are exempt from ADA requirements if participation is voluntary and health information is kept confidential. Incentives in wellness programs may make them involuntary, subject to federal health privacy laws like HIPAA. The program provides and bills for health care services, operated by an entity with a HIPAA-compliant contract. ARRA strengthened business associate requirements, making entities criminally liable for violating HIPAA privacy protections. The HIPAA privacy rule allows health plans to disclose information to employers under certain conditions. Secretaries of HHS and Labor would establish a grant program to help small employers cover 50% of costs for employee wellness programs. Allowable costs would be those attributable to the wellness program, not the health plan or insurance coverage. Grants would not cover the cost of food. The Secretaries of HHS and Labor would establish a grant program to help small employers cover 50% of costs for employee wellness programs. Grants would be capped at $150 per employee per year and $50,000 in total for an employer. Qualified wellness programs must meet specific criteria and include components like health awareness, education, screenings, employee engagement, and behavioral change activities. Work policies on tobacco use, food choices, stress management, and physical activity are also required. The program components required for certification include health awareness, education, screenings, employee engagement, and behavioral change activities. Employee participation cannot be mandated, and incentives for participation cannot be tied to health plan costs. Employee health information collected must be confidential and only used for program administration. Funding would be authorized for the Prevention and Wellness Trust under a new PHSA Title XXXI. The Trust will receive funds from the Public Health Investment Fund for FY2011 to FY2015. The Secretary must create a National Prevention and Wellness Strategy to enhance health through prevention activities. The National Prevention and Wellness Strategy aims to improve public health through prevention activities, including infrastructure improvements. It includes establishing two task forces to review and recommend clinical and community preventive services, with a focus on addressing health disparities. Sec. 3141-3143 of the National Prevention and Wellness Strategy focuses on research in prevention and wellness, including funding for projects on incentives. The Secretary would fund research and demonstration projects on incentives to promote wellness and healthy behaviors, focusing on tobacco use, obesity, and other priorities. If proven effective, incentives would be included in the essential benefits package and allowed use of grant funds, without discriminatory effects. Subtitle E, Sec. 3151 of the bill authorizes appropriations from the Trust for delivering community prevention and wellness services, emphasizing reducing health disparities. Grants would fund programs addressing priority areas identified in the Strategy, with funds not for construction or services covered by Qualified Health Benefits Plans. Subtitle F, Secs. 3161 and 3162 of the bill authorize grants to state health departments for core public health infrastructure needs, with specified funding amounts allocated annually. Maintenance of effort requirements apply to grant programs, and a voluntary program is to be developed by the CDC Director. The CDC Director is required to develop a voluntary accreditation program for state and local health departments and public health laboratories. Funding amounts are specified for FY2011 through FY2015. The Secretary must expand and improve core public health infrastructure and activities with allocated funding. General provisions and definitions are provided in Subtitle G. The section outlines procedures for transitioning functions of existing preventive services task forces to new task forces under PHSA Secs. 3131 and 3132. It also mandates grants for studying the feasibility of using schools as influenza vaccination centers and requires coordination with various agencies to ensure coverage for children's vaccination costs. The grant program covers costs of influenza vaccine and administration for children not covered by federal programs or private insurance. The program must adhere to HIPAA and FERPA rules. Minimum 10 grants in 10 states for partnerships including public schools serving low-income students. The Secretary would report to Congress on the impact of a program on influenza vaccination rates, including using school vaccination programs to address seasonal influenza and pandemics. Funding would be authorized for the program for FY2011 through FY2015, amending the WISEWOMAN program to provide preventive services to low-income women. The WISEWOMAN program provides breast and cervical cancer screening services to low-income women in states receiving funding. Currently, 19 states and two tribal organizations receive funding under the Secretary's authority. This section removes the 3-state limit and authorizes appropriations of $70.0 million for FY2011 to $85.0 million for FY2015 for the program. The Secretary can award grants to promote positive health behaviors in medically underserved communities through community health workers. Grants fund training for workers to educate communities on prevalent health issues, enrollment in insurance programs, and access to maternal health services. Priority is given to certain populations. The Secretary would prioritize grant applicants targeting areas with high uninsured rates, chronic diseases, and infant mortality. Applicants with experience in serving underserved populations and engaging community health workers would also be prioritized. Programs funded should implement outcome-based payment systems for community health workers. $30 million could be appropriated for this program. The Secretary would prioritize grant applicants targeting areas with high uninsured rates, chronic diseases, and infant mortality. Applicants with experience in serving underserved populations and engaging community health workers would also be prioritized. Programs funded should implement outcome-based payment systems for community health workers. $30 million could be appropriated for this program to carry out grants for evidence-based, community-based overweight and obesity prevention programs. Grants would be awarded for five-year periods to community partnerships with broad stakeholder involvement, requiring a $1 match for every $9 of federal funds. Funds cannot be used for healthcare services covered by existing programs, with preference given to entities serving communities with high levels of overweight and obesity or planning programs in school or workplace settings. The Secretary would prioritize grant applicants targeting areas with high uninsured rates, chronic diseases, and infant mortality. $10 million would be appropriated for FY2011 and SSAN for FY2012 through FY2015. The Secretary, in consultation with specified government agencies and private groups, would review and report to Congress on the utilization of benefits for recommended diabetes screening and establish an outreach program to increase awareness among seniors and providers. Home visiting is used to deliver support and services to families or individuals in their homes, focusing on improving maternal and child health, early childhood development, and family functioning. Early childhood home visitation programs involve specially trained nurses, professionals, or paraprofessionals visiting families weekly during pregnancy or after childbirth until the child is around two years old. Participation is voluntary, and these programs operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. While there is no federal funding exclusively for these programs, various federal programs like Medicaid and TANF support home visitation initiatives. Title IV-B of the Social Security Act authorizes formula grants to states for child and family services to ensure child safety and well-being. Programs like the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services and Promoting Safe and Stable Families are administered by the Administration for Children and Families within HHS. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within HHS seeks legislative authorization and mandatory funding for home visitation programs for families with young children and expecting children. This new program under SSA Title IV-B, Subpart 3 aims to improve child well-being, health, and development by providing funds to states, territories, and tribes for voluntary home visitation programs. States must conduct a needs assessment to determine current services, funding sources, gaps in services, and training and technical assistance. The assessment results must be included in the state's grant application, which should detail the home visitation programs to be supported, outcomes to be achieved, and evidence of effectiveness. The application must also include assurances of the state's commitment to supporting high-need communities, allocating 5% of funds for training and technical assistance, and providing annual reports to the Secretary on funded programs and outcomes. Successful states will receive funds based on their application and maintenance of effort. Beginning with FY2011, states must maintain spending levels for early childhood home visitation programs to be eligible for funds. Allotments are based on the number of children in low-income families. States must match a percentage of federal funding to receive their full allotment. Services must be voluntary for families expecting children or with children. The home visitation program must be voluntary for families with young children, adhere to an evidence-based service delivery model, and show positive effects on child and parent outcomes. States can use funding for programs with less evidence of effectiveness. The Secretary must provide interim and final reports on program evaluation, and HHS must submit annual reports to Congress on program activities. The section appropriates $750 million over five years for the early childhood home visitation program, with specific allocations for each fiscal year. Funds must be used for federal evaluation, training, technical assistance, and tribal home visitation programs. The Secretary is encouraged to expand research on postpartum depression and other conditions, including basic research, screening techniques, and education programs. A report to Congress is required within two years of enactment. The Secretary is required to study and report to Congress on the benefits of screening for postpartum conditions within two years of enactment. Congress suggests a study on the mental health consequences for women resolving pregnancies between FY2011 and FY2020. Funding is authorized for this purpose for FY2011 through FY2013. PHSA Title XX authorizes teen pregnancy prevention programs. Demonstration grants may be awarded for care and prevention services. Grantees must provide care and prevention services as per requirements, evaluate program results, and report to the Secretary. The Secretary can support research on teen pregnancy prevention. Various federal programs offer information on contraceptives, contraceptive services, and counseling for reproductive health, including Medicaid family planning, MCH block grant, SSA Title XX Social Services block grant, TANF block grant, and SSA Sec. 510 state formula grant for abstinence education programs for adolescents. Funds are awarded to states for abstinence education programs for adolescents based on the proportion of low-income children. States must match federal funds with state funds to receive funding. The program was funded through FY2003 and received extensions until June 30, 2009. A new state grant program for evidence-based education programs to reduce teen pregnancy or STDs is proposed. A new state grant program is proposed to fund evidence-based education programs aimed at reducing teen pregnancy and STDs. States must provide matching funds and choose programs from a registry developed by the Secretary. $50 million would be authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015 for grants to state health departments to oversee infant mortality programs. The pilot program aims to reduce infant mortality rates by allowing grantees to use funds for various activities, including community outreach, education, and clinical services. Preference will be given to areas with high infant mortality rates, and each program can allocate up to 10% of the grant for evaluation. The section authorizes $10 million for FY2011-FY2015 to address high infant mortality rates in the US. Behavioral health programs under PHSA provide funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Insurers offering behavioral health coverage must match physical health coverage. In 2007, 11% of Americans experienced serious psychological distress. The House legislation addresses behavioral health issues, focusing on mental health parity, federally qualified behavioral health centers, training programs, and postpartum depression. QHBPs would need to comply with existing parity rules for mental health and substance abuse benefits, while the essential benefits package must include behavioral health coverage. Sec. 222 of the House legislation mandates that the public health insurance option must provide full parity mental health and substance abuse treatment benefits, including behavioral health services. It also establishes federally qualified behavioral health centers and modifies requirements for services to children with serious emotional disturbance. The term \"community mental health services\" is replaced with \"behavioral health services\" and \"community mental health centers\" with \"federally qualified behavioral health centers.\" The section mandates that health services be provided through appropriate community programs or federally qualified behavioral health centers. Entities must be certified every five years by the SAMHSA Administrator. HRSA is required to establish a grant program to support mental and behavioral health training programs. Eligible entities include accredited schools, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations. Regulations for certifying these centers must be issued within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary would give preference to applicants with a demonstrated record of training health professionals for underserved communities, supporting teaching programs for vulnerable populations, and training individuals from underserved or disadvantaged backgrounds. $60 million would be authorized for the program annually from FY2011 to FY2015, with at least 15% allocated for psychology training programs. Annual reports to Congress would be required. The new PHSA Sec. 544 would establish a program to fund mental health and substance abuse services in primary care settings. Eligible entities must provide primary care services, integrate behavioral health, have relationships with behavioral health providers, and meet reporting requirements. Preference would be given to applicants in rural/frontier settings, school/university-based settings, or serving special needs populations. Funding period is up to five years, with annual evaluation reports to Congress. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on evaluation results and performance measures of the program within four years of initial funding. $30 million is authorized for FY2011 and SSAN for FY2012 through FY2015, with no more than 5% for program management. Stakeholders have made efforts to improve healthcare quality through metrics, comparative information reporting, and value-based purchasing. These efforts lack a unified strategy or entity guiding them. Efforts to improve healthcare quality lack a unified strategy or entity guiding them. Current law does not require the development of national priorities for performance improvement, but the Secretary is mandated to have a contract with a consensus-based entity to establish a national strategy for health care performance measurement. AHRQ has statutory authority to develop quality measures and promote health care quality improvement through research. H.R. 3962 aims to establish a national effort to prioritize quality improvement activities in healthcare, including the development of comprehensive quality measures for health and functional outcomes. The current lack of multi-stakeholder input in selecting quality measures for CMS programs like PQRI and RHQDAPU is addressed in the bill. The bill aims to establish a national effort for quality improvement in healthcare by developing comprehensive quality measures and involving multi-stakeholder input. It includes creating national priorities for performance improvement and harmonizing requirements for endorsed measures. The Secretary must prioritize care delivery areas with high disease burden, potential to reduce morbidity and mortality, and address health disparities. Funding of $2 million annually from Medicare trust funds and Treasury is authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. New sections in SSA Title XI, Part E would require agreements with entities to develop quality measures for healthcare services in the U.S. The Secretary is required to determine areas needing quality measures for assessing healthcare services in the US. Proposed quality measures must be made public and funding is authorized for testing and updating measures. $25 million annually from Medicare trust funds and Treasury is allocated for FY2010 through FY2014. GAO will evaluate periodically. SSA Sec. 1193 would require GAO to evaluate data collection processes for quality measures used by the Secretary and report findings to Congress. SSA Sec. 1808 would establish a process for multi-stakeholder groups to provide input on Medicare quality measures selection. The Secretary must make quality measures public for consideration, and the NQF would convene groups to recommend measures for public reporting or healthcare programs. The proposed rule requires a consensus-based entity to convene multi-stakeholder groups for input on quality measures in healthcare programs. Recommendations and comments from these groups must be included in the rule, along with an explanation for not following certain recommendations. Funding of $1 million annually from Medicare trust funds and Treasury is authorized for this purpose. The proposed rule requires the Secretary to select quality measures for various healthcare programs, including inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, physician, and renal dialysis services. The Secretary must choose endorsed quality measures for reporting data, may select non-endorsed measures if necessary, and submit them to NQF for endorsement. If NQF does not endorse a measure but the Secretary continues to use it, the rationale must be included in rulemaking. The proposed rule requires the Secretary to select quality measures for healthcare programs and submit them to NQF for endorsement. If NQF does not endorse a measure, the rationale must be included in rulemaking. Funding from Medicare trust funds is allocated for the consensus-based entity's activities. The Secretary is required to develop quality indicators for medical services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and report to Congress on their implementation within 24 months. The Secretary must report to Congress on the implementation of care coordination requirements within 24 months of enactment. Care coordination is crucial in healthcare to prevent waste and improve quality of care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. H.R. 3962 addresses care coordination issues by supporting collaborative care networks, medication management services, and patient navigator services. PHSA Sec. 340A authorizes these provisions. PHSA Sec. 340A authorizes grants for patient navigator services to assist individuals with chronic diseases in accessing healthcare. Patient navigators facilitate community involvement, help patients overcome healthcare barriers, and coordinate with insurance entities. The Secretary provides grants for medication management services by licensed pharmacists. The curr_chunk discusses grants to support medication management services provided by licensed pharmacists under Medicare Part D. It highlights the flexibility of Part D plans in structuring MTM programs and the need for AHRQ to establish an MTM grant program. The focus is on providing specified MTM services to targeted individuals to improve clinical outcomes. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of medication therapy management (MTM) services by licensed pharmacists under a new program. The services target individuals taking multiple medications, high-risk medications, with chronic diseases, or undergoing transitions of care. The Secretary would assess and report on the program, and grants would be awarded to public and nonprofit entities for MTM services. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of community-based collaborative care networks through grants awarded to public and nonprofit entities. These networks aim to improve care coordination, develop efficient healthcare delivery infrastructure, enhance chronic care coordination, and reduce unnecessary use of expensive resources for uninsured and low-income individuals. Eligible collaborative care networks must consist of a consortium of healthcare providers with a joint governance structure capable of delivering integrated healthcare services to low-income or medically underserved populations. Community-based collaborative care networks (CCNs) aim to provide services to low-income or medically underserved individuals, regardless of health insurance status. CCNs include FQHCs, safety net hospitals, critical access hospitals, county health departments, and community clinics. An integrated health system can also qualify as a CCN if it meets specific criteria. Priority is given to applicants that can offer a wide range of healthcare services to vulnerable populations. CCN funding can be used to assist uninsured, underinsured, and low-income individuals. Permissible uses of CCN funding include assisting uninsured, underinsured, and low-income individuals to access health services, enroll in insurance programs, obtain referrals to primary care providers, and receive care for chronic conditions. Funds can also be used for case management, application assistance, referrals through HIT networks, community outreach, expanding care capacity through telehealth, hiring staff, and providing after-hours services. Compliance with HRSA requirements may limit the percentage of funds spent on direct care services for network members who are also HRSA grantees. The Secretary may use up to 7% of funds for technical assistance, expert consultation, meetings, tool development, information dissemination, and evaluations. Participation in a CCN does not change FQHC governance obligations. FQHCs in CCNs must provide services within their approved scope of project. The Secretary can conduct audits and request spending reports, with the authority to terminate funding for cause. CCNs must submit evaluations after three years, detailing patient numbers served. The Secretary would have to submit annual evaluations to Congress, including information on the impact of CCNs on reducing emergency department use, prevalence of chronic conditions, and health conditions of patients. Funding would be authorized for FY2011 through FY2015 for a nationwide demonstration project awarding grants. The Secretary would establish a nationwide demonstration project awarding grants to medical-legal partnerships to assist patients in navigating health-related programs. Partnerships must enhance access, improve health outcomes, reduce disparities, and prevent chronic conditions. A report to Congress on project results is required. Authorization for funding is provided for FY2011 through FY2015. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to develop best practices in healthcare delivery and public reporting of health-care acquired infections. AHRQ has authority to conduct research on healthcare quality and provide financial assistance for new health services research centers. Reporting of health care-associated infections is not generally required by federal law. The current federal law aims to reduce specific types of healthcare-associated infections through Medicare reimbursement penalties and incentives for reporting. A new section in PHSA Title IX would establish a Center for Quality Improvement within AHRQ to prioritize best practices for quality improvement in healthcare delivery. The Center for Quality Improvement within AHRQ will focus on national priorities for performance improvement and key health indicators. It will disseminate best practices, submit annual reports, and prioritize quality improvement activities in areas such as health care-associated infections, surgery, emergency room, obstetrics, and pediatrics. Funding of $300 million is authorized from the Public Health Investment Fund. The section authorizes $300 million annually from FY2011 to FY2015 for PHSA Title IX, Part D and Sec. 1709. It introduces a new requirement for hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to report certain HAIs to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. The Secretary must establish procedures for data validity and online posting for facility comparisons. It does not affect state reporting laws. The current efforts to collect and disseminate health statistics on the U.S. population are primarily directed by AHRQ and the CDC National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). AHRQ submits annual reports to Congress on national trends in healthcare quality and disparities in healthcare delivery related to racial and socioeconomic factors. NCHS conducts statistical and epidemiological activities to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of health services in the United States. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of an HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Information under PHSA Title XVII, responsible for collecting, reporting, and publishing key health indicators. This includes sharing health data between federal departments and developing data collection standards. The Assistant Secretary would identify and publish statistics on key health indicators annually, following OMB regulations. The curr_chunk discusses rules governing the release of Federal Economic Indicators by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It requires coordination with entities collecting health information and an annual report to Congress. $300 million is authorized for FY2011-FY2015 from the Public Health Investment Fund for health indicator data collection. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research within AHRQ and an independent Comparative Effectiveness Research Commission to oversee activities. The Commission would include stakeholders like clinicians, patients, and payers. No mandate for coverage or reimbursement policies would be allowed. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Health Care Comparative Effectiveness Research Trust Fund (CERTF) to fund research activities without allowing the federal government to deny care based on research findings. The CERTF would receive funding from Medicare trust funds and eventually from public funds. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to enhance accountability requirements for Medicare certified skilled nursing and Medicaid certified nursing facilities. This includes maintaining additional ownership information, establishing compliance and ethics training programs, and conducting a study on undercapitalization. The Secretary would also improve the Medicare Nursing Home Compare website for easier access by long-term care consumers. The new provisions in H.R. 3962 aim to enhance accountability in skilled nursing and nursing facilities by requiring reporting of staff expenditures, developing a standardized complaint form with whistle-blower protections, and establishing a process for regular staffing data reporting. The Secretary would consult with experts to categorize expenditure data and improve access to information for consumers. The Secretary would establish a nationwide program for background checks on LTC facility employees, impose civil money penalties for quality deficiencies, implement a monitoring program for SNF and NF chains, and require notification of planned facility closures. Additional staff training would also be mandated. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for additional staff training in dementia and abuse prevention in SNFs and NFs, as well as the need for the full-time director of food services in nursing facilities to have specific qualifications. It also mentions the provision of interpretation services for patients with limited English proficiency by healthcare providers receiving HHS financial assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges faced by Medicare beneficiaries with limited English proficiency in accessing healthcare compared to those covered by Medicaid due to differences in language assistance requirements. The curr_chunk highlights the difficulties faced by LEP Medicare beneficiaries in accessing language services, including the lack of reimbursement and poor enforcement of the Act. It proposes a study to examine Medicare providers' utilization of language services for LEP patients and suggests developing payment systems for on-site and off-site interpreters. Feasibility of modifying the existing payment methodology for LEP patients is also discussed. The proposed study aims to analyze language services for LEP Medicare beneficiaries, explore funding options, and assess the potential payment systems for providers. Sanctions may be imposed on Medicare Advantage organizations failing to provide required language services. Additionally, a demonstration program would award grants to eligible Medicare providers within six months of the study's completion. The Secretary would award grants to Medicare providers to improve communication with underserved minority populations, requiring annual reports on language services provided. Grants cannot exceed $500,000 for a three-year period, with an evaluation report to Congress. The Secretary would conduct an evaluation of a demonstration program with a $16 million annual budget, including a study on language access services' impact on LEP populations. $2 million from the Medicare Trust Fund would be used for the study. Based on findings, the Secretary may designate training organizations for translation services for Medicare beneficiaries. This section would also amend PHSA Sec. 1707(a) to remove the Office of Minority Health. The section would establish an Office of Minority Health within the Office of the Secretary and in various agencies. Each office would have a director reporting to the senior official of the agency. The amendments would not change existing regulatory authority or positions without Congress approval. HIPAA's Administrative Simplification provisions mandated electronic format and data standards for specified health care transactions. CMS issued initial standards in 2000 and updated standards in 2009, with a compliance deadline of January. The compliance deadline for updated health care transaction standards is January 1, 2012. These standards include the health care payment and remittance advice transaction, which can accommodate electronic funds transfer (EFT). EFT is common in the health care sector, but there is no federal mandate for Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurance. Additionally, CMS proposed a standard for health care claims attachments in September 2005, which is one of the two remaining transaction standards to be adopted. HIPAA does not mandate electronic transactions, but providers choosing to submit them must comply with the standard. Congress mandated Medicare claims be submitted electronically in the HIPAA format, with exceptions for small providers. The standards include optional fields for plan-specific information, leading to customization on a plan-by-plan basis. Unique identifiers were adopted for healthcare providers, plans, and employers. The Secretary has adopted unique identifiers for healthcare providers, plans, and employers. The health plan identifier is still under review, and Congress has blocked the development of a unique individual identifier. HIPAA's Administrative Simplification provisions include security standards for electronic health information and privacy protections for patient information. The HIPAA privacy rule grants patients access to their medical information and limits how it can be used and disclosed by health plans and providers. The HITECH Act expanded HIPAA requirements for patient information privacy and security. It proposed new financial and administrative transaction standards to be adopted within two years, aiming for clarity, uniqueness, and comprehensiveness. The proposed standards aim to streamline financial transactions in healthcare by ensuring clarity, real-time determination of patient financial responsibility, harmonizing data elements, supporting electronic funds transfers, and simplifying administrative processes. The Secretary is required to build upon existing standards and regularly update them, with a plan for implementation due within six months of enactment. The Secretary must submit a plan to Congress for implementing new healthcare standards within five years of enactment. The plan includes developing and updating standards, providing implementation programs for rural providers, estimating funding needs, enforcing standards with investigations and audits, and ensuring data privacy under HIPAA. Additionally, a new section requires the adoption of interim companion guides for electronic transactions until new standards are in place. The Secretary must adopt interim companion guides for electronic transactions until new standards are in place, following existing HIPAA requirements and consulting with a nonprofit entity focused on administrative simplification. Companion guides for eligibility and claims status transactions must be adopted by October 1, 2011. The Secretary must establish new standards for HIPAA transactions by specific deadlines. A final rule for health claims attachment transactions and coordination of benefits must be issued within one year. The HIPAA standards do not apply to financial institutions unless they are business associates. A unique health plan identifier rule must be established within two years. Medicare Part A and B claims payment by the Secretary will be prohibited starting January 1, 2015. Starting January 1, 2015, Medicare Part A and B claims must be paid through EFT, following the adoption of an EFT standard by the Secretary. The HITECH Act incentivizes the use of electronic health records by offering bonus payments to eligible professionals and hospitals who become meaningful users of certified EHR systems. Meaningful use involves using EHR technology to exchange clinical information for improved care coordination and quality. The HITECH Act incentivizes eligible professionals and hospitals to use electronic health records for improved care coordination and quality. Eligible professionals include physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors for Medicare incentives, while for Medicaid incentives, they include non-hospital physicians, dentists, certified nurse mid-wives, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, FQHCs, and rural health clinics meeting specific requirements. ARRA provided $2 billion for activities and grant programs authorized by the HITECH Act. The Information Technology Research Center and regional extension centers funded by the HITECH Act provide assistance to healthcare providers in implementing electronic health records (EHRs). The Secretary is required to study methods to increase EHR use among small providers, including higher reimbursement rates and training. Grants are authorized for telehealth networks and resource centers, as well as for coordinating telemedicine licensure among states. The appropriations authority for these programs expired in FY2006. This section proposes to reauthorize grants for telehealth networks and resource centers under PHSA Sec. 330I. It aims to fund projects using telehealth technologies to reduce health disparities, expand eligible facilities to include skilled nursing facilities, and support collaboration between healthcare providers. Funding preference criteria for eligible applicants would be established, and activities would include telenursing services and promoting patient adherence to national health guidelines. The section proposes reauthorizing grants for telehealth networks and resource centers under PHSA Sec. 330I. It would amend reporting requirements and authorize appropriations for telehealth grant programs and licensure grants. Additionally, it authorizes funding for trauma care research, training, evaluations, and grants to trauma centers in areas affected by drug-related violence. PHSA Title XXVIII addresses preparedness for bioterrorism and public health emergencies, emphasizing the importance of trauma care within the first 60 minutes after an injury. Trauma systems aim to provide timely access to trauma centers, but the geographic distribution of these centers varies, leading to disparities in access. While most U.S. residents can reach a level I or II trauma center within an hour, rural areas face challenges in accessing timely care. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospital emergency departments to examine and treat individuals with emergency medical conditions or in labor. It also prohibits discrimination, delays in treatment, and provides protections for whistleblowers. Proposed amendments would replace existing provisions with new requirements for trauma centers under PHSA Secs. 1241-1245. The proposed amendments under PHSA Secs. 1241-1245 include establishing a grant program for trauma centers to further their missions, provide emergency relief, and establish new trauma centers in urban areas with high trauma rates. Grantees must be designated as trauma centers by the American College of Surgeons or state authorities. Preferences in making grants include reserving at least 25% for existing centers. The proposed amendments under PHSA Secs. 1241-1245 establish a grant program for trauma centers, with preferences for existing centers. The Secretary would reserve funds for rural and underserved areas, urban areas, and areas with unmet needs for trauma services. States and local entities must show financial support for trauma centers, and levels I and II are defined as the highest levels. Preference would be given based on geography and need for certain grant applicants. The proposed amendments establish a grant program for trauma centers, with preferences for existing centers based on geography and need. Grantee trauma centers must participate in a professional trauma care system, maintain access to trauma services, and provide data to a national registry. Grants are limited to three years, with 90% allocated to existing centers and 10% for emergency purposes. The proposed amendments establish a grant program for trauma centers, with preferences for existing centers based on geography and need. Grantee trauma centers must participate in a professional trauma care system, maintain access to trauma services, and provide data to a national registry. Grants are limited to three years, with 90% allocated to existing centers for core mission grants and 10% for emergency relief and new center funding. Authorization of appropriations for the trauma care center grant program is set at $100 million for FY2011, and SSAN for each of FY2012 through FY2015. Reallocation of unused funds is required to support existing trauma centers. Additionally, an Emergency Care Coordination Center within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) would be established to coordinate emergency care efforts. The Secretary, through the Center Director, would coordinate with the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services to promote research in emergency medicine and trauma care, establish the Council of Emergency Care, and submit reports to Congress on emergency department issues. Funding of SSAN for FY2010 through FY2014 would be authorized for these activities, with functions transferred to a new Center. The section establishes new demonstration projects for innovative emergency care systems, requiring partnerships between states and local governments. Projects aim to coordinate services, access to emergency care, patient transportation, resource tracking, and data management on a regional level. The new demonstration projects for innovative emergency care systems require partnerships between states and local governments to coordinate services, patient transportation, and data management on a regional level. Eligible entities must submit an application with required information and make financial contributions. Grantees must submit an evaluation report, with funding priority given to those serving medically underserved populations. An independent entity will evaluate the programs and make findings publicly available. The proposed legislation aims to allocate $12 million annually from FY2011 through FY2015 for evaluation of demonstration programs. A new grant program would assist veterans with military emergency medical training to become licensed EMTs upon discharge. States with EMT shortages can apply for grants to fund training and expedite licensure. The proposed legislation aims to allocate $12 million annually from FY2011 through FY2015 for a grant program to assist veterans with military emergency medical training to become licensed EMTs upon discharge. States with EMT shortages can apply for grants to fund training and expedite licensure. Additionally, GAO would conduct a study on barriers faced by veterans seeking to become licensed civilian health professionals, with recommendations for expanding training programs to other health professions. The proposed legislation aims to amend various acts to enhance emergency preparedness goals, including clarifying emergency curricula at federal dental health facilities and adding emergency dental personnel to the definition of emergency response providers. It also requires federal agency operational plans to address the preparedness and deployment of public health, medical, and dental resources, with the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Homeland Security serving as the primary point of contact with the medical and dental communities. The NIH established the Pain Consortium to enhance pain research and collaboration among researchers. The House legislation includes sections addressing pain research, education, and awareness as a national public health problem. The bill requires the Secretary to convene a Conference on Pain to increase recognition of pain as a public health problem. It authorizes $500,000 for FY2011 and FY2012 for this purpose. Additionally, it encourages the NIH Director to continue research on the causes and treatment of pain through the Pain Consortium. The Pain Consortium would develop recommendations for pain research initiatives annually. The Secretary would establish the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee to coordinate efforts within HHS and other federal agencies. A national pain care education outreach campaign would be implemented to educate the public about pain as a public health issue. The FDA is responsible for regulating the safety and effectiveness of medical products, which make up over 15% of healthcare costs. A public awareness campaign would receive funding to assist in development and implementation. $2 million would be appropriated for FY2011, and $4 million for each of FY2012 and FY2015. In the context of health care, FDA's regulation of food, particularly nutrition labeling requirements, may impact individuals' health. H.R. 3962 includes seven FDA-related provisions affecting regulation of medical devices, foods, drugs, and biologics. Provisions include creating a national medical device registry, imposing a tax on certain device sales, requiring nutrition labeling at restaurants and vending machines, and prohibiting activities that delay FDA approval of generics. The provision in H.R. 3962 aims to prevent delays in FDA approval of generics and establish a licensure pathway for biosimilars. Concerns about high-risk medical devices have led to discussions on tracking and postmarket surveillance mechanisms. The Act of 2007 added a new requirement for medical devices to have a unique identifier. There are no special taxes on medical devices, but manufacturers have been subject to FDA fees since 2002. A new provision would establish a national medical device registry for postmarket safety analysis. The Secretary would link device data with patient safety information and integrate registry activities with postmarket risk assessments. The Secretary would be required to adopt standards for the electronic exchange and use of a unique device identifier in certified electronic health records. A new tax of 2.5% would be imposed on the first taxable sale of medical devices, with exemptions for devices sold to consumers by retail establishments and certain other circumstances. The proposed tax on medical devices would allow sellers to recover taxes paid from producers or importers. The tax would apply to sales after December 31, 2012. Congress is considering options to promote healthy eating, including requiring nutrition labeling for some currently exempted foods. Restaurants are currently exempt from FDA's nutrition labeling requirements, but failure to comply could result in misbranding under FFDCA Sec. 403. States and localities are prohibited from establishing their own nutrition labeling. Sec. 403A prohibits states and localities from establishing their own nutrition labeling that is not identical to the Act's requirements. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must provide calorie information for standard menu items and make detailed nutritional information available upon request. The establishments must have a reasonable basis for their nutrient content disclosures. The Secretary would establish regulations for disclosing nutrient content of menu items, vending machine operators with 20+ machines must display calorie information, and FFDCA Sec. 403A would preempt state nutrition labeling requirements. The section prohibits requirements for nutrition labeling that differ from FFDCA Sec. 403(q) and clarifies that state or local laws on food labeling safety warnings are not preempted. Congressional interest in generic drugs has increased due to reports of brand name manufacturers paying. The interest in generic drugs has grown due to reports of brand name manufacturers paying to delay their introduction. Generic drugs offer cost savings as they are typically cheaper than brand-name drugs. However, this can reduce revenue for brand name manufacturers, impacting their ability to develop new drugs. Companies file Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) to market generic drugs, which can lead to patent infringement litigation. The FFDCA does not restrict patent disputes between patent owners and ANDA applicants from being settled. The MMA of 2003 mandated certain settlements to be filed with the DOJ and FTC. APA Sec. 553 outlines rulemaking procedures, including notice-and-comment rulemaking where interested parties can comment on proposed rules. This section proposes adding a new paragraph to FFDCA Sec. 505. The final rule would make it unlawful for an ANDA applicant to receive anything of value in a patent infringement settlement that limits their ability to research, develop, manufacture, market, or sell the drug subject to the ANDA and patent. Only agreements allowing the right to sell the drug and waiving past damages would be allowed. The FTC would enforce these provisions, and settlements must be filed with the DOJ and FTC. The CEO or responsible official must certify the filing as complete. The proposal requires certification that the filing is the final agreement between parties. It mandates GAO to study pharmaceutical patent litigation impact and allows FTC to exempt agreements promoting market competition. Biosimilars are similar to brand-name biologics, while generic drugs are identical to brand-name chemical drugs. The FDA is interested in creating an expedited pathway for the approval of biosimilars to achieve cost savings, similar to the pathway for generic chemical drugs. Biosimilars are complex proteins made from living organisms that may require additional clinical trials for approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drugs to be approved based on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the brand-name drug, saving costs by avoiding clinical trials and research expenses. Biosimilars, complex proteins made from living organisms, may also see cost savings through an expedited FDA approval pathway. The proposed section would amend PHSA Sec. 351 to establish a pathway for the approval of biosimilars, which are biological products highly similar to reference products. The Secretary may determine that certain elements in the application for licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product are unnecessary. Interchangeable products can be substituted for reference products without healthcare provider intervention. The proposed section would establish a pathway for the approval of biosimilars, allowing for interchangeable products to be substituted without healthcare provider intervention. Special requirements would apply to certain biosimilars with higher risks. It includes a period of exclusive marketing for the first interchangeable biological product, a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product, and an additional six months if pediatric studies show health benefits. The Secretary may publish proposed guidance for public comment before final guidance on biological product licensure. The proposed section establishes a pathway for biosimilar approval, allowing for interchangeable products without healthcare provider intervention. It includes special requirements for certain biosimilars with higher risks, exclusive marketing for the first interchangeable product, a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product, and additional six months for pediatric studies. The Secretary must ensure unique names for biological products, set a process for patent infringement claims, and require sponsors to file with the Assistant Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission. The proposed section establishes a pathway for biosimilar approval, allowing for interchangeable products without healthcare provider intervention. It includes special requirements for certain biosimilars with higher risks, exclusive marketing for the first interchangeable product, a 12-year data exclusivity period for the reference product, and additional six months for pediatric studies. Sponsors must file agreements regarding the manufacture, marketing, or sale of products with the Assistant Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission to avoid civil fines. The Federal Trade Commission may engage in rulemaking regarding the filing requirement.

The Federal Trade Commission may engage in rulemaking regarding the filing requirement. Patents identified by the reference product sponsor and other interested parties may be considered an act of patent infringement, requiring identification of relevant patents for the proposed biosimilar product. The biosimilar applicant can respond by asserting patent invalidity, unenforceability, or non-infringement, but such assertions may lead to immediate legal action. The 340B program provides discounts on outpatient drugs for covered entities like hospitals serving Medicaid beneficiaries. Covered entities cannot receive discounts on inpatient drugs and are prohibited from diverting purchased drugs to other organizations. Approximately 14,000 covered entities and 800 pharmaceutical manufacturers participate in the program. Entities participating in the 340B program are prohibited from diverting drugs purchased under the program and from obtaining multiple discounts. The 340B discount is based on the average manufacturer price (AMP) reduced by the Medicaid rebate percentage. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and their best price to the Secretary, and they may audit covered entity records to prevent product diversion or multiple discounts. Children's hospitals were added to the program in 2005. Sec. 6004 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 expanded the 340B program to include children's hospitals exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system. A final rule issued in 2009 added various entities like critical access hospitals, maternal and child health grantees, and rural referral centers to the list of covered entities eligible for discounted drug prices under the program. The new 340B-eligible facilities, including rural referral centers, must meet specific participation requirements. Amendments to PHSA Sec. 340B would enhance compliance and program integrity, increase transparency, and allow the Secretary to impose penalties for violations by manufacturers and covered entities. Administrative procedures would be established to resolve disputes. The administrative dispute resolution process would mediate overpayment claims and manufacturer claims against covered entities for drug diversion. Manufacturers must report plans to ensure fair allocation of limited drug supplies to covered entities. Quarterly ceiling prices for covered drugs must be reported to the Secretary. These changes would apply to drugs dispensed starting from the enactment date and would be used to determine manufacturers' compliance with 340B and Medicaid requirements. In recent years, concerns have been raised about financial relationships between healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies. Some states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring disclosure of gifts and payments from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals. However, there is no federal requirement for this disclosure. Under SSA Sec. 1877, physicians are prohibited from making referrals to entities with which they have a financial relationship. Physicians are prohibited from making referrals to entities with which they have a financial relationship under SSA Sec. 1877. This financial relationship can involve ownership, investment interest, or compensation arrangements. Ownership or investment interest may include equity, debt, or other means, excluding certain investment securities. Compensation arrangements involve remuneration between a physician or their immediate family member and an entity. Section 1877(f) and new SSA Sec. 1128H require entities providing Medicare-covered services and drug manufacturers to report ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements involving physicians or their relatives to the Secretary. Reporting includes details on transactions with physicians, hospitals, and other recipients. The new section requires hospitals and healthcare entities billing Medicare to report ownership shares of physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers, distributors, and group purchasing organizations must also report physician ownership or investment interests annually. The Secretary will make this information publicly available on a searchable website. Failure to submit required information on time may result in penalties. The Secretary must establish procedures for public availability of required information. State attorney generals can take action if the Secretary declines. Sec. 1128H preempts duplicative state laws starting January 1, 2011. PHSA Title III authorizes programs for autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities. Sec. 399AA authorizes grants for collecting state epidemiological data on ASD and other developmental disabilities. Sec. 399BB requires activities to increase public awareness, research early screening, and support interventions. Sec. 399CC establishes an Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee for tracking research and federal activities. Sec. 399DD mandates progress reports on ASD activities to Congress, while Sec. 399EE authorizes appropriations through FY2011. A new Subtitle F on National Training Initiative for Autism Spectrum Disorders would award training grants to University Centers for Excellence. The proposed grants aim to enhance interdisciplinary training and education for parents, professionals, and individuals with ASD. Funds would also support the development of model services and evidence-based practices. Additionally, a portion of funds would be reserved for a national organization to provide training and technical assistance to University Centers for Excellence. The section authorizes grants for training programs, establishes new University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service, and provides incentive payments to states with effective alternative medical liability laws. Funding amounts are specified for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015. The section authorizes grants for training programs, establishes University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service, and provides incentive payments to states with effective alternative medical liability laws. The Secretary must consider the effectiveness of such laws in improving the medical liability system, encouraging error disclosure, and maintaining access to affordable liability insurance. Nothing in the section would preempt or modify existing state laws limiting attorneys' fees or capping damage awards. The section authorizes grants for training programs, establishes University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service, and provides incentive payments to states with effective alternative medical liability laws. States must adhere to requirements in the bill to be eligible for federal funds. The Secretary is required to report to Congress on neglected diseases of poverty within one year of enactment. This section also creates a new PHSA Sec. 229 in the Office of the.

Additionally, a new section would add guidelines for minimal technical criteria for new medical diagnostic equipment under the Rehabilitation Act. The guidelines for new medical diagnostic equipment in medical settings must ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Federal agencies must prescribe regulations consistent with the guidelines to ensure equal access to healthcare for individuals with disabilities. The Secretary must conduct a study to determine if any new grant program duplicates existing HHS federal grant programs. If duplication is found, integration or elimination of the duplicative program is required, with funds redirected accordingly. A report to Congress and public disclosure of study results are mandated. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress and make study results public.
