    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice for Sergei Magnitsky Act of 2010\". The United States supports the people of the Russian Federation in their economic and democratic endeavors. Russia is a member of various international organizations and has ratified several human rights conventions. States voluntarily commit to respecting obligations and responsibilities under international agreements like the European Convention on Human Rights. Human rights are a crucial part of international law and the foundation of the international order. Good governance and anti-corruption measures play a key role in protecting human rights. The President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, has addressed corruption in public speeches, emphasizing zero tolerance for corruption to become part of the national culture. Corruption erodes trust in democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights protections. President Medvedev has acknowledged Russia's corruption issues and emphasized the need for prosecuting corrupt officials. He also highlighted the country's disregard for the rule of law, describing it as \"legal nihilism.\" The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his repressive arrest and torture, has been attributed to officers of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation. The death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison in 2009, after being denied justice and legal remedies for nearly a year, highlights the politically motivated persecution and corruption within the Russian state. Sergei Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison in 2009, leaving behind a mother, wife, and 2 sons. There is evidence of widespread abuse of power by Russian officials, including embezzlement and retaliation against whistleblowers. Magnitsky called himself a hostage of officials who misappropriated funds from the Hermitage Fund and the Russian Treasury during his detention. The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow concluded that Sergei Magnitsky's detention was a breach of his right to life, as he was unable to protect himself while in custody. Magnitsky faced psychological and physical pressure in custody, with conditions in some wards of Butyrka being described as torturous. Those responsible must be punished. The text chunk \"SEC. 3.
