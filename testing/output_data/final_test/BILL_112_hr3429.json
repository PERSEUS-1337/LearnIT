USE OF OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PLATFORMS FOR ARTIFICIAL REEFS. The Secretary must assess platforms to determine coral populations, protected species, and species with recreational or commercial value. Platforms cannot be removed until assessments are completed, and decommissioning may be suspended if a substantial reef ecosystem is found nearby. The decommissioning of a platform may be placed on hold if it could harm the reef ecosystem. Lessees can be exempt from removing a platform if they commit to entering it into an artificial reef program. Reefing in place and state programs are also allowed under the Program.
