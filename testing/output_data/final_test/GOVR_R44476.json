    "content": "On March 25, 2016, OSHA published new standards in the Federal Register for exposure to respirable crystalline silica in the workplace. Employers must protect workers when exposure exceeds the new permissible limit of 50 \u00b5g/m3 through engineering controls or respirators. Workers' exposure must be measured if it may reach or exceed 25 \u00b5g/m3. Access to high-exposure areas must be limited, and medical exams offered every 3 years to exposed workers. OSHA published new standards for exposure to respirable crystalline silica in the workplace, requiring x-rays and lung function tests every 3 years for workers exposed to silica at or above 25 \u00b5g/m3 for 30 or more days. Employers must train workers to limit exposure and maintain records of exposure levels. The standards will be phased in over five years starting June 23, 2017, with exemptions for construction industry if engineering controls are followed. The new standards for exposure to respirable crystalline silica require x-rays and lung function tests every 3 years for workers exposed to silica at or above 25 \u00b5g/m3 for 30 or more days. Employers must train workers to limit exposure and maintain records of exposure levels. Crystalline silica is found in soil, sand, and natural materials, with common forms being quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite. Workers are exposed to crystalline silica when cutting, sawing, grinding, drilling, or crushing materials like glass, stone, rock, concrete, brick, or industrial sand. Industrial sand used in abrasive operations like sandblasting and hydraulic fracturing also pose exposure risks. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that 1.7 million workers are exposed to crystalline silica in the workplace, with OSHA estimating over 2.3 million workers potentially exposed. Crystalline silica particles, smaller than normal sand particles, can easily enter the respiratory system and are classified as a human carcinogen by IARC and HHS. Exposure to crystalline silica is linked to diseases like silicosis and respiratory issues. Crystalline silica is linked to diseases like silicosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, lung cancer, autoimmune diseases, and renal issues. Occupational exposure to crystalline silica has been known to cause these health effects since the early 20th century, with documented cases among miners, stonecutters, and other workers. The construction of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation's Hawk's Nest Tunnel in Gauley Bridge, WV in 1931 resulted in several hundred deaths from acute silicosis, making it one of the deadliest incidents of occupational disease in American history. The federal government provides compensation for workers who contracted chronic silicosis from digging tunnels in Alaska and Nevada for atomic weapons testing. OSHA's new crystalline silica standards aim to prevent silica-related deaths and reduce health risks associated with exposure. OSHA conducted risk assessments based on extensive research on the health effects of crystalline silica exposure to develop new standards. The assessments were in compliance with the OSH Act, focusing on achieving the highest level of health and safety protection for employees. The Final Rule by OSHA establishes new standards for crystalline silica exposure, citing evidence of various health risks including silicosis, lung cancer, and kidney disease. The standards include a uniform PEL of 50 \u00b5g/m3 measured over an 8-hour TWA, requiring protective measures for workers exposed above this limit. Prior to the new crystalline silica standards, the old OSHA standards did not have a universal PEL for all industries and types of crystalline silica. The old PELs were not directly comparable to the new PELs, as they were expressed in different units. In its NPRM on new standards, OSHA reports outdated particle-count methodology for silica exposure. New PELs in \u00b5g/m3 are: quartz in general industry: 100; quartz in construction industry: 250; quartz in shipyard industry: 250; cristobalite in all industries: 50; tridymite in all industries: 50. Old PELs date back to a 1929 report on silica exposure in the granite-cutting industry. The OSHA report highlighted the presence of approximately 35% free silica, including crystalline silica like quartz, and suggested using ventilating devices to control dust levels. The established limit did not fully prevent silicosis but showed a reduced risk of pulmonary tuberculosis. OSHA's original PELs for crystalline silica in 1971 were based on existing standards from the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936. In 1989, OSHA updated its PELs for crystalline silica, converting them to measures of \u00b5g/m 3 of air. In 1992, OSHA proposed uniform PELs for all industries at 100 \u00b5g/m 3 for quartz and 50 \u00b5g/m 3 for cristobalite and tridymite, resulting in reduced PELs for construction and maritime industries. In 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reverted the PELs back to their original 1971 levels, which were replaced by new PELs in 2016. NIOSH recommended a PEL for crystalline silica in 1974, and OSHA published an ANPRM seeking public comments. The new OSHA crystalline silica PEL now aligns with the NIOSH recommendation, effective June 23, 2016. The new OSHA crystalline silica standards took effect on June 23, 2016. Compliance deadlines vary for different industries, with the construction industry required to comply by September 23, 2017. Good faith compliance assistance was announced for the construction industry for the first 30 days of enforcement. General industry and maritime industry have a compliance deadline of 2 years after the effective date, with specific requirements for medical surveillance. OSHA's new crystalline silica standards, effective since June 23, 2016, have varying compliance deadlines for different industries. The construction industry must comply by September 23, 2017, with good faith compliance assistance for the first 30 days. General and maritime industries have a 2-year compliance deadline, with specific requirements for medical surveillance. OSHA projects that implementing these standards will prevent 642 silica-related deaths annually and produce benefits of $8.7 billion through mortality and morbidity reductions. Compliance costs are projected at just over $1 billion annually, with benefits outweighing costs by more than eight times. After OSHA published the NPRM on the new crystalline silica standards in September 2013, employer groups opposed the changes, citing underestimated costs and unnecessary stricter standards. The Construction Industry Safety Coalition estimated that the new standards would cost employers $4.9 billion annually, with direct compliance costs of $3.9 billion. The Construction Industry Safety Coalition estimated annual compliance costs of $3.9 billion and indirect costs of over $1 billion due to higher prices for building materials. The American Chemistry Council's Crystalline Silica Panel claims that current OSHA PELs are effective in reducing silica-related deaths and do not need to be changed, citing data from the CDC showing a nearly 90% reduction in silicosis deaths between 1968 and 2010. The higher numbers of deaths in the early period of the data may be capturing workers exposed to crystalline silica before safety regulations were implemented. Reduction in workers in heavy industries like mining, where silica exposure is prevalent, has also contributed to the decrease in silicosis deaths. The ACC emphasizes better compliance with current PELs as key to reducing silicosis deaths among workers. In response to objections from various organizations, OSHA defends its projection of preventing 642 annual deaths from silicosis and non-malignant respiratory diseases with new standards. Critics argue that this number exceeds reported silicosis-related deaths in 2010, but OSHA clarifies that their projections include other NMRD as well. The Senate Committee on Appropriations included a provision in its FY2016 appropriations bill to restrict OSHA's spending. The Senate Committee on Appropriations included a provision in its FY2016 appropriations bill to restrict OSHA's spending on implementing changes to crystalline silica standards until a review is conducted by a SBAR panel and a study by the National Academy of Sciences is completed. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed a provision to restrict OSHA's spending on implementing changes to crystalline silica standards until a review is conducted by a SBAR panel and a study by the National Academy of Sciences is completed. S. 1695 would have allocated $800,000 to OSHA for the NAS study, but it was not voted on by the Senate. Legal challenges to the new crystalline silica standards were initiated by various groups after the Final Rule was published. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated petitions challenging OSHA's new silica exposure standards in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Employers and manufacturers raised five key issues regarding the standards, including concerns about health risks, technological feasibility, economic feasibility, compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, and confidentiality of medical examination results. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld new standards challenged by labor groups and manufacturers regarding medical surveillance and dry cleaning methods in the workplace. The court rejected challenges to the medical surveillance provision and found OSHA's decision on medical removal to be \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld new standards challenged by labor groups and manufacturers regarding medical surveillance and dry cleaning methods in the workplace. The court remanded issues to OSHA for reconsideration or further explanation on medical removal recommendations by professionals for workers with COPD."
