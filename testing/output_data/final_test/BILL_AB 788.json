    "title": "AB 788",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4040 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define a \"prescription\" as an order given individually for a patient, including their name, address, drug details, directions for use, date of issue, prescriber's information, and purpose of the drug if requested. The prescription order can be requested by the patient or prescriber to omit information about the condition or purpose from the container label. The order must be in writing and signed by the prescriber, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, naturopathic doctor, or pharmacist. A prescription order can be issued by various healthcare professionals licensed in the state, including physicians, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, veterinarians, nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and pharmacists. A written order from a prescriber for a dangerous drug can be treated as a prescription by the pharmacist if it includes specific information. If there is a conflict, the Health and Safety Code prevails. Electronic transmission prescription includes image and data prescriptions. Abbreviations do not invalidate a valid prescription. Chiropractors may prescribe devices within their scope of practice. Business and Professions Code Section 4076 is amended. Section 4076 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require pharmacists to dispense prescriptions only in properly labeled containers that meet state and federal law requirements. Pharmacists must dispense prescriptions in properly labeled containers with the drug name, directions for use, and patient's name, unless specified by certain healthcare providers. When dispensing prescriptions, pharmacists must include the drug name, patient's name, prescriber's name, date of issue, pharmacy information, prescription number, drug strength, quantity, and expiration date. The expiration date of the drug dispensed and the physical description of the medication must be included on the prescription label, except for certain exemptions. This requirement applies to outpatient pharmacies only. The information required by this paragraph may be printed on an auxiliary label affixed to the prescription container for outpatient pharmacies. If a pharmacist dispenses a drug using a unit dose medication system for patients in healthcare facilities, the system must contain necessary information or have it readily available at the time of drug administration. If a pharmacist dispenses a dangerous drug in a licensed facility, it is not necessary to include the names of healthcare professionals on individual unit dose containers for specific patients. When a pharmacist dispenses a prescription drug in a licensed facility, they do not need to include certain information if the drug is administered by a licensed healthcare professional within their scope of practice. Section 4070 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read under this act, with no reimbursement required by local agencies or school districts as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. Section 4070 of the Business and Professions Code states that an oral or electronic prescription must be reduced to writing by the pharmacist and filled promptly. The pharmacist is not required to write down certain details if they are easily accessible in the pharmacy. A pharmacy receiving an electronic transmission prescription is not required to reduce it to writing if they can produce a hard copy report with dispensing information upon request by the board. This exemption does not apply to controlled substances in Schedule II-V, except as permitted by law. The pharmacy's computer system must not allow changes to received information or dispensed dangerous drugs once recorded electronically. Corrections can only be made by a pharmacist with approval, and the record must reflect the correction, date, and individuals involved. The pharmacist making corrections and the pharmacist approving them must be identified in the record. The requirement for electronically transmitted prescriptions to be sent to the patient's chosen pharmacy or written prescriptions does not apply to medications administered in acute care hospitals."
