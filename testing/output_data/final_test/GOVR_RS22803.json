    "content": "The dormant Commerce Clause is not applicable when a state acts as a market participant rather than a market regulator. The market participant doctrine does not apply when the state is assessing and computing taxes. Two cases have addressed whether state laws taxing interest earned on bonds issued by other states while exempting interest earned on bonds issued by that state violate the Commerce Clause. In 1994, the Ohio court held such treatment was constitutional, while in 2006, the Kentucky court held the opposite. In Kentucky Department of Revenue v. Davis, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Ohio's bond taxing scheme did not violate the Commerce Clause as it benefitted the state. The court distinguished between challenges involving in-state private entities and those benefitting the state itself. The market participant doctrine was not applicable in this case. The court found two cases relevant: Bonaparte v. Tax Court and South Carolina v. Baker. Bonaparte established that a state law exempting state-issued public debt held by residents, while taxing non-residents, did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause. South Carolina v. Baker determined that the federal government could tax state-issued bonds. The Shaper court quoted the Supreme Court's statement that state bonds can be taxed by the federal government. Ohio's bond taxing scheme was upheld as constitutional due to the lack of precedent applying the Commerce Clause. In contrast, the Kentucky court of appeals found that their state's bond taxing scheme violated the Commerce Clause. The court found Kentucky's bond taxation system to be facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, as it favored in-state bonds over out-of-state bonds. It rejected the state's argument to adopt the Shaper court's holding, stating that a statute cannot be deemed permissible just because it has not been previously found unconstitutional. The court also dismissed the relevance of the Bonaparte decision, which dealt with the Full Faith and Credit Clause, not the Commerce Clause. The U.S. Supreme Court found Kentucky's bond taxing scheme unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, favoring in-state bonds over out-of-state bonds. The court rejected the argument that Kentucky was a market participant, stating it was a market regulator when choosing how to tax its citizens. Oral arguments for the Davis case were heard on November 5, 2007, with a transcript available on the Supreme Court's website. The Court's decision in United Haulers influenced the outcome of the Davis case. The Court found Kentucky's bond taxing scheme unconstitutional for discriminating against out-of-state entities. The United Haulers decision suggested a less stringent analysis for state laws benefiting public entities. Questions remain on how the Court will apply this to the Davis case. The Court's analysis in United Haulers found that governmental units and private entities are not \"substantially similar\" due to public welfare responsibilities. In Davis, the key question is whether Kentucky is similar to other states in its bond taxing scheme. If so, it could be constitutionally problematic. However, if a similar analysis to United Haulers is applied, Kentucky's taxing scheme may be permissible. Policy concerns include not disrupting the state bond market and bond purchasers' expectations. The Court may find Kentucky's taxing scheme constitutional, as Congress could authorize it under the Commerce Clause. This would not violate any other constitutional provision, such as disrupting the state bond market or bond purchasers' expectations."
