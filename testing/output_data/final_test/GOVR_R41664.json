    "content": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims to increase access to affordable health insurance for uninsured Americans and make insurance more affordable for those already covered. It restructures the private health insurance market, sets minimum coverage standards, mandates most U.S. residents to have health insurance, and establishes state-based insurance exchanges. Federal subsidies are available to help individuals and families purchase coverage through the exchanges. ACA also expands Medicaid eligibility, amends Medicare to reduce spending, imposes an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and makes various other changes in healthcare financing and delivery. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims to increase access to affordable health insurance for uninsured Americans and make insurance more affordable for those already covered. It restructures the private health insurance market, mandates most U.S. residents to have health insurance, and establishes state-based insurance exchanges. ACA includes spending to subsidize health insurance coverage through exchanges, expands Medicaid eligibility, amends Medicare, imposes an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and makes various changes to healthcare financing and delivery. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions for temporary programs to increase access and funding for targeted groups, such as high-risk pools for uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions, a reinsurance program for 55- to 64-year-old retirees, and small business tax credits. States may also choose to expand their Medicaid programs before 2014. Private health insurance market reforms have already been implemented. Some private health insurance market reforms have already taken effect, including extending dependent coverage to children under age 26, prohibiting denial of insurance based on preexisting conditions for children under age 19, and eliminating lifetime dollar limits on essential health benefits. Plans must cover preventive care with no cost-sharing, establish an appeals process for coverage and claims, and limit administrative costs compared to medical costs. The major expansion and reform provisions in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) begin in 2014 with states expected to establish health insurance exchanges. Beginning in 2014, states are expected to establish health insurance exchanges providing access to private plans with standardized benefits. Premium credits and subsidies will be available for eligible individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the FPL. Most individuals will be required to have insurance or face a penalty, and certain employers with more than 50 employees may also face penalties for not offering health insurance. Employers not offering health insurance may face penalties under the ACA. Market reforms in 2014 include no annual dollar limits on essential health benefits and coverage for preexisting conditions. Plans must meet essential benefit standards and cover various services. Premiums can vary based on age, family size, geographic area, and tobacco use. Plans must sell and renew policies to all individuals without discrimination. The ACA requires private health insurance plans to sell and renew policies to all individuals without discrimination based on health status. State Medicaid programs must expand coverage to eligible non-pregnant, non-elderly legal residents with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level or risk losing federal matching funds. The federal government will cover costs for this group initially, with the matching percentage phased down to 90% by 2020. The law also maintains the current CHIP structure through FY2019 and provides federal CHIP appropriations through FY2015. The Supreme Court found the Medicaid expansion unconstitutional for threatening states with the loss of federal matching funds. The ACA includes provisions to reduce Medicare spending growth, such as payment cuts to Medicare Advantage plans and hospitals, the establishment of an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to recommend spending reductions, and tools to combat fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, the law creates pilot programs to test integrated care models. The ACA establishes pilot programs to test integrated care models, including ACOs, medical homes, and bundled payments. It creates the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to pilot new payment and service delivery models primarily for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally, the law introduces pay-for-reporting and pay-for-performance programs within Medicare, incentives for primary care and prevention, and increased funding for these initiatives. The ACA increases funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps to expand access to primary care services in rural areas. It requires the HHS Secretary to develop a national strategy for health care quality. ACA implementation is projected to reduce federal deficits by $210 billion over 10 years. The ACA's insurance coverage provisions are projected to result in net costs of $1,042 billion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. These costs will be offset by penalties paid by uninsured individuals and employers, an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and savings from other effects of coverage expansion on tax revenues and outlays. The net costs are balanced by direct spending savings from payment and delivery system reform provisions and new revenue sources from taxes and fees. The ACA raises revenue from taxes on high-income households and fees on insurers and manufacturers. CBO and JCT project $1,252 billion in new revenues and direct spending savings over FY2012-FY2021. The law also limits contributions to FSAs and excludes over-the-counter medications from reimbursement. The March 2012 baseline projects an increase in gross costs for insurance coverage expansion under the ACA, with estimated net costs of $1,083 billion over a 10-year period. CBO and JCT estimate that the ACA will increase the number of nonelderly Americans with health insurance by about 33 million in 2021, with Medicaid and CHIP programs expected to enroll 17 million additional individuals. In 2021, an estimated 23 million people will purchase health insurance through insurance exchanges, leading to a net increase of about 16 million people with private insurance coverage. CBO and JCT's projections do not include the Supreme Court's decision on Medicaid expansion. The ACA implementation involves all major healthcare stakeholders. The ACA implementation involves major healthcare stakeholders, including federal and state governments, employers, insurers, and providers. The HHS Secretary oversees key provisions, with other federal agencies like the IRS having regulatory responsibilities. Market reform and coverage expansion under ACA will take effect in 2014, requiring extensive rulemaking and actions by federal agencies. The ACA implementation involves new statutory requirements, creating commissions and advisory bodies with decision-making authority. States must expand Medicaid coverage, establish exchanges, and employers play a key role in providing health insurance coverage. Small employers face decisions on incentives, while larger employers must weigh the benefits and costs of offering coverage or paying penalties. Federal subsidies and outlays are also part of the implementation. The ACA includes mandatory spending for expanding insurance coverage, with federal subsidies and outlays. It also provides funding for various grant programs and activities, such as establishing exchanges and testing payment models. Additionally, the ACA funded trust funds for health centers, workforce programs, research, and public health initiatives. The ACA funded trust funds for various programs and activities, including expanding insurance coverage and establishing exchanges. The HIRIF funds have been used for administrative costs, with a request for additional funding in the FY2013 budget. Congressional appropriators will need to act to obtain funding for discretionary programs related to ACA implementation. The federal rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), involves publishing proposed rules, allowing public comments, and issuing final rules. Agencies must comply with the APA's requirements, which do not apply to guidance documents. The ACA includes provisions for agencies to issue rules, giving Congress oversight options for implementation. Congress has various oversight options for implementing the ACA, including hearings, meetings with agency officials, requesting evaluations from the Government Accountability Office, and using the Congressional Review Act to disapprove agency rules. State attorneys general have also challenged certain provisions of the ACA through lawsuits. State attorneys general and others filed lawsuits challenging provisions of the ACA on constitutional grounds, leading to cases reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012, the Court upheld the individual mandate as a constitutional exercise of Congress's taxing authority but ruled against its validity under the Commerce Clause or Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court also addressed the Medicaid expansion provision in a separate opinion. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2012 ruling, upheld the individual mandate of the ACA as constitutional under Congress's taxing authority but not under the Commerce Clause or Necessary and Proper Clause. Chief Justice Roberts' opinion found that the Medicaid expansion provision coerced states into administering a new program by threatening to withhold federal Medicaid funds, violating the Tenth Amendment. However, the Court allowed for severance of the unconstitutional provision, limiting it to the termination of federal funds. States can now decline to participate in the Medicaid expansion without financial penalty but must comply with new requirements to receive expansion-related funds. The federal government will cover 100% of expansion costs for the first three years, phasing down to 90% thereafter. Low-income adults below the poverty line may be ineligible for Medicaid if a state chooses not to implement the expansion. Low-income adults eligible for Medicaid may not qualify for exchange subsidies."
