    "content": "We investigate properties of multidimensional probability distributions in latent space prior distributions of implicit generative models. Linear interpolations between random latent vectors show oversampling near the origin, limiting their usability for analyzing the latent space. The distribution mismatch can be eliminated by choosing the latent probability distribution or using non-linear interpolations. There is a trade-off between linear interpolation and stable training properties like finite mean. The multidimensional Cauchy distribution is used as an example of the prior distribution, along with a method for creating non-linear interpolations. Generative latent variable models like VAEs and GANs require defining a probability distribution on the latent space. VAEs use a stochastic encoder network to embed data in a lower dimensional space, while GANs use a generator network to create data samples from noise. Non-linear interpolations can be used to address distribution mismatch in latent space prior distributions. The latent space in generative models like VAEs and GANs requires a defined probability distribution. Popular variants include the multidimensional normal distribution and the uniform distribution on a zero-centred hypercube. Analyzing the latent space can be done locally by sampling and decoding points nearby or globally to capture long-distance relationships through methods like latent arithmetics and interpolations. Interpolations offer interpretability through one-dimensional curves, aiding in understanding the model's representation. The latent space in generative models like VAEs and GANs needs a defined probability distribution, such as a multidimensional normal distribution or a uniform distribution on a zero-centred hypercube. Analyzing the latent space can be done locally by sampling nearby points or globally through methods like latent arithmetics and interpolations. A meaningful representation in the latent space reflects the internal structure of the training dataset, showing gradual transformations in interpolations. Additional tools are needed to evaluate the coherence and quality of the learned manifold. The interpolations in the learned manifold are distinguished by the shortest path property, often using the Euclidean metric. Different definitions of shortest path can result in various interpolations. A well-trained model should transform samples sensibly along the shortest path, reflecting any natural hierarchy in the data. Interpolations in the learned manifold are guided by the shortest path property, which can be influenced by the data features. The latent space can be equipped with a stochastic Riemannian metric to enforce desired properties in the interpolation scheme. This approach complements the analysis of the latent space using simple methods. In this work, the authors criticize the use of linear interpolations in evaluating properties directly connected with the model's objective. They propose a more sophisticated metric to comprehensively describe the latent space and suggest a suitable interpolation variant to address distribution mismatch issues. The authors criticize the use of linear interpolations in evaluating properties connected with the model's objective due to distribution mismatch issues in the latent space. They propose a more sophisticated metric to describe the latent space comprehensively and suggest a suitable interpolation variant to address this issue. The authors found flawed data generation near the latent space origin in experiments using a DCGAN model on the celebA dataset. They suggest changing the latent distribution or using spherical interpolations to address the issue of distribution mismatch in the latent space. In addressing distribution mismatch in the latent space, using spherical interpolations is a common compromise. Linear interpolations that preserve the latent probability distribution are either trivial or \"pathological.\" The Cauchy distribution is an example of an invariant distribution with negative consequences when chosen as the latent prior. Nonlinear interpolations that do not cause distribution mismatch are explored to relax the Euclidean shortest path property. Nonlinear interpolations are proposed to address distribution mismatch in the latent space, avoiding issues with linear interpolations. A general framework for creating such interpolations is described, with examples provided in sections 3.4 and 3.5. The experiments using the DCGAN model on the CelebA dataset aim to illustrate the problem, not study the DCGAN itself. The focus is on selecting a proper latent distribution for training a generative model with a D-dimensional latent space and fixed latent probability distribution. The text discusses weak convergence of random variables and the concept of linear interpolation invariance in probability distributions. It mentions that the most commonly used latent probability distributions are products of independent random variables. The text discusses the weak convergence of random variables and linear interpolation invariance in probability distributions. It highlights that latent distributions are often products of independent random variables, with norms concentrating around a certain value resembling sampling from a zero-centered sphere. This leads to oversampling regions near the origin in the latent space, resulting in a lack of linear interpolation invariance property for Z. The variance of the approximated probability distribution of Z does not change as D tends to infinity, only the radius of the sphere is affected. If the latent distribution is normalized, it concentrates around the unit sphere, showing the soap bubble phenomenon. Linear interpolation changes the distribution, with Z being the middle points of a linear interpolation between two independent samples from Z. If Z has a finite mean and is distributed identically to Z, it must be concentrated at a single point. If a probability distribution is not heavy-tailed, its tails are bounded by the exponential distribution, indicating a finite mean. Distributions with undefined expected value are heavy-tailed, which can impact training negatively. BID7 reduced distribution mismatch by defining the latent distribution using a Cauchy distribution with no finite mean. The Cauchy distribution has a density function of 1/\u03c0(1 + x^2) and does not have a finite mean. It satisfies the distribution matching property and can be used in high dimensional spaces by defining it as a product of independent standard Cauchy distributions. The linear interpolation invariance property of the Cauchy distribution can be proved by applying formulas coordinate-wise. The multivariate Cauchy distribution has isotropy but with statistically dependent canonical directions. The distribution is a member of stable distributions and has been used to model heavy-tailed data. The non-isotropic Cauchy distribution will be the focus of further analysis. The Cauchy distribution, not commonly used in generative models, shows low density near zero for norms of vectors in high dimensions. Linear interpolations avoid oversampling this area due to the heavy-tailed nature of the distribution. Comparison with other distributions is shown in FIG0. The distribution-interpolation trade off suggests that distributions with linear interpolation invariance are either trivial or heavy-tailed. Challenges in generating images were observed with the Cauchy distribution. The Cauchy distribution poses challenges in generating images due to issues with large norm of latent vectors. Linear interpolation invariance property prevents normalization using linear transformations, making batch normalization ineffective. Non-linear normalization, such as clipping norms of latent vectors, alters the distribution and interpolation, which will be further explored in the next section. In the next section, popular variants of interpolations are reviewed with a focus on distribution mismatch analysis. Two new examples of interpolations are presented, emphasizing their performance with popular latent priors. The interpolation on the latent space is formally defined as a function, with a property regarding distribution matching discussed. The linear interpolation defined as f L x1,x2 (\u03bb) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)x 1 + \u03bbx 2 does not change the distribution of Z. The spherical linear interpolation, defined as DISPLAYFORM0 where \u2126 is the angle between vectors x 1 and x 2, corresponds to a geodesic on the sphere of radius R when vectors x 1 and x 2 have the same length. This interpolation can have the distribution matching property, unlike the linear interpolation. The normalised interpolation introduced in BID0 preserves the distribution of Z if Z has a uniform distribution on the zero-centred sphere of radius R > 0. However, it behaves poorly when vectors x1 and x2 are close or equal in length, violating the concept of the shortest path. A general method for designing interpolations with the distribution matching property is presented here. The method presented involves defining a Cauchy-linear interpolation in a latent space L with a given probability distribution Z. It requires assumptions about Z and involves transforming endpoints x1 and x2 using a bijection g to maintain the original latent distribution. The Cauchy-linear interpolation in a latent space L with probability distribution Z involves transforming endpoints x1 and x2 using a bijection g to maintain the original distribution. Defining g as CDF \u22121 C \u2022 CDF Z applied to every coordinate can achieve this, with additional assumptions needed for desired properties like behaving as spherical linear interpolation. The spherical Cauchy-linear interpolation involves interpolating directions of latent vectors and norms using a specific formula. It does not alter the distribution of Z if Z is isotropic, with assumptions about the g function needed for verification. Comparisons between Cauchy-linear and spherical Cauchy-linear interpolations are shown in a two-dimensional plane. The study explores spherical Cauchy-linear interpolations on a two-dimensional plane for vectors from different distributions, showing distribution matching. Results from a DCGAN model trained on CelebA dataset are compared. It is noted that defining a latent probability distribution with a finite mean and linear interpolation invariance is impossible. The D-dimensional Cauchy distribution remains unchanged by linear interpolation but leads to poor model performance due to its heavy-tailed nature. The study proposes using nonlinear interpolations with the Cauchy distribution to match distributions, relaxing the assumption of straight-line paths. Three goals for using interpolations in generative models are identified: ensuring training objectives are met without distribution mismatch, exploring manifold convexity with linear interpolations, and conducting a comprehensive investigation of the learned manifold. The study suggests using nonlinear interpolations with the Cauchy distribution to match distributions, exploring manifold convexity with linear interpolations, and conducting a comprehensive investigation of the learned manifold using a DCGAN model. Generative models can generate sensible images from out-of-distribution regions, showing promise for future research. The generator and discriminator networks had specific architectures with different activation functions and optimizers. The latent space dimension was set to 100, and input images were resized to 64x64 for the CelebA dataset. The text discusses the convergence of cumulative distribution functions and the modification of negative values in the normal distribution. The central limit theorem is used to show uniform convergence, and a bijection function is utilized for substitution. Negative values are concentrated at zero, and the inequality is simplified accordingly. The proof involves simplifying inequalities for non-negative random variables and approximating the variable Z. The square root function is used, and calculations are made for N + (D\u00b5, D\u03c3^2). The width of N (D\u00b5, D\u03c3^2) is discussed, and a definition for b is introduced to determine probabilities. The assumption is made that \u221aD\u00b5 - b > 0. The proof involves simplifying inequalities for non-negative random variables and approximating the variable Z. The square root function is used, and calculations are made for N + (D\u00b5, D\u03c3^2). The width of N (D\u00b5, D\u03c3^2) is discussed, and a definition for b is introduced to determine probabilities. The cumulative distribution functions are increasing functions with values in [0. The cumulative distribution functions are increasing functions with values in [0, 1]. By simplifying inequalities and approximating the variable Z, it is shown that if Z has a finite mean and is distributed identically to Z, then Z must be concentrated at a certain point. If Z has a finite mean and is distributed identically to Z, then Z must be concentrated at a single point. By using induction on n, it can be shown that a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables is also distributed identically to Z. The sequence converges in probability to the mean of Z, denoted by \u00b5, for any infinite subsequence. Observation 3.1 states that if Z has a uniform distribution on a zero-centered sphere of radius R, then the function f SL does not alter the distribution of Z. This is proven by showing that the random variable f SL Z(1), Z(2) (\u03bb) is concentrated on the zero-centered sphere of radius R, and any linear isometry of the latent space preserves this property. The distribution of Z is not changed by Cauchy-linear interpolation, as it remains invariant to all linear isometries of the latent space. This is proven by showing that the random variables Z(1) and Z(2) are both distributed uniformly on a zero-centered sphere of radius R. The distribution of Z is invariant to Cauchy-linear interpolation, as shown by the independence and identical distribution of Z(1) and Z(2) on a zero-centered sphere."
