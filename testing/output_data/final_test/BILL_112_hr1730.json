    "content": "The \"Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2011\" establishes Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Start-up Savings Account is treated like an individual retirement plan, with no deduction allowed for contributions and a limit on the total amount that can be contributed in a taxable year. Business Start-up Savings Accounts for individuals have a maximum limit of $10,000, with an aggregate contribution limit of $150,000 for all taxable years. There is a cost of living adjustment for the $10,000 limit after 2012. Contributions to a Small Business Start-up Savings Account can be made after age 70\u00bd. Adjustments to contribution limits are based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year. Amounts are rounded to the nearest multiple of $500 if necessary. Taxpayers over age 70\u00bd cannot rollover funds from eligible retirement plans to a Small Business Start-up Savings Account. Contribution limits are reduced for taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint returns). The amount of reduction in contribution limits for taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint returns) is determined based on a ratio of excess income to a specified amount. Modified adjusted gross income includes any excluded amounts from gross income under specific sections. For taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint returns), reduction in contribution limits is based on a ratio of excess income to a specified amount. Qualified distributions from a Small Business Start-up Savings Account are excluded from gross income, while other distributions are treated as net capital gain. Small Business Start-up Savings Account allows payments for equipment, facilities, marketing, training, incorporation, and accounting fees, as well as capital contributions for business purposes. The Small Business Start-up Savings Account allows payments for various business expenses and must adhere to specific conditions regarding subsequent payments or distributions. If the account beneficiary passes away, the account will no longer be considered a Small Business Start-up Savings Account. If the beneficiary of a Small Business Start-up Savings Account passes away, the account will no longer be considered as such. The fair market value of the assets in the account at the time of death will be included in either the person's or the beneficiary's gross income for the respective taxable year. The amount included in gross income for predeath expenses is reduced by amounts incurred by the decedent before death and paid within 1 year. An estate tax deduction is allowed for amounts included in gross income. Mandatory distribution rules do not apply. Excess contributions to Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts are defined as the amount contributed exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the taxable year. Excess contributions to Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts are calculated by subtracting the distributions and the excess contribution amount from the previous year, as well as the aggregate contributions exceeding the allowable limit for all taxable years. The amendment involves excess contributions to Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts under section 408B(c)(2)(B) for taxable years, compared to the amount determined in preceding years. The amendments for Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts under Sec. 408B will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
