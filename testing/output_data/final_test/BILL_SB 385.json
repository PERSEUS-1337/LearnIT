    "title": "SB 385",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 116431 of the Health and Safety Code allows public water systems to request a compliance plan for achieving the primary drinking water standard for hexavalent chromium. The state board may grant a period of time for compliance based on the approved plan, which must include reasons for non-compliance, funding sources, treatment technologies, and options for meeting the standard. The public water system must outline actions to comply with the hexavalent chromium standard by a set date, including planning, designing, and securing funding. The state board can approve a compliance plan. The state board may approve a compliance plan or provide written comments on the plan to the public water system, which must comply with the hexavalent chromium standard by January 1, 2020. If comments are provided, the system can submit a revised plan for approval. The public water system must provide written notice to customers at least twice a year about the compliance plan for hexavalent chromium, approved by the state board, detailing actions taken to meet the drinking water standard. Updates on progress implementing the plan are required in subsequent notices. The public water system must inform customers about alternative drinking water options and provide information on hexavalent chromium levels, the maximum contaminant level, and its potential health effects as per California regulations. The public water system must submit a written status report to the state board updating the compliance plan for hexavalent chromium, with any necessary changes for achieving compliance with the drinking water standard. Approval of the report by the state board includes approval of proposed changes to the compliance plan. A public water system can implement an approved compliance plan for hexavalent chromium without being in violation of the primary drinking water standard. Approval of proposed changes to the compliance plan by the state board prevents violation of the standard while the plan is pending. The state board can direct revisions or disapprove a compliance plan if it is deemed inadequate to achieve compliance. Written status reports may also be disapproved if they fail to show compliance. The public water system will be notified of deficiencies that need to be addressed in a resubmitted plan or report. A compliance plan or status report may be revised and resubmitted within 60 days of disapproval by the state board. Failure to resubmit within the timeframe will result in no extension for achieving compliance with the hexavalent chromium standard. The state board may approve a compliance plan that remains in effect until the specified compliance date or until the plan loses state board approval. The state board can provide further guidance on this section through criteria published on its website, without needing to follow the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. This section addresses compliance with the state's hexavalent chromium drinking water standard, specifically for public water systems requiring capital improvements. It will be in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. This act creates new crimes or infractions, changes penalties, and is deemed urgent for public safety. The state's regulation on hexavalent chromium VI went into effect on July 1, 2014, with compliance monitoring required by January 1, 2015. Public water systems may need to take significant actions to meet the new regulation. An act is needed to authorize a compliance period to prevent violations."
