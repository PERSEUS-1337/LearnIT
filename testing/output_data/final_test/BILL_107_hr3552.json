    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Holocaust Victims' Assets, Restitution Policy, and Remembrance Act\". It includes findings related to the Holocaust. Congress finds that the United States should lead efforts to identify, protect, and return looted assets taken by the Nazis from Holocaust victims. The US citizens should understand how the government dealt with these assets, and although efforts were made to locate and restitute them, the restitution policy had inadequacies and fell short of returning stolen property to the victims. The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States found that US authorities generally restituted victims' assets to their country of origin, leaving many survivors or heirs without their looted property. The United States designated \"successor organizations\" to sell heirless and unclaimed property from victims of Nazi genocide and use the proceeds for their care and rehabilitation, as part of a policy that excluded those without a nation to represent their interests. The United States military government's strict deadlines for filing restitution petitions led to many rightful owners being unable to assert their rights, resulting in protracted and expensive administrative proceedings with settlements far below the full value of the assets. Better policy implementation in Germany and Austria could have prevented identifiable victims' assets from being stored in disorganized and poorly secured military warehouses, where they were sometimes stolen or requisitioned by United States personnel. In 1953, a Senate subcommittee criticized the United States Office of Alien Property for its inefficient handling of assets and slow processing of claims. The United States War Claims Commission received over $200,000,000 from liquidated German and Japanese assets to pay war claims. Congress used frozen German assets to compensate American businesses and individuals for damages. The government should improve policies to help victims or their heirs recover stolen property from the Nazi regime. The conference on Material Claims Against Germany has worked since 1951 to accomplish material restitution of looted assets of Holocaust victims, playing a major role in allocating unclaimed restitution funds, including those contributed by the United States, to the Nazi Persecutee Relief Fund. A centralized repository for research and information about Holocaust-era assets would enhance policies to assist victims of future armed conflicts globally.
