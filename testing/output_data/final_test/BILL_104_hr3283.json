The findings in the Act highlight the importance of improving Federal regulation of aboveground storage tanks for environmental protection. It notes the need for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to implement recommendations on oil spill prevention. Consolidation of regulations is seen as a way to simplify the program and ensure compliance with standards for secondary containment structures. The Act aims to promote environmental protection by streamlining offices in the Environmental Protection Agency and other departments, consolidating laws governing aboveground storage tanks, and encouraging release prevention and fire protection measures. The Act defines \"aboveground petroleum storage tank\" as a tank with a capacity of 42,000 gallons or more used for regulated petroleum substances, excluding tanks used in crude oil or natural gas production. The term \"aboveground storage tank\" refers to a stationary tank connected to pipes within a facility. The definition of an aboveground storage tank includes tanks with a volume greater than 90% above ground, capable of visual inspection, but excludes certain types of tanks like surface impoundments, pits, ponds, or flow-through process tanks. An aboveground storage tank may include various types such as intermediate bulk containers, tanks regulated under specific acts, tanks for storing regulated products, tanks for managing leachate or methane gas, and tanks for storing propane. An aboveground storage tank may include various types such as tanks for storing propane gas, fertilizer materials, or other regulated products, as well as pipes connected to these tanks. The Administrator refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Director refers to the Director of the Office. Environmental law encompasses specific statutes and regulations. The curr_chunk defines various environmental statutes including the Clean Air Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Oil Pollution Act, and Solid Waste Disposal Act. It also defines the term \"model fire code\" as codes issued by the National Fire Protection Association or Uniform Fire Code. The curr_chunk defines the terms \"Office,\" \"Petroleum,\" and \"Regulated petroleum substance\" in relation to storage tanks. It includes definitions of petroleum and regulated petroleum substances. The curr_chunk further defines \"petroleum substance\" as petroleum or petroleum-based substances derived from crude oil, and \"regulated substance\" as substances regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The term \"underground storage tank\" is defined in section 9001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as a tank used to store regulated petroleum substances. SEC. 5. CONSOLIDATION OF OFFICES. The Office of Underground Storage Tanks of the Environmental Protection Agency is redesignated as the Office of Storage Tanks, headed by a Director appointed by the Administrator. The Director will perform functions previously held by the Director of the Office of Underground Storage Tanks and other transferred functions. All relevant authorities related to regulation are transferred to the Director. The Environmental Protection Agency designates key officials for regulating aboveground and underground storage tanks. The Administrator will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Secretary of Labor to clarify authorities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The Environmental Protection Agency designates key officials for regulating storage tanks under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. The Administrator will also collaborate with the Secretary of Transportation to clarify their respective authorities. The curr_chunk discusses the regulation of aboveground and underground storage tanks under chapter 601 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 6. CONSOLIDATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS. The Director, in consultation with the States, will evaluate and consolidate laws related to aboveground and underground storage tanks within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The restated laws will streamline their application without modifying requirements, except to eliminate duplication. The regulation under subsection (a) will adopt model fire codes and require reporting of releases from aboveground storage tanks of 42 gallons or more within 5 days to the national response center. The Administrator may issue an order prohibiting the use of an aboveground petroleum storage tank after a release if it poses a threat to human health, public safety, or the environment, until corrective action is taken or it is determined that the prohibition is unnecessary. The Director has authority to issue regulations for aboveground petroleum storage tanks to protect human health and the environment. This includes release detection, prevention, and correction measures in accordance with the law. The Director is tasked with identifying deficiencies in laws related to aboveground petroleum storage tanks and considering industry standards in formulating regulations to address these deficiencies. The Director evaluates laws related to aboveground petroleum storage tanks and issues regulations to address deficiencies. The regulations must exclude the capacity of certain underground storage tanks and clarify enforcement provisions. The regulation under subsection (c) or (d) implementing authority conferred by this Act shall be enforced in accordance with the procedures in section 9006 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The Director must submit an interim report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, detailing progress and tentative conclusions of the evaluation process.
