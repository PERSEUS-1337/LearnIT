    "content": "The U.S. State Department welcomed Felix Tshisekedi's victory in DRC's 2018 presidential election, praising the peaceful transfer of power. Despite debates on the election's democratic nature, Tshisekedi's presidency marks a shift from Kabila's rule. Kabila, who held power since 2000, is expected to retain political influence. President Tshisekedi's coalition government with Kabila's FCC has raised speculation of a power-sharing deal. Observers are now focused on Tshisekedi's performance and independence as DRC faces significant challenges despite its rich resources. The Democratic Republic of Congo is rich in resources but most of its population lives in poverty. International attention has been on addressing conflicts and supporting state authority. Challenges include security threats, political uncertainty, corruption, poor infrastructure, and regulatory issues affecting the business climate. The State Department pledged to work with President Tshisekedi to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, enhance security, and promote economic growth through foreign investment and trade. Enduring conflicts and humanitarian suffering in the east contribute to regional instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Neighboring countries like Rwanda and Uganda have supported Congolese rebel proxies, leading to a security vacuum that attracts foreign militias. State security forces have been involved in serious abuses, with millions of internally displaced persons and refugees in neighboring countries. Around 12.8 million people are in dire need of assistance, and a new security challenge emerged in April 2019 when the Islamic State claimed an attack in eastern DRC. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is plagued by enduring conflicts and humanitarian suffering in the east, contributing to regional instability. The country's economy heavily relies on industrial mining, particularly of copper and cobalt. DRC has poor relations with international financial institutions since 2012. The Islamic State claimed an attack in eastern DRC in April 2019, linking to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a locally based armed group. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has faced economic challenges since 2012 when the IMF stopped lending due to transparency issues in mining contracts. DRC's history includes exploitation by King Leopold II and subsequent independence in 1960, marked by instability and conflicts. In 1961, Lumumba was murdered, leading to a U.N. peacekeeping operation in Katanga. Colonel Mobutu seized power in 1965, renaming the country Zaire and establishing an authoritarian regime backed by the U.S. and Western powers during the Cold War. Mobutu's rule was marked by corruption, fraudulent elections, and a kleptocracy label. Mobutu faced domestic and international pressures as the Cold War ended and his health declined. He agreed to a multiparty system in 1990 but delayed elections. State institutions and the military fractured, leading to conflicts in neighboring states spilling into DRC. Hutu extremists from Rwanda used Zaire as a base to regroup against the Rwandan government, with reported backing from Mobutu. Rwanda and Uganda supported a rebellion led by Laurent D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila in 1996, sparking the \"first\" Congo war. The \"first\" Congo war saw Laurent Kabila seize power from Mobutu in 1997, leading to the country being renamed DRC. Tensions escalated in 1998 when Kabila tried to expel Rwandan forces, resulting in a conflict involving multiple countries and rebel groups. This conflict, known as \"Africa's World War,\" caused a major humanitarian crisis and an estimated 3.3 million deaths. Laurent Kabila was assassinated in 2001, and his son Joseph Kabila took over the presidency. Joseph Kabila assumed the presidency after his father's assassination and led a U.N.-backed peace process. A peace accord in 2002 called for foreign troops to withdraw and Congolese rebels to be integrated into the military and government. Kabila oversaw landmark national elections in 2006, which were deemed credible despite some issues. He won reelection in 2011 in a vote characterized as extremely flawed. The late opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi rejected election results and declared himself president, but protests did not materialize. Kabila's party maintained a majority coalition despite losing seats in the legislature. DRC's relations with neighboring countries remain complex and volatile, with tensions periodically flaring, particularly with Rwanda. In 2008-2009, Kabila and Rwandan President Kagame reestablished diplomatic ties and launched joint military operations. Tensions surged during the 2012-2013 M23 rebellion but have since eased. In early 2018, militia conflict in Ituri led to a refugee influx into Uganda. Felix Tshisekedi's inauguration as president in January 2019 marked DRC's first peaceful transfer of power. His victory averted potential scenarios that could have led to instability, such as an unconstitutional third-term bid by outgoing president Joseph Kabila or a victory by Kabila's unpopular choice of successor. Felix Tshisekedi's inauguration as president in January 2019 marked DRC's first peaceful transfer of power. His victory averted potential scenarios that could have led to instability. Tshisekedi's ability to bring about change in the country is uncertain, as Kabila still holds influence over state decisions, including the security apparatus and mining sector. Electoral data leaks and vote tabulations suggested Tshisekedi's rival, Martin Fayulu, won by a large margin, leading to disputes over the official results. Fayulu, backed by exiled opposition figures, has refused to accept the outcome. The official election results in DRC have raised speculation of a backroom deal between Kabila and Tshisekedi. Local elections scheduled for September 2019 are crucial for the country's democratic process. Kabila's succession and uncertainty over the election process have been key issues in national politics. Significant popular opposition and unrest in DRC led to pressure on the government to hold elections without Kabila as a candidate. Street protests began in 2015 against a proposal to delay elections, with activists, opposition parties, and Catholic organizations organizing protests despite violent repression. The 2018 election process was marred by flaws and irregularities, with voters having a negative view of the electoral commission. The 2018 election in DRC was marred by high-level corruption in the electoral commission, state restrictions on opposition, problematic voter registry, and last-minute cancellation of votes in pro-opposition districts. Exiled opposition figures were barred from running, violating a political agreement for fair elections. The government rejected U.N. logistical support, leading to disenfranchisement and delays. Despite welcoming Tshisekedi's presidency, the U.S. government criticized corruption and political issues. The U.S. government has criticized corruption and political repression in the DRC under Tshisekedi's presidency. Violence surged in the country between 2016 and 2018, with conflicts escalating in various regions, including the east, central Kasai, and southeastern Tanganyika province. Ethnic violence erupted in Ituri in early 2018, while hundreds were killed in Yumbi in December 2018 due to local political and ethnic tensions. The conflicts in Kasai and Tanganyika caused displacement of nearly 2 million people. Political unrest, prison breaks, and attacks in Kinshasa worsened security. The conflict in Kasai led to a humanitarian crisis with atrocities, child abuse, and food insecurity. U.N. officials documented 87 mass graves in the region. The DRC government blamed violence on an antigovernment militia called Kamuina Nsapu. In March 2017, two U.N. sanctions investigators were murdered in Kasai while probing human rights abuses, with evidence of state security force involvement. Conflict and displacement contribute to food insecurity in DRC, along with pest infestations and weather patterns. Efforts to contain Ebola in the east face security threats and distrust of state actors. Kabila's government faced criticism and sanctions for election delays. The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo faced criticism and sanctions for election delays, refusing to attend a U.N. humanitarian donor conference and calling for aid funds to be sent directly to a state agency. Aid organizations reported bureaucratic impediments, and a draft bill threatened to regulate nongovernmental organizations. Civilians have been the primary victims of 25 years of brutal violence in the mineral-rich, agriculturally fertile, and densely inhabited east of DRC. Security forces like the police and ANR have been involved in atrocities, including during counter-insurgency operations and illicit mining activities. Violence from Rwanda and Burundi in the 1990s worsened tensions between indigenous and Rwandan-origin communities. Rebellions in the east, supported by Rwanda, have led to regional crises. Rwanda's involvement in DRC conflicts is driven by national security, ethnic solidarity, and economic interests. The M23 rebellion in 2012-2013, backed by Rwanda, started as a mutiny within the military. Anti-Rwandan sentiment has been present. The DRC government, with the support of the UN Intervention Brigade, defeated the M23 insurgent group in 2013. However, the government failed to fully implement peace agreements and reports surfaced of ex-M23 members being recruited by senior security officers to suppress protests. Multiple armed groups, including Mai Mai militias, continue to be active in the eastern region of the DRC. Multiple armed groups, including \"Mai Mai\" militias, foreign-origin groups like the FDLR and ADF, and elements of the SPLM-iO from South Sudan, are active in eastern DRC. Reports of sexual and gender-based violence, gang rape, child rape, and other abuses by armed groups and FARDC personnel have garnered international attention. The prevalence of sexual violence in Congolese conflict zones is attributed to factors such as eroded status of women, weak state authority, flawed justice system, and breakdown in community protection mechanisms. Men and boys are also victims. Donor efforts to improve accountability for perpetrators have had limited systemic impact. Ivory poaching is notable in DRC national parks affected by armed conflict. The presence of various armed actors, including state security forces, militias, and poaching syndicates, poses a significant threat to elephant populations in DRC's national parks. Poachers and park rangers are increasingly well-armed, leading to a \"catastrophic threat\" to elephant survival. The UN peacekeeping operation MONUSCO focuses on protecting civilians and supporting stabilization in conflict zones, with a mandate to address key strategic priorities. Council Resolution 2409 (2018) outlined two main priorities for MONUSCO: protecting civilians and supporting the implementation of the St. Sylvestre agreement and electoral process. The Security Council extended MONUSCO's mandate in March 2019, focusing on state institutional strengthening and reforms. Other tasks include protecting U.N. personnel, demobilizing ex-combatants, and supporting security sector reform. A strategic review in 2019 will include an exit strategy. The Security Council has debated how MONUSCO should respond to threats to civilians posed by state security forces and logistical assistance for future elections. MONUSCO has faced criticism for failing to protect Congolese civilians due to various factors, including a wide-ranging mandate and limited capacity among troop-contributing countries. MONUSCO's mandate requires supporting the DRC government, contingent on government acceptance. Personnel have been implicated in sexual abuse. The U.S. praised President Tshisekedi for committing to work with MONUSCO but did not call for immediate drawdown. Trump Administration advocated troop reduction, citing support for a corrupt government. Concerns arose over troop reduction coinciding with new conflicts and election preparations. The U.N. Secretary-General stated in 2017 that MONUSCO had pursued reforms to \"yield efficiencies,\" but called for U.N. member states to \"exercise caution in making further cuts to the Mission's budget that may compromise its ability to deliver on its core priorities.\" The Security Council did not alter the troop ceiling in 2018 or in the March 2019 renewal. Since 2013, the Security Council has authorized a Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) within MONUSCO to target armed groups, including through unilateral operations. The FIB has conducted such operations periodically, but the scope of FIB activity has been limited by troop contributors' evolving perceptions of their own national security interests in DRC, as well as a lack of capacity. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has significant natural resources, with most Congolese relying on subsistence farming and informal activities for survival. The country is a major global producer of copper, cobalt, industrial diamonds, and tantalum. The UN investigation highlighted gaps in training and posture of troops in the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) following a deadly ADF attack in 2017. There is debate on whether the FIB model could be applied to other conflict situations like South Sudan and Mali. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a major global producer of copper, cobalt, industrial diamonds, and tantalum. However, private sector growth is hindered by poor business environment, corruption, insecurity, and lack of infrastructure. China is the largest consumer of Congolese copper and cobalt, and DRC's largest trading partner, providing significant loans for infrastructure development. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faced a fiscal crisis in 2015-2017 due to a crash in global mineral prices and political uncertainty. Despite this, GDP growth improved to 3.8% in 2018 from 2.4% in 2016. Major investors divested assets during the price slump, with Freeport McMoRan selling its stake in DRC's largest industrial mine to a Chinese firm. The government's approval of oil production contracts near Virunga National Park raised conservation concerns. In 2014, SOCO, a British oil company, was accused of bribing DRC military commanders to intimidate opponents of oil exploration in Virunga National Park, leading to the cessation of operations there. U.N. sanctions monitors reported in 2016 that due-diligence measures in the mining sector had reduced opportunities for armed groups to benefit from illicit mining, but challenges such as involvement of FARDC elements, government corruption, and mineral smuggling persisted, with gold smuggling through Uganda and Rwanda providing financing for armed groups. The DRC's industrial mining operations, particularly G\u00e9camines, have been criticized for their involvement in corrupt networks. Albert Yuma, the head of G\u00e9camines, has been accused of being part of a \"regime cash machine.\" The IMF ended its loan program in 2012 due to lack of transparency in state mining contracts with G\u00e9camines. Israeli businessman Dan Gertler, linked to President Kabila, has faced international scrutiny for flipping state-held mining concessions for profit. Gertler and his affiliated firms have been targeted in corruption probes in the US, Canada, and the UK, leading to sanctions imposed by the Trump Administration in 2017 and 2018. The US imposed sanctions on Dan Gertler and firms linked to him for acting as a middleman in underpriced mining asset sales in the DRC. The DRC lost over $1.36 billion in potential revenues. Gertler defended himself, stating his success reflects his risk appetite and focus on the DRC. The DRC government introduced a new mining code in 2018, increasing taxes and royalties for foreign mining firms despite opposition. The code was popular among Congolese but raised concerns among Western investors. The Trump Administration welcomed Tshisekedi's victory in the DRC but criticized the electoral process. Sanctions were imposed on top CENI officials for corruption and a flawed electoral process. US entry visas were prohibited for several DRC officials, citing corruption and political repression. Assistant Secretary of State Tibor Nagy called the 2018 vote controversial. Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor Nagy described the 2018 election in Congo as the most democratic but with significant problems. There are differing views on the U.S. stance, with some seeing it as supporting Tshisekedi over Kabila. The Trump Administration aims to strengthen trade ties and counter great power competitors in Africa, possibly influencing its positive relationship with Tshisekedi. China is DRC's main trading partner, while Russia focuses on military cooperation. The Administration continues efforts for a peaceful transfer of power in the region. The Trump Administration has maintained a focus on human rights issues in the DRC, continuing efforts for an electoral transfer of power from Kabila to a new president. They have sanctioned DRC state security officials for human rights abuses and corruption, including prominent businessman Dan Gertler. Ambassador Nikki Haley played a role in U.N. relations during this time. Ambassador Nikki Haley's high-profile role in DRC policy included calling for fair elections and greater respect for human rights during her trip to DRC in October 2017. She urged DRC authorities to adhere to the election timetable and expressed concern about the electoral process and government's failure to guarantee rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in February 2018. U.S. officials rejected opposition calls for a transitional government without Kabila as unconstitutional. The U.S. officials have criticized calls for a transitional government in DRC as unconstitutional and called for a credible investigation into the murders of U.N. sanctions investigators in Kasai. Cooperation between DRC authorities and U.N. experts has been reported as deficient, with Congolese security services interfering with the investigations. A colonel in the FARDC was arrested in connection with the killings. U.S. bilateral aid programs in DRC aim to promote stability, economic growth, health, good governance, education, security force professionalization, and military justice, with a $201 million aid budget request for FY2020. The FY2020 aid budget request for DRC includes $201 million in bilateral funding, a 25% decrease from FY2018. The U.S. provides additional funds for emergency humanitarian aid and MONUSCO's budget. The Trump Administration's policy on the Child Soldiers Prevention Act and Trafficking Victims Protection Act may impact aid programs. DRC has been designated under CSPA and TVPA triggering legal prohibitions on aid, with waivers granted in FY2018. President Trump partially waived restrictions for DRC in FY2018, but did not grant waivers in FY2019, prohibiting nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to the government. Military aid and certain economic aid are generally prohibited. The Administration has not specified which programs are affected, but some U.S. aid implementers have been notified of potential funding discontinuation. Legislation in the 115th Congress aimed to deter President Kabila from holding onto power, including a bill that would have codified U.S. sanctions on DRC. The Senate passed S.Res. 386 urging President Trump to assist elections in DRC and investigate the murders of U.N. sanctions investigators. Previous resolutions expressed concern over election delays and human rights abuses in DRC, focusing on issues like sexual violence and conflict minerals. The U.S. has imposed legislative restrictions on aid to countries like DRC for using child soldiers and human trafficking. The decision not to issue waivers for DRC in FY2019 has led to the suspension of military assistance. Congress has placed conditions on U.S. military aid to neighboring countries to deter proxy involvement in conflicts in DRC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 restricts International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds for governments in Africa's Great Lakes region until the Secretary of State confirms no involvement in destabilizing activities in neighboring countries. Debate continues on Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the SEC to regulate disclosure of conflict minerals from DRC and neighboring states. The SEC issued a rule in 2012, but its implementation was partially stayed in 2014 due to a court challenge. In 2017, the acting SEC chairman directed a review of the guidance. Members in the House supported these actions during the 115th Congress. During the 115th Congress, Members in the House debated legislation to repeal or prohibit Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, citing burdensome compliance costs and potential harm to the Congolese people. Some defended the provision as vital for stabilizing the DRC. The country's stability may hinge on the actions of President Tshisekedi, former president Kabila, and other political rivals. Local grievances like poverty, corruption, and poor access to justice contribute to instability in the DRC. The DRC faces challenges such as poverty, unemployment, corruption, and poor access to resources, exacerbated by political leadership issues. Regional tensions and humanitarian crises in neighboring countries may impact DRC's stability. Efforts to advance reforms and economic prosperity have been hindered by entrenched dysfunction benefiting certain elites. President Tshisekedi's political survival and electoral victory raise concerns about flawed political institutions. President Tshisekedi's electoral victory raises concerns about flawed political institutions and challenges in reforming the security apparatus and governing the mining sector. Restrictions on U.S. aid may hinder support for state institution reform. Policymakers are debating effective tools for exerting U.S. influence in the DRC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 restricts certain International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds for governments in Central Africa's Great Lakes region until the Secretary of State confirms they are not involved in destabilizing activities in neighboring countries. The Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 requires the State Department to provide Congress with a list of countries involved in wildlife trafficking and urges continued military assistance to African security forces for countering wildlife trafficking. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2015 restricted Foreign Military Financing for Rwanda unless they cease support to armed groups in the DRC involved in human rights violations or illegal exports. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 authorized Defense Department support for foreign forces against the LRA. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated sanctions against individuals supporting the M23 rebellion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 restricted funding for Rwanda and Uganda if they supported armed groups in the DRC. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provided aid for civilians in eastern DRC. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act required U.S.-listed companies to disclose if their products contain conflict minerals from DRC or neighboring countries. The Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament Act directed a strategy to eliminate the LRA threat. The Consolidated Appropriations Act restricted grants for Rwanda if supporting DRC armed groups. The National Defense Authorization Act mandated the production of a strategy to support multilateral efforts. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been the focus of several U.S. legislative acts. These include the requirement for the executive branch to produce a map of mineral-rich areas controlled by armed groups, funding for Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) to train a Light Infantry Battalion, prohibition of certain security assistance for countries supporting child soldiers, and outlining U.S. policy towards DRC. The Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of 2006 outlined U.S. policy towards DRC, set funding levels for foreign aid, and authorized withholding aid if the DRC government did not meet policy objectives. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 established a ranking system to measure efforts to eliminate human trafficking and restricts U.S. aid to worst-ranked countries."
