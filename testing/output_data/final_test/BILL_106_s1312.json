    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Telecommunications Competition Enforcement Act of 1999\" and includes findings. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established competition in local telecommunications markets by requiring incumbent carriers to open their networks to new entrants. Bell operating companies were allowed to offer long distance services only after opening their networks to competition. Despite progress, challenges remain three years after the Act's passage. Three years after the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Bell operating companies have not opened their networks to competition as required. Incumbent carriers lack incentives to cooperate, and regulators have not enforced compliance. Mandatory penalties on non-compliant companies can expedite market opening, benefiting American consumers. The purpose of this Act is to penalize telephone companies that have not complied with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to accelerate the opening of local telecommunications markets to competition. Enforcement authority is granted under Title 2 of the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure compliance. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 penalizes Bell operating companies for not fully implementing the competitive checklist for all telecommunications services in their region. The penalty is $100,000 per day until compliance is achieved. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires Bell operating companies to divest their telecommunications network facilities if they fail to fully implement competitive requirements by a specified date. The company must not provide services to carriers in non-compliant states until effective local competition is established. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 mandates that incumbent local exchange carriers with more than 5 percent of the access lines must comply with section 251(c) for all telecommunications. The Commission will investigate within 120 days upon receiving a petition to ensure market competition and consult with State regulators for benchmarking. If an incumbent local exchange carrier is found to be non-compliant with section 251(c) of the Telecommunications Act, the Commission will provide a 60-day period to rectify the issue. Failure to comply will result in a daily penalty of $50,000 and a cease and desist order on marketing long distance services to new customers until compliance is met. If a Bell operating company fails to meet the requirements of section 271(c)(2)(B) for telecommunications services, the Commission will impose a $100,000 penalty for each violation and each day of non-compliance. The Commission has the authority to order a Bell operating company to divest its telecommunications network facilities within 180 days if it fails to meet certain requirements. The Commission will enforce these provisions without altering existing compliance standards. The Commission has the authority to order a Bell operating company to divest its telecommunications network facilities within 180 days if it fails to meet certain requirements, in addition to penalties and forfeitures provided by title 5 of the Act."
