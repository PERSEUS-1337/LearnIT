    "content": "The \"Agriculture Environmental Stewardship Act of 2016\" aims to provide incentives for the conservation of nutrients in organic matter through biogas and manure resource recovery systems to save taxpayers money. It includes provisions for energy credits for qualified biogas property and qualified manure resource recovery property. The Agriculture Environmental Stewardship Act of 2016 introduces amendments to the Internal Revenue Code to include incentives for qualified biogas property and qualified manure resource recovery property, providing energy credits for these systems. The Agriculture Environmental Stewardship Act of 2016 introduces incentives for qualified biogas property, defined as a system converting biomass into methane gas for use as fuel, including cleaning and conditioning equipment. Qualified manure resource recovery property refers to a system that recovers nitrogen and phosphorus from non-treated digestate or animal manure by reducing at least 50% of the nutrient concentration. This property does not qualify for tax credits after December 31, 2020. The term \"qualified manure resource recovery property\" includes equipment like biological reactors, crystallizers, reverse osmosis membranes, evaporators, distillers, decanter centrifuges, and other nutrient recovery tools for non-treated digestate or animal manure. The term \"qualified manure resource recovery property\" includes equipment for processes like dissolved air flotation, ammonia stripping, gasification, ozonation, and thermal drying of recovered nutrients. No credit will be available after December 31, 2020. The term \"qualified facility\" excludes facilities generating electricity from biogas property if a credit was claimed in taxable years after December 31, 2015. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 2015. SEC. 4 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include qualified biogas property and qualified manure resource recovery property for new clean renewable energy bonds. The amendment applies to obligations issued after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5 calls for a study of biogas. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on biogas quality, energy content optimization, and recommendations for expanding biogas production to meet US energy needs. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted to help meet the growing energy needs of the United States within 2 years of the enactment of this Act."
