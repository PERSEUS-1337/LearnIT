    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2012\" and pertains to navigable waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define navigable waters as waters of the United States, including navigable-in-fact or permanent bodies of water connected to navigable-in-fact waters. Exclusions apply to certain types of waters. The definition of navigable waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act includes waters physically connected to navigable waters, excluding certain types of waters like intermittent water flows, drainage channels, and wetlands without a continuous surface connection to bodies of water that are waters of the United States. EPA and corps activities are also regulated. Without explicit State authorization, EPA and Corps activities cannot impinge on States' traditional power over land and water use. Aggregation of wetlands not described in specific clauses cannot determine Federal jurisdiction, and certain wetlands are not under Federal jurisdiction. Appeals can be made regarding jurisdictional determinations by the Administrator. The Administrator's decisions affecting State land and water resources can be appealed within 30 days. Groundwater is considered State water and not used to assert Federal jurisdiction over certain water bodies. The use of a significant nexus test by the EPA is prohibited. The use of a significant nexus test by the Environmental Protection Agency to determine Federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and waters of the United States is prohibited. This section does not affect exemptions under specific sections of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. SEC. 3. APPLICABILITY OF AGENCY REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. The regulations and guidance listed shall have no force or effect, including rules from the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency related to the Clean Water Act jurisdiction. The Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency are prohibited from expanding the definition of navigable waters without explicit authorization from Congress. This includes regulations and guidance related to the Clean Water Act jurisdiction. SEC. 4. STATE REGULATION OF WATER. This Act does not affect a State's right to regulate waters or a landowner's duty to follow State nuisance laws regarding waters. SEC. 5. CONSENT FOR ENTRY BY FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES. Amends Section 308 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require written consent from property owners for federal agency representatives to enter private property for collecting information about navigable waters. Landowners must be notified of the entry date and have access to the collected data. If consent is given, the landowner has the right to be present during data collection. SEC. 6. COMPENSATION FOR REGULATORY TAKING. Federal regulations impacting property value require compensation equal to twice the loss, to be paid by the issuing agency from its operational funds. Regulations have no effect until affected landowners are compensated."
