    "content": "The \"Diversity in Science Technology and Nurturing Capable Educators Act\" or the \"DISTANCE Act\" aims to attract individuals educated in STEM fields to the teaching profession by offering scholarships. The goal is to bring 10,000 of America's brightest students into teaching over the next 5 years. This involves amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a STEM Teacher Scholarships program. The Secretary will award STEM teacher scholarships to students pursuing bachelor's degrees with certification in STEM subjects, who agree to provide qualified service. Selection of recipients will be done on a competitive basis. The Secretary will develop selection criteria for awarding STEM scholarships based on merit to students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Applicants must submit required information for scholarship consideration. Scholarships are awarded for one academic year and can be renewed annually for up to 6 years based on academic progress. Recipients must fulfill a qualified service requirement. The Secretary will establish requirements for STEM scholarship recipients to complete 5 academic years of qualified service within 7 years after obtaining a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Recipients must fulfill this service or repay the scholarship amount not utilized for the required service. The Secretary will use repayments for additional activities under this part. Qualified service is defined as full-time teaching in STEM fields at a public or private school. \"SEC. 264. AWARDS.\" The Secretary provides scholarships up to $20,000 per academic year to eligible students. Recipients can also opt for a bonus agreement to perform qualified service for one academic year. The Secretary offers scholarships up to $20,000 per academic year to eligible students, who can also choose a bonus agreement for additional $10,000 per academic year for qualified service in high-need local educational agencies.

The Secretary offers scholarships up to $20,000 per academic year to eligible students, with an option for an additional $10,000 bonus for qualified service in high-need local educational agencies. Recipients must fulfill the service requirement or repay the bonus amount. Repayments for unfulfilled service will be used for additional activities. The maximum award for a student in an academic year is their cost of attendance minus any other grant aid received. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations for this part. Additionally, a new part for Integrated Degree Programs is added to the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to institutions of higher education for 4-year integrated degree programs where students can earn a bachelor's degree in STEM fields and be certified to teach K-12. Grants are limited to 50 institutions per year, with a maximum award of $1,000,000 for one fiscal year, renewable for up to 5 years. Grant recipients are selected through a competitive process. The Secretary will establish criteria to evaluate grant applications for 4-year integrated undergraduate degree programs. Grants will be distributed equitably throughout the United States, considering geographic distribution and types of institutions. Application requirements will be specified. To receive a grant, a higher education institution must submit an application to the Secretary with a project description, demonstration of commitment and support, plans for project continuation, and an evaluation plan with benchmarks for monitoring progress. Higher education institutions receiving grants must match the grant amount from non-Federal sources. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2021 for this purpose."
