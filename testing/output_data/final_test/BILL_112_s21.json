    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cyber Security and American Cyber Competitiveness Act of 2011\". Congress finds that malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications networks pose a serious threat to national security and the economy of the United States. With information technology being crucial to the economy and national defense, nearly every American is at risk of cyber attacks. Malicious actors have already caused significant damage to the US Government. The United States faces significant damage from cyber attacks, with government networks probed daily, millions of Americans having their identities stolen annually, businesses losing millions of dollars, and intellectual property worth trillions stolen. The White House emphasizes the need to prioritize cybersecurity for economic growth, national security, and democratic institutions. An effective solution to the challenges of cybersecurity requires cooperation across multiple government agencies, private sector, and international allies, along with increased public awareness and preparedness. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress should enact bipartisan legislation to secure the US against cyber attacks, enhance competitiveness in the IT industry, and protect American citizens' sensitive information by improving government networks' security, incentivizing the private sector to mitigate cyber risks, and promoting investments in the American IT sector to create jobs and boost economic competitiveness. Improving US government and military cyber defense capabilities, enhancing private sector cyber risk assessment, preventing identity theft, and promoting international cooperation to address cyber threats. Protecting critical infrastructure, such as the electric grid and financial sector, against cyber attacks and threats, while respecting privacy rights and promoting American innovation. Maintaining robust privacy protections for American citizens' online activities and communications."
