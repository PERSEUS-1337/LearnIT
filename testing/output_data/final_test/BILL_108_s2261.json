    "content": "The Act titled \"Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act of 2004\" provides trade benefits to Haiti under a special rule inserted after section 213 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. Beginning on October 1, 2003, apparel articles wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti can enter the US duty-free for 7 years if Haiti meets specified requirements. During the 12-month period starting on October 1, 2003, the quantity of duty-free apparel articles from Haiti is set at 1.5 percent of all apparel imports into the US from the previous year. This percentage increases by 0.5 percent annually, not exceeding 3.5 percent, based on the previous year's imports. Haiti is eligible for preferential treatment if it meets certain economic and political conditions, including establishing a market-based economy and the rule of law. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of protection under the law, elimination of trade barriers, economic policies to reduce poverty, increase healthcare and education availability, and promote private enterprise and capital markets. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for a system to combat corruption and bribery, protection of worker rights, and not engaging in activities that undermine US national security or foreign policy interests. The text emphasizes the need for Haiti to meet certain conditions, including adopting effective visa systems and enforcement procedures to prevent unlawful transshipment and counterfeit documents related to the importation of goods. Haiti must enact legislation allowing access for Customs and Border Protection teams to investigate transshipment allegations. Haiti also agrees to report exports and imports of specified articles to the US promptly and cooperate fully in addressing any issues. Haiti agrees to maintain production and export records for specified articles for at least 2 years. They also agree to report the country of origin of these articles promptly upon request by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. The term 'circumvention' refers to actions involving false information to evade US or Haiti trade laws on textile imports, leading to tariff avoidance or preferential treatment. The term 'transshipment' is defined under section 213(b)(2)(D)(iii). The amendment applies to goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after October 1, 2003, with retroactive application available for certain entries made on or after that date. Entries made between October 1, 2003, and the enactment of this Act will be adjusted as if the new amendment applied at the time of entry. The Senate passed S. 2261 on July 16, 2004, expanding preferential trade treatment for Haiti."
