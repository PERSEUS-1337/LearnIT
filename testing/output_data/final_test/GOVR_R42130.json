    "content": "Medical device regulation is complex due to the wide variety of items categorized as medical devices, ranging from simple tools like tongue depressors to high-tech devices like pacemakers. The market consists of eight industry sectors, and the FDA is responsible for regulating medical devices. Manufacturers must obtain FDA approval before marketing many medical devices in the United States. The FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for medical device premarket review, while the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates devices related to blood collection and processing. CDRH's activities are funded by congressional appropriations and user fees from manufacturers, totaling $450 million in FY2016, with user fees accounting for 28% of the budget. FDA's authority to collect medical device user fees was authorized in 2002. The collection of medical device user fees was reauthorized through FY2017 by the 112th Congress via Title II of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. Congress aims to balance consumer access to new devices with safety concerns. Private investment in medical device development has fluctuated in recent years, with the U.S. medical technology industry generating $336 billion. The U.S. medical technology industry generated $336 billion in revenue in 2013 and employed almost 671,000 workers. The industry includes medical device, diagnostic, drug delivery, and analytic/life science tool companies. Small device companies contribute to early innovation and may partner with larger companies for market access. The U.S. medical technology industry is a significant sector, generating billions in revenue and employing hundreds of thousands of workers. Manufacturers face challenges in developing new devices due to regulatory and reimbursement hurdles, with costs playing a crucial role in decision-making. Incentives like tax breaks can help offset development costs, but inadequate regulation may lead to unsafe products reaching the market, causing harm to consumers. Access issues have prompted proposals for incentives to develop devices for rare diseases and pediatric populations. The media has reported severe patient injuries and deaths from various medical devices such as metal-on-metal hip implants, pacemakers, defibrillators, stents, endoscopes, surgical mesh, and power morcellators. Concerns have been raised about the FDA's oversight of device safety and effectiveness, with reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other agencies highlighting issues with the review process. The report provides a description of FDA's medical device review process, divided into premarket and postmarket requirements. FDA classifies devices based on risk levels, with low-risk devices exempt from premarket review. Manufacturers must register facilities, list devices, and follow general controls requirements. FDA classifies devices based on risk levels, with low-risk devices exempt from premarket review. Manufacturers of moderate- and high-risk devices must obtain FDA's permission prior to marketing, either through a PMA application with clinical studies or a shorter, less costly path. The 510(k) process allows for FDA clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device already on the market. Clinical data may not be required, and the manufacturer selects the predicate device for comparison. FDA has discretion in determining the appropriateness of the comparison. About 63% of unique devices listed with FDA in FY2016 were exempt from premarket review. In FY2016, 63% of medical devices listed with the FDA were exempt from premarket review. The remaining devices entered the market through the 510(k) process (35%), the PMA process (1%), or other means. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 classified devices into Class I, Class II, and Class III based on risk to patients. Device classification determines regulatory requirements for manufacturers. Class I devices are subject to general controls, which are sufficient for safety and effectiveness. Class II devices require additional controls beyond general controls. FDA determines device classification based on risk to patients. Class II devices pose a moderate risk to patients and may have special controls in place to reduce risk, such as special labeling requirements and postmarket surveillance. Around 15% of Class II devices are subject to special controls. Class III devices have insufficient information to be classified as Class I or Class II, requiring more stringent controls for safety and effectiveness. Class III devices cannot be classified as Class II due to insufficient information for determining safety and effectiveness. They are for life-supporting/sustaining or high-risk purposes, requiring premarket approval for assurance. New devices are automatically Class III unless a manufacturer requests otherwise. Class III devices are automatically designated as Class III unless the manufacturer files a request for reclassification. Some Class III devices may have been cleared via the 510(k) process, with over 80% entering the market on the basis of substantial equivalence to preamendment devices. FDA initially regulated over 170 Class III device types through the 510(k) program, with the intent of eventually reclassifying them into Class I or II. The FDA reclassifies medical devices into Class I or II, or sustains Class III with PMA applications. The 515 Program Initiative was implemented in 2009 to address remaining Class III device types. In 2012, FDASIA changed the process for reclassifying Class III devices from rulemaking to an administrative order. Since 2013, FDA has published final orders in the Federal Register to reclassify many Class III device types. Before a medical device can be marketed, a manufacturer must submit a PMA application for approval or a 510(k) notification for clearance by the FDA. The FDA determines approval or clearance based on manufacturer submissions, with requirements based on device risk. The agency evaluates over 4,000 510(k) notifications and 40 PMA applications annually. The FDAMA of 1997 allows FDA to establish pre-submission procedures to expedite reviews. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), manufacturers must comply with various regulations such as not selling adulterated products, registering their facility with FDA, submitting premarket submissions, and reporting incidents of device-related deaths or injuries to FDA. Manufacturers are also required to pay user fees for FDA review of submissions, with fees varying based on the type of submission and business size. In 2005, FDA review costs were $870,000 for a PMA and $18,200 for a 510(k) submission. User fees make up 43% of FDA's FY2016 program level and 28% of CDRH's level. The CDRH budget in FY2016 is $450 million, with $127 million from user fees. PMA is the strictest device marketing application, requiring valid scientific evidence for FDA approval. The FDA requires valid scientific evidence for PMA approval, which generally involves clinical data. An IDE is needed for clinical evaluations of investigational devices, allowing them to be used in studies to collect data for PMA submissions. FDA released draft guidance in 2011 to streamline the IDE process and ensure quality in clinical trials. The FDA requires valid scientific evidence for PMA approval, which generally involves clinical data. Final guidance on clinical trials was issued in 2013 and 2014. All clinical studies must receive prior approval by an institutional review board (IRB). A PMA application must include summaries of nonclinical and clinical data, device description, indications for use, marketing history, proposed labeling, and manufacturing process description. Approval is based on scientific data strength and manufacturing facility inspection. The FDA requires valid scientific evidence for PMA approval, including clinical data. FDAMA allows for modular PMA submissions. FDA has specific timelines for application review and may convene advisory committees for recommendations. Advisory committees consist of experts and industry representatives. An advisory committee meeting allows interested persons to present information and views at a public hearing. FDA typically accepts advisory committee recommendations for a PMA application, but there have been cases where FDA's decision differed. CDRH may hold joint advisory committee meetings with other FDA centers. MDUFA performance goals aim to reduce PMA review time. FDA may require post-approval studies for device safety and effectiveness. The report published in November 2014 by JAMA Internal Medicine analyzed 223 post-approval studies of 158 medical devices ordered by the FDA between 2005 and 2011. Delays in launching and completing these studies were common, with limited information on the causes of delays. The FDA has never issued a warning letter to a manufacturer for failing to start or complete a mandated post-approval study, which may undermine its authority. The most common effect of a post-approval study was a change to device labeling, but the influence of these label changes is unknown. In 2015, 98% of PMAs accepted for filing were approved by the FDA. The FDA requires manufacturers to submit various types of PMA supplements for device changes, with associated fees. Approved PMA supplements have smaller fees, shorter review times, and may not require premarket clinical data. Clinical data involves human trials, while preclinical data includes engineering tests and animal studies. The PMA supplement encourages manufacturers to use evolving technologies for new device models without direct clinical studies. FDA considers PMA the most stringent application for high-risk devices, but concerns have been raised about the quality of data submitted for approval. The JAMA report highlighted that a significant number of cardiovascular device PMAs were based on single studies lacking high-quality randomized controlled trials. Only 27% of cardiovascular PMAs were based on randomized trials, with 14% using a blinded design. Surrogate endpoints were commonly used, raising concerns about their reliability in predicting patient benefit. The 2009 JAMA study raised concerns about the quality of data used for cardiovascular device approvals, emphasizing the need for higher evidence standards compared to drug approvals due to the permanent nature of implants. Surrogate markers, like cholesterol levels, are often used in place of direct patient outcomes, but may not always correlate with improved survival. The importance of FDA device approval versus clearance is significant, preempting consumer lawsuits on device safety. Clinical trial data accessibility could inform decisions on high-risk devices like cardiovascular ones. Selective reporting bias in medical literature is a known issue, favoring new drugs over comparators. The selective publication of favorable results for drugs in medical literature is a known issue, with failure to publish entire studies and unfavorable outcomes. A BMJ report highlighted that half of clinical studies on high-risk cardiovascular devices remain unpublished two years after FDA approval, with discrepancies between FDA documents and published findings. Mandatory registration on platforms like Clinicaltrials.gov is crucial to address this issue. The authors emphasize the need for improved accessibility and user-friendliness of FDA reports for clinicians. A JAMA report in January 2014 examined FDA approval of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) through the PMA process. The study found discrepancies between FDA documents and published findings, highlighting the importance of making all data available to clinicians immediately after FDA approval. The FDA approved 77 CIED PMAs and 5829 PMA supplements from 1979 to 2012. Clinicians and patients are warned that clinical data are rarely collected before marketing PMA supplements. Nearly half of the supplements entered the market through the 30-day notice supplement. Two widely reported medical device recalls, Medtronic Sprint Fidelis and St Jude Medical Riata ICD leads, were approved via the PMA supplement process. The FDA approved many CIED PMAs and PMA supplements from 1979 to 2012, including the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis and St Jude Medical Riata ICD leads. Postapproval studies for devices via PMA supplements are uncommon, highlighting the need for rigorous postmarket studies to evaluate incremental innovations in device technology. The JAMA study recommends more rigorous postmarket studies for device performance after FDA approval. Innovative but potentially defective devices entering the market quickly can lead to difficult decisions for patients and physicians. For example, the Sprint Fidelis lead had a 2.8% failure rate per year, delivering a painful shock to the patient's heart. The risk of major complications in replacing the lead is 15.3%. The body's natural healing process forms scar tissue along the lead, making removal difficult and risky. If a lead is not malfunctioning, patients are usually closely monitored instead of undergoing prophylactic surgery. The Department of Justice fined over 500 hospitals for implanting ICDs in Medicare patients in violation of coverage requirements, totaling more than $280 million. Medicare coverage for the device is governed by a National Coverage Determination based on clinical trials and expert guidance. The Department of Justice fined hospitals for implanting ICDs in Medicare patients in violation of coverage requirements. The waiting period after a heart attack or bypass surgery is to allow the heart to improve function before considering an ICD. Dr. Rita Redberg emphasized the importance of following guidelines to ensure benefits outweigh harm in ICD implantation. Dr. Redberg reviewed cases for the DOJ and found many violations of CMS guidelines in unnecessary ICD implantation surgeries. The number of surgeries dropped by 28% after the investigation, saving Medicare $2 billion. Europe has lower implantation rates, leading to fewer unnecessary surgeries compared to the US. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA, P.L. 101-629) established the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) in the United States to promote the development of devices for rare diseases. HDE applications are exempt from effectiveness requirements but have limitations such as a 4,000-unit annual limit and the need for IRB approval. The process can be costly, and insurers may not cover the device. The Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) in the United States allows for the development of devices for rare diseases, with limitations such as a 4,000-unit annual limit and the need for IRB approval. FDAAA removed the profit restriction for HDEs developed for pediatric use, while FDASIA allows HDE devices to qualify for an exemption to the profit ban if intended for specific disease conditions. The Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) in the United States allows for the development of devices for rare diseases, with limitations such as a 4,000-unit annual limit and the need for IRB approval. FDAAA removed the profit restriction for HDEs developed for pediatric use, while FDASIA allows HDE devices to qualify for an exemption to the profit ban if intended for specific disease conditions. In order to receive HDE marketing approval, there must not be another legally marketed device available to treat or diagnose the disease. CMS requires FDA approval or clearance for coverage under the Medicare program, but this does not guarantee coverage. Manufacturers may focus on obtaining HDE approval if a comparable device has been approved under another HDE or is being studied under an IDE. CMS has highlighted that manufacturers often prioritize FDA approval over Medicare coverage, which is not automatic. Private payer coverage also typically requires FDA approval. BlueCross BlueShield's TEC mandates FDA approval where necessary by law. Medicare may cover devices without FDA approval in specific cases, such as with an IDE, nonexperimental investigational device classification, or participation in FDA-approved clinical trials. From the perspective of device manufacturers, Medicare's coverage decision holds significant weight as it can lead to rapid adoption of a device in the healthcare system. The processes for FDA approval and Medicare's national coverage determinations (NCDs) are distinct, with different review purposes and contextual factors. While FDA approval is often prioritized, Medicare coverage may be granted without FDA approval in certain cases, such as participation in FDA-approved clinical trials. In October 2011, CMS and FDA launched a two-year pilot program for parallel review of medical products to expedite device approval. The pilot program was extended until December 2015, but the MOU between FDA and CMS was amended in 2015 with an indefinite termination date. Congress is monitoring the status of the parallel review pilot. The FDA and CMS launched a pilot program for parallel review of medical products to expedite device approval. The program was extended until December 2015, with an indefinite termination date in 2015. Congress is monitoring the pilot's status. FDA approved a product through the CMS Parallel Review Program, resulting in simultaneous FDA approval and CMS issuance of a proposed NCD. The agencies plan to evaluate the pilot once a representative group of products have gone through.

FDA approved a product through the CMS Parallel Review Program, resulting in simultaneous FDA approval and CMS issuance of a proposed NCD. The agencies plan to evaluate the pilot once a representative group of products have gone through the process and to extend the program to both drugs and biologics. A 510(k) submission is required for a moderate-risk medical device that is not exempt from premarket review. Between 1996 and 2009, more than 80% of the devices cleared by FDA using 510(k) notification were Class II devices. In FY2007, FDA cleared 90% of 510(k) submissions, with 85% in 2015 deemed substantially equivalent. Manufacturers can choose traditional, special, or abbreviated 510(k) submissions for premarket clearance. A predicate device for 510(k) can be Class I or II, or preamendment Class III without PMA requirement. A study of 510(k) submissions found that 80% were traditional, 16% were special, and 3% were abbreviated. For novel devices without a predicate, there is the de novo 510(k) process. Traditional 510(k) submissions must include device details, comparison with a predicate, intended use, labeling, and directions for use. Studies supporting submissions are usually preclinical, not clinical. Substantial equivalence often means the device performs similarly to the predicate without human studies. The 510(k) process is less rigorous than the PMA process, with characteristics such as no premarket inspections of manufacturing, no postmarket studies required, and limited FDA authority to rescind clearance. FDA can take various actions after review, including issuing clearance or prohibiting marketing. Manufacturers have 30 days to provide additional information if requested. The FDA has 30 days to review a traditional 510(k) application, while abbreviated and special 510(k)s were introduced to streamline the review process. An abbreviated 510(k) uses FDA guidance documents to communicate regulatory expectations to industry. Guidance documents are developed in accordance with Good Guidance Practices and are available on the FDA's website. In an abbreviated 510(k), manufacturers use FDA guidance documents or standards to assess device performance. Other required elements include product description, labeling, and performance summary. FDA reviews this in 60 days. A special 510(k) is for modifications to cleared devices, using design control requirements. This allows manufacturers to declare conformance without data submission. The special 510(k) allows manufacturers to declare conformance to design controls without providing data. FDA aims to review most special 510(k)s in 30 days. The de novo 510(k) process was created to reclassify novel devices lacking a legally marketed predicate, reducing regulatory burden on manufacturers. This process requires more data than a traditional 510(k) but less than a premarket approval application. The FDA has created an alternative de novo pathway for device classification, allowing manufacturers to submit a petition for reclassification within 30 days. This new pathway does not require a device to be reviewed under a 510(k) first. FDA may decline a classification request if a legally marketed device exists for comparison or if the new device is not low-moderate risk. The FDA's de novo pathway allows manufacturers to petition for device reclassification within 30 days without a 510(k) review. The FDA may decline a classification request if a comparable device exists or if the new device is not low-moderate risk. Reports have highlighted concerns about Class III devices being cleared through the less stringent 510(k) process, prompting recommendations for stricter regulations. In December 2008, an orthopedic device by ReGen was cleared via the 510(k) process. In September 2009, FDA released a report on the review of the device, citing 22 instances of non-compliance. Acting Commissioner Sharfstein initiated an internal review due to confusion about the 510(k) legal standard. FDA requested an independent evaluation of the 510(k) process by IOM. The FDA initiated an internal comprehensive assessment of the 510(k) process by forming two staff working groups to review the program and incorporate new science into decision-making while maintaining predictability for industry. Public input was sought through various meetings, leading to the release of two final reports with 55 recommendations in August 2010. Public comments were again solicited, and in January 2011, FDA released its \"Plan of Action\" based on the reports. In response to recommendations from internal review reports, FDA released a \"Plan of Action\" in January 2011. In July 2011, the IOM recommended replacing the current 510(k) process with a new regulatory framework. FDA expressed openness to proposals for improving device review programs in response to the IOM report. The IOM findings align with FDA efforts to enhance device regulation. A well-funded review program will strengthen the system. Major changes should be based on sound science and transparent discussion. The 510(k) process is unique to the U.S. compared to drug regulation. Other countries with strict regulations do not rely solely on substantial equivalence. The IOM report highlights the need for a predicate-based system for premarket review of medical devices. Manufacturers must comply with regulations on labeling, manufacturing, and postmarketing surveillance. Efforts like the Sentinel Initiative and Unique Device Identification system are in development. A strong surveillance system is crucial for monitoring device safety and implementing corrective actions when issues arise. After a medical device enters the market, corrective actions such as changing labeling, improving user training, and postmarket surveillance may be implemented. The iterative nature of device development complicates postmarket requirements. For high-risk cardiac implantable electronic devices, there were a median of 50 supplements per original PMA approved by the FDA between 1979 and 2012. Clinical data collection before marketing is rare. The 2011 IOM report recommended FDA to develop a strategy for collecting, analyzing, and acting on data. The 2011 IOM report recommended that the FDA develop a comprehensive strategy for collecting, analyzing, and acting on medical device postmarket performance information. In response, the 2012 CDRH report highlighted concerns about the current postmarket surveillance system in the United States, noting that foreign surveillance systems have identified serious device safety issues sooner in some cases. For example, a Swedish registry found an increased risk of death with drug-eluting stents compared to bare-metal stents, and an Australian registry was the first to identify higher failure rates of metal-on-metal hip joints. The registry identified increased failure rates of metal-on-metal hip joints and found that new hip replacement products did not improve health outcomes compared with older devices. Patients and taxpayer-financed health care programs were not benefiting from expensive new devices with higher risks of adverse events. Postmarket data can monitor device safety and measure innovation and cost-effectiveness. The current US medical device postmarket surveillance system relies on Medical Device Reporting (MDR) for detecting potential device problems, but limitations include incomplete, inaccurate, and delayed data. Limitations of the passive surveillance system include incomplete, inaccurate, and delayed data reporting, underreporting of events, and lack of information on total devices in clinical use. FDA's MedSun network receives 5,000 high-quality reports annually from 280 U.S. hospitals for targeted surveys and research. Post-Approval and Postmarket Surveillance Studies assess device safety, effectiveness, and real-world performance. FDA may order manufacturers to conduct 522 studies for Class II or III devices. FDA may order manufacturers of Class II or Class III devices to conduct a 522 study if failure of the device could have serious health consequences, is expected to be used in pediatric populations, intended for long-term implantation, or has life-supporting use outside a device user facility. Approaches for 522 studies vary widely and may include nonclinical testing, analysis of clinical databases, observational studies, and rarely, randomized controlled trials. FDA also conducts discretionary studies to monitor device performance, investigate adverse events, and assess benefits and risks to patient sub-populations using privacy-protected data sources such as national registries and Medicare/Medicaid data. FDA is working on creating a new national system for medical device surveillance to address limitations in current data sources. This system aims to provide a resource for stakeholders involved in the use of medical devices, augmenting existing surveillance mechanisms like FDA's MDR and MedSun. The FDA is developing a new national system for medical device surveillance to complement existing mechanisms like FDA's MDR and MedSun. This system will conduct real-time active surveillance using electronic health information with unique device identifiers to quickly identify poorly performing devices and accurately assess their clinical benefits and risks. The proposed actions include establishing a UDI system, promoting device registries, modernizing adverse event reporting, and using new methods for evidence generation. The FDA is working on a new National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST) to enhance medical device surveillance. This system aims to use unique device identifiers (UDI) to track device performance in patient populations. Reports have outlined plans for UDI implementation, including integration into electronic health records and insurance claims. Recommendations for system implementation include a coordinating center, a seven-year plan, and pilot programs. The FDA is working on a National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST) to enhance medical device surveillance. The cost to implement and maintain the system is estimated to be $200-250 million over five years. Reports by FDA and partners on the system are listed. A Senate report recommends full funding for the system. FDA released draft guidance on using real-world data in device evaluation. The FDA released draft guidance on using real-world data (RWD) for premarket and postmarket regulatory decisions on medical devices. RWD is data collected outside of traditional clinical trials, such as healthcare claims and electronic health records. Postmarket surveillance may include ordering manufacturers to conduct postmarket surveillance studies (522 studies) for certain class II and class III devices to gather safety and efficacy data. The FDA requires postmarket surveillance for medical devices with serious health consequences, significant pediatric use, long-term implantation, or life-sustaining functions. Manufacturers must submit a surveillance plan within 30 days of introducing their device. The primary goal is to study device performance and identify failures impacting patients. FDASIA mandates FDA approval of the surveillance plan. The FDASIA mandates postmarket surveillance for medical devices, with manufacturers required to start surveillance within 15 months of the order. However, conducting these studies has been challenging due to lack of incentives for clinicians and patients to participate. FDA issued final guidance on postmarket surveillance under FFDCA Section. The FDA issued final guidance on postmarket surveillance for medical devices under FFDCA Section 522. A GAO study analyzed 313 post approval studies ordered by the FDA between 2007 and 2015, with 56% for cardiovascular devices, 11% for orthopedic devices, and 9% for general and plastic surgery devices. The majority of studies were for devices approved through the PMA process. The GAO analyzed 313 postapproval studies ordered by the FDA between 2007 and 2015. Most studies were for devices approved through the PMA process. Of the 392 postmarket surveillance studies ordered by the FDA, 50% were for orthopedic medical devices. FDA ordered studies in 2011 and 2012 due to safety concerns about metal-on-metal hip implants and surgical mesh used for urogynecological procedures. Most studies were for devices cleared through the 510(k) process. The GAO analyzed 392 postmarket surveillance studies, with most (94%) for devices cleared through the 510(k) process. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 required FDA to establish a system for monitoring adverse events. Device manufacturers must report adverse events to FDA promptly. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 mandated that device manufacturers report adverse events to the FDA promptly. User facilities, such as hospitals and nursing homes, must report deaths and serious injuries to manufacturers or the FDA within specific timeframes. FDA proposed a rule in 2009 for manufacturers to submit adverse event reports in electronic format for more efficient data entry and timely access to information. The FDA implemented a final rule on Electronic Medical Device Reporting (eMDR) in February 2014, requiring manufacturers to submit adverse event reports in electronic format. User facilities can also submit eMDR reports, but paper submissions are still allowed. Manufacturers are mandated to track certain devices from production to distribution upon FDA request. The FDA has implemented a tracking system for certain Class II or Class III devices to facilitate notifications and recalls in case of serious health risks. This includes implantable devices and other devices used outside a facility. The FDA has established a postmarket risk identification system called Sentinel to monitor all FDA-regulated products, including medical devices. The system aims to access data on 25 million people by July 2010, a goal that has been met, and 100 million people by July 2012, which was achieved in December 2011. As of June 2012, the system has secure access to data on approximately 126 million patients nationwide. The FDA's Sentinel system has secure access to data on approximately 126 million patients nationwide from 17 different data partners. The system aims to complement existing systems for tracking adverse events linked to regulated products and collaborates with various institutions and advocacy groups. One project focused on identifying potential orthopedic implant registries for a national network. The FDA's Sentinel system aims to expand to include medical devices by incorporating a Unique Device Identification (UDI) on CMS claims forms. Regulations were established to implement the UDI system, with most devices required to have a UDI on their label in human- and machine-readable form. The UDI is an alphanumeric code consisting of a device identifier (DI) indicating the manufacturer and model. The Unique Device Identification (UDI) system consists of a device identifier (DI) and a production identifier (PI) for tracking devices. It offers benefits such as accurate reporting of adverse events, reducing medical errors, and enhancing postmarket surveillance. The Unique Device Identification (UDI) system provides standardized identifiers for medical devices to support postmarket surveillance, manage recalls, secure distribution chains, and establish a global recognition system. Implementation is phased by device class, with Class III compliance in September 2014, Class II in September 2016, and Class I in September 2018. FDA has engaged stakeholders in meetings and workshops to discuss UDI implementation. The FDA has engaged stakeholders in discussions about the adoption and use of a UDI system for medical devices. There have been calls from various organizations, including Congress, for UDIs to be included in Medicare claims forms to improve patient safety and Medicare trust protection. Following the recall of the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis defibrillator lead in October 2007, Medicare incurred costs exceeding $1 billion. Medicare claims forms currently do not adequately identify beneficiaries who received recalled or defective devices, making it difficult to assess the impact on Medicare. Over 200 FDA recalls for cardiac devices since 2010 and numerous orthopedic-related recalls in the last 5 years have significantly increased Medicare costs. In the past, CMS has been opposed to including UDIs on claims due to technological challenges and costs. However, in a 2016 letter, CMS and FDA expressed support for including UDIs on claims for medical devices. FDA-approved medical devices must have labels that inform users how to use the device. The FFDCA defines a \"label\" as written, printed, or graphic matter on a device's container. \"Labeling\" includes all accompanying materials like pamphlets, brochures, and web pages. Advertising is considered labeling under the FFDCA. The FFDCA defines labeling as all printed matter accompanying a device, including advertising. Devices must meet general labeling requirements and specific labeling for certain devices, such as package labeling, informational literature, and patient release forms. The Quality System regulation also impacts labeling by ensuring legibility and proper handling. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in a device being considered adulterated. Medical device manufacturers must comply with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements outlined in the Quality System (QS) regulation. This includes establishing a quality system for designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing, and servicing medical devices intended for commercial distribution in the United States. Failure to adhere to GMP requirements could lead to labeling errors, potentially resulting in misbranding or adulteration of the device. Medical device manufacturers must comply with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements outlined in the Quality System (QS) regulation. FDA monitors device problem data and inspects operations to ensure compliance with GMP requirements. Manufacturers have flexibility in designing quality systems for their devices. Compliance applies to premarket approval and postmarket surveillance. FDA can take actions to protect public health when issues arise with regulated products. The FDA can take various actions to protect public health, including working with manufacturers to correct issues voluntarily. If necessary, legal remedies such as product recalls, seizures, or injunctions may be pursued. Criminal penalties, including prison sentences, may be sought for deliberate violations of the law. FDA has the authority to ban devices presenting substantial risks and require notifications to health professionals and other relevant parties. Section 519 of the act allows the FDA to regulate manufacturers, importers, and distributors of medical devices to ensure they are not adulterated or misbranded. Section 520(e) gives the FDA authority to restrict the sale of devices if safety and effectiveness cannot be assured, with restricted devices requiring authorization for sale. The Office of Compliance within each FDA center ensures regulatory compliance for pre- or postmarket studies. The Office of Compliance (OC) ensures regulatory compliance for pre- or postmarket studies, manufacturing requirements, and labeling requirements. The Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program aims to ensure data quality, protect human subjects, and enforce prohibitions against promotion of investigational devices. Inspections can be conducted at establishments where devices are manufactured, used, or records are kept. The Office of Compliance (OC) reviews quality system design and manufacturing information in PMA submissions to determine regulatory compliance. Inspections assess manufacturer's capability and confirm QS regulation compliance. Postapproval inspections focus on changes in device design, manufacturing, and quality systems. Compliance offices collaborate closely with the OC. The Office of Compliance (OC) works closely with the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) to regulate business establishments producing medical products. ORA conducts inspections to ensure products meet FDA standards and monitors clinical trials. A Warning Letter is issued for violations of FDA laws. The Warning Letter serves as a formal notification to address violations and prevent future occurrences, potentially leading to administrative or judicial action. Recalls are used to remove or correct products that violate FDA regulations, typically initiated voluntarily by manufacturers after FDA consultation. Manufacturers and importers must report any actions taken to mitigate health risks posed by medical devices. Recall procedures may involve removing all or part of a product from the market, with FDA intervention in cases of non-compliance. If a manufacturer or importer fails to recall a device posing health risks, FDA may issue a recall order. FDA evaluates the health hazard by considering factors like disease or injuries caused by the product, potential hazards to different populations, seriousness of the hazard, likelihood of occurrence, and consequences. The recall is classified based on the level of health hazard. The FDA assigns recalls a classification based on health hazard level. Class I recalls are the most serious, with a high probability of causing severe health consequences or death. Class II recalls may cause temporary health issues, while Class III recalls are unlikely to cause harm. FDA may issue warnings or alerts to inform healthcare providers and consumers of device risks. FDASIA mandates improvements to the device recall system. The FDA mandates improvements to the device recall system, requiring assessments of recall information, effectiveness of corrections, and documentation for recall terminations. This stems from the history of laws governing medical device regulation, starting with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. The FDA's regulatory authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was initially limited to addressing adulterated or misbranded medical devices. In the first 20 years after the act was passed, the focus was on protecting the public from fraudulent devices, but attention shifted to hazards from legitimate devices around 1960 due to advancements in biomedical technology. The post-war revolution in biomedical technology led to the invention of various sophisticated medical devices such as heart pacemakers, kidney dialysis machines, defibrillators, surgical implants, and artificial heart valves. While these advancements have saved many lives, there is a heightened risk to consumers due to the complex technology involved in their manufacture and use. New experimental approaches have sometimes been tried without adequate testing or quality control. The Dalkon Shield, a contraceptive device introduced in November 1970, is an example of a legitimate device marketed without adequate premarket testing. Other examples include defective cardiac pacemakers and intraocular lenses causing serious vision impairment. FDA began imposing rigorous premarket approval of some products deemed devices after Congress amended the FFDCA in 1962. Court decisions in the late 1960s upheld FDA's authority to regulate some medical devices as drugs. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA; P.L. 94-295) provided a definition for medical devices and established general controls for all devices, including provisions on adulteration, misbranding, advertising, and manufacturer registration with the FDA. This legislation addressed the need for comprehensive authority to regulate medical devices, following unsuccessful attempts to classify devices as drugs under the 1938 law. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 established controls for medical devices, including registration with FDA and classification into three risk-based classes. Only Class III devices require premarket approval before commercial sale. Under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, medical devices are classified into three risk-based categories. Class III devices require premarket approval before commercial sale, while Class I and Class II devices have less rigorous requirements such as notification to the FDA before marketing. Class III devices undergo intense scrutiny and need premarket approval (PMA) before being sold commercially. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 classify devices into three categories based on risk. Class III devices need premarket approval (PMA) before being marketed, while Class I and II have less stringent requirements. The reclassification process does not evaluate safety or effectiveness, with Class III devices requiring a PMA application for review. Class I and II devices rely on postmarketing tools to address safety and effectiveness issues. The classification process for medical devices under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 did not include a comprehensive FDA evaluation for safety or effectiveness for preamendment devices in Class I and II. Postamendment devices were automatically placed into Class III, with exceptions for devices substantially equivalent to preamendment devices in Class I or II. Manufacturers could demonstrate substantial equivalence as part of the 510(k) submission. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA; P.L. 101-629) made changes to the law by providing a definition for substantial equivalence and revising the definition for Class II devices. FDA could use special controls for Class II devices and simplified the process of establishing performance standards. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) authorized the FDA to establish performance standards for Class II devices using special controls. It also allowed for the reclassification of some Class III devices into Class I or II to reduce the number of devices requiring premarket approval. SMDA required FDA to respond to 510(k) submissions before new device marketing could begin, evaluating safety and effectiveness data. SMDA allowed for the evaluation of safety and effectiveness data in 510(k) notifications for new devices with different technologic characteristics from existing ones. FDA clearance of a 510(k) notification did not imply the device was safe or effective, as reiterated by the agency and accepted by the US Supreme Court in 1996. SMDA also established postmarket requirements for medical devices, including reporting incidents to the FDA. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA; P.L. 105-115) mandated reforms in the regulation of foods, drugs, and medical devices by FDA. It required facilities to report incidents suggesting a device caused harm, mandated tracking of patients with certain implants, and authorized enforcement actions for non-compliant products. The focus was on reducing FDA workload and concentrating resources on devices with higher potential for harm. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) aimed to limit FDA's authority in regulating the device industry to accelerate technology transfer. It eliminated the 510(k) notification requirement for most Class I and some Class II devices, introduced third-party review for 510(k) submissions, and allowed for de novo 510(k) process for new devices. FDAMA emphasized considering the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence for new devices with different technological characteristics.

The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250) established a user fee program for premarket reviews of 510(k) submissions and PMA applications. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) established a user fee program for premarket reviews of 510(k) submissions and PMA applications. MDUFMA also made targeted changes to reduce regulatory burdens, such as allowing establishment inspections by accredited third parties. It was amended and clarified by the Medical Device Technical Corrections Act of 2004 and the Medical Device User Fee Stabilization Act of 2005. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 reauthorized several expiring programs, including the medical device user fee act, and made agency-wide changes with implications for regulation. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended regulations for medical devices, including creating incentives, reporting requirements, and safety measures for manufacturers. It also reauthorized user fee programs and modified FDA authority to regulate medical products. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended regulations for medical devices, creating incentives, reporting requirements, and safety measures for manufacturers. Provisions in FDASIA made modifications to premarket and postmarket device regulation, including changes to the 510(k) and PMA processes, requirements for postmarket studies, device recall and tracking capabilities, and transparency of FDA's approval decisions.
