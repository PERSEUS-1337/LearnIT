    "content": "The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established the budget process, creating the House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 aimed to achieve a balanced budget by FY1991 through declining deficit targets enforced by sequestration. After failing to meet deficit targets, Congress and the President implemented a \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) process and limits on discretionary spending under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. These changes superseded deficit targets, with sequestration remaining as the enforcement mechanism. The PAYGO process applied to direct spending and revenue legislation, while discretionary spending limits applied to annual appropriations acts. Direct spending funds entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The discretionary spending funds routine operations of federal departments and agencies, while direct spending funds entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The PAYGO process and discretionary spending limits were extended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997. The statutory PAYGO process and discretionary spending limits were in effect from 1991 to 2002. The PAYGO process was terminated in 2002, and proposals to restore it were made from 2003 onwards. Disagreements arose on whether it should apply to both direct spending and revenue legislation or only to direct spending legislation. President George W. Bush submitted draft legislation in 2004. President George W. Bush submitted draft legislation to Congress, the Spending Control Act of 2004, to restore the PAYGO process for direct spending legislation and discretionary spending limits. However, the proposal did not include revenue legislation. In the 110th Congress, there was renewed interest in reinstating a comprehensive PAYGO requirement. Section 508 of the FY2008 budget resolution expressed Congress's support for extending PAYGO to reduce the deficit. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 included a provision similar to Section 515 in the FY2009 budget resolution. The Senate and House have their own PAYGO rules, with the Senate revising its rule in 2007 to align with the House. The Senate has aggregate limits on discretionary spending, while proposals have been made to restore statutory discretionary spending limits. President Obama announced a PAYGO proposal in 2009, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 was proposed to Congress by President Obama, with the House passing a bill incorporating it into various measures. The Senate later added the proposal to a debt limit increase measure, which was signed into law by President Obama shortly after. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer introduced the proposal as H.R. 2920, with the House Budget Committee holding a hearing on it. The House eventually passed H.R. 2920, which differed from the original proposal. The Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 was passed by the House with a modified substitute amendment incorporated automatically. A substitute amendment by Representative Paul Ryan was defeated, and the bill was passed by the House with a vote of 265-166. Section 421 of the budget resolution for FY2010 exempted certain costs from budget enforcement procedures in the House. The House passed the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 with a modified substitute amendment. Section 421 of the FY2010 budget resolution exempted costs in four policy areas from budget enforcement procedures. The House incorporated H.R. 2920 into measures addressing Medicare payments, middle class tax reform, AMT reform, and estate and gift tax reform. H.R. 2920 was included in three different measures during the last two months of the 2009 session. The House passed the Physician Payment Reform Act of 2009 and the Permanent Estate Tax Relief Act of 2009 in November and December 2009, respectively. Both bills included the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009. Additionally, a package of measures was considered to close the 2009 session on December 16, 2009. On December 16, 2009, the House Rules Committee reported a special rule, H.Res. 976, for the consideration of various measures including the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2010. The special rule incorporated the \"Jobs for Main Street Act, 2010\" into H.R. 2847 and required the addition of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009. The House agreed to H.Res. 976 on December 16, 2009, incorporating the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 into H.R. 2847. The House also agreed to the amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2847 by a vote of 217-212. The Senate passed House Joint Resolution 45 in January 2010, modifying the debt-limit increase and adding a statutory PAYGO process. The House accepted the Senate's modifications in early February. House Joint Resolution 45, originating on April 29, 2009, increased the debt limit to $13.029 trillion, up $925 billion from the previous limit. This resolution was automatically engrossed and transmitted to the Senate after final agreement on the FY2010 budget resolution. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 increased the debt limit to $12.394 trillion. The bill was passed by the House and Senate in December 2009 and signed into law by President Obama as P.L. 111-123. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 45 in January 2010, with amendments related to budget enforcement issues, including \"pay go.\" The measure was discharged from the Senate Finance Committee and taken up by the Senate by unanimous consent. Senate Amendment 3299, developed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, became the underlying vehicle for the amendments. The public debt limit proposed by the House was changed to a higher level. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 45 with amendments related to budget enforcement, including the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Amendments by Majority Leader Reid and Senator Baucus aimed to protect Social Security. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 45 with amendments related to budget enforcement, including the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. A commission made recommendations on the Social Security program, with an amendment proposed by Senator Tom Coburn to rescind $120 billion in duplicative and wasteful spending. The amendment was divided into four divisions, with Division I incorporated into H.J.Res. 45 as Title II. Several other amendments failed to garner the required 60 votes. Several Senate amendments related to budget enforcement failed to garner the required 60 votes, including proposals to terminate authority under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, establish a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action, and rescind duplicative and wasteful spending. The Senate considered several amendments related to budget enforcement, including proposals for discretionary spending limits, a Commission on Congressional Budgetary Accountability, and motions to invoke cloture on various amendments. Ultimately, Senate Amendment 3299 was agreed to and H.J.Res. 45 was passed. The House passed H.J.Res. 45 by a vote of 60-39, completing congressional action on February 4, 2010. A special rule, H.Res. 1065, was agreed to for the consideration of the Senate amendment. A motion for an amendment proposed by Representative Randy Neugebauer was defeated. The Neugebauer amendment aimed to establish limits on discretionary spending and offset expansions of direct spending. The motion to agree to the Senate amendment was divided into two portions. The debt-limit increase was agreed to automatically upon a special rule. President Obama signed H.J.Res. 45 into law on February 12, 2010. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 enforces budget neutrality on new revenue and direct spending. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 enforces budget neutrality on new revenue and direct spending legislation. The Office of Management and Budget records the budgetary effects of revenue and direct spending provisions on PAYGO scorecards covering rolling five-year and 10-year periods. Statements inserted into the Congressional Record by the chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees determine the budgetary effects of PAYGO measures. If this procedure is not followed, OMB determines the effects. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 enforces budget neutrality by finalizing PAYGO scorecards after each congressional session. If a violation is found, the President issues a sequestration order for across-the-board cuts in nonexempt direct spending programs. The process is repeated each session with no expiration date. The aim is to prevent deficit increases from new direct spending and revenue legislation. The Statutory PAYGO process excludes emergency costs, savings from the CLASS Act, and debt service costs. It does not address deficit increases from changes in direct spending or revenue levels under existing law. Other budget enforcement procedures like reconciliation may be used to reduce deficit levels. PAYGO does not apply to discretionary spending provided in annual appropriations acts. The Statutory PAYGO Act does not apply to discretionary spending provided in annual appropriations acts. It consists of 13 sections blending new law with amendments to the CBA of 1974 and the BBEDCA of 1985. Sections from the BBEDCA are made applicable to the new statutory PAYGO process. The Statutory PAYGO Act includes core procedural elements in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7, defining PAYGO legislation as bills affecting direct spending or revenues. It covers revenue, direct spending, hybrid measures, and annual appropriations acts with direct spending provisions. PAYGO legislation includes measures affecting direct spending or revenues, with revenue measures falling under the jurisdiction of specific committees. Various legislative committees in the House and Senate handle direct spending legislation. Committees in the House and Senate oversee direct spending legislation, which mainly involves entitlement programs funded automatically through permanent appropriations. Legislative action can still modify these programs despite their permanent funding status. Direct spending can also be provided through regular or irregular legislative actions, such as the farm bill or extensions of unemployment compensation during economic downturns. Measures may fall under the jurisdiction of a single committee or multiple committees, depending on the specific issue, like Medicare revenues or transportation trust funds. Annual appropriations acts, including regular, supplemental, and continuing appropriations measures, provide discretionary spending and are under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Discretionary spending is controlled by budget enforcement procedures, and some acts may include provisions affecting direct spending. The annual appropriations act affects direct spending only in the current or budget year, exempt from PAYGO process. Budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation involve costs (outlay increases or revenue decreases) and savings (outlay decreases or revenue increases). Scoring rules and procedures for CBO cost estimates are crucial in assessing these effects. Only on-budget budgetary effects are considered, off-budget entities are excluded. Off-budget entities like the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and Postal Service Fund are given special status in the budget process. Direct spending and revenue impacts of emergency requirements are not counted in the budget. Procedures are in place for designating provisions as emergency requirements in the House and Senate. In the House, the question of consideration is used to enforce the internal PAYGO rule. In the Senate, an emergency PAYGO designation can be removed by a point of order, which requires a three-fifths vote to waive. Debt service costs are excluded from budget effects, and timing shifts are prohibited to prevent evasions of enforcement. Timing shifts are prohibited to prevent evasions of enforcement in budget legislation. This prohibition applies to shifts at the end of the 10-year \"window,\" involving the ninth and tenth outyears. Costs cannot be shifted out of the window, nor can savings be shifted into the window, as a way of evading enforcement. This rule is incorporated into the CBA of 1974, pertaining to CBO cost estimates. The act allows for exclusions in Medicare physicians' payments, estate and gift tax, AMT, and certain income tax cuts for the middle-class. Adjustments can be made to estimates of budgetary effects in these areas without needing to offset costs. The authority for adjustments is in effect until December 31, 2011, to extend current policies for defined periods. The current policies can be extended with adjustments made for statutory PAYGO purposes varying from two years for the estate and gift tax and the AMT, to five years for Medicare physicians' payments, to permanently for the middle-class tax cuts. The adjustments allow Congress to address these policies without having the cost added to the PAYGO scorecard. Adjustments can be used to offset the cost of legislation for PAYGO enforcement, with limitations on how they can be applied. The adjustments are specific to each policy area and are limited to prevent offsetting the cost of more generous policies. The budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation are recorded on PAYGO scorecards. The budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation can be determined by Congress or OMB. Congress follows specific procedures outlined in the act, or OMB steps in if Congress does not comply. The process involves requesting a \"CBO PAYGO estimate\" and inserting a statement in the Congressional Record before a vote on the measure. The budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation are determined by Congress or OMB. Specific procedures are followed, including requesting a \"CBO PAYGO estimate\" and inserting a statement in the Congressional Record before a vote on the measure. In cases of conference agreements or amendments, the chairmen insert a joint statement referencing the budgetary effects. The budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation are determined by Congress or OMB through specific procedures. A valid statement must be included in the text of the enrolled law for OMB to record the effects on the PAYGO scorecards. Violations of procedures could lead to OMB determining the budget effects. Congressional determinations may reflect decisions made by one chamber. The Statutory PAYGO Act reaffirms the authority of the House and Senate Budget Committees to make final determinations of the budgetary effects of legislation. OMB is required to maintain two PAYGO scorecards, a 5-Year Scorecard and a 10-Year Scorecard, on which the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation are recorded. If a valid reference is not included in the PAYGO act, then OMB must determine the measure's budgetary effects. The Statutory PAYGO Act mandates OMB to maintain 5-Year and 10-Year scorecards displaying the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation. OMB must adhere to rules like combining current year effects with budget year effects and averaging cumulative effects over fiscal years. The 10-Year Scorecard follows the same process as the 5-Year Scorecard, including cumulative budgetary effects over ten years. Emergency Legislation and CLASS Act Savings are excluded from the scorecards. OMB is required to continuously update and publicly release scorecards based on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A hypothetical example in Table 2 shows how CBO cost estimates for a PAYGO act are recorded on the 5-Year and 10-Year Scorecards for the FY2011 budget cycle. The example demonstrates a deficit-neutral estimate over a five-year period, with costs and savings offsetting each other. Look-back feature includes a cost of $15 billion for FY2010. The cumulative budgetary effect of the PAYGO measure is a cost of $15 billion for the 5-Year Scorecard, with $3 billion to be entered for each of the five years. For the 10-Year Scorecard, the measure shows a savings of $10 billion over the FY2011-FY2020 period, with $1 billion to be entered for each of the ten years. The OMB must issue an annual PAYGO report within 14 days. The annual PAYGO report must be issued within 14 days after Congress adjourns, containing the 5-Year and 10-Year PAYGO scorecards, policy adjustments, emergency legislation information, and other relevant data. The report must be published in the Federal Register and made publicly available by OMB. If a PAYGO violation is indicated, further action is required. If a debit occurs on either scorecard, the President must issue a sequestration order to offset it. If there are debits on both scorecards, the order must fully offset the larger one. This involves reducing budgetary resources of direct spending programs to generate savings in the budget year and subsequent fiscal year. In a hypothetical example, a sequester would be required to offset a $3 billion debit for FY2011 on the 5-Year Scorecard. The 10-Year Scorecard would not be relevant in this case. The 10-Year Scorecard is irrelevant in this case as it would show a savings of $1 billion for FY2011. If a sequester is needed, OMB must prepare the order for the President and include it in the annual PAYGO report, which must be transmitted to Congress. The report must include estimates of budgetary resources subject to sequestration, the amount to be sequestered, and the outlay reductions. A sequestration order by the President takes immediate effect. Figure 1 illustrates the requirements for the annual PAYGO report and sequestration order issuance. The Statutory PAYGO Act applies to provisions affecting direct spending and revenues of on-budget entities, excluding off-budget entities like Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service Fund. Programs are assessed for budgetary effects and may be covered or exempt from sequestration orders. Certain direct spending and revenue amounts are excluded from PAYGO legislation assessment, such as emergency requirements, debt service costs, timing shifts, and net savings. The Statutory PAYGO Act excludes certain direct spending and revenue amounts from assessment, such as emergency requirements, debt service costs, timing shifts, and net savings. Section 255 of BBEDCA of 1985 lists mandatory programs exempt from reduction under sequestration orders, with updates made by the Statutory PAYGO Act to include new programs and clarify treatment of certain transportation programs. The Statutory PAYGO Act excludes certain direct spending and revenue amounts from assessment. Section 255 of BBEDCA of 1985 lists mandatory programs exempt from reduction under sequestration orders, including Social Security, Medicare, and other key programs. Sequestration rules limit the size of reductions for Medicare spending, effectively exempting most of it from sequestration orders. If a PAYGO violation occurs, OMB calculates a uniform reduction percentage to eliminate the debit on the appropriate PAYGO scorecard. OMB calculates the uniform reduction percentage to eliminate the debit on the appropriate PAYGO scorecard by reducing budgetary resources for accounts. Sequestration calculations are made based on rules set forth in the Statutory PAYGO Act and BBEDCA of 1985. The sequestrable base is determined as the total amount of budgetary resources for direct spending programs subject to sequestration. The next step involves reducing the total budgetary resources to achieve the required outlay savings in the budget year and subsequent fiscal years. The uniform reduction percentage is calculated to reduce budgetary resources for accounts and eliminate the debit on the PAYGO scorecard. If the percentage is less than 4%, a uniform reduction is applied to all nonexempt accounts. If it's greater than 4%, a 4% reduction is made in Medicare spending, and the remaining programs are adjusted accordingly. Table 3 in the report illustrates sequestration calculations under a hypothetical example. Total direct spending amounts to over $2 trillion, with most exempt from PAYGO. The total budgetary resources amount to over $2 trillion, with most exempt from the PAYGO process. In a hypothetical example, the sequestrable base is set at $640 billion, with $575 billion attributed to Medicare and the rest to other nonexempt programs. A $30 billion debit must be eliminated, resulting in a $23 billion reduction in Medicare spending and a $7 billion reduction in other programs. This leads to a uniform reduction percentage of 10.77% for the nonexempt programs. The PAYGO process required a $30 billion reduction in budgetary resources, achieved by cutting Medicare spending by $23 billion and other nonexempt programs by $7 billion. Section 13 of the Statutory PAYGO Act establishes a point of order against legislation containing recommendations on Social Security spending or revenues. Section 13 of the Statutory PAYGO Act establishes a point of order against legislation containing recommendations on Social Security spending or revenues, requiring a three-fifths vote in the Senate to waive the point of order. The Senate considered amendments to establish a Bipartisan Task Force on Responsible Fiscal Action. Senator Conrad's amendment proposing expedited procedures was defeated, while Senator Baucus' amendment was withdrawn. The Conrad amendment would have excluded Social Security recommendations from expedited procedures. President Barack Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform by executive order on February 18, 2010. The commission was required to vote on a final report by December 1, 2010, but there was no provision for expedited consideration by the House or Senate of the Commission's recommendations."
