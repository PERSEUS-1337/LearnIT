    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that approximately 30 million Americans lack access to basic health services, with specific challenges faced by those in underserved rural or urban areas, lacking insurance, migrant workers, minority groups, limited English speakers, homeless individuals, and high-risk pregnant women, infants, and children. Efforts to provide access to essential health care services for medically underserved Americans, including through federally qualified health centers, can improve health status, reduce unnecessary care, and lower overall healthcare costs. The curr_chunk states that a proven model exists to extend access to medically underserved Americans, benefiting millions in need. Establishment of a new part under the Medicaid program to provide funds for a new Federally Qualified Health Centers Grants Program. The Social Security Act is amended to provide grants for health care services to medically underserved individuals under the Medicaid program. The funds will be used for making payments to States and entities meeting the requirements. The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) will be effective on October 1, 1993. Establishment of a new program under Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide funds for expanded health services to medically underserved individuals. The Secretary will award grants to federally qualified health centers and other entities to provide access to services for medically underserved populations or in high impact areas not currently served by an FQHC. Eligibility for grants is based on proposals submitted to expand operations. The Secretary will award grants to expand operations of health care entities to serve medically underserved populations or high impact areas not currently served by an FQHC. Eligible entities must be certified as an FQHC, have submitted applications to qualify, or have a plan to meet FQHC requirements. Grants will also be given to nonprofit agencies meeting FQHC qualifications, except for the consumer majority requirement. Entities seeking grants to provide FQHC services must have a consumer majority governing board and submit a proposal approved by the Governor. The Secretary will allocate no more than 10% of funds for these grants. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an FQHC or entity must submit an application meeting specified requirements. The application must include fee schedules, discounts based on patient income, and assurances of services provided to eligible individuals. The entity or organization must provide services to eligible individuals and make efforts to collect reimbursement. Funds awarded can be used for planning and specific costs. Funds awarded under this section can be used for assessing needs, preparing a description of how needs will be met, and developing an implementation plan. Additionally, funds can be used for recruiting, training, and compensating staff to meet FQHC requirements. Funds awarded under this section can be used for acquiring facilities, equipment, and services necessary for operating at new or expanded sites. This includes construction of new buildings, acquiring, expanding, or modernizing existing facilities, purchasing essential equipment, and amortization of loans for site construction and equipment. Entities receiving funds under this section can use the money for providing necessary services to qualify as an FQHC, offering other reimbursable services, and covering unreimbursed costs. Priority in grant awards is given to FQHCs certified before January 1, 1993, that propose expanding their operations. The Secretary prioritizes awarding grants to FQHCs or entities proposing to serve medically underserved populations with the highest unmet need. Second priority is given to entities qualifying as FQHCs before providing services in underserved areas not currently served by an FQHC. The Secretary gives third priority in awarding grants to FQHCs or entities that have expanded services and will incur significant unreimbursed costs. Any excess revenues not used for expanding services or covering unreimbursed costs must be returned to the Secretary. Grants may be terminated for entities not meeting specified criteria. The Secretary may terminate grants awarded to entities that fail to meet FQHC requirements or requirements of the section. Prior notice and opportunity to correct deficiencies must be given before termination. Upon termination, the Secretary may sell acquired property. The Secretary has the authority to terminate grants for entities not meeting FQHC requirements. Upon termination, the Secretary can sell acquired property or recoup funds provided. There are limitations on the amount of funds that can be expended for the program in each fiscal year. Effective October 1, 1993, amendments made by Congress apply to services provided by federally qualified health centers or other qualifying entities. SEC. 4. STUDY AND REPORT ON SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND HOSPITALS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the relationship between community health centers and hospitals in medically underserved areas. The study will involve National Rural Research Centers and provide recommendations for improving services coordination. $150,000 is authorized for the study in fiscal years 1994 and 1995."
