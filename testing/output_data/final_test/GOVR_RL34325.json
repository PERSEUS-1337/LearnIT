    "content": "The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) allows Indian tribes to conduct gaming on \"Indian lands\" without conforming to state law. The three classes of gaming authorized by IGRA are class I social gaming, class II bingo and non-banking card games, and class III casino gaming. Tribes can conduct types of gaming permitted in the state without state limits or conditions, such as seeking a tribal-state compact for class III casino gaming if the state allows \"Las Vegas\" nights for charitable purposes. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) allows tribes to conduct gaming on \"Indian lands\" without following state law. This includes class I social gaming, class II bingo and card games, and class III casino gaming. Gaming under IGRA is limited to lands within Indian reservations or lands held in trust by the United States for tribes. Determining reservation boundaries requires analyzing congressional intent and statutes. Determining tribal reservation land status involves analyzing statutes and jurisdictional history. The land must be in trust or restricted status, and the tribe must exercise governmental authority over it. Congress has the power to take tribal land into trust based on various statutes. The Department of the Interior is required to take land into trust for tribes or individual Indians based on various statutes, with the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 being a key law granting the Secretary of the Interior discretion in this matter. Procedures for land acquisition are outlined in 25 C.F.R., Part 151, allowing Indian owners of fee land to have their title conveyed to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust, resulting in the land being removed from state and local tax rolls. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 grants the Secretary of the Interior discretion to take land into trust for tribes or individual Indians. This results in the land being removed from state and local tax rolls, preventing its sale or legal process for debt collection or foreclosure. The Secretary must consider various factors and notify state and local governments for comments before approving land acquisition. The assumption of U.S. sovereign immunity under the Quiet Title Act was challenged in the Match-E-Be - Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak case in June 2012. The Quiet Title Act allows federal courts to resolve disputed real property titles claimed by the United States, excluding trust or restricted Indian lands. In a case involving the State of South Dakota and the U.S. Department of the Interior, a regulation was issued requiring a 30-day waiting period for land acquisition into trust. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak that sovereign immunity under the Quiet Title Act does not apply to suits where the plaintiff is not seeking to claim title to the land. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Federal Administrative Procedure Act allows suits within a six-year statute of limitations period. The decision broadened standing under 25 U.S.C. Section 465, allowing a plaintiff who owns nearby property and is affected by a planned gaming casino to satisfy standing requirements. The Bureau of Indian Affairs responded to the decision. The Bureau of Indian Affairs revised its Land Acquisition regulations in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, eliminating the 30-day waiting period for land-into-trust decisions. Final agency actions are made by the Secretary of the Interior or the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, requiring prompt publication in the Federal Register. Bureau of Indian Affairs officials' decisions are not final agency actions and do not require Federal Register notice.

Bureau of Indian Affairs officials' decisions are not final agency actions and do not require Federal Register notice. Land may not be taken into trust until administrative remedies are exhausted or the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired. Once a BIA-level decision has become final, the land is to be acquired in trust immediately. In a June 4, 2015, en banc decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a challenge to land taken into trust for a tribe not recognized in 1934 may not be raised decades after the trust acquisition in a collateral attack. The en banc court overturned a previous opinion on a challenge to the validity of a trust acquisition under the Administrative Procedure Act. The case involves land taken into trust for the Big Lagoon Rancheria of California in 1994, leading to a dispute with California over a tribal-state gaming compact. The state claimed the land was not validly taken into trust based on the Carcieri v. Salazar decision. The Big Lagoon Rancheria of California claimed that the land taken into trust in 1994 was not valid due to lack of federal jurisdiction in 1934. The Ninth Circuit agreed with California, stating that Big Lagoon was not a tribe under federal jurisdiction in 1934, therefore DOI had no authority to take the land into trust. A dissenting opinion suggested using the APA to challenge the trust acquisition. The APA, with a six-year statute of limitations, was ruled as the only way to challenge a land-into-trust decision. The court held that the land was not \"Indian lands\" for IGRA purposes, allowing California to contest the trust acquisition validity as a defense. The en banc court rejected the approach of challenging a decision more than six years later, citing Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak. Allowing California to attack the BIA's decision outside the APA would create doubt over land taken into trust for tribes. Lands acquired in trust for tribes recognized by the Federal government after the enactment of IGRA are generally not eligible for gaming if they are outside of and not contiguous to the boundaries of a tribe's reservation. Exceptions, such as the two-part determination, allow gaming on newly acquired lands with the consent of the state governor after certain criteria are met. Exceptions to the general rule of not allowing gaming on newly acquired lands for tribes recognized after IGRA include specific circumstances where gaming is permitted without gubernatorial consent or consultation with local officials. These exceptions involve tribes without reservations in 1988, allowing gaming on newly acquired lands within former reservation boundaries or contiguous to trust lands. Additionally, tribes may have gaming on lands acquired through land claim settlements or as the initial reservation for newly recognized tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a final rule for gaming on newly acquired trust lands for tribes recognized after IGRA. The rule applies to requests under 25 U.S.C. Section 2719 and contains exceptions for opinions issued before June 19, 2008. The final rule specifies factors for determining if land qualifies for IGRA's exceptions to the gaming prohibition on newly acquired trust lands. It covers Secretarial Determinations and other exceptions like lands contiguous to reservations, land claims settlements, initial reservations for newly acknowledged tribes, and lands restored to newly restored tribes. Requests for Secretarial Determinations go to the SOI, while land-into-trust applications go to the BIA's Office of Indian Gaming. The final rule specifies procedures and requirements for Secretarial Determinations regarding gaming on newly acquired lands. Tribal applications can be submitted simultaneously with land-into-trust applications. Detailed projections on benefits, potential detrimental effects, and mitigation proposals must be included in the application. The definition of \"surrounding community\" includes local governments and tribes within a 25-mile radius. The Secretarial Determination application for gaming on newly acquired lands must include proof of ownership, gaming ordinances, distance from tribal lands, and projected benefits like income and tribal employment. The Secretarial Determination application for gaming on newly acquired lands must include proof of ownership, gaming ordinances, distance from tribal lands, and projected benefits like income and tribal employment. The rule specifies that consulting agreements, financial agreements, and other relevant information must be provided to support the application. Additionally, the potential detrimental impact on the surrounding community must be evaluated, addressing factors such as impacts on the community's character, land use patterns, economic development, and compulsive gambling. Costs and revenue sources to mitigate these effects must also be identified. The application for gaming on newly acquired lands must be approved by the state's governor within a specified timeframe. If not approved, the application will no longer be considered. Newly acquired trust lands must be within or contiguous to the reservation boundaries as of October 17, 1988. The rule defines \"contiguous\" as two parcels of land with a common boundary, including parcels touching at a point. IGRA allows gaming on after-acquired lands for land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim, with three qualifying methods outlined in the rule. The rule allows gaming on after-acquired lands for land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim, with specific requirements for tribal acknowledgment, absence of gaming facilities, and being the first proclaimed reservation after acknowledgment. On July 29, 2016, a court upheld the decision to take land into trust for gaming as an initial reservation for the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, based on the requirement of a \"significant historical connection.\" The court upheld the decision to take land into trust for gaming as an initial reservation for the Cowlitz Indian Tribe under 25 C.F.R. \u00a7292.6, based on a \"significant historical connection\" requirement. The tribe demonstrated use and occupation of land in the vicinity, satisfying the criteria for the IGRA gaming exception. The criteria for trust acquisition of lands for tribes restored to federal recognition include demonstrating modern and historical connections to the land, as well as a temporal connection to the date of restoration. Similar requirements apply to tribes acknowledged under the administrative process, with specific conditions for tribes with initial reservations proclaimed after October 17, 1988. The Department of the Interior issued guidance on taking off-reservation land into trust for gaming purposes in 2008, which was rescinded in 2011. The Obama Administration withdrew the guidance after consultations with tribal leaders and a review of land acquisition regulations. The 2008 Guidance on off-reservation land acquisition for gaming purposes was rescinded in 2011 after consultations with tribal leaders and a review of regulations. It emphasized scrutinizing benefits from acquisitions and assessing negative effects on reservation life if gaming facilities are located far from the reservation. The 2008 Guidance on off-reservation land acquisition for gaming purposes was rescinded in 2011. It focused on assessing the impact of gaming facilities located far from the reservation on reservation life and the on-reservation benefits of the proposal, including job creation. The Guidance required intergovernmental cooperative agreements and compliance with state and local zoning and land use requirements. DOI consulted with tribal leaders nationwide on the need for the Guidance. The review determined that the regulations on qualifying newly acquired land for gaming and compliance with land acquisition regulations were sufficient, leading to the withdrawal of unnecessary Guidance. No changes were recommended regarding the application process for gaming and taking land into trust. The review and consultation process, initiated by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar in 2010, required government-to-government consultations for land-into-trust acquisitions for gaming. This process covered both on and off-reservation acquisitions under different exceptions. The Secretary of the Interior ordered government-to-government consultations for land-into-trust acquisitions for gaming, noting the need for principled criteria and transparency in decision-making. Delays were expected due to the consultation process, with 24 pending applications at the time of the memorandum. The DOI conducted government-to-government consultations on whether to modify, rescind, or incorporate the Guidance Memorandum into regulations. Many tribes recommended rescinding the Guidance, citing lack of tribal consultation and inconsistency with Federal Indian policy. Some tribes criticized the Guidance for making assumptions about tribal benefits and harm. Some tribes criticized the Guidance Memorandum for unfairly prejudicing tribes with reservations far from population centers and ignoring historical facts. Assistant Secretary Larry Echo Hawk outlined requirements for tribes seeking approval for off-reservation gaming, noting the need for case-by-case consideration of various factors. The Guidance Memorandum was criticized for its inflexible approach towards off-reservation gaming, with Assistant Secretary Larry Echo Hawk highlighting the need for a case-by-case evaluation of factors. He concluded that existing regulations already provide comprehensive standards for evaluating tribal applications, making the Guidance unnecessary and potentially restrictive. The regulation under scrutiny by Assistant Secretary Echo Hawk may unnecessarily constrain the Department's decision-making process regarding trust acquisitions. Unlike the Guidance, the regulation does not require disapproval based on a single issue and considers various factors. Some bills in the 111th Congress aimed to prevent gaming in federal recognition and land trust status applications. P.L. 111-323 prohibits gaming on federal land transferred to the Hoh Tribe, while other bills in the 112th and 113th Congress contained gaming prohibitions in connection with land-into-trust acquisitions. P.L. 113-179 ratified the DOI's trust acquisition of land and required dismissal of federal court actions related to it. The Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act, S. 477, proposed new standards for tribes acquiring land for gaming purposes under IGRA, including exceptions for land claim settlements, initial reservations, or land restoration for tribes. The Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act, S. 477, sets new standards for tribes acquiring land for gaming under IGRA. Tribes must demonstrate modern and aboriginal connections to the land within a 25-mile radius of tribal headquarters or significant tribal member residences. Tribes with reservations must wait five years after restoration or recognition to be eligible for exceptions. The Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act, S. 477, requires tribes to show modern and aboriginal connections to land within a 25-mile radius of tribal headquarters or significant member residences. Tribes without reservations must meet specific criteria to be eligible for exceptions, including demonstrating a temporal connection to the land and not conducting gaming on any other land. The legislation outlines factors for determining aboriginal connection to the land. The bill addresses factors for determining tribal presence on land, including historical ties, cultural affiliation, language usage, proximity to culturally significant sites, and removal from the land. Other bills considered federal recognition of tribal status and land trust for tribes, with provisions related to gaming. The Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Recognition Act would provide federal recognition for six Virginia Indian Tribes and prohibit them from conducting gaming activities. The Elko Motocross and Tribal Conveyance Act included a provision transferring approximately 373 acres of land. The legislation includes provisions for transferring land to the Te-moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians and the Muscogee Nation of Florida, with restrictions on gaming activities. Additionally, there is an amendment to the Siletz Tribe Indian Restoration Act authorizing the Secretary to take land into trust for the Siletz Indian Tribe. The Siletz Indian Tribe is seeking federal recognition and authorization for land to be taken into trust, with restrictions on gaming activities. The Lumbee Recognition Act and H.R. 2442 also aim to provide federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and the Duwamish Tribe, respectively, with provisions prohibiting gaming activities. The Duwamish Tribe, Samish Indian Nation, Te-Moak Tribe, and several other tribes were included in bills seeking federal recognition and land to be taken into trust, with restrictions on gaming activities. H.R. 3313 and H.R. 4018 were bills in the 114th Congress that involved land transfers for tribes with gaming restrictions. P.L. 114-69 and P.L. 114-181 also contained gaming prohibitions in connection with land-into-trust acquisitions. Certain bills in the 114th Congress involved transferring land into trust for tribes with gaming restrictions. One bill prohibited gaming on certain Bureau of Land Management Land in California for the Susanville Rancheria. Another bill would transfer land for the Cow Creek Bank of Umpqua Tribe of Indians and make it ineligible for gaming. Additionally, a bill would prohibit gaming in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area until 2027. Another bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to exchange tribal land for economic development purposes. The Land Exchange act would require the Secretary of the Interior to take certain land in the City of Banning into trust for the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. The California Desert Conservation and Recreation Act of 2015 includes provisions for taking land into trust for the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Reservation Addition, with a stipulation that the land is ineligible for gaming. The Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Recognition Act provides federal recognition for six Virginia Indian Tribes, prohibiting them from conducting gaming activities. The Oregon Coastal Lands Act, Cow Creek Umpqua Land Conveyance Act, and Siletz Tribe Reservation Addition Act transfer land to tribes in Oregon, prohibiting gaming activities under IGRA. The Douglas County Conservation Act of 2015 and the Nevada Native Nations Land Act transfer federal land to tribes in Nevada, prohibiting gaming activities under IGRA. The legislation discussed involves transferring federal land to tribes for their benefit, with restrictions on gaming activities under IGRA. This includes land for the Susanville Indian Rancheria, Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians, Moapa Band of Paiutes, and the Lumbee Recognition Act. The Lumbee Recognition Act, S. 2285 and H.R. 184, seek federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and authorize the Secretary to take land in Robeson County into trust for the Tribe. The legislation allows for gaming activities on the land, but prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities based on claimed inherent authority or federal law, including IGRA. H.R. 496, the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area Establishment Act, and H.R. 1157, the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians Land Transfer Act, both involve the Secretary of the Interior (SOI) taking certain land into trust for Native American tribes, with restrictions on gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. H.R. 1632, the Samish Indian Nation Land Conveyance Act of 2015, also requires the SOI to take certain land into trust for the benefit of a tribe. The Samish Indian Nation Land Conveyance Act of 2015 and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe Land Conveyance Act involve the Secretary of the Interior taking certain land into trust for Native American tribes, with restrictions on gaming activities. The Acts specify that the tribes may not conduct gaming activities on the land taken into trust. H.R. 2538, the Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act, transfers certain lands to the Lytton Rancheria Tribe, prohibiting gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. H.R. 4688, the Douglas County Economic Development and Conservation Act of 2016, transfers federal land to the Washoe Tribe, also restricting gaming under IGRA."
