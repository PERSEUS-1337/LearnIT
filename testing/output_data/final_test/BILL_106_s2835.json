    "content": "The \"Medicare Home Health Refinement Act of 2000\" includes provisions for emergency cash-flow assistance, reimbursement of unfunded PPS-related costs, and reimbursement for OASIS labor costs for home health agencies. Sec. 301. Reimbursement for OASIS labor costs under the IPS and PPS for home health services. Sec. 401. Exclusion of nonroutine medical supplies under the PPS for home health services. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that home health care is essential for Medicare beneficiaries, allowing them to remain in their homes and communities instead of costly institutionalized care. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reformed Medicare home health care spending by implementing a prospective payment system, but some regulations are burdensome and divert funds from beneficiary care. The majority of home health agencies are small. The majority of home health agencies are small businesses or nonprofit institutions facing cash flow challenges. The prospective payment system should not penalize agencies treating Medicare beneficiaries with higher-than-average medical needs. SEC. 101. HOME HEALTH TRANSITIONAL LOAN PROGRAM. Establishment of Home Health Transitional Loan Program under which the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes loans to qualified home health agencies before termination of authority. Loans made on specified terms and conditions. The Secretary approves loan applications for qualified home health agencies within 10 days. The loan amount is based on the agency's average costs over a 3-month period. The interest rate is zero percent, and repayment is required within 12 months. The term \"qualified home health agency\" refers to a home health agency determined by the Secretary to lack sufficient cash reserves to transition from the interim payment system to the prospective payment system due to repayment of overpayments and discontinuation of periodic interim payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established payment amounts for home health agencies, with the termination of loan authority after 6 months. The effective date is tied to the implementation of the prospective payment system under the Social Security Act. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 set payment percentages for home health services under the Social Security Act. The Secretary will pay 80% upon patient admission notice and 20% upon final claim transmittal. Effective upon enactment, prompt payment from Medicare Trust Funds is required for home health services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established payment percentages for home health services under the Social Security Act. To ensure timely payment, the Secretary will pay the full amount of each claim for an episode of care from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. If any amount should have been paid from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, it will be transferred accordingly. The amendments made by this section will ensure prompt payments from trust funds for home health agencies. The Secretary will pay the full amount of each claim from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. Any amount that should have been paid from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be transferred accordingly. These amendments will take effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Adjustment to reflect administrative costs not included in the PPS for home health services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will pay home health agencies an additional $10 per Medicare beneficiary to cover technology costs related to compliance with the prospective payment system for home health services. This includes expenses for computer hardware and software necessary for patient classification, accounting, billing, and data transmission. The Secretary will pay home health agencies $10 per Medicare beneficiary for technology costs related to compliance with the payment system. Payments will be made within 30 days after the settled cost report is submitted. Funds will come from the Medicare Trust Funds. The term \"home health services\" and \"Medicare beneficiary\" are defined under the Social Security Act. Reimbursement of home health agencies for OASIS labor costs under the IPS and PPS for home health services. Adjustment to reflect administrative costs under the interim payment system for Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, increasing from $10 to $30. The text chunk discusses the payment of amounts payable to an agency under a subsection for fiscal years after 2000. The Secretary is required to make these payments no later than 30 days after the settlement of the cost report submitted by the agency. The Secretary must make payments to home health agencies under the prospective payment system within 30 days of settling their cost reports. An additional $30 per beneficiary is included in the payment to cover data collection and reporting costs related to the Outcome and Assessment Information Set. The amendments under the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) required by BBA waive budget neutrality for home health services, effective as if included in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. The SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 was enacted into law by section 1000(a)(6) of Public Law (106-113). TITLE IV--NONROUTINE MEDICAL SUPPLIES FURNISHED BY HOME HEALTH AGENCIES\n\nSEC. 401. EXCLUSION OF NONROUTINE MEDICAL SUPPLIES UNDER THE PPS FOR HOME HEALTH SERVICES. Section 1895 of the Social Security Act is amended to exclude nonroutine medical supplies furnished by home health agencies from prospective payment amounts, instead basing payment on the lesser of the actual charge or the fee schedule established by the Secretary. The amendment excludes nonroutine medical supplies provided by home health agencies from prospective payment amounts, with a budget neutrality adjustment to balance payment reductions and increases. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to Section 1895(b)(1) of the Social Security Act. These amendments take effect upon enactment of the Act."
