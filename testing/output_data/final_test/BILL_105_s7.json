    "content": "The National Missile Defense Act of 1997 aims to deploy a defense system by 2003 to protect the US against limited ballistic missile attacks and potentially larger threats in the future. The policy also emphasizes transitioning to a regime that promotes strategic stability without relying solely on offense-based deterrence. The National Missile Defense Act of 1997 requires the development of a National Missile Defense system by the end of 2003. The system includes interceptors, ground-based radars, space-based sensors, and BM/C3 for defense against ballistic missile attacks. The National Missile Defense Act of 1997 mandates the creation of a National Missile Defense system by 2003, comprising interceptors, radars, sensors, and BM/C3 for protection against ballistic missile threats. SEC. 4 focuses on the implementation of this defense system. The Secretary of Defense is required to initiate preparatory actions for the National Missile Defense system, conduct integrated systems tests by fiscal year 1999, use streamlined acquisition policies, and develop a follow-on program leveraging off the initial system. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a follow-on program that leverages the national missile defense system to provide a layered defense if necessary. SEC. 5. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 120 days outlining the plan for developing and deploying a national missile defense system. The report should include details on the system architecture, justification for the selection, and estimated appropriations needed for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 to achieve operational capability. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 120 days on the plan for a national missile defense system, including system architecture, justification, and estimated appropriations for achieving operational capability. The report should also address any potential conflicts with the ABM Treaty and provide an estimate of the time needed to meet the operational capability date specified in section 3(a). SEC. 6. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY. Congress urges the President to pursue high-level discussions with Russia to amend the ABM Treaty for the deployment of the national missile defense system. If an agreement is reached, it must be presented to the Senate for approval before any funds can be used for implementation. If an agreement to amend the ABM Treaty for the deployment of the national missile defense system is not achieved within one year, the President and Congress may consider withdrawing the United States from the treaty. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"ABM Treaty\" refers to the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems. The term \"limited ballistic missile attack\" is defined as per the National Ballistic Defense Capstone Requirements Document."
