    "content": "The Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015, also known as the Title 51 Amendment, establishes a new chapter in the United States Code for space resource exploration and utilization. The Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015, also known as the Title 51 Amendment, defines key terms related to space resources, including space resource, asteroid resource, State, and United States commercial space resource entity. The term 'United States commercial space resource utilization entity' refers to an entity providing space resource services, not controlled by a government, organized under US laws, and subject to US court jurisdiction. The President is tasked with facilitating commercial space exploration and utilization. Federal agencies must support the commercial exploration and use of space resources, while also discouraging government obstacles and promoting the rights of US commercial entities to explore and utilize outer space resources. The President is required to submit a report to Congress with recommendations within 180 days of this section's enactment. The report contains recommendations for the allocation of responsibilities among Federal agencies for space resource exploration and utilization, as well as the necessary authorities to meet international obligations. It also addresses property rights for asteroid resources obtained in outer space, safety of operations, and civil actions for relief from harmful interference. \"A United States commercial space resource utilization entity can take legal action for harmful interference in asteroid resource utilization activities in outer space. The court will rule in favor of the plaintiff if they followed international obligations, were the first to conduct the activity, and the activity is reasonable for exploration.\" \"A United States commercial space resource utilization entity can take legal action in district courts for interference in asteroid resource utilization activities in outer space. The court will rule in favor if international obligations were followed, the entity was the first to conduct the activity, and the activity is reasonable for exploration.\" Space resource exploration and utilization falls under code 51301."
