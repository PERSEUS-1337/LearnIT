    "content": "The escalating drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico and the increasing presence of Mexican drug traffickers and Central American gangs in the United States have raised concerns in Congress about the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The killing of three individuals, including two U.S. citizens, in Ciudad Juarez in 2010 further emphasized the need for continued collaboration with the Mexican government to combat trafficking organizations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to supporting counterdrug and anticrime efforts in Central America. Congress has appropriated $1.3 billion for M\u00e9rida programs in Mexico, $248 million for M\u00e9rida and a new Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), and $42 million for Caribbean countries. The original M\u00e9rida Initiative funding ended in FY2010, leading to discussions on the future of security cooperation in the region. The Obama Administration proposed a new four-pillar strategy for U.S.-Mexican security cooperation in its FY2011 budget request. Detailed strategy documents for CARSI and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) are not yet available. After Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led a delegation to Mexico in March 2010, a joint statement was released with Mexican Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinosa, emphasizing continued U.S.-Mexican security cooperation. The new bilateral strategy focuses on disrupting criminal groups, rule of law, border security, and community resilience. This builds upon previous efforts and aims to facilitate secure flows of people. The 111th Congress will oversee the use of M\u00e9rida Initiative funds and the Obama Administration's strategies for Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Mexico is a major producer and supplier of drugs to the U.S., with 90% of cocaine entering the U.S. flowing through Mexico. Mexican drug trafficking organizations control drug distribution operations along the Southwest border, with 90% of cocaine entering the U.S. flowing through Mexico. President Calder\u00f3n has focused on combating these organizations since 2006, achieving some victories but also fueling turf wars among rival groups. The government crackdown and turf wars among rival DTOs have led to a surge in violence in Mexico, especially along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2008, over 5,100 people were killed in drug-related violence, a 126% increase from the previous year. By 2009, more than 6,500 people, including soldiers and police officers, died due to drug-related violence, mainly in five states. Despite the presence of federal troops and police, violence remains high in areas like Ciudad Juarez. In 2010, drug-related violence escalated further in new \"hot spots\" like Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Sonora. Mexican DTOs are also expanding into Central America. Mexican DTOs are expanding operations into Central America, a region with high violent crime rates. Central American law enforcement officials lack training and equipment to combat organized crime, making them vulnerable to drug-related corruption. Central American countries also face issues with impunity and human rights abuses by security forces, hindering their law enforcement and judicial systems. Prior to 2007, Mexico and Central America received minimal U.S. counterdrug assistance. Mexico, Guatemala, and Panama received counterdrug assistance totaling $36.7 million, $1.9 million, and $3.3 million respectively. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, proposed in 2007, aimed to provide $1.4 billion in counterdrug and anticrime assistance to Mexico and Central America from FY2008 to FY2010. Its goals included combating criminal organizations, strengthening border controls, improving justice systems, and reducing gang activity and drug demand in the region. The M\u00e9rida Initiative aims to combat criminal organizations, strengthen border controls, improve justice systems, and reduce gang activity and drug demand in Mexico and Central America. It is seen as a regional security partnership between the United States, Mexico, and Central America, requiring shared responsibility to tackle domestic issues contributing to drug trafficking and crime. Mexico has increased security spending and mobilized soldiers and police under this initiative. The Obama Administration has increased security spending to $6.9 billion in 2010, mobilized soldiers and police to drug trafficking \"hot-spots,\" and enacted judicial and law enforcement reforms. Central American leaders have met to coordinate security and counterdrug efforts through the Central American Integration System. The 110th Congress appropriated $352 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance and $48 million in FY2009 bridge fund supplemental assistance for Mexico. In contrast to the Bush Administration, Congress divided the funding for Mexico in P.L. 110-252 between different aid accounts, earmarking $73.5 million for judicial reform, institution building, rule of law, and anti-corruption activities. Congress also imposed restrictions on the use of funds and made a portion of aid contingent on meeting human rights conditions. The State Department issued a favorable human rights progress report to Congress on August 13, 2009, meeting the requirements for releasing funds under P.L. 110-252. The first tranche of $400 million included funding for helicopters, surveillance aircraft, inspection equipment, ion scanners, canine units, secure communications, and training to support Mexican law enforcement agencies. The 111th Congress passed the Omnibus Appropriations Act in March 2009, providing $300 million for Mexico within various accounts to support judicial reform, institution building, anti-corruption, and rule of law activities. Human rights conditions affected 15% of the total funds provided, excluding assistance for these activities. The Obama Administration submitted a FY2009 supplemental request for $66 million in INCLE assistance for Mexico to acquire Blackhawk helicopters. President Obama signed a FY2009 supplemental appropriations measure that included $160 million in INCLE assistance and $260 million in FMF for Mexico, exceeding the Administration's request by $354 million. Congress made 15% of the INCLE assistance subject to human rights conditions. For FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $450 million in INCLE assistance for Mexico for various security equipment and training programs, including helicopters, surveillance systems, law enforcement training, and anti-corruption training. Congress also appropriated funds for other U.S. agencies to increase security on the Southwest border. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act included $210.3 million for Mexico in various accounts with human rights conditions. Congress provided less funding for M\u00e9rida-related programs than requested but more than in FY2009. The Secretary of State was directed to submit a report on prior M\u00e9rida funds usage and future plans within 90 days. In addition to M\u00e9rida Initiative funding, Mexico receives U.S. assistance through State and Defense Department accounts for security and counterdrug programs. For example, in FY2009, Mexico received $0.8 million for military training programs funded through the State Department's IMET Account, up from $0.4 million in FY2008. The Department of Defense provided a $13 million counterterrorism training and equipment package to the Mexican military in FY2008. DOD assistance expanded to $34.2 million in FY2009 to complement M\u00e9rida programs. Congress appropriated an additional $50 million in funding for Mexico on December 16, 2009. In December 2009, Congress allocated $50 million for counternarcotics communication equipment for Mexico in the FY2010 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Additionally, $60 million in M\u00e9rida funds for Central America were included in the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act. Congress shifted funding for Central America from public security to institution building and development programs, including $25 million for an Economic and Social Development Fund. $20 million of the funds are administered by USAID for youth violence prevention and community policing. In addition to funding for counternarcotics equipment in Mexico, Congress allocated $5 million for educational and cultural exchange programs and $1 million for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala. Human rights conditions were imposed on Central American governments to receive assistance. In April and August 2009, funding was allocated for Central American countries with human rights conditions. Nicaragua's progress was not reported, and funds were redirected to Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama. Congress provided $105 million in funding subject to human rights conditions. $70 million was allocated for INCLE programs, $15 million for maritime security, and $12 million for economic and social programs. Progress reports were submitted for Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama. The State reported progress made by Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama in meeting the 15% withholding statutory requirement for INCLE funds. $1.73M in FY 2009 funds remains withheld for Honduras pending a report to Congress. The Obama Administration requested $100 million in FY2010 for Central America to enhance citizen security, combat illegal trafficking, and strengthen justice institutions. Funding would support anti-gang efforts, community policing, juvenile justice systems, and anti-corruption measures. Congress passed $83 million for Central America in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act to combat drug trafficking. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 3288 / P.L. 111-117) allocated $83 million for Central America to combat drug trafficking, organized crime, and for judicial reform, institution building, anti-corruption, rule of law, and maritime security. The Act established the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and directed the Secretary of State to submit a report detailing the threats, goals, and expected results of the funded programs in Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Additionally, $2.5 million in INCLE funding was dedicated to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In FY2010, $2.5 million in INCLE funding was allocated for Haiti and the Dominican Republic to combat drug trafficking. M\u00e9rida funds in Haiti are used for a secure communications network for the Haitian National Police and drug interdiction efforts, while in the Dominican Republic, funds support police professionalization programs and training for judicial authorities. The Obama Administration did not request M\u00e9rida Initiative funding for 2010, proposing the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative instead. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $37 million for CBSI. The H.R. 2410 Foreign Relations Authorization Act provided $37 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), with a focus on social justice and education programs. The bill included actions to enhance the M\u00e9rida Initiative, such as appointing a high-level coordinator, adding Caribbean Community countries, and implementing an assessment program. Reporting requirements were also established for the M\u00e9rida Initiative activities. Title IX, Subtitle B of the bill under the M\u00e9rida Initiative aims to combat illicit small arms trafficking in the Western Hemisphere by establishing an inter-agency task force and increasing penalties. H.R. 3239 (Kirkpatrick) was introduced in July 2009 and requires a report on the initiative's impact on U.S. border security. The M\u00e9rida Initiative has faced delays in delivery of assistance due to various reasons, including government contracting regulations, negotiations with Mexico, and late passage of appropriations bills by Congress. The Government Accountability Office issued a report on funding status in December 2009. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a preliminary report to Congress on the status of funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative. By September 2009, $830 million of the $1.3 billion appropriated had been obligated but only $26 million had been spent. Delays were attributed to statutory conditions, administrative challenges, and the need to enhance institutional capacity. The State Department acknowledged implementation delays but stated efforts were made to work with partner governments for assistance coordination. The State Department criticized the GAO's use of \"expended funds\" as its primary performance measure for the M\u00e9rida Initiative, citing ongoing training programs and equipment orders not accounted for. As of late November 2009, approximately $359 million in funding was actively supporting projects in Mexico and Central America. Significant progress in implementation was reported in Mexico City, with $113 million worth of equipment, including helicopters and software, already delivered by March 2010. Another $151.2 million in equipment is scheduled for delivery by the end of 2010. Police professionalization programs funded by the M\u00e9rida Initiative have made significant progress, with 4,300 university-educated police officers graduating from training courses. Judicial training programs are also underway, with 87 judges and prosecutors completing U.S.-funded courses on administering oral trials. Equipment, including helicopters and firearms tracking technology, is beginning to arrive in the region. The ATF provides Spanish \"e-Trace\" firearms tracking technology. A Transnational Anti-Gang (TAG) unit will start in Guatemala and Honduras. FBI regional legal advisor to be based in El Salvador. ICE supports vetted units in Central America with funding. USAID funds crime prevention programs and impact evaluation surveys. U.S. Customs and Border Protection assesses land border ports of entry in Central America. Regional firearms initiatives are also in progress. The Administration, Congress, and the policy community agree on the need to support Mexico and Central America in addressing drug trafficking-related violence. President Obama has reaffirmed his commitment to Mexico's counterdrug efforts during visits in 2009 and invited President Calder\u00f3n to discuss bilateral security efforts in 2010. M\u00e9rida funding is used to support Central American officials in law enforcement courses, and regional firearms assessments have been initiated. The 111th Congress has focused on combating drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico and monitoring the effectiveness of assistance provided through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of bilateral cooperation in addressing the issue during her visit to Mexico in 2009. Secretary Clinton acknowledged the role of the United States in arming drug traffickers and emphasized the need to counteract drug demand and illegal firearms purchases. Congress is examining the U.S. government's responsibility in tackling domestic issues contributing to drug trafficking and crime in the region, raising questions and policy issues for consideration. The M\u00e9rida Initiative and other international drug control efforts may not have a significant impact on drug flows in the region without a more holistic U.S. drug policy focusing on reducing demand. Studies have shown that while programs like Plan Colombia improved security conditions, they did not significantly reduce the amount of drugs flowing into the United States. Calls have been made for a new policy focused on harm reduction through prevention and treatment rather than criminalization. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009, H.R. 2134 (Engel), passed by the House on December 8, 2009, would establish a commission to evaluate U.S. drug control policies and programs directed at the Western Hemisphere. Senators Menendez and Kerry introduced S. 3172, the Counternarcotics and Citizen Security for the Americas Act of 2010, which would require the State Department to submit a multi-year, Inter-American counternarcotics strategy report to Congress. S. 3172 would also encourage focusing U.S. counterdrug assistance on strengthening civilian institutions in recipient countries. The M\u00e9rida Initiative is seen as a security cooperation partnership against drug traffickers and criminal groups, with supporters urging full funding to build capacity in military and civilian institutions. Critics argue that addressing the drug trade requires more than just equipment and training for military and police forces, emphasizing the need for funding to strengthen civilian judicial and law enforcement institutions, as well as addressing societal issues like poverty and corruption. During the 110th Congress, debates arose over security vs. institution-building funding in the Bush Administration's FY2008 supplemental request for Mexico. Some Members of Congress opposed the emphasis on expensive equipment for the Mexican military due to human rights concerns. Administration officials argued that the Calder\u00f3n government requested security assistance to combat drug cartels, as Mexican forces were outgunned. Congress ensured support for \"soft-side\" programs under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Congress supported \"soft-side\" programs under the M\u00e9rida Initiative by limiting funds for equipment to the Mexican military and allocating money for institution building, rule of law, and anti-corruption activities in Mexico. Border security and counterdrug assistance for Central America were reduced to create an Economic and Social Development Fund. Critics argue that the initiative focuses too much on technology transfer and not enough on capacity-building and institutional reform. Several \"soft-side\" programs and approaches have been identified to complement existing rule of law, human rights, and anti-corruption programs under the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Suggestions include supporting constabulary forces, community policing programs, micro-credit, job training, and alternative livelihoods programs. There is also a call to allocate more assistance to state and local entities to improve transparency and accountability in government. These recommendations have influenced the Obama Administration's \"Beyond M\u00e9rida\" strategy. The Obama Administration's \"Beyond M\u00e9rida\" strategy includes a range of indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, such as trends in narcotics flows, changes in illicit materials seized, and the number of drug traffickers arrested. Congress requested performance measures for each part of the initiative in the FY2008 spending plan. The State Department was directed to submit a progress report on the initiative within 90 days as per the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The progress report on the M\u00e9rida Initiative, due within 90 days, is expected to include new performance indicators. Despite a decrease in drug seizures in Mexico in 2008, U.S. officials attribute it to traffickers finding alternate routes due to better enforcement. Mexico seized record amounts of methamphetamine and cocaine in 2009, but marijuana seizures declined. Some key results of the initiative, like increased communication and cooperation, may be challenging to quantify. The M\u00e9rida Initiative has led to increased cooperation among U.S., Mexican, and Central American law enforcement officials. There is a strong sense of co-responsibility and cooperation between high-ranking U.S. and Mexican officials, unlike in the past. A multi-level working group structure has been established to implement bilateral security efforts, with a new bilateral office at the U.S. Embassy. The initiative includes diverse program components carried out by various U.S. agencies. The M\u00e9rida Initiative involves diverse program components carried out by U.S. agencies under the leadership of the State Department. The process of tracking funding and implementation of FY2008 programs in Mexico has been challenging for NAS in Mexico City. Negotiating inter-agency agreements and deploying personnel for the seven-fold increase in U.S. law enforcement-related assistance to Mexico has been time-consuming. The M\u00e9rida Initiative involves various program components led by the State Department. Some agencies are facing delays in training programs due to differences in progress. Unlike Plan Colombia, there is no active U.S. military presence in Mexico or Central America. The Department of Defense (DOD) is not a primary player in the initiative but administers assistance through the FMF account. The Department of Defense (DOD) administers M\u00e9rida-funded equipment for Mexican and Central American security forces. DOD has its own legislative authorities for counterdrug assistance in Mexico and Central America, overseen by U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) respectively. DOD provided roughly $12.1 million in counternarcotics assistance to Mexico in FY2008 and $34.2 million in FY2009. In FY2008 and FY2009, DOD provided counternarcotics assistance totaling $12.1 million and $34.2 million to Mexico. Additionally, DOD allocated approximately $16.8 million in FY2008 and $17.7 million in FY2009 for counternarcotics assistance to Central American countries. Congress authorized DOD to train and equip foreign military forces for counterterrorism operations through \"Section 1206\" authority, resulting in $13.9 million in counterterrorism training and equipment for the Mexican military in FY2007 and FY2008. Other countries like the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, and Belize have also received maritime security support funded by Section 1206. Mike Mullen and Secretary Clinton traveled to Mexico to offer increased military assistance. DOD officials in Mexico City predict funding for training in anti-drug operations and investigations. DOD counterdrug support must be requested by the U.S. Embassy. Programs supporting Mexico and Central America complement the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The U.S. government pledged to intensify efforts to address drug trafficking. Many security experts argue that addressing all aspects of drug trafficking, including weapons and bulk currency trafficking to Mexico, is crucial for regional counterdrug efforts. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, funded as foreign assistance, lacks companion legislation on the domestic side, making it difficult for Congress to monitor U.S. government's fulfillment of domestic pledges. Mexican drug traffickers rely on firearms purchased in the United States through \"straw purchases.\" The ATF's Project Gunrunner aims to disrupt illegal flows of weapons from the US into Mexico by targeting straw purchasers who buy guns legally and sell them to smugglers. The initiative has led to numerous prosecutions and the deployment of eTrace technology to combat arms trafficking. In FY2008, Mexico submitted over 7,500 guns for tracing, with most originating from Texas, Arizona, and California. Roughly 93% of these firearms were made in or imported to the United States. ATF deployed bilingual \"e-Trace\" technology to Mexico and Central America in 2009. ICE and CBP are also involved in stopping weapons flow to Mexico, enforcing export provisions of the Arms Exports Control Act. ICE launched Operation Armas Cruzadas in collaboration with Mexican authorities in 2008 to combat weapons smuggling through intelligence sharing and joint law enforcement efforts. The M\u00e9rida Initiative involves intelligence sharing and joint law enforcement efforts with vetted Mexican units, resulting in numerous criminal arrests and weapon seizures. Mexico implemented a pilot program in 2009 to screen incoming traffic for guns and cash, expanding it across the entire border. The Mexican government replaced customs inspectors with better-trained ones using non-intrusive inspection equipment to check vehicles for arms and cash smuggled from the United States. Some advocates are calling for the U.S. Senate to act on a pending treaty to curb weapons trafficking to Mexico. The Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials (CIFTA) was signed by the United States in 1997 and entered into force in July 1998. President Obama urged congressional action on CIFTA in 2009 due to the impact of U.S. drug demand on fueling illicit industries. Addressing drug demand through treatment and prevention programs has been suggested as more successful and cost-effective than supply reduction programs. The U.S. drug control budget has historically focused on supply-side programs, with funding increasing for these efforts compared to demand reduction programs. President Obama and other officials have pledged to enhance domestic demand reduction initiatives to complement counterdrug programs in Latin America. The Obama Administration's drug control strategy is expected to prioritize evidence-based approaches to reduce drug demand through prevention. Kerlikowske emphasized the need to address the nation's significant demand for drugs through evidence-based approaches in prevention and treatment. However, critics have raised concerns about the modest increase in funding for treatment programs compared to previous years. Additionally, efforts to disrupt the flow of drug money from the U.S. to Mexico are seen as a key strategy in reducing drug-related issues. The Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) generate an estimated $15 billion to $25 billion annually, which is used to buy weapons, corrupt officials, and continue their operations. The U.S. Treasury's efforts to prevent money laundering have led the DTOs to rely on bulk cash shipments. To combat this, the DEA, FBI, ICE, and CBP have conducted bulk cash seizures, including through \"Operation Firewall\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, resulting in 679 arrests since 2005. Operation Firewall, initiated in 2005, has led to 679 arrests and the seizure of over $302 million in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The M\u00e9rida Initiative has expanded bilateral efforts against bulk cash smuggling and money laundering, with training provided to over 350 Mexican officials. A bi-national study on illicit criminal proceeds is forthcoming, informing future anti-drug cartel efforts. The U.S. Congress is likely to monitor Mexico's progress in combating drug cartels and reforming its law enforcement and judicial systems. President Calder\u00f3n has prioritized combating drug trafficking and organized crime in Mexico, increasing the security budget significantly. He has deployed soldiers and federal police to arrest traffickers, establish checkpoints, and interdict drug shipments. Extradition has been used as a major tool, with a record number of individuals extradited in recent years. Congress should monitor Mexico's anti-corruption efforts and accountability for human rights abuses in law enforcement and military forces. President Calder\u00f3n's aggressive anti-drug strategy has led to government victories against drug trafficking organizations, including the killing of Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva and capture of Teodoro Garcia Simental. However, the increasing violence by traffickers has raised criticism. To maintain popular support, the government must dismantle DTOs and reduce drug-related violence. Calder\u00f3n is revising the military-led strategy for Ciudad Juarez after a massacre of 15 civilians. The Calder\u00f3n government has developed a new strategy called \"We Are All Juarez\" in response to the massacre of 15 civilians in Ciudad Juarez. This strategy includes federal investments in education, job training, and community development programs to address underlying factors contributing to violence. U.S. officials have pledged to support Mexican government efforts with funding. Mexican military forces began withdrawing from Ciudad Juarez in April 2010, leaving security responsibilities to federal police. Corruption among law enforcement and government officials has hindered the campaign against drug cartels. The Attorney General's office for Special Investigations of Organized Crime (SIEDO) was involved in a scandal related to payoffs for sensitive information about antidrug activities, leading to the firing or arrest of at least 35 officials. The former head of SIEDO was arrested in November 2008 for accepting bribes from a drug cartel. The Federal Agency of Investigations (AFI) was criticized for corruption and disbanded in June 2009. President Calder\u00f3n has taken steps to reform Mexico's police forces by reorganizing federal agencies, enhancing training, creating a national database, and implementing a national police registry. President Calder\u00f3n proposed the creation of a unified federal police force under the SSP, but two laws in 2009 established separate federal police forces under the SSP and PGR. 4,300 university-educated SSP officers graduated from a basic investigative training course. The government aims to absorb municipal police forces into state-level agencies to coordinate with the SSP, with federal subsidies for units meeting standards. Legislative approval is needed for this change. The Calder\u00f3n government has implemented federal police reform efforts, cracking down on corruption within police and government institutions. Critics argue that many arrested for colluding with organized crime have been released due to lack of evidence. Security experts praise the efforts but express concern about slow judicial reform. Analysts suggest additional reforms be considered. The Calder\u00f3n government has implemented federal police reform efforts, cracking down on corruption within police and government institutions. Critics argue that many arrested for colluding with organized crime have been released due to lack of evidence. Security experts praise the efforts but express concern about slow judicial reform. Analysts suggest additional reforms be considered, such as strengthening police professionalization programs, establishing career tracks within police forces, and improving the judicial system. President Calder\u00f3n signed a judicial reform decree in June 2008 to address issues like long case backlogs, high pre-trial detention rates, and corruption within the system. Mexico is undergoing judicial reform to transition to a public trial system with oral arguments and the presumption of innocence. Challenges include updating law school curricula, retraining legal professionals, building new courtrooms, improving forensic technology, and promoting alternative dispute resolution. Observers look to states like Chihuahua and Oaxaca for guidance in adopting an accusatorial justice system. The transition to an accusatorial justice system in Mexico, with support from USAID, faces challenges due to capacity constraints and entrenched interests in the judicial system. Concerns have been raised about the Calder\u00f3n government prioritizing modernizing the police over strengthening the justice system, leading to poor human rights records for both the police and military. Reports of police involvement in extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, and torture, as well as the military's lack of human rights training and accountability to civilian authorities, have raised concerns. The Mexican military, with less human rights training and accountability than the police, is increasingly involved in public security functions and committing human rights abuses. Complaints of abuses have risen, with criticism towards the government for failing to hold officials accountable. Human rights groups have expressed concerns about past and current abuses by the military. Mexican military courts have not convicted any soldiers for serious human rights violations. Human rights organizations praised the inclusion of human rights conditions in M\u00e9rida Initiative appropriations legislation. US and Mexican human rights groups criticized the Mexican military for not investigating or punishing human rights abuses. The State Department submitted a human rights progress report for Mexico to Congress in August 2009. The report acknowledges steps taken by the Mexican government to improve police transparency, consult with human rights organizations, investigate human rights abuses by security forces, and prohibit torture. Human rights complaints against the Mexican military have increased significantly. Human rights groups have criticized the opaqueness of the military court system. The State Department's assessment of Mexico's human rights progress has been criticized by human rights groups. A new strategy called \"Beyond M\u00e9rida\" was agreed upon by the Obama and Calder\u00f3n governments to broaden bilateral security efforts and focus on institution-building. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $310 million for Merida-related programs in Mexico. The new strategy \"Beyond M\u00e9rida\" was announced at the M\u00e9rida High-Level Consultative Group meeting in Mexico City on March 23, 2010. It focuses on disrupting organized crime, institutionalizing Mexico's rule of law, creating a modern border structure, and building strong communities. The Calder\u00f3n government has primarily targeted dismantling drug trafficking organizations, conducting joint police-military operations, investigating collusion among public officials, and seizing illicit assets. U.S. assistance, including $421 million in FMF funding, has been used for equipment purchases in support of these efforts. The Obama Administration has requested $8 million in FMF for FY2011 to support Mexican government efforts in disrupting illicit weapons and funding to drug trafficking organizations. Increased intelligence-sharing, cross-border law enforcement operations, and focus on combating other types of organized crime like human trafficking and alien smuggling have been suggested for cooperation under pillar one of the new strategy \"Beyond M\u00e9rida.\" Many security experts emphasize the need for the Mexican government, with U.S. support, to address weak law enforcement and judicial institutions. Federal police reform is ongoing, but questions remain about when they will take over anti-drug functions from the military. Efforts to extend U.S.-funded police training and corrections reform to Chihuahua and Juarez are likely to be reprogrammed from FY2009 M\u00e9rida funding. A binational project is designed to support Juarez through training, equipment, and professional exchanges. The Mexican government's plan for Juarez includes training, equipment, professional exchanges, and targeted information-sharing. Security experts emphasize the importance of improving police-community relations, respecting human rights, and addressing street crime in Juarez and Mexico. It is crucial for Mexico to implement judicial reforms and fight corruption to transition to an accusatorial system with oral trials by 2016. U.S.-funded judicial training programs may need to be expanded for this transition. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request includes $207 million for M\u00e9rida-related programs in Mexico under the \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" aid category. The \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" aid category in Mexico includes programs focused on creating a 21st-century border to facilitate secure commerce and people flow while curbing illicit activities. This involves establishing a model port, expanding trusted travel programs, and deploying new technology to patrol the southern border. Additionally, there will be a new focus on assisting at-risk youth and addressing social problems in communities affected by drug trafficking and violence. Experts have praised the inclusion of social development and crime prevention programs in the new M\u00e9rida framework, but are concerned about limited funding from the United States. The Mexican government will primarily be responsible for funding and implementing pillar four, with possible support from institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank. Efforts under pillar four are focused on pilot projects in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua, with potential expansion to Tijuana and Baja California. These initiatives involve continuing and expanding existing M\u00e9rida-funded programs, such as school-based \"culture of lawfulness\" programs and demand reduction services. USAID may provide technical expertise in re-zoning efforts. The Mexican government may request additional U.S. support for President Calder\u00f3n's \"We Are All Juarez\" plan, which includes 160 initiatives. The Central American portion of the M\u00e9rida Initiative has been split into the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) due to policy issues. Addressing drugs and crime in Central America requires a longer-term commitment than the three-year M\u00e9rida program. Some analysts believe that splitting Central America from U.S.-Mexican security programs could lead to more focus and funding for the region. However, others argue for an integrated approach to counterdrug and anti-crime efforts. The Obama Administration requested $100 million for CARSI in its FY2011 budget. Funding disparities between Mexico and Central America have been a key issue in congressional discussions on the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Members of Congress are concerned about the funding disparity between Mexico and Central America in the initiative. Questions remain about the adequacy of funds and how they should be allocated between regional and bilateral programs in Central American countries. Funding for law enforcement programs in Central America was reduced in the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act to prioritize institution-building, rule of law, and development programs. Earmarks for these programs were included in the FY2008 supplemental and FY2009 omnibus appropriations measures but not in the FY2010 appropriations bill. Debate continues on how funding should be balanced between different program components in CARSI, especially regarding support for law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts. The December 2009 GAO report raised concerns about the slow pace of implementation of M\u00e9rida funding. Projects in Central America are stalled, and assistance for Honduras was delayed due to political instability. Debates continue on which U.S. agency is best equipped to carry out M\u00e9rida and CARSI programs. There is ongoing disagreement over the level and combination of preventive and suppressive policies that should be used in Central America to address the gang problem. Proponents of law enforcement solutions argue that Central American officials lack the capacity to target gang leaders effectively, while human rights groups emphasize prevention and rehabilitation programs. Congress may also be interested in improving U.S. deportation procedures for individuals with criminal records and providing assistance to help receiving governments reintegrate deportees. The Obama Administration requested $45 million for security projects in the Caribbean region through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) to address transnational crime and illicit trafficking. The CBSI involves increased U.S. assistance and dialogue with Caribbean nations to establish complementary programs. Initial meetings were held in Suriname, Barbados, and the Dominican Republic in 2009. In 2009, U.S.-Caribbean meetings were held in Suriname, Barbados, and the Dominican Republic. A ministerial meeting is expected in Washington in 2010 to adopt a political declaration, action plan, and framework for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. The initiative will focus on reducing illicit trafficking, advancing public safety and security, and promoting social justice. Congress allocated at least $37 million in FY2010 for the CBSI. The CBSI received $37 million in FY2010, with $21 million designated for social justice and education programs. The Administration's FY2011 request is for $79 million, allocated across various programs. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act for the M\u00e9rida Initiative had softer human rights conditions due to Mexico's objections. The Secretary of State is required to report on implementing Section 620J of the Foreign Assistance Act. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits aid to foreign security forces with human rights violations unless the country takes action. P.L. 110-252 requires withholding 15% of assistance to Mexico until human rights conditions are met. The M\u00e9rida Initiative requires consultations with Mexican organizations, investigation of human rights violations by federal police and military, and enforcement of the prohibition on torture. Similar conditions apply to assistance for Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The M\u00e9rida Initiative requires reports on implementing human rights conditions for funding release, including establishing police complaints commissions, judiciary reforms, and investigating human rights violations by federal police and military in Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic."
