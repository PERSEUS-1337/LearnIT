    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Delta smelt, a small fish native to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, is a vulnerable species with low fecundity and a limited diet. Listed as threatened in 1993, it faces habitat loss, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants as threats to its survival. A comprehensive strategy is needed for the sustainable survival of the Delta smelt and other species in their native habitat, while ensuring reliable water supplies for Californians. Immediate action is required to address the critical condition of the Delta smelt population, with a Delta smelt hatchery being a key element in improving habitat conditions and species recovery. Chapter 7.1 (Section 1710) of the Fish and Game Code establishes the Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016. It defines terms like \"banking partner\" and \"Delta smelt\" for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 defines terms like \"Delta smelt,\" \"mitigation bank,\" \"mitigation banking agreement,\" and \"program\" related to the Delta Smelt Hatchery Program. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program aims to preserve and restore the Delta smelt by establishing a genetic refugia population, developing broodstock for scientific and educational purposes, and providing fish for wild population supplementation. The program includes designing and constructing at least one Delta smelt hatchery by January 1, 2019, at a suitable site within or adjacent to the delta. The department shall develop a hatchery management plan in consultation with the University of California and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. They will establish a mitigation bank for banking partners to provide take authorization and adopt guidelines for participation. Mitigation banking agreements will be entered into with partners to provide take authorization under Section 2081. The department will establish a mitigation bank for banking partners to participate in proportion to their impact on Delta smelt. Financial contributions will be required to ensure funding for the Delta smelt hatchery operations. Mitigation banking agreements meeting all requirements will result in a permit for incidental take authorization under Section 2081. Delta smelt reared for refugia populations, scientific research, and population augmentation will count towards mitigation credits. Excess hatchery production will create credits for future activities. Funding for the Delta smelt hatchery will come from banking partners' revenues. These funds will be dedicated to program implementation. Funds for Delta smelt hatchery planning, design, and construction will be allocated from Section 1718. An audit of received funds will occur every three years. The department can partner with public agencies for hatchery projects and collaborate with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The department will cooperate on developing long-term Delta ecosystem solutions consistent with this chapter. A program under Section 1712 will be part of any state Delta ecosystem program. Protections for Delta smelt under state law will not be reduced, illegal taking is prohibited, and compliance with the California Endangered Species Act remains necessary."
