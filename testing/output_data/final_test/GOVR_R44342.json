    "content": "Fundamental tax reform is a key policy priority with broad bipartisan support. The current U.S. income tax code is seen as complex, unfair, and in need of change. Debates often focus on altering marginal tax rates or shifting towards taxing consumption instead of income. Tax liability is determined by total income with income tax, but with a consumption tax, it is based on total expenditures on goods and services. Savings are not taxed under a consumption tax. Different forms of consumption taxes exist, such as value added tax (VAT) and national sales tax (NST). The United States is the only OECD country without a broad-based national consumption tax, but many states have their own sales taxes. OECD encourages countries to shift towards consumption taxes from income taxes. The OECD encourages countries to shift towards consumption taxes like VAT. Proposals in Congress aim to replace income tax with national sales tax or consumed-income tax. The report will discuss various consumption tax structures and their effects on economic efficiency and tax burden distribution. The United States implements taxes on income, wages, and consumption. Income is taxed through a federal income tax with differential rates on labor and capital. Wages are taxed through the payroll tax, funding programs like Social Security. Consumption taxes include money spent on goods and services, with examples like the gasoline excise tax. Broad consumption taxes, such as state sales taxes and value added taxes in Europe, have a wider tax base compared to narrow consumption taxes like the gasoline excise tax in the United States. State sales taxes vary in their application, with some exemptions for necessities like certain medicines in Virginia. A comprehensive consumption tax could be applied to all money spent on goods and services for final consumption, allowing for more revenue generation. A consumption tax with a broad base allows for more revenue collection with lower tax rates. It distinguishes itself from an income tax when taxpayers save a portion of their income, as only the amount spent on goods and services is taxed. Proponents argue that tax-free savings incentives will encourage individuals to save more, leading to higher levels of savings. Switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system can potentially increase savings and boost the economy. Different types of consumption taxes include value added tax (VAT), national sales tax (NST), and consumed-income tax. These taxes vary in how they are implemented and collected. The value added of a firm is calculated as the difference between its sales and purchases from other firms. A firm's value added is the amount it contributes to a good or service by using factors of production. A value-added tax is levied on a firm's net value added at each production stage. The credit-invoice method is commonly used to calculate and track VAT, where the firm collects VAT on sales and subtracts input VAT to determine tax liability. Different accounting methods exist, including subtraction and addition. VATs can vary in their treatment of capital purchases. A consumption-type VAT treats capital purchases like any other input, excluding them from the tax base. Other types include income VAT and gross product VATs. Most countries use a consumption-type VAT. A national sales tax (NST) is a federal consumption tax collected at the retail level by vendors. A national sales tax (NST) is collected at the retail level by vendors, with the tax revenue remitted to the federal government. Both a value-added tax and a national sales tax with the same rate and base would generate the same revenue. Legislative proposals in Congress aim to replace the federal income tax with a 23% tax-inclusive sales tax rate in 2017. Under a consumed-income tax, taxpayers would keep their savings in an account similar to an IRA. Net contributions to this account would be deducted from income to determine consumed income, on which a tax would be applied. H.R. 1040 in the 114th Congress allows taxpayers to elect a flat tax rate, starting at 19% for the first two years. Consumption taxes, such as VATs, are common globally, with over 120 countries using them as a major revenue source. In OECD countries, general consumption taxes, mainly from VATs, made up 20% of total tax revenue in 2012. Personal income taxes accounted for 25% of total tax revenues in OECD countries that year. The United States is the only OECD country without a broad-based national consumption tax. Taxes enable governments to provide services but can also impact economic decision-making in competitive markets. In a perfectly competitive market, taxes distort decisions by interfering with prices, impeding economic efficiency. The goal is to design a tax structure that minimizes distortions, allowing the market to operate efficiently. A \"perfectly competitive market\" is a theoretical concept in economics with strict assumptions for economic efficiency. Market failures can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, resulting in too little or too much production of goods. Taxes or subsidies can correct market failures, such as the case with education where positive externalities are not considered by individuals. This intervention is necessary to achieve socially optimal levels of resource allocation. Replacing federal income tax with a consumption tax is proposed to reduce distortions in the economy. Taxes can impact work decisions by altering price signals, affecting the real value of work and its relative value. The potential impact and merits of consumption taxes compared to income taxes on work choices, savings, and the economy will be discussed. The income effect and substitution effect impact individuals under income or consumption tax. An income tax reduces take-home salary, while a consumption tax reduces purchasing power through higher prices or lower wages. For example, a 20% income tax reduces effective wage from $10 to $8 per hour, requiring more hours to cover expenses. Similarly, a 20% consumption tax increases prices, affecting consumers. Under a 20% consumption tax, the effective cost of monthly expenditures increases to $1,800, requiring 180 hours of work to cover expenses. The income effect leads individuals to work more to compensate for lost purchasing power. Switching to a consumption tax may have a similar income effect as an income tax. Taxes not only decrease purchasing power but also devalue work compared to leisure, impacting daily time allocation decisions. The implementation of a tax on income or consumption reduces the value of working hours compared to leisure and other activities. Taxes decrease the real value of work, leading individuals to spend less time working due to the increased relative value of leisure. The substitution effect, influenced by the tax rate, impacts individual work decisions. The tax rate affects work decisions, with a higher rate increasing the disincentive to work. A consumption tax typically has a higher rate than an income tax for revenue neutrality. Transitioning to a consumption tax may limit the need for higher rates due to implicit taxes on savings and assets. The transition to a consumption tax may impose an implicit tax on savings and assets owned before the change. This tax, known as a tax on old capital, reduces the real value of assets and savings as they are subject to the consumption tax when used for purchases. This decrease in value is a distortion in individual behavior and economic efficiency. The tax on old capital under a consumption tax is an exception to the rule as individuals cannot alter their past decisions to reduce their tax burden. This lump-sum tax is not expected to distort individual behavior. A revenue-neutral consumption tax may require a higher tax rate than an income tax due to a smaller tax base, leading to a larger substitution effect that discourages individuals from working as much. A consumption tax can generate a larger substitution effect compared to an income tax, but a lower tax rate can still be revenue neutral due to a lump sum tax on old capital. This tax can raise revenue without distorting the economy. The net impact on work decisions is ambiguous in theory, with researchers producing varying estimates on how income and substitution effects play out in reality. In empirical work, economists estimate labor supply elasticity to measure how workers respond to changes in after-tax wages. Elasticities typically range between 0 and 1.3, with many studies finding values between 0 and 0.3. Critics argue that methodological flaws may underestimate the true response, suggesting a larger decrease in hours worked for the same decrease in after-tax income. Overall, increased taxes tend to lead to decreased work effort, highlighting the significant impact of the substitution effect. Increasing taxes can lead to a decrease in work effort, with the substitution effect being more significant than the income effect. A revenue-neutral consumption tax may not significantly impact work effort compared to an income tax, mainly due to the additional lump sum tax on old capital. While a consumption tax may slightly decrease labor participation more than an income tax, the difference is expected to be minimal. The treatment of individual savings differs between income and consumption taxes, with capital income being a key factor in how individuals earn income. An income tax affects work choices and savings behavior by reducing after-tax returns, while a consumption tax does not introduce a disincentive to saving. Economic theory does not definitively predict how individuals will respond to increased returns on investments. The impact of rising returns to saving results in two opposing effects on saving behavior. The income effect leads to individuals saving less as the rate of return increases, while the substitution effect leads to individuals saving more. This allows individuals to reach their savings goals with less effort. The substitution effect occurs when the return to saving increases, leading individuals to substitute current consumption for future consumption. This can result in individuals saving more or less, depending on the magnitude of these opposing responses compared to saving under an income tax. Researchers have found that as the return to saving increases, consumers tend to save more, but the magnitude of this increase varies. Switching to a consumption tax from an income tax could lead to an increase in gross domestic product in the long run due to factors like increased personal savings and a lump sum tax on capital. The literature shows varying estimates on the saving response to a real return increase, with some finding no response at all. Transitioning to a consumption tax from an income tax is expected to increase economic welfare by encouraging private saving and lowering the effective tax rate on capital. This shift is anticipated to boost the amount of capital available for firms to invest in improved facilities, machines, and workers. Transitioning to a consumption tax from an income tax is expected to increase economic welfare by encouraging private saving and lowering the effective tax rate on capital. This shift is anticipated to boost the amount of capital available for firms to invest in improved facilities, machines, and workers. Older individuals with retirement savings would own a significant amount of old capital and bear a larger burden from the lump-sum tax when transitioning to a consumption tax. Researchers have produced varying estimates of the potential impact on the economy of transitioning to a consumption tax. Switching to a consumption tax from an income tax could increase economic output by 5% to 10% in the long run. However, this transition may impose a burden on the elderly with retirement savings due to the lump-sum tax on old capital. Policymakers may need to find ways to ease this tax burden, although it could reduce the expected economic gains. Compensating the owners of old capital could decrease the efficiency gains of the switch by 60%. Switching to a consumption tax from an income tax could increase economic output by 5% to 10% in the long run. However, compensating owners of old capital could decrease efficiency gains by 60% to 90%. Economic research often focuses on the benefits of a full transition to a consumption tax, but in reality, governments often implement additional taxes on alternative tax bases for revenue. Two potential alternative consumption tax schemes include a partial replacement of income tax with a consumption tax and an additional consumption tax on top of the current income tax. The CBO estimated the economic effects of replacing a quarter of the income tax in the United States with a consumption tax in the form of a VAT. The saving rate would increase by 0.5 percentage points, consumption by 1.2%, and overall output by 1.5% in the long run. The expected increase in overall output from partial replacement is 8.5 to 3.5 percentage points lower than full replacement of the income tax with a consumption tax. The limited empirical work suggests that increasing the VAT rate in economies with an income tax tends to decrease consumption and increase saving. A one percentage point increase in the VAT rate could reduce consumption between 0.4% and 1% in the near term, with a larger decrease in the long term. This decrease in consumption would likely be accompanied by an increase in savings, contributing to greater economic output in the long term. Transitioning from an income tax to a consumption tax can have distributional implications. Altering specific parts of the tax structure can change these implications, such as exempting certain income or staple goods. This discussion focuses on a revenue-neutral switch between these tax types. Transitioning from an income tax to a consumption tax can have distributional implications. This section considers a pure income and a pure consumption tax structure with a flat 20% tax rate and similarly sized tax bases. Consumption taxes are criticized for being regressive, as higher-income individuals tend to save more of their income, resulting in a larger portion of lower-income individuals' income being subject to the tax. Individuals in different income quintiles have varying savings rates, with those in the second quintile having a 22% savings rate in 2013, while those in the fourth quintile had a 10% savings rate. A 20% consumption tax would result in an average tax rate of about 25% for the second quintile and 16% for the fourth quintile. When considering lifetime income, the burden of a consumption tax is more evenly distributed as lifetime consumption tends to mirror lifetime income. This means higher-income individuals would pay more in taxes due to higher consumption levels over their lifetime. A consumption tax results in a proportional tax burden across income levels, with individuals paying more as their income increases. Tax burdens remain proportional regardless of annual or lifetime income under an income tax system. Differences in tax burdens across generations are influenced by varying consumption and saving behaviors. Individuals' tax burden varies with age under a consumption tax, with middle-aged individuals having the smallest burden due to higher savings rates. Savings rates influence average tax rates, with younger individuals facing higher rates and older individuals facing lower rates. Under a consumption tax, individuals' tax burden varies with age, with middle-aged individuals having the lowest average tax rates due to higher savings rates. Proponents argue for the simplicity of a consumption tax, but complexity in the tax code is more a result of the political process than the tax base used. The complexity of the tax code is influenced by additions and revisions to the tax code. Consumption-based taxes like VATs have lower administrative costs compared to income taxes. European countries with VATs have lower administrative costs than the United States. Implementing a VAT or NST in the United States would likely increase administrative costs. The implementation of a VAT or NST could impact wages or consumer prices, as the relative price of goods and services would increase. This increase could be achieved through price hikes or wage reductions, depending on wage- and price-setting institutions and monetary policy. Analysts believe that a one-time price increase could be accommodated, as workers are hesitant to accept lower wages. If inflation expectations remain stable, a one-time price adjustment may not affect inflation, and monetary policy may not need to change. Implementing a broad consumption tax in the US could be complicated due to interactions between state and federal tax codes. States with existing consumption taxes may resist federal encroachment on their tax base. Inconsistent tax bases across states could create challenges for businesses in tracking taxable items under both federal and state tax codes. Businesses face complexity in managing a tax structure with both federal and state taxes applied to certain items at the point of sale. This complexity reduces administrative efficiency gains that could be achieved under a consumption tax. Both income- and consumption-based taxes are countercyclical to the business cycle, with debates on their stabilizing effects on the economy. Countercyclical tax policy can increase tax burdens and reduce demand, sparking debate on its impact on business cycle stability."
