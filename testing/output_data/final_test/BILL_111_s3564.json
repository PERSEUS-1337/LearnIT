    "content": "FULFILLING THE POTENTIAL OF WOMEN IN ACADEMIC STEM. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a Federal STEM agency and the development of workshops to enhance gender equity in academic STEM. The term \"Federal STEM agency\" refers to any Federal agency responsible for at least 2 percent of total Federal research and development funding in STEM to higher education institutions. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, is required to develop a uniform policy for all Federal STEM agencies to conduct workshops educating program officers, grant review panel members, and STEM department chairs on gender equity in STEM. The curr_chunk discusses guidelines for minimizing gender bias in evaluation of Federal research grants and academic advancement in STEM departments. The Secretary of Commerce will coordinate workshops across Federal STEM agencies to support these efforts. The Secretary of Commerce will coordinate workshops every 2 years among Federal STEM agencies to support minimizing gender bias in evaluation of research grants and academic advancement in STEM departments. Eligible organizations for grants include nonprofit scientific societies, organizations advancing women in STEM, and workshops must meet specific characteristics. The workshops must invite chairs of departments from the top 50 institutions in STEM, members of research grant review panels, and Federal STEM agency program officers. Activities at the workshops for Federal STEM agency program officers include research presentations and discussions on gender bias in grant-making and academic achievement recognition. Research presentations and workshop programs should address the challenges faced by women in historically underrepresented groups and provide recommendations to increase their representation. A report evaluating the effectiveness of these programs in reducing gender bias must be submitted to relevant committees within three years of the Act's enactment. The subsection aims to reduce gender bias in STEM research funded by the Federal Government through workshops, improving evaluation processes, tracking participation rates, and noting policy changes. Workshops should be held with disciplinary meetings to minimize travel costs. Additionally, policies for caregivers should be established within six months. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will develop a uniform policy to extend grant support for federally funded researchers with caregiving responsibilities. Once the policy is developed, it will be transmitted to the relevant committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each Federal STEM agency will be required to collect and report data on federal research grants. Each Federal STEM agency must collect standardized demographic information on applications and proposals for STEM research grants, including rank, gender, race, age, field, award type, budget request, review score, and funding outcome. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish a policy for uniform data collection and reporting. Each Federal STEM agency is required to collect demographic data on STEM research grant applications and proposals. The National Science Foundation will store and publish this data and share it with the Secretary of Commerce. The Director of the National Science Foundation will report statistical summary data on the demographics of STEM faculty at higher education institutions in the U.S., including gender, race, age, and rank. The Director of the National Science Foundation will report statistical summary data on STEM faculty demographics at higher education institutions, including faculty in nontenure-track positions, promotion rates, faculty years in rank, attrition, faculty hiring, and faculty in leadership positions. Recommendations for input will also be solicited. The Director of the National Science Foundation will gather demographic data on STEM faculty, seeking input from stakeholders on data collection methods and definitions. A report to Congress will detail the data to be reported, data sources, and justification for any exclusions. The Director of the National Science Foundation will compile demographic data on STEM faculty, with input from stakeholders on data collection methods and definitions. The report to Congress will include a list of definitions for terms like \"faculty\" and \"leadership positions\" for data reporting."
