    "content": "The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters by regulating pollution from both point and nonpoint sources. Despite progress, water quality issues persist, including runoff from farms, cities, and industrial discharges. The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to eliminate pollution and achieve zero discharge of pollutants. Federal financial assistance is provided for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. The Environmental Protection Agency administers federal programs, while state and local governments implement CWA programs. The act set goals to eliminate pollutant discharge by 1985 and make waters \"fishable and swimmable\" by 1983, although full achievement has not been reached. Progress has been made in controlling conventional pollutants discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants, but efforts to control toxic pollutants are mixed. Nonpoint source pollution is a more recent focus. Data shows that a significant percentage of river and stream miles and lake acres do not meet water quality standards. EPA and states report these impairments. Approximately 67% of U.S. stream miles are in poor or fair condition, with nutrients and streambed sediments having the largest impact. 95,000 lakes and 544,000 river miles in the U.S. have fish-consumption advisories due to chemical contaminants. Mercury contamination is a growing concern, with 45 states issuing consumption advisories. The Water Quality Act of 1987 was the last major amendment to address water quality issues. The Water Quality Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-4) was a significant amendment to address water quality issues, with authorizations for various programs expiring in the following years. Despite this, Congress has continued to appropriate funds for implementation, and the act is still being enforced by EPA, states, industry, and citizens. The Clean Water Act has been successful in achieving its goals, but there are questions about the need for further actions to bring additional benefits. Criticism has arisen from industry, developers, property rights groups, states, and cities regarding the Clean Water Act's regulatory programs and potential new requirements. Environmental groups advocate for further adjustments to maintain progress and address water quality issues. Legislative activity on the CWA has been limited since 1987. Since 1987, there has been limited legislative activity on the Clean Water Act. In the 104th Congress, a reauthorization bill was passed by the House but not enacted. Subsequent Congresses have seen bills addressing specific water quality issues and reauthorizing existing programs. Water infrastructure financing has been a key issue since the 107th Congress, with bills passed by House and Senate committees but not enacted. The 111th Congress continues to focus on CWA issues. The 111th Congress focused on Clean Water Act (CWA) issues, including water infrastructure funding, regulatory protection of wetlands, and water quality appropriations. Despite progress since the Act's passage, significant water pollution problems persist, with debates on necessary solutions and the need for new legislation. Key water quality issues include evaluating existing provisions and determining if additional steps are required. The 111th Congress focused on Clean Water Act (CWA) issues, including water infrastructure funding, regulatory protection of wetlands, and water quality appropriations. Efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests debate whether and how to change the law, making difficult tradeoffs between impacts on different sectors of the economy. Congress has favored focusing on narrow bills to extend or modify selected CWA programs. The 111th Congress focused on Clean Water Act (CWA) issues, with legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected CWA programs. Factors such as reluctance to address controversial environmental issues and a lack of presidential initiatives have also played a role in the legislative process. The 111th Congress focused on Clean Water Act issues, with a particular legislative focus on water infrastructure financing legislation and the geographic reach of the Clean Water Act over the nation's waters and wetlands. Anticipation of greater attention to environmental issues, including clean water, was heightened by the 2008 election and the Obama Administration's support for wetlands preservation, Great Lakes restoration, water conservation, and regulation. The 111th Congress focused on Clean Water Act issues, including wetlands preservation, Great Lakes restoration, water conservation, and regulation of large animal feeding operations. Funding for water infrastructure projects was a key focus to stimulate the economy. Two bills amending the CWA were enacted, one extending a moratorium for CWA permitting of certain vessels and the other ensuring federal agencies pay for managing stormwater pollution. Since 1972, Congress has provided over $85 billion in financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction to meet Clean Water Act requirements. State and local governments have also contributed over $25 billion for construction. Federal funds can only be used for construction, not for operation and maintenance of facilities. The funding needs for wastewater treatment and collection systems are very high, with an additional $298 billion required according to the most recent Needs Survey estimate by EPA and states. This includes $187.9 billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems, $63.6 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections, $42.3 billion for stormwater management, and $4.4 billion for systems to distribute recycled water. EPA reported reasons for the increased total needs, which were $23 billion higher than in the previous report. The EPA reported an increase in funding needs for wastewater infrastructure, including improvements for water quality standards, infrastructure rehabilitation, and capacity expansion to accommodate population growth. Stormwater management needs also rose by $17 billion, mainly for \"green\" infrastructure. The total estimated funding required over the next two decades is nearly $390 billion for replacing and building wastewater systems. This does not include funding for security issues or adapting treatment works to climate change impacts. The EPA estimated an additional $148 billion in funding needs for operation and maintenance of wastewater infrastructure over the next two decades. Without increased investment, there will be a $6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures and projected spending needs. Increasing wastewater spending by 3% annually could reduce this gap by nearly 90%. The federal role in assisting states and cities with high funding needs for water infrastructure is under consideration in Congress. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act extended grants for sewage treatment projects and introduced a program of grants for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds. States are required to deposit at least 20% of the federal capitalization grant into the Fund. Repayment for wastewater treatment construction is done by loan recipients to the states under the revolving fund concept. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act introduced State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds, where loan recipients repay states for future construction projects. The federal contributions were expected to transition to full state and local financing by FY1995, but funding and administrative issues have caused delays. SRF monies can be used for various activities, including providing loans for project costs and refinancing debt obligations. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRF) can be used to refinance debt obligations or as revenue for state-issued bonds. States have used $2.6 billion for over 8,650 nonpoint management projects, with none going to estuary management activities. States have established mechanisms to administer the loan programs and receive SRF capitalization funds under Title VI, but many find the program complicated due to federal rules. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRF) program, criticized for its complexity due to federal rules, was intended to provide flexibility to states by Congress. Despite some criticism, the program is well supported and has been used as a model for other programs. Congress continues to appropriate SRF capitalization grants to states, averaging $1.35 billion annually in recent years. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program provides an average of $1.35 billion annually to states for wastewater treatment funding. Small communities face challenges in accessing SRF loans due to limited resources and high borrowing costs. A reestablished grant program may help meet the special needs of these communities. Congress is interested in addressing the special needs of small towns through a reestablished grant program, other funding sources, or loan programs with special rules. There are concerns about the adequacy of funding for high-cost projects dealing with sewer overflows, which can harm public health and the environment. The cost of projects to control sewer overflows and manage stormwater runoff nationwide is estimated to be nearly $64 billion, exceeding the total SRF capitalization grants appropriated since 1987. During the Bush Administration, EPA officials acknowledged that federal funding for water infrastructure needs exceeded what the government could provide alone. The President's budget proposed that federal funding would end after 2011, with state and local self-financing taking over. EPA's main initiative was to support various responses to ensure water utilities could meet investment needs efficiently and equitably. EPA worked with water utilities to promote efficient water use and conservation measures, reducing the need for new infrastructure projects. The Obama Administration continued to support sustainable practices to bridge the funding gap for water infrastructure needs. EPA issued a \"Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Sustainability Policy\" in October 2010 to address management and pricing of infrastructure funded through SRFs. The \"Sustainability Policy\" aims to manage and price infrastructure funded through SRFs to promote conservation and secure long-term funding. EPA will collaborate with water utilities to prioritize projects focusing on system upgrades, full life cycle costs, and natural resource conservation. Congress has previously considered bills to extend SRF programs and increase federal assistance for water infrastructure. In the 108th and 109th Congress, bills were introduced to reauthorize the Clean Water Act SRF program and sewer overflow grants. The Senate approved legislation authorizing $41.25 billion for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs, including $20 billion for the clean water SRF program. No further action was taken on these bills. The 108th and 109th Congress introduced bills to reauthorize the Clean Water Act SRF program and sewer overflow grants. The Senate approved legislation authorizing $41.25 billion for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs, with $20 billion allocated for the clean water SRF program. However, no further action was taken on these bills. In the 109th Congress, various factors hindered progress on the legislation, including disputes over funding allocation, prevailing wage requirements, and opposition from the Administration. The Davis-Bacon Act's application to SRF-funded projects was a particularly contentious issue due to strong supporters and critics in Congress and beyond. The Davis-Bacon Act applies to federal construction work under contract with the United States or the District of Columbia. Critics argue it increases costs and hampers competition, while supporters believe it stabilizes the local construction industry. The Act's applicability to SRF-funded projects has been a contentious issue, with debates on whether to restore its requirements. In March 2007, the House approved wastewater infrastructure financing bills, but the Senate did not act on them. H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, authorized $14 billion for the clean water SRF program for FY2008-FY2011. It included provisions for economically disadvantaged communities, such as extended loan repayments and additional subsidies. One key difference was the specification that the Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirement applies to all SRF-financed projects. The House passed bills to reauthorize CWA Sections 220 and 221, providing funding for sewer overflow projects and alternative water source projects. The Senate committee approved the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, authorizing grants for the Clean Water Act SRF program and Safe Water Act. The House passed bills to reauthorize CWA Sections 220 and 221, providing funding for sewer overflow projects and alternative water source projects. The Senate committee approved the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, authorizing grants for the Clean Water Act SRF program and Safe Water Act. Additionally, $19.6 billion was allocated for Clean Water Act SRF program grants and $14.7 billion for Safe Drinking Water Act SRF capitalization grants through FY2012. The bill expanded eligibility for clean water SRF assistance to include projects such as stormwater management, water conservation, and wastewater reuse. Provisions were included to align the clean water and drinking water SRF programs, allowing assistance for private wastewater treatment systems. Amendments were made to ensure prevailing wage requirements apply to all SRF-funded projects. The 111th Congress saw the House passing a bill related to the Clean Water Act SRF program, but no legislation was enacted due to various issues. The House approved legislation to reauthorize the SRF program and related programs in the CWA, including provisions for economically disadvantaged communities. Title I of the bill would have authorized $13.8 billion in SRF capitalization grants over five years. The House passed a bill related to the Clean Water Act SRF program, including provisions for economically disadvantaged communities. The bill allowed extended loan repayments and additional subsidies for qualifying communities. It encouraged green infrastructure projects and required asset management plans for infrastructure maintenance. The Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirement applied to all SRF-financed projects. Title II of the bill reauthorized a pilot program for alternative water source projects at $50 million per year through FY2014. Title III authorized $2.5 billion for projects to correct municipal sewer overflows, with 20% allocated for green infrastructure projects. Title IV aimed to ensure sewage treatment plants monitor and report raw sewage discharges from sanitary sewers. EPA would issue criteria for assessing sewer overflows' impact on human health. Title V of the bill aimed to reauthorize the Clean Water Act's program for cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes with increased funding of $150 million per year through FY2014. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a similar bill on June 18 (S. 937), while the House passed a similar bill in June 2008 (H.R. 2452). The House had previously passed a bill providing the same funding level and programmatic changes, but the enacted bill retained the existing funding level of $50 million per year. The House adopted several amendments to H.R. 1262, including requirements for states to use 15% of SRF grants for small communities, establishment of a federal task force on pharmaceutical disposal, a crosscut budget for Chesapeake Bay, and studies on infrastructure along the Rio Grande River, U.S.-Mexico border, wastewater infrastructure in the Great Lakes, and presence of chemicals in U.S. waters. Companion legislation was approved by the Senate but not considered. The Senate did not consider the bill modeled after a previous one from the 110th Congress. It would have authorized funds for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, a grant program for combined sewer overflows, and agriculture-related water quality issues. The bill aimed to expand eligibility for clean water SRF assistance and make the programs more parallel. Unlike the House-passed H.R. 1262, the Senate bill did not pass. The Senate bill for clean water and drinking water SRF programs did not include a requirement for states to reserve funds for \"green\" infrastructure projects. However, it did offer incentives for such projects, like forgiving a portion of SRF loans. The Committee adopted amendments including applying the Davis-Bacon Act to all SRF projects and directing EPA to update guidance on pharmaceuticals in U.S. waters. The House bill and Senate bill proposed different approaches to revising the formula for distributing clean water SRF capitalization grants among states. The House bill would have extended the current formula for two years and then implemented a hybrid approach based on funding needs. The Senate bill did not include a requirement for states to reserve funds for \"green\" infrastructure projects but offered incentives for such projects. The Senate bill proposed a revised formula for distributing clean water SRF capitalization grants among states, with adjustments to ensure fair allocation. The formula was based on needs identified in the 2004 clean water needs survey. The Senate did not consider the bill due to concerns over the allocation formula. The 2008 needs survey led to a debate on revising the allocation formula in the legislation for water infrastructure projects. Interest has been growing in developing new mechanisms to fund these projects beyond federal grants or SRFs. Discussions have included creating a national clean water trust fund for increased funding. Some groups advocate for a national clean water trust fund similar to existing funds for highway and aviation projects. Difficulty lies in identifying fair revenue sources. Legislation in the 109th Congress proposed a $7.5 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements, aiming to provide new funding for necessary upgrades amid dwindling federal funds. The 109th Congress proposed a $7.5 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements to address the issue of dwindling federal funds. In the 111th Congress, legislation was introduced to create a Water Protection and Reinvestment Trust Fund, aiming to raise $10 billion per year through excise taxes on various products for clean water and drinking water programs, security upgrades, and climate change adaptation for water utilities. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources held a hearing in 2009 regarding legislation for climate change adaptation and funding sources for water utilities. A GAO report suggested taxes on industry, corporations, and water as a revenue source, but consensus was challenging. Wetlands protection and regulation, especially under the Clean Water Act, remain contentious issues, with the Section 404 permit program requiring permits for disposal of dredged material into navigable waters. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates the disposal of dredged material into navigable waters, including wetlands. The program is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with limited roles for other federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service. Critics view the program as intrusive and burdensome, prompting a need to address concerns while still protecting wetlands. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, regulating activities in wetlands. There is tension between wetlands regulation and landowners' desire for property development. Controversies include federal jurisdiction, permit delays, and the role of federal agencies and states in issuing permits. Litigation surrounds the question of whether isolated waters fall under Section 404 jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruling in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers questioned the authority of the Corps and EPA over isolated wetlands under the Clean Water Act's Section 404. The 5-4 decision stated that denying a permit based solely on migratory bird usage exceeded the act's authority. The impact of this ruling on the regulatory program remains unclear even a decade later. The SWANCC decision questioned federal authority over isolated wetlands under the Clean Water Act's Section 404. The ruling's impact on wetland protection remains uncertain, with states and localities now responsible for safeguarding affected wetlands. Environmentalists criticize the Court's interpretation, while industry groups support it. The decision's effect on federal regulation varies depending on how broadly it is applied by different courts. The SWANCC decision questioned federal authority over isolated wetlands under the Clean Water Act's Section 404, leading to uncertainty in wetland protection. Environmentalists criticize the Court's interpretation, while industry groups support it. Federal courts play a key role in interpreting the decision, with ongoing disputes over the reach of the CWA permit program in wetland development cases. The Supreme Court's ruling in Rapanos v. United States in 2006 addressed the scope of the Clean Water Act permit program regarding wetlands development. The decision, led by Justice Scalia, clarified the incorrect standard applied by lower courts in determining CWA coverage for wetlands. Justice Kennedy joined the plurality in vacating lower court decisions and remanding the cases for further consideration. The Supreme Court's ruling in Rapanos v. United States in 2006 clarified the scope of the Clean Water Act permit program for wetlands development. Justice Scalia led the decision, with Justice Kennedy joining in vacating lower court decisions and remanding the cases for further consideration. The justices took different positions on substantive issues, leading to more case-by-case determinations and ongoing litigation. In response, the EPA and Corps issued guidance in 2007 to help field staff make CWA jurisdictional determinations following the ruling. The EPA and Corps issued guidance in 2007 to determine the jurisdiction of waters following the Rapanos v. United States ruling. After receiving public comments, a revised guidance was issued in December 2008, clarifying key terms like \"adjacent wetlands.\" The agencies left open the possibility of further changes based on experience and feedback. Some environmental groups criticized the revised guidance. Some criticized the revised guidance for limiting protected waters under the CWA. Industry analysts noted few changes could simplify jurisdictional determinations. Congressional committees seek clarification on SWANCC and Rapanos decisions. Legislation introduced to broaden \"waters of the United States\" definition. Legislation introduced in multiple Congresses to clarify \"waters of the United States\" definition and reaffirm CWA jurisdiction. Bills like H.R. 2421 and S. 1870 were discussed in committees to address issues from Supreme Court rulings. The Obama Administration addressed concerns about uncertainties in the Clean Water Act jurisdiction following the Rapanos ruling. Officials supported legislative clarification to protect the nation's waters and promote consistency with agricultural practices. In the 111th Congress, legislation similar to bills introduced previously was advanced by a Senate committee, but the bill was not considered by the full Senate. On June 18, 2009, the Environment and Public Works Committee approved an amended version of S. 787, the Clean Water Restoration Act, defining \"waters of the United States\" to include various water bodies. The bill proposed expanding the definition of \"waters of the United States\" to include various water bodies, excluding certain areas like prior converted cropland. The committee rejected amendments to remove terms like mudflats and prairie potholes but approved language aligning the definition with past interpretations and Congress's authority. The bill aimed to clarify the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act by expanding the definition of \"waters of the United States\" and removing the word \"navigable.\" Companion legislation in the House also sought to restore jurisdiction as it was interpreted before previous court rulings. The new definition of \"waters of the United States\" in the House bill was based on existing EPA-Corps regulatory definitions with modifications. Despite criticism for potentially increasing federal jurisdiction, the bill differed from prior proposals and addressed various issues related to the Clean Water Act. Two bills were enacted during the 111th Congress, one concerning pollutant discharges from vessels and another regarding federal agencies' responsibility for stormwater charges. In 2000, the BEACH Act was enacted to improve water quality standards for coastal recreation waters. The act directed states to update standards and EPA to develop new criteria. A 2007 GAO report found EPA had implemented most provisions but had not published required water quality criteria. In the 110th Congress, hearings were held on the BEACH Act's implementation, and a bill to extend grants was approved by the House. The House approved bill H.R. 2537 to use BEACH Act funds for pollution tracking and rapid beach water testing. It aimed to increase grant funds to $40 million annually and directed EPA to revise water quality criteria for pathogens. Senate committee approved companion legislation S. 2844, but no further action was taken. The 111th Congress also considered similar bills for faster beach water testing and public notification. The House passed H.R. 2093 on July 29, 2010, aimed at rapid testing of beach waters for contamination and faster public notification. Combined sewers serve about 40 million people in older urban and coastal cities, with overflow occurring during high rainwater or snowmelt volumes. Combined sewer systems (CSOs) overflow during high volumes of rainwater or snowmelt, discharging untreated sewage, industrial wastes, and stormwater directly into receiving waters. To manage CSOs, cities must implement EPA's 1994 policy requiring nine minimum controls, including management techniques and structural measures. Some cities also face issues with overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers (SSOs) that transport only sanitary wastes, leading to discharges of untreated sewage. The EPA estimates that about 18,000 municipalities with separate sanitary sewers can experience overflows due to various issues like broken pipes and deteriorated infrastructure. There is no explicit EPA or statutory control policy for addressing these sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). Funding for CSO and SSO projects is a major concern for states and cities, with the largest water infrastructure needs category being to address CSOs, totaling $55 billion. In 2000, Congress passed the Wet Weather Water Quality Act to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems, but no appropriations were provided for these grants. In March 2007, the House passed legislation to reauthorize wet weather grants, but no appropriations were provided. Similar language was included in H.R. 1262 in the 111th Congress. Legislation was also approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. EPA estimates that municipalities with separate sanitary sewers can experience overflows due to broken pipes and deteriorated infrastructure. Funding for CSO and SSO projects is a major concern, with the largest water infrastructure needs category being to address CSOs. Efforts to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay watershed have been insufficient despite decades of activity by government, private sector, and the public. The Bay and its tributaries suffer from polluted water, reduced fish populations, and degraded habitat. President Obama declared the Bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009, leading to the establishment of a Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay to develop a strategy for restoration. The strategy released in 2010 aims to protect and restore the Chesapeake region through new clean water regulations, agricultural conservation practices, and habitat restoration. A key aspect is the establishment of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Chesapeake Bay to control pollution levels and ensure water quality standards are met. EPA requires states to identify impaired waters and set TMDLs to limit pollution levels. The EPA is required to establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay by May 1, 2011, as part of efforts to address water quality standards. This TMDL will allocate reductions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment to all jurisdictions in the watershed. Detailed plans for specific reductions will be developed by the Bay states in Watershed Implementation Plans. The Bay states will develop specific reductions in Watershed Implementation Plans as part of the EPA's TMDL plans for the Chesapeake Bay. The federal Bay restoration strategy is controversial, with concerns about mandatory actions. Environmental activists support legislation to codify Bay TMDL requirements in the Clean Water Act and provide assistance for implementation. Bills were introduced in Congress, with the Senate committee approving a version aiming for restoration actions by 2025. The legislation aimed to establish 2025 as the deadline for restoration actions in the Chesapeake Basin, with $2.26 billion in funding over five years. The National Estuary Program was created in 1987 to protect estuaries threatened by pollution and development, allowing for financial and technical assistance for comprehensive management plans. The National Estuary Program, created in 1987, aims to protect estuaries through stakeholder-driven management plans. EPA has approved 28 estuaries, with funding reauthorized by Congress. Legislation like H.R. 4715 seeks to expand the program, address climate change impacts, and require plan updates and EPA approval. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 4715 on June 30, 2010. Mountaintop removal coal mining in six Appalachian states has raised concerns about stream water quality and wildlife habitat destruction. Critics argue that valley fills from mining activities are detrimental, while the industry defends mountaintop mining as essential for surface coal mining operations. The industry argues that mountaintop mining is essential for surface coal mining in the Appalachian region, regulated under various laws. In June 2009, officials signed a Memorandum of Understanding to reduce environmental impacts through administrative actions, emphasizing coordination and transparency. These actions are being implemented through regulatory proposals and guidance documents. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to restrict mountaintop mining by narrowing the Clean Water Act's definition of \"fill material.\" This would limit materials discharged into U.S. waters under Section 404 permits, with non-eligible materials regulated under Section 402, which has stricter requirements. Support for the bills sought to make regulations more stringent. Critics of the Administration's recent regulatory actions in the 111th Congress introduced legislation (H.R. 6113 and S. 3993) to restrict the EPA, Army Corps, and OSM from enforcing policies not contained in promulgated regulations. This was in response to concerns that the policies constituted rules and were too stringent for economically important activities like coal mining. The Clean Water Act requires permits for pollutant discharge from point sources under the NPDES program. Vessel operations were exempt until a 2006 court decision reversed EPA policy, leading to the development of general permits. The Clean Water Act required permits for pollutant discharge from point sources under the NPDES program. In response, EPA began developing general permits for vessel discharges. The Clean Boating Act provided a two-year moratorium on permit requirements for smaller commercial vessels. EPA issued a general permit for approximately 69,000 vessels, which the Obama Administration is considering changing due to criticism from environmental groups and states. EPA and the Coast Guard were directed to evaluate impacts of discharges from exempted vessels. In March 2010, Congress extended the moratorium on water pollution control requirements until December 18, 2013. The legislation clarified federal responsibility to pay for managing stormwater pollution from federal properties. This addressed concerns about equity in addressing water pollution. In recent years, federal courts have ruled that a CWA permit is required for aerial pesticide application over U.S. waters, even if it complies with FIFRA. This has raised concerns for pesticide applicators, including mosquito control districts, regarding pest control for diseases like West Nile virus. In response, EPA finalized a rule in November 2006 to clarify the regulatory scope of CWA and FIFRA related to pesticide use. In response to recent litigation, the EPA's argument that NPDES permits are not required for residual pesticides from aerial applications impacting U.S. waters was rejected by a federal court in January 2009. Legislation affirming this exemption was introduced in the 109th Congress but not enacted. EPA requested a two-year delay in the court's ruling, planning to develop general CWA permits for pesticide applications. The general permit was proposed in June and is expected to be finalized by April 9. The EPA proposed a general permit in June and aims to finalize it by April 9, 2011. Industry groups sought a Supreme Court review, but the request was denied in February 2010. Legislation to nullify a 2009 federal court ruling was introduced in Congress, but no further action was taken. Clean Water Act permitting issues were also raised in other litigation, including concerns about the transfer of polluted water between waterbodies. Congress has not addressed the Supreme Court's decision on permitting requirements for water transfers. In response to a 2008 ruling by the EPA, a rule was issued defining water transfers not needing permits under the Clean Water Act. This rule was challenged in court by the Miccosukee Indian Tribe and environmental advocates. A related case found pumping polluted water into Lake Okeechobee without a permit did not violate the CWA, citing the EPA's regulation as reasonable. In October 2009, the EPA announced plans to reconsider the water transfer rule due to concerns about water quality impacts. Following the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April 2010, efforts focused on capping the undersea well and containing the oil to prevent shoreline contamination. Congress examined response activities and events leading up to the disaster. The federal government's oil spill response framework, established in 1968 after the Torrey Canyon spill, includes the National Contingency Plan. Subsequent laws like the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and OPA have expanded the NCP to address oil spills in U.S. waters. The statutory framework for responding to oil spills in the U.S. is primarily based on two laws: the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Oil Pollution Act (OPA). The CWA established requirements for oil spill reporting, response, and liability, while the OPA set liability limits for oil spill removal costs and other expenses. Additionally, other federal laws like the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) regulate offshore oil and gas activities. During the 111th Congress, multiple bills were considered to address issues related to oil spills, such as increasing liability limits, streamlining claims assistance, and expanding research programs. The only bill enacted was to advance funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for spill removal costs. Some bills aimed to amend the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and Clean Water Act (CWA) provisions, like H.R. 5629, which included various provisions for spill response and prevention. During the 111th Congress, multiple bills were considered to address oil spill issues, including raising liability limits, revising NCP procedures, and clarifying federal agency responsibilities. H.R. 5629 included provisions for spill response and prevention, while H.R. 5608 aimed to incorporate worst case discharges into NCP and Area Contingency Plans. H.R. 5677 proposed water quality monitoring within 48 hours of a spill to assess impacts. During the 111th Congress, bills were considered to address oil spill issues, including H.R. 5677 which proposed water quality monitoring within 48 hours of a spill to assess impacts on aquatic resources. Another bill, S. 3466, focused on penalties and enforcement related to the Clean Water Act. President Bush's FY2009 budget sought $7.1 billion for EPA programs, 5% less than the previous year. The FY2009 budget requested $555 million for the clean water SRF program, a 20% reduction from FY2008. It also asked for 8% less for nonpoint pollution management grants ($184.5 million) and no funding for targeted watershed grants program. In contrast, a House Appropriations subcommittee approved $850 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants, exceeding the Administration's request. In FY2009, Congress passed legislation providing partial-year funding for EPA and other agencies through March 6, 2009. A second short-term CR was enacted on March 6, followed by a full-year omnibus FY2009 appropriations bill signed by President Obama on March 11, 2009. This bill provided $689 million in regular appropriations for the full year, with an additional $4.0 billion in economic stimulus funds. In 2009, Congress provided $4.0 billion in economic stimulus funds. President Obama urged Congress to enact a multi-billion dollar fiscal stimulus bill to address the nation's economic conditions. Interest in using federal government spending to stimulate U.S. economic recovery intensified, with a focus on making accelerated investments in public infrastructure to create jobs and meet infrastructure needs. In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, providing $6 billion in supplemental appropriations for various government programs, including the clean water SRF program. Interest groups identified \"shovel ready\" projects worth billions, prompting quick legislative action to meet President Obama's deadline for economic stimulus legislation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $6 billion for clean water SRF grants. The legislation was amended in the Senate to provide $4 billion for these grants, which was later agreed upon by the House and Senate. President Obama signed the bill into law on February 17 (P.L. 111-5), waiving the 20% match requirement for states and allowing various forms of assistance to communities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $6 billion for clean water SRF grants, with a focus on quick-start activities and wastewater projects. States were directed to prioritize projects that could begin within 120 days and proceed to construction within 12 months. At least 20% of the funds were to be used for green infrastructure, water or energy efficiency improvements. The supplemental funds provided were significantly larger than regular appropriations, and were well-received by state and local officials. President Obama detailed the Administration's FY2010 budget request on May 7, 2009, seeking $10.5 billion for EPA, with a focus on water infrastructure. The budget included $2.4 billion for clean water SRF grants, a significant increase from previous years, aiming to fund 1,000 clean water projects. The FY2010 budget sought $475 million for Great Lakes restoration efforts, including funding for clean water projects. Congress agreed to provide $2.1 billion for clean water SRF grants and $187 million for water infrastructure special project grants, with conditions on usage. The bill imposed conditions on the use of clean water SRF grants, requiring at least 30% to be used for additional subsidization and 20% for green infrastructure projects. It also mandated the application of prevailing wage rules for clean water projects. EPA issued guidance on the interpretation of these rules in November 2009. The EPA's guidance on Davis-Bacon applicability, issued in connection with FY2010 appropriations, was criticized for being overly broad and retroactive. This criticism contributed to the Senate's inaction on CWA water infrastructure reauthorization legislation. President Obama signed the bill supporting $475 million for Great Lakes restoration on October 30, 2009 (P.L. 111-88). President Obama signed the bill on October 30, 2009 (P.L. 111-88) and presented his FY2011 budget request to Congress on February 1, 2010. The budget called for a freeze on non-security discretionary expenditures at EPA, with a total request of $10.02 billion, slightly lower than the $10.3 billion enacted for FY2010. The request included $2.0 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, with a focus on \"green infrastructure\" projects and additional subsidization for communities facing financial challenges. The President's FY2011 budget requested $300 million for Great Lakes restoration, continuing the initiative from the FY2010 budget. Only 8% of the 2010 funds had been obligated by February 2010, with some funds not spent until 2011. Limited action was taken by Congress on FY2011 funding for EPA before the new fiscal year began on October 1, 2010. In September 2010, a continuing resolution was passed to extend FY2010 funding levels for EPA and other federal agencies until December 3, 2010. Additional short-term resolutions were passed, leading to a fourth resolution in December that extended funding through March 4, 2011. Final resolution of FY2011 appropriations was expected in the 112th Congress."
