    "content": "On September 5, DOT Secretary Mary Peters warned of a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund by October 2008, urging Congress to pass legislation transferring general fund revenues. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a $109.4 billion funding for FY2009 THUD appropriations, $6.6 billion more than requested by the Administration. The House Committee on Appropriations also marked up a draft bill for increased funding in housing and transportation programs. The bill proposes increased funding for various housing and transportation programs, surpassing the President's request. Congress is challenged with the FY2009 appropriations process amidst economic difficulties. The budget deficit for FY2008 is projected to be around $400 billion. The THUD budget request for FY2009 shows no net increase compared to FY2008. The THUD budget request for FY2009 shows no net increase compared to FY2008, and Congress may pass continuing resolutions to keep the government operating until FY2009 appropriations are completed in 2009. The President's net FY2009 request for the programs covered by this appropriations bill is $102.5 billion. The appropriations bill for FY2009 covers $102.5 billion, slightly lower than FY2008. The DOT request was $63.5 billion, a 2% decrease from FY2008. Transit funding saw a 7% increase, but below authorized levels. The President's FY2009 Budget requests $39.1 billion, a less than 4% increase in total budget authority for HUD. The requested increase is mainly due to declines in rescission and offsetting receipts. Regular appropriations for HUD represent a slight decline from FY2008. The Administration's FY2009 budget request included funding reductions for various programs, such as DOT highway funding, airport grants, Amtrak, subsidies for air service to small communities, HUD's Community Development Fund, Housing for the Elderly, Housing for the Disabled, and various other programs. The total funding provided for each title in the bill for FY2008 and the amount requested for FY2009 are listed in tables. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have reorganized their subcommittee structure multiple times since 2003. Changes included adding a Homeland Security subcommittee and combining Transportation appropriations with other subcommittees. In 2005, the House reduced its subcommittees from 13 to 10, merging Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies with the District of Columbia subcommittee. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reorganized its subcommittees, reducing the number to 12 and adding jurisdiction over appropriations for the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The House and Senate subcommittees had almost identical coverage, with the main difference being the Senate retaining a separate District of Columbia Appropriations subcommittee. At the beginning of the 110th Congress in 2007, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures. The responsibilities of the TTHUD subcommittees were divided between two subcommittees: Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD); and Financial Services and General Government. This reorganization made year-to-year comparisons of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriation bills complex. The funding trends for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development over the five-year period FY2004-FY2008, and the amounts requested for FY2009, are shown in Table 3. The economic and political context for the FY2009 transportation appropriations process is tumultuous due to factors such as rising fuel prices impacting cars, trucks, and commercial jets. The rise in fuel prices is impacting the transportation industry, leading to significant losses in the commercial passenger aviation sector. Flights are being reduced and routes eliminated, affecting air connections to communities. Legislation reauthorizing FAA programs is being debated in Congress, with concerns about infrastructure. The collapse of an Interstate Highway bridge in Minnesota in August 2007 raised concerns about the nation's aging bridges and transportation infrastructure. Calls for increased spending on transportation infrastructure have been made, with recommendations to double surface transportation investment to $225 billion annually. However, the Highway Trust Fund is projected to run short of money before the end of FY2009. The Highway Trust Fund is projected to run short of money before the end of FY2009 due to reduced fuel consumption from rising gas prices. Congress is considering legislation to provide funds from the general account to prevent a deficit. The President's FY2009 budget requested $64.5 billion for the Department of Transportation, with changes in funding levels for transit, highways, and Amtrak. The Administration's FY2009 budget proposed significant cuts in transportation funding, including a $525 million decrease in Amtrak funding, a $765 million decrease in the FAA's Airport Improvement Program, and a $60 million decrease in funding for the Essential Air Service Program. These proposed cuts have been repeatedly rejected by Congress, creating a challenge for appropriators. If funding is restored to previous levels, the resulting bill may exceed the President's budget. The Highway Trust Fund, funded mainly by federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, faces a deficit in its accounts. The Highway Account, which receives the majority of the revenues, is expected to run short of money before the end of FY2009, with projections showing an increasing deficit in the following years. This was anticipated in 2005 with the passage of SAFETEA-LU, which authorized more funding for federal highway and transit programs. The Highway Trust Fund, funded by federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, is facing a deficit in its accounts. SAFETEA-LU in 2005 authorized more highway funding than projected revenues could support, leading to a shortfall in the Highway Account by October 2008. Expenditures have exceeded authorized levels, and revenues have not kept pace, exacerbated by a drop in revenues in 2008 due to high gas prices. The deficit is projected to worsen in subsequent years. The Highway Trust Fund is facing a deficit in its accounts due to expenditures exceeding revenues. To address the shortfall, the Administration plans to slow the rate of highway funds transferred to states. Legislation has been proposed to transfer $8 billion from the general fund to cover the deficit, despite the Administration's concerns about increasing the federal deficit and altering the fund's principles. The Administration is seeking legislation to transfer funds to the Highway Account due to a funding shortfall. The FAA budget includes funding for air traffic control and airport grants. The President's budget requests $14.6 billion for FY2009, slightly less than the previous year. The Senate Committee recommended $15.4 billion, with a focus on the Airport Improvement grant program. Comparing funding levels for operations and facilities & equipment is challenging due to budget categorization. The Administration's budget request for FY2009 includes a cut to the Airport Improvement grant program, proposing a reduction from $3.51 billion to $2.75 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations rejected this cut and recommended maintaining funding at $3.5 billion. Additionally, the President's budget requested a $60 million (54%) reduction for the Essential Air Service program. The Administration proposed a $60 million (54%) reduction for the Essential Air Service program in FY2009, seeking to preserve air service to small airports in rural communities. Supporters argue that maintaining airline service to rural areas was part of the agreement made by Congress in 1978. Concerns have been raised that cutting funding for this program could impact transportation connections in rural communities. The President's budget for FY2009 proposed a $1.8 billion cut in funding for federal highway programs, below the authorized level guaranteed by SAFETEA-LU. This reduction includes a $1.0 billion decrease due to the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority adjustment. The Administration proposed a $1.0 billion reduction in authorized funding for FY2009, citing declining receipts. The FHWA's share of the reduction was $800 million to adjust for extra Highway Bridge Program obligations in FY2008. The Senate Committee on Appropriations rejected both the $1.0 billion cut and the $800 million reduction, recommending $42.1 billion for FY2009. The Administration proposed transferring funds from the Mass Transit Account to cover the FY2009 Highway Account deficit, but the committee recommended $8 billion from the general fund instead. The requested funding for FMCSA is $541 million, with $307 million for grants to states for truck and bus safety enforcement. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same funding level. The FY2008 THUD appropriations act included a provision prohibiting funds from establishing a cross-border trucking demonstration program. The Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a pilot program in 2007 for cross-border trucking with Mexico. Despite opposition from Congress, the program has been extended for two more years due to safety compliance rates being equal to or better than U.S. truckers. Trucking companies have been hesitant to participate, leading to lower than expected participation rates. The Sierra Club and Teamsters Union have filed a lawsuit to stop the program. The Administration requested $851 million for NHTSA, an increase of $13 million over the previous year. $600 million is allocated for grants to states for highway safety programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $855 million for NHTSA's operations and research account. NHTSA's main goal is to improve highway safety, as highway fatalities are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 3 and 34. The fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled is a key measure for highway safety. NHTSA has not met its goal of reducing the rate to 1.0 fatality per 100 million VMT by 2011. Motorcycle fatalities have been increasing since 2001, and mandatory helmet laws are seen as the most effective safety policy. Congress has penalized states without helmet laws by restricting federal highway funding. Congress repealed the provision penalizing states without helmet laws in 1995, leading to about twenty states having universal mandatory helmet laws. In 1998, Congress also prohibited DOT from lobbying states for traffic safety laws, except for reducing motorcycle fatalities. The Administration requested a $471 million cut for FRA in FY2009, with the Senate Committee recommending $1.816 billion, mainly for Amtrak funding. The Administration requested a $800 million cut for Amtrak in FY2009, while the Senate committee recommended $1.5 billion for Amtrak and an additional $100 million for an incentive grant program. Congress is considering reauthorization of Amtrak with bills authorizing between $2 and $3 billion annually, compared to the current $1.3 billion funding level. The Administration requested funding cuts for Amtrak in FY2009, while the Senate committee recommended increased funding. The FRA budget includes funding for safety programs and research for rail safety improvements. Congress also provided funding for a rail line relocation and improvement program in FY2008. The Senate committee recommended $25 million for a program in SAFETEA-LU that had not been funded before, while the Administration requested $10.135 billion for FTA in FY2009, an increase of $644 million from FY2008. Most of FTA's funding supports state and local transportation authorities for various transit services. The Senate committee recommended $100 million less for formula grant programs and bus grants, but $188 million more for the New Starts program. The Administration requested $313 million for MARAD for FY2009, $7 million above the FY2008 enacted amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $345 million, with a primary change being $20 million for small shipyard assistance. MARAD's budget includes the Maritime Security Program and Operations and Training, with a $174 million request for the former, a 12% increase from FY2008. The Maritime Security Program received a $174 million budget for FY2009, an $18 million increase from FY2008. This program maintains a fleet of 60 privately owned vessels for security purposes. Operations and Training funding was requested at $118 million, $4 million less than FY2008. HUD's programs focus on housing issues for low-income households, including rental assistance for the elderly and disabled. HUD's rental assistance programs for the poor, elderly, and disabled, such as Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance, receive the majority of non-emergency funding. Block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants support housing and community development activities for low-income families. Specialized grants help homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD also focuses on increasing homeownership rates for lower-income and minority households through downpayment assistance and housing counseling programs. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides insurance for mortgages made to lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus fees are used to offset HUD's budget, which includes regular appropriations, offsetting collections from FHA, rescissions, and emergency appropriations. This section gives an overview of FY2009 funding for HUD. The section provides an overview of FY2009 funding for HUD, including the President's budget request compared to prior year's enacted budget authority and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported funding levels. It includes details on budget authority provided and available, with and without emergency appropriations. The President's FY2009 Budget requested a less than 4% increase in total budget authority for HUD, driven by declines in rescission and offsetting receipts. Congress is scored by the Congressional Budget Office for available budget authority in appropriations bills. The FY2009 request for regular appropriations for HUD represents a slight decline from FY2008. The tenant-based rental assistance account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, providing rental assistance for low-income families. HUD administers the program at the local level through public housing authorities. The tenant-based rental assistance account is the largest in HUD's budget and has been a source of contention. Attention has been on funding for voucher renewals and how it is allocated to public housing authorities. The President's request for FY2009 includes $11,881 million in current year funding for voucher renewals and $4,000 million in advance appropriations for FY2010. This would result in $16,039 million in available budget authority for FY2009, an increase from the previous year. The President's FY2009 budget requested $11,881 million for voucher renewals and $4,000 million for advance appropriations, totaling $16,039 million in available budget authority. HUD estimated this funding would be sufficient to renew all vouchers in use. There was a debate over changing the funding formula for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to base funding on the previous year's amount rather than on costs and voucher usage. This debate has been ongoing since FY2003. The President's budget for FY2009 requested $39 million for new incremental vouchers for elderly and disabled families displaced by hurricanes in 2005 and $75 million for homeless veterans. The Senate bill, S. 3261, would provide $12,503 million in current year funding for tenant-based rental assistance and $4,200 million in advance appropriations for FY2010, rescinding $800 million from the previous year. The total budget for new vouchers would be $114 million, less than the amount provided in FY2008. The Senate bill, S. 3261, would result in $15,861 million in available budget authority for FY2009, an increase from the previous year. It includes $134 million for new incremental vouchers, more than requested by the President. The project-based rental assistance account provides funding for over one million rental assistance contracts between property owners and HUD, allowing low-income tenants to pay reduced rents. HUD faced a funding shortfall in 2007, leading to a halt in payments to property owners with project-based contracts. Negotiations with the Office of Management and Budget and contract revisions allowed HUD to resume payments. The project-based rental assistance account faced a funding shortfall in 2007, leading to a halt in payments to property owners with contracts. For FY2009, the President's budget requested $7,000 million for the account, with industry groups contending that an additional $2,000 million would be needed to fully fund contractual obligations. S. 3261 included $6,700 million in current year appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $6,700 million in current year appropriations for project-based rental assistance, along with $1,750 million in advance appropriations for FY2010. This funding was noted to be insufficient to cover all contracts for 12 months but aimed to bring stability to the program. Despite the President's lack of funding requests for the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program since FY2003, Congress has continued to fund it each year. The HOPE VI public housing revitalization program has been funded at around $100 million in recent years, with criticism for slow expenditure of grant funds. Proponents highlight its transformative effects on distressed communities. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the President's proposal to eliminate funding and allocated $100 million for FY2009, extending the program's authorization through the end of FY2009. The Community Development Fund (CDF) account funds the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, a formula grant for community development activities. The President's FY2009 budget recommendation for CDBG is $659 million less than the previous year, with plans to reform the program during the 110th Congress. The Community Development Block Grant Reform Act, S. 3261, proposes $3,586 million for CDBG formula grants, exceeding the President's request. The Administration's FY2009 budget aims to reduce funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminate funding for other community development programs deemed duplicative. S. 3261 rejects most of the President's proposals to eliminate funding for community and economic development programs. It would fund Rural Housing and Economic Development Grants, Section 108 loan guarantees, and EDI and NI earmarks. However, it does not provide new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiatives program. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program provides block grant funding for affordable housing initiatives. The President's FY2009 budget requested a $275 million increase in funding for HOME formula grants. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications highlight the importance of the HOME program for increasing homeownership opportunities, especially for minorities. The program received a strong rating from OMB's evaluation. S. 3261 would provide $34 million more for HOME formula grants than the President's request. The Section 202 Housing for the Elderly and Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities programs offer capital grants and rental assistance for subsidized housing. In FY2009, the Administration's budget proposed cuts to funding for housing and services for elderly households and persons with disabilities. The President's budget suggested reducing funding for Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities to $160 million from $237 million in FY2008. S. 3261 rejected the proposed cuts and would provide $765 million for Section 202 and $250 million for Section 811. The FHA administers mortgage insurance programs to protect lenders from loan defaults. The FHA administers mortgage insurance programs to protect lenders from loan defaults, enabling borrowers to obtain loans for various purposes. The programs are funded through two accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund account (GI/SRI). The MMI/CMHI fund provides insurance for home mortgages, while the GI/SRI fund covers riskier mortgages and special-purpose loans. The FY2009 Budget estimates that the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund (MMI/CMHI) would need a credit subsidy or increased insurance premiums to continue operation. The Budget proposes risk-based insurance premiums to avoid the need for subsidy appropriations, with the option to increase premiums if necessary. This approach, along with legislative and programmatic changes, aims to offset the need for credit subsidy appropriations. The FY2009 Budget proposes risk-based insurance premiums for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund to avoid the need for subsidy appropriations."
