    "content": "The report discusses the constitutionality of federal tort reform legislation, including products liability and medical malpractice proposals. Torts are civil wrongs that cause injury, such as medical malpractice or selling defective products. While tort law is primarily state law, Congress has enacted some tort reform statutes. Enacting tort reform legislation is within Congress's power to regulate commerce and does not violate due process or federalism, but it may raise constitutional concerns. The report discusses the constitutionality of federal tort reform legislation, focusing on the application of such legislation to intrastate torts that do not affect interstate commerce. Congress has the authority to enact tort reform generally, including caps on damages and limitations on liability. However, more specialized reforms may face constitutional challenges, such as statutes involving punitive damages awards. Alternative dispute resolution options are also considered in the report, some of which may have constitutional issues. An Appendix describes selected federal tort reform statutes. The report examines the constitutionality of federal tort reform legislation, specifically focusing on Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. It discusses the application of tort reform to intrastate torts and addresses constitutional concerns such as Due Process and Federalism. The report states that federal tort reform must be enacted within Congress's enumerated powers and not violate the Constitution. The question of whether tort law falls under \"commerce\" is raised, along with the constitutionality of federal tort reform on purely intrastate torts. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has the power to regulate activities that impact interstate commerce. This includes the business of insurance, which is considered interstate commerce. The constitutionality of federal tort reform legislation on intrastate torts is examined, with a focus on Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. Congress has the power to regulate activities impacting interstate commerce, including the business of insurance. Tort reform legislation within Congress's commerce power, but may be unconstitutional for intrastate torts not affecting interstate commerce, as seen in United States v. Lopez. The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 made it a federal offense to possess a firearm at a school zone. The Court in Lopez identified three categories of activity that Congress can regulate under its commerce power, including activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was found to be outside the scope of Congress's commerce power in the case of Lopez. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Morrison further clarified the limits of the Commerce Clause in cases involving activities that substantially affect commerce. The Supreme Court struck down the provision of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 that created a federal cause of action against gender-motivated crimes of violence, stating that such crimes are not economic activity. The Court emphasized the non-economic, criminal nature of the conduct in question, as seen in the Lopez case. In Morrison, the Court highlighted the lack of congressional findings to support the substantial effect on interstate commerce. In Gonzales v. Raich (2005), the Supreme Court upheld the federal statute prohibiting marijuana manufacture and possession for medicinal purposes, citing a rational basis that local cultivation and use of marijuana substantially affect interstate commerce. The Court differentiated this case from Lopez and Morrison as marijuana is considered a commodity with economic implications. In Gonzales v. Raich (2005), the Supreme Court upheld the federal statute prohibiting marijuana manufacture and possession for medicinal purposes, citing a rational basis that local cultivation and use of marijuana substantially affect interstate commerce. The Court differentiated this case from Lopez and Morrison as marijuana is considered a commodity with economic implications. The decision supports Congress's power to regulate activities that constitute interstate commerce, such as medical malpractice and products liability litigation. In 1978, the Supreme Court upheld the Price-Anderson Act's limitation on liability for accidents at nuclear power plants, stating that statutes limiting liability are common and can be enforced. In 1985, the Court also upheld California statutes capping damages in medical malpractice cases. In National League of Cities v. Usery, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fair Labor Standards Act could not be applied to state and municipal government employees due to a constitutional limitation on Congress's commerce power. The Court did not specify the exact provision but emphasized the Tenth Amendment's role in preserving states' integrity and functioning in a federal system. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court overruled National League of Cities, allowing the Fair Labor Standards Act to apply to state and municipal employees. The Court emphasized that the Commerce Clause did not authorize Congress to interfere with states' freedom to structure integral operations in traditional governmental functions. The Court found the National League of Cities test impractical and doctrinally barren, stating it had no license to use freestanding conceptions of state sovereignty when measuring congressional authority under the Commerce Clause. However, it recognized the special position of states in the constitutional system. In New York v. United States, the Court invalidated a provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985. The Court invalidated a provision of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, stating that Congress may regulate interstate commerce directly but not state governments' regulation of it. Congress can urge states to adopt federal standards through spending power or pre-emption of state law under the Commerce Clause. The Court ruled that Congress can regulate interstate commerce directly but not state governments' regulation of it. States must choose between two coercive regulatory techniques, as Congress cannot force them to participate in a federal scheme. The \"take title\" provision was deemed unconstitutional for commandeering state legislative processes. Federalism restrains the use of state regulatory processes for federal purposes, but not federal regulation of businesses and individuals. Congress can regulate interstate commerce directly but not state governments' regulation of it. States must choose between two coercive regulatory techniques, as Congress cannot force them to participate in a federal scheme. Federalism restrains the use of state regulatory processes for federal purposes, but no federalism restraint on federal regulation of businesses and individuals in areas traditionally regulated by states. Congress can enact federal law that preempted substantive state law without commandeering state regulatory processes. In New York v. United States, the Supreme Court affirmed Congress's power to pass laws enforceable in state courts, citing the Supremacy Clause. This involves federal statutes directing state judges to enforce them, as mandated by the Clause. One case cited, Second Employers' Liability Cases, dealt with tort reform. Cases, 223 U.S. 1 (1912), challenged the Employers' Liability Act of 1908, a federal workers' compensation statute that preempted state tort law. The Supreme Court addressed whether rights under the congressional act could be enforced in state courts, affirming Congress's power to pass laws enforceable in all states. One potential tort reform suggested for Congress is to mandate alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for tort claims, like medical malpractice, instead of traditional jury trials. While federal causes of action can be enforced with or without a jury trial, traditional tort actions, such as medical malpractice and products liability, are governed by state law, even in federal court on diversity grounds. State laws typically allow for jury trials in tort cases. The Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution generally allows for jury trials in tort cases brought in state courts, and cases arising under state law in federal court. The question arises regarding Congress's ability to require alternative dispute resolution for tort claims under state law. The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury in common law suits, including tort actions. However, it does not apply in state courts where most tort actions are brought. The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in common law tort actions, but it does not apply in state courts where most tort cases are brought. However, it does apply to cases under state law in federal court on diversity grounds. Congress cannot eliminate the right to a jury trial in common law tort actions in federal court, but it can eliminate the right to bring such actions in federal court by abolishing diversity jurisdiction or altering tort suits so they no longer fall under common law. Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101 et seq., provides compensation to federal employees for work-related injuries without proof of fault. Employees cannot bring tort actions under state law against the government. Claims must be filed with the Secretary of Labor for determination of entitlement to an award. No right to jury trial or judicial review. Congress can prohibit common law tort suits in federal court but cannot allow them with restrictions. The Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution prohibit common law tort suits from being heard by federal courts without a jury. Federal courts established under Article III are known as \"Article III courts.\" Congress cannot allow common law tort suits to be decided by federally established non-judicial forums without violating the Constitution. Article I courts, established by Congress in specialized areas, do not require judges to have life tenure or irreducible salaries. However, only Article III courts can exercise the judicial power of the United States. Congress's power to create Article I courts is limited to specialized areas, such as territorial courts, military courts, and courts for cases involving public matters. Federal judicial power cannot be exercised by arbitration panels or any federal forum other than an Article III court. Marathon clarified that courts for public rights cases involve disputes between the government and others, while private rights disputes are core judicial matters. The Court later revised this, stating that public rights cases do not necessarily involve the government. The issue at hand is whether Congress can create a private right closely linked to a regulatory scheme that can be resolved by an agency rather than an Article III court. Placing common law tort actions in an Article I tribunal raises constitutional concerns similar to denying jury trials in such cases. Congress cannot bypass the Seventh Amendment by sending traditional legal claims to an administrative tribunal. Congress may create causes of action analogous to common-law claims and assign their resolution to a forum without jury trials, but this power is limited. The ability to deny the right to a jury trial is the same as placing a matter outside of an Article III court. The Seventh Amendment prohibits Congress from sending traditional legal claims to an administrative tribunal. The Seventh Amendment affords the right to a jury trial for legal causes of action tried in an Article III court. If Congress assigns adjudication to a non-Article III tribunal, the Seventh Amendment does not pose a barrier to nonjury factfinders. The question of whether a federal statute assigning tort claims to an Article I tribunal violates Article III and the Seventh Amendment is the same. Congress may establish a federal non-Article III forum for traditional tort claims, which raises constitutional issues regarding the Seventh Amendment. However, if Congress prohibits states from using jury trials in tort cases without establishing an Article I forum, it does not raise an Article III/Seventh Amendment concern. State courts operate under state laws and do not exercise federal judicial power. Congress altering state court procedures for state causes of action raises a separate constitutional issue. The extent to which Congress can require tort claims to be decided by an Article I tribunal is discussed in Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co. In Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., the Supreme Court established that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate traditional tort actions arising under state law without consent of the litigants and subject only to ordinary appellate review. Congress may require traditional tort actions to be heard in a federal non-Article III forum by altering the claims or allowing de novo review with a jury trial. Congress may require traditional tort actions to be heard in a federal non-Article III forum without a jury, but allow for a dissatisfied party to seek a jury trial. If Congress wishes to limit judicial review of tort claims, it must alter them so they are no longer traditional common law tort actions. The Supreme Court has indicated that Congress can create causes of action closely analogous to common-law claims and place them outside the Seventh Amendment's scope if they are integrated into a public regulatory scheme suitable for agency resolution with limited involvement by Article III judiciary. In Thomas, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that a matter of public rights must involve the government and others, emphasizing practical attention to substance over formal categories in applying Article III. The case involved a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which requires manufacturers to submit research data to the EPA for pesticide registration. Congress intended for the EPA to consider data submitted by one registrant to support another registrant's product registration. The Supreme Court found mandatory binding arbitration permissible for resolving compensation disputes among registrants under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The right to compensation for shared data does not replace a right under state law and is not purely a private right. The Supreme Court found that the right created by FIFRA is not purely private but has characteristics of a public right. Using a registrant's data for follow-on registrations serves a public purpose in safeguarding public health. Congress can authorize agencies to allocate costs and benefits without Article III adjudication. Thomas case involved a private right closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme. FIFRA allows limited judicial review and does not preclude review by an Article III court. The Supreme Court emphasized that the arbitration proceeding can still be reviewed by an Article III court. In Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, the Court declined to adopt rigid rules, considering various factors to assess the impact of congressional action on the federal judiciary's role. The opinion in Schor highlighted the nonformalistic approach, focusing on the reservation of essential judicial powers to Article III courts. The Supreme Court in Schor upheld a congressional grant of adjudicatory powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), emphasizing that the CFTC's jurisdiction over common law counterclaims departs from the traditional agency model. The statute leaves most of the \"essential attributes of judicial power\" to Article III courts, unlike the unconstitutional portion of the Bankruptcy Act in Northern Pipeline. The Supreme Court upheld the CFTC's adjudicatory powers in Schor, stating that CFTC orders are reviewed under the \"weight of the evidence\" standard. In Northern Pipeline, the Court found unconstitutional the delegation of adjudication of the right to recover contract damages to an Article I tribunal. This decision was based on the distinction between public and private rights, stating that the right to recover contract damages is a state-created private right and cannot be delegated to an Article I court. The Supreme Court's decision in Granfinanciera emphasized the need for bankruptcy court judgments to be subject to review only under the 'clearly erroneous' standard. This limited review gave bankruptcy courts more power than was deemed permissible. The Court also ruled in favor of a jury trial in bankruptcy trustee suits to recover fraudulent transfers, citing the Seventh Amendment. The distinction between public and private rights was highlighted in Northern Pipeline, where the delegation of adjudication of contract damages to an Article I tribunal was found unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's decision in Granfinanciera emphasized the need for bankruptcy court judgments to be subject to review only under the 'clearly erroneous' standard. The Court ruled in favor of a jury trial in bankruptcy trustee suits to recover fraudulent transfers, citing the Seventh Amendment. Congress cannot eliminate a party's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial by relabeling the cause of action. Providing jury trials in some fraudulent conveyance actions may impede swift resolution. The Supreme Court upheld the use of non-Article III forums in certain cases, citing reasons such as limited judicial review and the nature of the rights involved. In contrast, the Court struck down the use of an Article I forum in Northern Pipeline due to its authority over state-created private rights and lack of robust judicial review. The Supreme Court has upheld non-Article III forums in certain cases for limited judicial review and specific rights. However, in cases like Granfinanciera, an Article I forum was struck down for adjudicating private rights without robust judicial review. The Court considers factors like the nature of the cause of action and the level of review by an Article III tribunal in determining the constitutionality of congressional actions affecting the federal judiciary's role. In cases where the cause of action is altered to the point that it no longer resembles a common law tort and is closely integrated into a federal regulatory scheme, adjudication by an Article I forum without judicial review may be permissible. Bright-line rules cannot effectively be employed for all Article III inquiries. If Congress prohibits states from using jury trials in tort cases without establishing a federal non-Article III forum, it would not raise an Article III/Seventh Amendment issue. The issue at hand is whether Congress, even with the power to regulate under the Commerce Clause, can change the procedures state courts use for state causes of action. While Congress can preempt state law, eliminating jury trials may be seen as commandeering state regulatory processes. This distinction between substance and procedure is supported by the Supreme Court's approach to diversity cases. In diversity cases, federal courts must apply state substantive law, including statutes of limitations, which can significantly impact the outcome of litigation. This principle was established in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins and Guaranty Trust Co. v. New York. The right to a jury trial in federal court is determined by federal law, not state law, and can have a significant impact on litigation outcomes. The Seventh Amendment is a key factor in this determination. Federal courts may use federal rules for jury trials of state causes of action, potentially preempting state court rules. The importance of state control over judicial procedure is a general rule in this context. The general rule in federal court is that state rules regarding claims, defenses, and counter-defenses can apply to federal claims as long as they do not nullify rights. A 1950 case showed that states can deny access to their courts for Federal Employers' Liability Act cases if done impartially. Congress may have the power to eliminate jury trials in state causes of action heard in state courts. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts conflicting state law, allowing agreements to arbitrate to eliminate the right to a jury trial in some state cases. This authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause has been upheld in various cases, including Southland Corp. v. Keating, Perry v. Thomas, and Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto. The Federal Arbitration Act allows agreements to arbitrate to eliminate the right to a jury trial in some state cases, preempting conflicting state law. The Employers Liability Act of 1908 regulated the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employees, essentially serving as a federal workers' compensation statute that preempted state tort law. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute, affirming Congress's power to regulate commerce and override state tort law. The Price-Anderson Act limits the tort liability of Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees and Department of Energy nuclear contractors for a single \"nuclear incident.\" The liability limit is currently $9.09 billion, including industrywide contributions. This policy is applicable to all states and should be respected in state courts. The Price-Anderson Act limits tort liability for nuclear incidents to $9.09 billion. In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the act, stating that new rights can be created or old ones abolished by statutes to achieve legislative goals. The Atomic Testing Liability Act made the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for suits against government contractors involved in atomic weapons testing programs. The Warner Amendment immunized contractors from liability for atomic weapons testing programs, making the United States liable instead. Other statutes also substitute the United States as the defendant in suits under state tort law, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act and the National Swine Flu Immunization Program of 1976. Congress has enacted statutes that protect vaccine manufacturers from liability under state law, allowing the United States to sue them for negligence. Various statutes treat non-federal individuals as federal employees for liability purposes, including volunteers in federally funded programs like medical clinics and the Peace Corps. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 treats smallpox vaccine manufacturers and administrators as federal employees for liability purposes. Victims of negligence can sue the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, but liability is limited. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act of 1986 prohibits suits under state tort law against vaccine manufacturers unless a claim for limited compensation is filed first. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides no-fault compensation for vaccine injuries, overseen by a Director selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Claims are adjudicated by the United States Court of Federal Claims and paid by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund. Manufacturers are not liable for failure to provide warnings directly to the injured party under state tort law. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act overrides state tort law in certain sections. Section 112(e) states that no person asserting a claim against the Fund waives any other claim from the same transaction. Section 309(a) governs actions for personal injury or property damages caused by exposure to hazardous substances. The General Aviation Revitalization Act bars products liability suits against manufacturers of older planes not used in scheduled service. The Cruise Ship Liability section of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 added provisions for vicarious liability for medical malpractice involving crewmembers at shoreside facilities. It also allows contracts to relieve vessel operators from liability for emotional distress or psychological injury to passengers. The Cruise Ship Liability section of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 added provisions for vicarious liability for medical malpractice involving crewmembers at shoreside facilities. Liability for emotional distress, mental suffering, or psychological injury may not be limited in cases of physical injury, negligence, intentional infliction, sexual harassment, assault, or rape by crewmembers or operators. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act provides protection for individuals or gleaners who distribute food to the needy. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act protects individuals or gleaners who donate apparently wholesome food in good faith to non-profit organizations for distribution to needy individuals. The act also extends liability protection to the receiving non-profit organization, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. The 2008 statute alerts federal contractors that they are exempt from civil and criminal liability under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. This statute applies to contracts above $25,000 for food provision or rental of federal property for events involving food in the United States. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 provides immunity to volunteers for nonprofit organizations or governmental entities, except for cases of willful or criminal conduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. Nonprofit organizations and governmental entities may still be held vicariously liable for the ordinary negligence of their volunteers. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 limits liability for noneconomic damages for volunteers working for nonprofit organizations and governmental entities, allowing punitive damages only in cases of willful misconduct. It preempts state laws unless they offer additional protection and allows states to opt out of the Act. The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 limits damages in rail accidents, allowing punitive damages only if there is clear evidence of conscious indifference to others' safety. The maximum allowable awards for all claims from a single incident is $200,000,000. The Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998 states that air carriers are not liable for damages related to obtaining medical assistance. The Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998 limits air carriers' liability for damages related to obtaining medical assistance during in-flight emergencies, protecting passengers and medically qualified individuals unless gross negligence or willful misconduct is involved. The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998 restricts products liability for biomaterials suppliers under state law, holding them liable only if they are the manufacturer of the implant. The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998 limits liability for biomaterials suppliers under state law, holding them liable only if they are the manufacturer of the implant, seller in limited situations, or supplier of raw materials that do not meet specifications. The Y2K Act limits tort liability under state law, including a cap on punitive damages. The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2000 includes provisions such as a cap on punitive damages, a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard for punitive damages, elimination of joint and several liability in certain cases, and a prohibition on damages for economic loss. It also provides Good Samaritan protections for the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2000 provides immunity from civil liability for individuals using automated external defibrillator devices in medical emergencies, with exceptions for misconduct or negligence by licensed health professionals or healthcare entities. This immunity supersedes state laws lacking similar protections. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act provides immunity for air carriers from civil liability for acts of terrorism between September 22, 2001, and December 31, 2008, up to $100 million, with the government responsible for amounts exceeding that. No punitive damages can be awarded against the air carrier or the government. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act provides immunity for air carriers from civil liability for acts of terrorism between September 22, 2001, and December 31, 2008, up to $100 million, with the government responsible for amounts exceeding that. No punitive damages can be awarded against an air carrier or the government under this statute. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act grants immunity to air carriers from civil liability for acts of terrorism between September 22, 2001, and December 31, 2008, up to $100 million. Victims can recover under the program or sue knowing participants in terrorist acts, with limitations on liability for air carriers, aircraft manufacturers, and others. The United States has a right of subrogation to recover payments made under the compensation program from liable parties. The United States has subrogation rights to recover payments made under the compensation program from liable parties. The final day to file a claim under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund was December 22, 2003. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Protection Act limits the liability of teachers in states that receive funds under the act. The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Protection Act limits teacher liability for ordinary negligence in disciplinary actions, but not for willful misconduct or harm caused while operating a vehicle. Punitive damages may not be awarded in cases where a teacher is held liable. Punitive damages may not be awarded in cases where a teacher is held liable unless clear and convincing evidence shows willful misconduct or conscious flagrant indifference. Joint and several liability does not apply to noneconomic damages. The Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002 grants federal district courts jurisdiction over civil actions with minimal diversity involving a single accident with at least 75 deaths. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes six tort liability provisions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes six tort liability provisions, limiting liability for various entities such as smallpox vaccine manufacturers, sellers of anti-terrorism technology under the SAFETY Act, air transportation security companies, air carriers, Federal flight deck officers, and manufacturers of vaccine components. One of these provisions, related to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, was repealed by P.L. 108-7, Division L, \u00a7 102. The SAFETY Act, P.L. 107-296, \u00a7 863, created a federal cause of action against sellers of anti-terrorism technologies. The SAFETY Act, P.L. 107-296, \u00a7 863, created a federal cause of action against sellers of anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising from acts of terrorism. This federal cause of action preempts state tort law and limits liability by prohibiting punitive damages, joint and several liability for noneconomic damages, and use of the collateral source rule. The technology must be approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 amended federal jurisdiction over class actions, with exclusive jurisdiction in federal district courts for cases exceeding $5 million. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005 prohibits civil actions except in specific circumstances. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-92) prohibits civil actions against firearm manufacturers or sellers for damages resulting from criminal misuse, with exceptions for violations of statutes or negligence. It also includes the Child Safety Lock Act of 2005, requiring secure gun storage devices on handguns for immunity against liability. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-148) provides immunity to individuals who use a handgun, similar to the immunity granted to gun manufacturers and sellers under P.L. 109-92. This act limits liability for pandemic flu and other public health countermeasures in the event of a public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Willful misconduct would still be subject to liability under a new federal cause of action. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 added a new fund for victims to accept payment instead of suing under state tort law. Section 227 of the Victims of Child Abuse Act requires reporting of child pornography violations to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 grants immunity to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and its personnel for reporting cyber tips, except in cases of intentional misconduct.
