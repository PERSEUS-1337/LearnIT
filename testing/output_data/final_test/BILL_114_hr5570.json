Congress finds that the public lands in the North Sand Hills Instant Study Area in Jackson County, Colorado have been adequately studied for wilderness designation. The Bureau of Land Management found in 1980 that the area did not meet wilderness criteria, and in 2011, Resolution 2011-01 supported the release of the area from further consideration for wilderness designation. The public lands in Dominguez Canyon and Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness Study Areas in Colorado have been adequately studied for wilderness designation, and the remaining acreage in these areas was excluded from wilderness designations. The purpose of this Act is to release certain Wilderness Study Areas from further consideration for wilderness designation.
