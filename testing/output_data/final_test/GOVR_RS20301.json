    "content": "In 2011, there were 552,640 U.S. teenagers who became pregnant, resulting in 329,772 births. Teen childbearing is linked to negative health and social outcomes for both mothers and children, including lower educational attainment, unemployment, poverty, rapid repeat pregnancies, and higher rates of infant mortality. Teenage pregnancy is associated with negative health and social outcomes for both mothers and children. The prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancies is a major goal in the U.S. despite a decline in teen birth rates. The number of births to U.S. females under age 20 has generally decreased since 1970. The teenage birth rate in the U.S. has significantly declined over the years, with a 65% decrease from 1970 to 2015. In 2015, there were 232,391 births to teens, with a rate of 22.3 per 1,000 women ages 15-19, the lowest recorded. The peak birth rate for U.S. teenagers was in 1957. In 2015, the teen birth rate for ages 15-19 was the lowest recorded, with a 64% decline from 1991. The birth rate for teens ages 15-17 was 9.9 per 1,000, down 74% from 1991, while for ages 18-19 it was 40.7 per 1,000, down nearly 57%. 89% of the 232,391 births to females under age 20 were to unmarried teenagers in 2015. Teen birth rates vary by state, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate at 10.6 births per 1,000 women in 2014. In 2014, Massachusetts had the lowest teen birth rate at 10.6 per 1,000 women (ages 15-19), while Arkansas had the highest at 39.5 per 1,000 women. Teen birth rates decreased or remained stable in all states from 2013 to 2014. After a decline from 1991 to 2005, the birth rate for teens aged 15-19 increased for white, black, and American Indian/Alaska Native women from 2005 to 2007. However, from 2007 to 2015, the rates decreased for all racial and ethnic groups, with significant drops for Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, black, and American Indian/Alaska Native teens. In 2015, birth rates for Hispanic, black, and American Indian/Alaska Native teens were higher than for white and Asian/Pacific Islander teens. Hispanic teens had a birth rate of 34.9 per 1,000, black teens 31.8 per 1,000, and American Indian/Alaska Native teens 25.7 per 1,000. White teens had a rate of 16.0 per 1,000, and Asian/Pacific Islander teens had the lowest rate at 6.9 per 1,000. There was also a decline in subsequent births among teens, with 17% in 2014 compared to 28% in 1951. Preventing teen pregnancy is a priority for policymakers and the public due to its economic impact. Teenage pregnancy is a priority for policymakers and the public due to its high economic, social, and health costs for teen parents and their families. Teen parents have lower education levels, higher poverty rates, and their children are more likely to have chronic medical conditions, struggle in school, engage in risky behaviors, and face unemployment or underemployment as young adults. Additionally, a significant percentage of teen girls drop out of high school due to pregnancy or parenthood, leading to a cycle of poverty and reliance on public benefits. Teen childbearing in the United States cost taxpayers about $9.4 billion in 2010, with most of the costs associated with negative consequences for the children of teen mothers. These costs include increased healthcare expenses, child welfare, incarceration, and lost tax revenue. Less than 25% of teen mothers receive child support payments, and children born to mothers under age 18 perform significantly worse on school readiness measures. The December 2013 study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy estimated that adolescent childbearing cost U.S. taxpayers about $9.4 billion per year in 2010. This cost includes child welfare benefits, public sector health care expenses, spending on incarceration, and lost tax revenue due to lower earnings of children of teen mothers. Research shows that teen mothers are less likely to complete high school and college, leading to reduced economic self-sufficiency. Children of teen parents are more likely to experience school problems, drop out of high school, and repeat the cycle of teenage pregnancy and poverty. The 2013 report highlighted the high costs associated with teen childbearing, estimating it at $9.4 billion per year. Teen birth rates have declined, but in 2015, a significant percentage of 9th to 12th graders reported having sexual intercourse. The use of contraception has decreased since 2004, and teen parenthood is linked to growing up without a father. The study on adolescent pregnancy in developed countries, particularly the United States, attributes high rates to poverty, lack of contraceptive services, and denial of sex education. Teen childbearing is seen as a result of social and economic issues, with some girls opting for non-marital motherhood due to limited opportunities for advancement. The decline in teen pregnancies from 1991-2005 is credited to increased contraceptive use, especially condoms, and abstinence campaigns targeting younger teens. In 2006 and 2007, the teen birth rate saw a small increase, interrupting the previous decline. Factors such as changes in the economy, attitudes, anxiety, schooling, public policy, and media messages are hypothesized to be responsible for this trend. Prevention fatigue and the need for new strategies to reach teens who have not been reached before have also been suggested. The decrease in teen births is attributed to the severe recession that began in 2008, leading teenagers to be more careful due to economic difficulties. Strong pregnancy prevention messages and increased contraception use among sexually active teenagers have contributed to the decline in birth rates. The recent decline in teen birth rates is attributed to various factors such as the recession, increased use of contraception methods, popular media influence, and access to information through technology. Researchers are still debating the extent to which these factors have contributed to the 46% reduction in teen births since 2007. The 1996 welfare reform law aimed to reduce nonmarital pregnancies and funded abstinence-only programs for teen pregnancy prevention. Despite recent declines in teen pregnancy rates, the US still has a higher teen birth rate compared to other industrialized countries. The U.S. teen birth rate is significantly higher than that of other industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Different approaches to teen pregnancy prevention, including abstinence-only education and comprehensive sex education, have been debated. The comprehensive approach to sex education provides youth with information and decision-making skills for realistic choices about sexual activities, including abstinence, setting relationship limits, using contraceptives, and preventing STDs. Advocates argue that abstinence-only messages offer no protection against pregnancy and disease for the 47.4% of high school students who have had sex. Teens breaking virginity pledges are less likely to use contraception than those who never made such promises. Efforts to promote abstinence and contraception among teens, especially females under 25, have increased due to high rates of sexually transmitted infections. A survey in 2012 showed strong support for messages advocating delaying sex until after high school and providing information on both abstinence and contraception. Parents and the American public support programs that educate teens on postponing sex and using birth control. The American public, including adults and teens, support encouraging teens to delay sexual activity and providing information about contraception. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius emphasized the importance of addressing teen pregnancy using evidence-based initiatives. The CDC views teen pregnancy prevention as a winnable battle, promoting interventions that encourage abstinence or delayed sexual activity. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program, created in 1981, focused on adolescents and was the first federal program to address issues of adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. It required all funding to be used directly on these issues. Grants were provided for projects offering care services, health, and sex education. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program, established in 1981, focused on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. It funded projects providing care services, health, sex education, and prevention services promoting abstinence. After 1998, prevention services focused solely on abstinence due to the Title V Abstinence Education block grant. The AFL program, established in 1981, focused on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. Congress mandated that AFL prevention grants adhere to an abstinence-only model. Research projects aimed to prevent adolescent pregnancies and understand their consequences. Abstinence education funding was discussed during the 1994-1996 welfare reform debate. During the welfare reform debate, funding for abstinence education was emphasized as equal to programs providing contraception information and services to teenagers. Advocates believed in promoting abstinence as the sole message against premarital sex, arguing that supporting both abstinence and birth control was contradictory. Advocates of abstinence education argue that promoting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical. They believe abstinence is the most effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancy and STDs. Federal programs funded abstinence education until FY2010. Until legislation passed in 2010, there was no federal funding exclusively for teen pregnancy prevention initiatives. Two programs established in the 111th Congress provide funding for evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention: the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program and the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP). Success in teen pregnancy prevention is now seen as not limited to either abstinence-only or contraception approaches. The Obama Administration supports evidence-based approaches in teen pregnancy prevention, using rigorous evaluation to determine program effectiveness. The Department of Health and Human Services has identified 37 evidence-based program models that delay sexual activity, increase condom use, and reduce teen pregnancy. Evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs aim to educate youth on abstinence and contraception to prevent teen pregnancy. These programs vary in their approach, with some focusing on delaying the first instance of sex while others seek to understand the root causes of teen pregnancy. Teen pregnancy prevention programs aim to address various factors contributing to teen pregnancy, such as lack of access to birth control, societal pressures, and limited job prospects. Some programs focus on preventing second or additional births to teens, recognizing the need for a different approach compared to preventing first births. Teen pregnancy prevention programs with mentoring, case management, home visits, and parenting classes have been effective in reducing subsequent childbearing by teens. Evidence-based programs share common characteristics like strong theoretical underpinning and rigorous evaluation methods. Evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs are effective in changing behavior, such as delaying sex and increasing contraceptive use. Results are published in peer-reviewed journals and include adequate sample sizes and appropriate statistical analyses. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy emphasizes the importance of these characteristics in program evaluation. Different programmatic approaches can be grounded in different theories of behavior change, and there is no single valid theory. Effectiveness of a program is an empirical question that needs to be tested by looking at the results. P.L. 111-117 provided funding for a new discretionary TPP program that aims to reduce teen pregnancy through \"medically accurate and age-appropriate\" programs. The TPP program, funded by P.L. 111-117, aims to reduce teen pregnancy through grants and contracts. Administered by the Office of Adolescent Health in HHS, eligible entities include nonprofit organizations, universities, hospitals, and more. $110 million was appropriated for FY2010, with $75 million for \"Tier 1\" grants and $25 million for \"Tier 2\" grants. The TPP program, funded by P.L. 111-117, aims to reduce teen pregnancy through grants and contracts. $25 million was allocated for \"Tier 2\" research and demonstration projects, and $10 million for training and program support. An additional $4.5 million was provided for evaluations of TPP program approaches. \"Tier 1\" grants are available for curriculum-based and youth development programs that focus on educating young people and reducing risky behaviors. Youth development programs incorporate various components like service learning and academic support. The TPP program aims to reduce teenage pregnancy through grants for evidence-based programs. Tier 1 grants replicate effective models, while Tier 2 grants fund research and innovative strategies. Funding for the program has ranged from $98.4 million to $110 million, with additional funds allocated for program evaluation. The TPP program funding varied from $4.5 million in FY2010 to $8.5 million in FY2012-2014, then decreased to $6.8 million in FY2015-2016. P.L. 113-76 allocated $101 million for FY2014, with $8.5 million for program evaluation. Funding for FY2015 remained at $101 million, with $6.8 million for evaluation. The TPP program received $101 million in funding for FY2015, with an additional $6.8 million for program evaluation. In FY2016, the program was funded at the same rate, with a slight across-the-board rescission. In FY2016, the TPP received $101 million in funding, along with $6.8 million for program evaluation. The TPP program received $101 million in funding for FY2015, with an additional $6.8 million for program evaluation. In FY2016, the program was funded at the same rate, with a slight across-the-board rescission. In FY2016, HHS awarded 81 new TPP program grants totaling $86 million to various organizations. P.L. 111-148 established a state formula grant program and appropriated $375 million over five years for the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) to prevent teen pregnancy and STDs through education on abstinence and contraception. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) receives funding through various acts, extending it through FY2017. PREP aims to educate youth on healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, and more. A total of 59 jurisdictions are eligible for PREP, with no state match required for funds. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) is funded through various acts and administered by the Administration on Children, Youth and Families' (ACYF) Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in HHS. PREP includes state formula grants, competitive grants, Tribal PREP, PREP\u2013Innovative Strategies (PREIS), and funding for training and evaluation. The majority of the funding goes to states/territories based on youth population. States/territories must outline how they will use the funding to achieve specific goals. The state's plan for using PREP formula grant funds focuses on achieving goals among high-risk youth populations, including those in foster care, homeless youth, and pregnant youth under 21. States that failed to submit applications in previous years were ineligible for funds, which were then awarded as competitive grants to local organizations for the same purpose. The PREP program provides grants to local organizations for educating adolescents on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. Recipients must participate in federal evaluations and replicate effective evidence-based programs to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. The PREP program provides grants for evidence-based programs aimed at reducing pregnancy and promoting safe sexual practices among youth. States must ensure their programs address abstinence, contraception, and adult preparation subjects. Tribal PREP grants support 16 projects annually. The PREP program supports 16 grantees to implement proven teen pregnancy prevention programs. $10 million is reserved annually for innovative youth pregnancy prevention strategies targeting high-risk youth populations. Grantees must conduct rigorous evaluations of their programs. The Title V Abstinence Education Block Grant provides federal funding for abstinence education programs, with $50 million per year allocated for five years starting in FY1998. The program is considered mandatory and funded through mandatory spending. Additionally, the HHS Secretary must reserve $6.5 million annually for research, training, and evaluation of programs funded by the grant. The Education program is a formula grant program funded by mandatory spending, based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. States must request funds when soliciting Title V Maternal and Child Health block grant funds. The law stipulates that abstinence education programs must exclusively teach the benefits of abstaining from sexual activity, promote abstinence outside of marriage, and emphasize the importance of abstinence in preventing pregnancy and STDs. The Title V Abstinence Education program teaches the importance of abstinence in preventing health problems, promotes monogamous relationships within marriage, warns against sexual activity outside of marriage, and emphasizes the harmful consequences of bearing children out-of-wedlock. It also educates on rejecting sexual advances, avoiding alcohol and drug use, and the importance of self-sufficiency before engaging in sex. The program must be used exclusively for teaching abstinence, be medically accurate, and requires a state match of federal funds. The Title V Abstinence Education program receives federal and state funding totaling $87.5 million annually. Funding was reauthorized through various acts, with the block grant amount increasing to $75 million per year. The Title V Abstinence Education program received increased funding of $75 million per year for FY2016 and FY2017. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program, enacted in 1981, is administered by the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy programs in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and has care and prevention components. The AFL program supports care demonstration projects to develop interventions for pregnant and parenting teens, providing services like pre- and post-natal care, nutrition counseling, and vocational services. The program aims to ameliorate the effects of early childbearing for teen parents and their families. The AFL program primarily focused on prevention services for pre-teens, teens, and their families to promote abstinence from premarital sexual relations. Projects aimed to encourage adolescents to postpone sexual activity and reduce risks for teenage pregnancy and STDs through abstinence-only education. The target age group was 9 to 14 in public schools, community settings, or family environments. The AFL program targeted students aged 9 to 14 in public schools, community settings, or family households, emphasizing abstinence education. Nonprofit organizations could apply for grants lasting up to five years, with annual reapplications required. Projects had to include independent evaluations and received funding ranging from $9.0 million to $13.1 million until FY2009. Funding for prevention ended in FY2009, with a $16.7 million appropriation for the care component in FY2010. The AFL program received $16.7 million in FY2010 and $12.4 million in FY2011, with funding not allocated for prevention services. Abstinence-only education funding was provided through the CBAE program until FY2009, with $20 million appropriated in P.L. 106-246. The CBAE program received funding for abstinence education from FY2001 to FY2009, starting at $20 million and increasing to $108.9 million in FY2008 before dropping to $94.7 million in FY2009. No funding has been allocated to CBAE since FY2009, with additional $5 million grants provided in FY2012 to FY2015. The recent laws, P.L. 113-235 / P.L. 113-164, P.L. 113-76, P.L. 113-6, and P.L. 112-74, provided funding ranging from $4.7 million to $5 million for competitive grants for abstinence-only education from FY2012 to FY2015. P.L. 114-113 allocated $10 million for competitive grants in FY2016. The Act of 2016 allocated $10 million for competitive grants for sexual risk avoidance education in FY2016. The funding continued in FY2017 at the same rate with a slight reduction, as per P.L. 114-223. While other federally funded programs may provide pregnancy prevention information and contraception services, they are not required by law to do so. While federally funded programs may offer pregnancy prevention information and contraception services, they are not obligated to allocate funds specifically for teenagers. These programs primarily target adult women and do not track expenditures for services provided to teens. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is collaborating with the federal Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health to reduce teenage pregnancy as part of President Obama's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative. The federal Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health is partnering with the CDC to reduce teenage pregnancy rates, focusing on African American and Latino/Hispanic youth aged 15-19. The CDC's Division of Adolescent and School Health aims to prevent unintended pregnancies among children, teens, and young adults. Effective teen pregnancy prevention programs aim to convince teens to delay sexual activity and use contraception consistently. These programs should be led by trained individuals, engage participants, address peer pressure, teach communication skills, and be tailored to the age, sexual experience, and culture of young individuals. Effective teen pregnancy prevention programs are developed in cooperation with teens and experts, clarify values, develop coping skills, provide accurate information, have clear goals, focus on specific health behaviors, address psychological factors, use trained educators, and offer ongoing support. The Office of Adolescent Health coordinates health programs and initiatives, supports projects to improve adolescent health, collects and disseminates information, and collaborates with other agencies for evidence-based approaches. The Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) provides a list of 41 evidence-based programs for adolescent health, including curriculum-based and clinic-based initiatives targeting various populations. These programs focus on abstinence, contraceptive use, and responsible behaviors to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. The approach is based on proven effectiveness in improving adolescent health outcomes. The Office of Adolescent Health provides a list of 41 evidence-based programs for adolescent health, including abstinence-only education programs. Prior beliefs about the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only approach were challenged by studies showing positive results. A study on African American students found positive outcomes with abstinence-only intervention compared to other interventions and a control group. The study used a health promotion intervention to improve healthy behaviors unrelated to sexual behavior. Only 34% of students in the abstinence-only intervention reported engaging in sexual intercourse, compared to 49% in the control group. There was no significant difference in consistent condom use between the two groups. The interventions did not have a significant effect on consistent condom use. The teen pregnancy prevention field has seen growth in program evaluation, with evidence showing effective activities in reducing teen pregnancy and STIs. There is a push to fund high-impact programs proven through rigorous trials for societal benefit. Identifying successful programs is crucial, but implementation is also important. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention programs aim to replicate evidence-based programs and implement innovative strategies to prevent teen pregnancy and STIs. Funding is provided for evaluation to build the evidence base for effective prevention methods. OAH supports evaluation activities for 41 TPP grantees to assess program effectiveness. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) grantees are conducting independent evaluations of their programs, with 19 grantees focusing on replicating evidence-based programs and 22 grantees evaluating new and innovative prevention programs. OAH funds federal evaluations on teen pregnancy prevention. A special supplement released by the Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) reports on findings from the TPP Program, highlighting results from studies on effective prevention methods. The journal supplement highlights findings from a subset of grantees of the OAH Teen Pregnancy Program's 41 studies. Editorials discuss the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program and lessons learned. The evaluation of the PREP program will help the federal government and local service providers learn about program outcomes. The Administration for Children and Families contracted with Mathematica Policy Research to assess the replication effort of PREP programs nationwide. The evaluation will study PREP programs nationwide, collecting data from all grantees, and will also conduct an in-depth examination of a few selected PREP sites."
