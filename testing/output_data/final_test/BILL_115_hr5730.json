    "content": "The Act titled \"Transportation Security Technology Innovation Reform Act of 2018\" defines key terms and establishes the Transportation Systems Integration Facility. The Transportation Security Administration Systems Integration Facility (TSIF) is established for testing and evaluating advanced transportation security screening technologies. It aims to enhance security through screening, threat mitigation, and detection, support mission needs, provide test plans to manufacturers, and collaborate with other technical facilities. The TSIF is established to test and evaluate advanced transportation security screening technologies, enhance security, prevent delays in testing processes, and promote participation by small businesses with advanced technology capabilities. The TSIF is responsible for testing and evaluating advanced transportation security screening technologies, ensuring timely certification, and collaborating with technology stakeholders to address security gaps in transportation. The Administrator must notify congressional committees if testing exceeds 180 days from the date of technology turnover for evaluation. The Administrator must notify congressional committees about the arrival date, reasons for delays, and estimated completion time of advanced transportation security screening technology testing. Failed technology may be retested. The Administrator's authority does not impact other department or agency responsibilities for research and evaluation. The Undersecretary for Science and Technology and the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have specific authorities and responsibilities within the Department. SEC. 4. REVIEW OF TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITIONS PROCESS. The Administrator must review existing transportation security technology practices within the Administration, identifying process delays, leveraging Department resources for innovation, and promoting competition among technology stakeholders. The Administrator will review transportation security technology practices, identify process delays, leverage resources for innovation, promote competition among stakeholders, increase funding for small businesses, identify best practices, and address problems and challenges. A briefing will be provided to congressional committees on the findings and plan to address issues identified in the review. The Administrator will engage with transportation stakeholders to foster innovation in advanced security screening technologies, streamline technology development processes, and ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The Secretary of Homeland Security, with input from the Chief Privacy Officer, must provide a compliance assessment to Congress on the Transportation Security Administration's acquisition process for screening technologies' health and safety risks."
