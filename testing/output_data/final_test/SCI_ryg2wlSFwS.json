    "content": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) present challenges due to sparsity, irregularity, and high-dimensionality, hindering reliable downstream outcomes. Existing imputation methods often overlook correlated features, temporal dynamics, and uncertainty. To address this, a novel variational-recurrent imputation network (V-RIN) is proposed, integrating imputation and prediction networks while considering these factors to improve missing values estimates. The study proposes a deep generative model and recurrent imputation network to estimate missing values in Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. The model is validated using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. EHR data poses challenges like high-dimensionality, temporality, sparsity, irregularity, and bias. Medical events are often recorded irregularly with missing values, leading to potential bias in downstream analysis. Complete-case analysis may overlook important data, so imputation methods are used to improve clinical outcome predictions. Imputation methods are used to improve clinical outcome predictions by filling in missing values. Brick & Kalton classified methods as deterministic or stochastic, with stochastic methods generating samples based on data distribution. Imputation models for multivariate time series should consider temporal relations, correlations across variables, and offer a probabilistic interpretation for uncertainty estimation. Deep learning models are now being used to address these conditions. Deep learning models like VAEs and GANs generate data points for incomplete data, but lack uncertainty estimation. Additional approaches like Gaussian process or RNNs are needed for estimating missing values in multivariate time series due to ignoring temporal relations. Deep learning models like VAEs and GANs lack uncertainty estimation for incomplete data. RNNs, such as GRU-D and BRITS, address missing values in multivariate time series by considering temporal relations and feature correlation. However, they do not account for uncertainty in estimating missing values, which can impact task performance. In this work, the primary task is predicting in-hospital mortality on EHR data. Due to sparse and irregularly-sampled data, an imputation model is devised as a major concern. A novel variational-recurrent imputation network (V-RIN) is proposed to handle multivariate time series EHR data, capturing correlations among variables and temporal relations. The model uses a VAE inference network to capture data distribution, a generative network for imputation estimates, and integrates temporal and feature correlations. The study introduces a novel uncertainty-aware GRU in a recurrent imputation network to predict mortality using EHR data. The model combines deep generative models with feature and temporal correlations to estimate missing values and improve prediction accuracy. Training the imputation and prediction networks jointly in an end-to-end manner resulted in superior performance compared to other methods on real-world EHR data. Imputation strategies using statistics, machine learning, and deep learning methods were devised to address sparse high-dimensional time series data in EHR. Various methods like mean filling, EM algorithm, KNN, PCA, and MICE were proposed to consider feature relationships for better imputation. Deep learning-based imputation models, such as VAEs and GP-VAE, have been proposed to address temporal relations in time series modeling. While VAEs leverage the distribution and correlations of features in the latent space, GP-VAE incorporates Gaussian processes to model temporal dynamics. However, these models focus primarily on imputation tasks and may require separate models for downstream outcomes. Additionally, RNNs-based imputation models have been proposed for time series data. The RNNs-based imputation models, including GRU-D, GRU-I, BRITS, and M-RNN, were proposed to handle time series data by considering temporal dynamics and missing patterns. These models enhanced accuracy by estimating missing values in both forward and backward directions. However, the proposed model in the current text chunk differs by integrating uncertainty for imputation. The proposed model integrates imputation and prediction networks jointly, modeling feature and temporal relations using deep generative and recurrent networks. It introduces imputation fidelity as uncertainty to improve estimates, penalizing unreliable ones. The architecture includes imputation and prediction networks, with the imputation network based on VAEs for capturing latent data distribution. The VAEs capture latent data distribution using an inference network, while the generative network estimates reconstructed data distribution. Imputation estimates are based on mean and uncertainty on variance for reliable prediction outcomes. Recurrent imputation networks utilize RNNs to model temporal dynamics and regression layers for feature correlation in imputing missing values. By unifying VAEs and RNNs, the model considers feature correlations, temporal relations, and uncertainty for more accurate estimates. The multivariate time series EHR data of N patients includes clinical observations and labels for in-hospital mortality. A masking matrix is used to address missing values, and a new data representation is defined. The time gap between observed values is considered important for information. The time gap between observed values is crucial information. A time delay matrix \u2206 is introduced, derived from timestamps of measurements. The latent representation z is inferred from observations x t using an inference network. The marginal likelihood p \u03b8 (x t ) is defined as p \u03b8 (x t |z)p \u03b8 (z)dz, approximated with q \u03c6 (z|x t ) as a Gaussian distribution N (\u00b5 z , \u03c3 2 z ). The latent representation z is inferred from observations x t using an inference network with a Gaussian distribution N (\u00b5 z , \u03c3 2 z ). The reparameterization trick is applied to z = \u00b5 z + \u03c3 z z, allowing for differentiation and training. The generative network estimates p \u03b8 (x t |z) with mean \u00b5 x and variance \u03c3 2 x. Another reparameterization trick is applied to x t = \u00b5 x + \u03c3 x x. The reconstructed data is regarded as estimates for missing values while observed values are maintained. The uncertainty matrix quantifies fidelity scores of missing value estimates in the VAE-based imputation network. Imputed values {X,\u016a} and uncertainties are obtained. A modified GRU cell incorporates uncertainty in the recurrent imputation process. The imputed data's temporal relations are modeled, exploiting uncertainties using a uncertainty-aware GRU cell. The uncertainty decay factor is calculated at each time step to emphasize reliable estimates and penalize uncertain ones. The hidden state h is obtained from the GRU, compiling comprehensive information from preceding sequences to produce current observation estimates. The imputed data's temporal relations are modeled using a regression equation to produce current observation estimates. Imputed values are obtained based on features correlations and temporal relations, then merged to create a combined vector. A temporal decay factor is introduced to control the influence of past observations on hidden states. The complete vector is obtained by replacing missing values with combined estimates and fed into an uncertainty-aware GRU cell. The uncertainty-aware GRU cell is utilized to predict in-hospital mortality as the clinical outcome. Learnable parameters in the recurrent imputation network are specified, and a composite loss function is defined to tune all model parameters jointly. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are used to maximize the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) with 1-regularization to introduce sparsity. The difference between observed data and imputation estimates is measured by the mean absolute. The study utilizes an uncertainty-aware GRU cell to predict in-hospital mortality. A composite loss function is defined to tune all model parameters jointly, with VAEs used for sparsity. The model is evaluated on a real-world EHR dataset, PhysioNet 2012 Challenge, with 35 clinical variables from nearly 4,000 patients in the ICU. Three patients with no observations were excluded. Stochastic gradient descent is used for optimization during training. The study excluded three patients with no observations and sampled hourly data with high missing rates. In-hospital mortality was predicted using VAEs with imbalanced labels. The model architecture included feedforward and generative networks with ReLU activation, and a modified GRU for imputation. Training involved Adam optimizer with specific parameters. The study utilized VAEs for in-hospital mortality prediction with imbalanced labels. They compared their model's performance with state-of-the-art models like M-RNN, GRU-I, and BRITS. The study compared VAEs for in-hospital mortality prediction with models like M-RNN, GRU-I, and BRITS. BRITS utilized bi-directional dynamics for estimating missing values based on feature and temporal correlations. Variants include BRITS-I, RITS, and RITS-I. V-RIN, based on a proposed model, ignored uncertainty. V-RIN-full included feature-based correlations, temporal relations, and uncertainty to reduce estimate bias. The hyperparameters {\u03b1, \u03b2} were used for imputation in V-RIN and V-RIN-full models for in-hospital mortality prediction. Performance was optimized by balancing imputation between feature and temporal relations. Both models achieved high AUC scores, with V-RIN peaking at {\u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.75} and V-RIN-full at {\u03b1 = 0.01, \u03b2 = 0.5}. Emphasizing temporal relations over feature correlations led to improved performance, but increasing \u03b2 degraded performance. The performance of various models for in-hospital mortality prediction was compared, showing that balancing imputation between feature and temporal relations is crucial. Increasing the \u03b2 parameter degraded performance, highlighting the importance of both features and temporal aspects in estimating missing values. The study compared different models for in-hospital mortality prediction, emphasizing the importance of balancing imputation between feature and temporal relations. By integrating VAEs with RNNs and incorporating temporal decay and uncertainty, significant performance improvements were observed in terms of AUC and AUPRC. The inclusion of uncertainty in the imputation network of V-RIN-full led to a notable enhancement in predictive accuracy. The experimental results of in-hospital mortality prediction were presented, comparing the V-RIN model with other methods in terms of AUC, AUPRC, and balanced accuracy. V-RIN showed better performance in AUC and balanced accuracy but was slightly comparable to BRITS in AUPRC. BRITS-I and BRITS utilized bidirectional dynamics for estimating missing values, achieving higher performance. M-RNN struggled with bidirectional dynamics, while V-RIN is related to GRU-D, GRU-I, RITS-I, and RITS in exploiting temporal decay. The V-RIN model outperformed GRU-D, GRU-I, RITS-I, and RITS in estimating missing values using deep generative models. It achieved the highest overall performance results, especially in handling imbalance issues. The utilization of uncertainty proved beneficial, leading to reliable downstream tasks and surpassing all comparative models. In this paper, a novel unified framework combining imputation and prediction networks for sparse high-dimensional multivariate time series was proposed. The model, utilizing deep generative and recurrent models, captured feature correlations and temporal relations to estimate missing values and incorporate uncertainty for clinical outcome prediction. Evaluation on PhysioNet 2012 Challenge dataset showed superior performance in mortality prediction compared to state-of-the-art models."
