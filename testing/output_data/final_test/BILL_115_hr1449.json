    "content": "The Act titled \"Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017\" requires a report on the designation of Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism. Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, al-Qaeda leaders and the Afghan Taliban fled Afghanistan to Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) facilitated al-Qaeda's movement of fighters to and from Afghanistan and provided support to foreign terrorist organizations. Admiral Mike Mullen testified in 2011 about Pakistan's involvement in aiding these groups. The Haqqani Network, supported by Pakistan's ISI, conducted attacks against US interests in Afghanistan, including the 2011 Embassy attack. Osama bin Laden was found and killed in Abbottabad in 2011, leading to Pakistan condemning the raid and imprisoning Dr. Shakil Afridi. A 2012 NATO report highlighted the Afghan Taliban's activities. The 2012 NATO report revealed that the Afghan Taliban receives direct assistance from Pakistani security services, with Pakistan manipulating the Taliban leadership. The report also mentioned the presence of senior Taliban leaders in close proximity to ISI headquarters in Islamabad. Mullah Akhtar Mansour, the leader of the Afghan Taliban, was killed in a US drone strike in southwestern Pakistan in 2016. The Afghan Taliban's top leadership is based in Quetta, Baluchistan Province. The 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism criticized Pakistan for not taking substantial action against the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, Laskar-e-Tayyiba, and Jaish-e-Mohammad. The Secretary of Defense has been unable to certify Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani Network as required by law. Pakistan has not shown commitment to prevent the Haqqani Network from using North Waziristan as a safe haven or in arresting and prosecuting its leaders. The President must submit a report within 90 days to determine Pakistan's actions against terrorism. The Government of Pakistan, including its agents, committed, conspired, or aided acts of international terrorism. If confirmed by the Secretary of State, further actions will be taken. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of determining whether Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism or providing a detailed justification if the conduct does not meet the criteria. Reports must be unclassified but may include a classified annex if necessary. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
