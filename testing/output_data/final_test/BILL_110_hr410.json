    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Physician Shortage Elimination Act of 2007\". The average life expectancy in the United States has increased to 80 years, leading to a higher demand for medical care. In 1975, US medical schools graduated around 12,716 physicians, with half being US graduates and the other half foreign graduates under the J-1 Visa Program. Currently, there are approximately 39,109 applicants, both foreign and domestic, seeking admission to US medical schools. Over the last 20 years, tuition and fees at medical schools have significantly increased. The Association of American Medical Colleges called for an increase in National Health Service Corps program awards to address rising medical student debt and meet the need for physicians in underserved areas. The program has successfully supplied physicians to rural and inner city communities, and its continued expansion is recommended. The growing debt of medical students may lead to more graduates applying for National Health Service Corps program funding. A significant number of physicians are nearing retirement age, leading to a projected shortage of physicians by 2020. The Council on Graduate Medical Education predicts a shortage of at least 90,000 full-time physicians by 2020. The declining number of family physicians may result in shortages of safety net and rural physicians, impacting access to healthcare. Recruiting qualified medical students from underserved areas is becoming more challenging, affecting community health centers' ability to attract personnel. The National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program and Loan Repayment Program is reauthorized with an increase in appropriations to $300,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. $30,000,000 will be allocated for scholarships for medical students pursuing degrees in medicine or osteopathic medicine. SEC. 4. REAUTHORIZATION OF PROGRAMS PROVIDING GRANTS FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS TRAINING FOR DIVERSITY. Grants for Centers of Excellence and Educational Assistance for Individuals From Disadvantaged Backgrounds are amended to receive increased funding for fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\nSEC. 5. EXPANSION OF RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES OFFERED BY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. Part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include provisions for expanding residency training programs and primary care services at community health centers. \"SEC. 749. GRANTS TO EXPAND MEDICAL RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS AT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS.\" The Secretary may grant funds to community health centers for establishing new medical residency training programs or expanding existing ones.
