    "title": "SB 634",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 94858 of the Education Code is amended to define a \"private postsecondary educational institution\" as a private entity in California offering postsecondary education for a charge. Additionally, Chapter 1.2 is added to establish the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement. Chapter 1.2 introduces the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, aiming to protect California students in distance education programs across state borders and promote quality online education. It allows California colleges to participate in interstate reciprocity agreements, such as the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, enabling institutions to offer distance education in all states and territories. In Chapter 1.2, the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement allows California colleges to participate in interstate agreements for distance education. Terms defined include accreditation by recognized agencies, the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, participating postsecondary institutions, and accredited postsecondary institutions in the state. The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement allows California colleges to participate in interstate agreements for distance education. The Department of Consumer Affairs may enter into a regional state authorization reciprocity agreement with other states through a compact on behalf of this state. Educational institutions exempt from the California Private Postsecondary Act of 2009 may participate in the agreement without impacting their exempt status. The Bureau will establish a memorandum of understanding with key educational institutions in California for the state authorization reciprocity agreement. A reasonable fee may be set for participating postsecondary institutions to cover administrative expenses. The Governor is authorized to enter into an interstate reciprocity agreement for oversight of postsecondary educational institutions without a physical presence in the state, ensuring similar consumer protection as regulated institutions by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education."
