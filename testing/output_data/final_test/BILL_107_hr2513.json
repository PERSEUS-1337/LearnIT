Congress finds that access to prescription drugs is crucial for all Americans, especially low-income individuals who struggle to afford their medications, leading to skipping doses or splitting pills. This financial burden may force them to prioritize drug costs over other essential expenses. Medicaid aims to provide medical assistance to families with dependent children and the elderly, aligning with the Act's objective. Every State has elected to provide prescription drugs as a benefit under the Medicaid program to increase access for low-income individuals. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to approve projects promoting Medicaid objectives. Medicaid demonstration projects, approved under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, waive certain state plan requirements to promote program objectives. Maine and Vermont have implemented projects to increase access to prescription drugs for low-income individuals with approval from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Resources implemented demonstration projects to expand access to prescription drugs under the Medicaid program, benefiting thousands of individuals without other prescription drug insurance. Terminating these projects early could waste public funds and harm those who rely on them. The Secretary of Health and Human Resources has the authority to clarify the treatment of certain payments in approved demonstration projects under SEC. 3.

This involves rebate agreements under section 1927, ensuring expenditures align with Medicaid program objectives, considering payments as medical assistance for prescribed drugs, and exempting certain charges for project participants from section 1916 requirements.

It takes effect on the date of enactment and includes payments made before or after that date."
