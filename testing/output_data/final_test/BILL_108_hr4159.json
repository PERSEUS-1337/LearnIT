    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drug Impaired Driving Research and Prevention Act\". Congress acknowledges the significant problem of driving under the influence of illegal drugs, with over 35 million people in the US using illegal drugs in 2002. Research shows that drug abuse impairs driving performance, and approximately 10 to 22 percent of drivers involved in crashes use illegal drugs. Drug impaired drivers are involved in all motor vehicle crashes; they are less frequently detected and prosecuted compared to drunk drivers. There is inconsistency among states in handling drug impaired drivers, with a lack of trained police officers and prosecutors. Per se drug impaired driving laws are seen as a viable strategy for prosecuting offenders. Driving under the influence of drugs is illegal in all states, similar to alcohol. While driving under the influence of alcohol is consistently addressed by states, there is no uniform method for identifying drug impairment or the presence of drugs in the body. The purposes of this Act are to provide a model for States to implement drug impaired driving statutes, identify and assist drivers in need of drug education or treatment, advance research on drugged driving, and enhance training for law enforcement to enforce drug impaired driving laws. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefinitions for controlled substance, inhalant, and drug recognition expert are provided in this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. MODEL STATUTE. The Secretary will develop a model statute for drug impaired driving within one year of the Act's enactment. The statute will define drug impaired driving as operating a vehicle with any detectable amount of a controlled substance in the body or due to the presence of a controlled substance in combination with alcohol or an inhalant. The model statute for drug impaired driving, developed by the Secretary, may include sanctions for refusing a controlled substance test and an affirmative defense for lawful use of prescribed substances. The model statute for drug impaired driving may include penalties for repeat offenses, authorization for license suspension upon conviction, and consecutive imprisonment for drug impaired driving offenses. An appropriate system of evaluation, counseling, treatment, and supervision for persons convicted of drug impaired driving. Research and development in the field of drug detection technology, testing technology improvement, determining impairment levels for controlled substances, and collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for research. Goals for training are also outlined. SEC. 7. GOALS FOR TRAINING. The Secretary shall establish programs to enhance police and prosecutor training for drug impaired driving laws enforcement and ensure training programs exist in all 50 States and the District of Columbia by December 31, 2006. The Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is responsible for advising and coordinating with other Federal agencies on addressing driving under the influence of illegal drugs, as well as conducting research on prevention, detection, and prosecution of this issue. SEC. 9. REPORTS.\n\nThe Secretary must provide Congress with a report on the progress of implementing the Act, including updates on drug impaired driving laws, new research, the extent of the issue in each State, and recommendations for addressing it.\n\nSEC. 10. FUNDING. SEC. 10. FUNDING.\n\nThe Secretary will allocate a minimum of $1,200,000 per fiscal year from funds appropriated for section 403 of title 23, US Code, for drug impaired driving traffic safety programs from 2004 to 2009."
