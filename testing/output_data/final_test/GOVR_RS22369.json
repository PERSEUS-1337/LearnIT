    "content": "The DRA continues the TANF block grant created in the 1996 welfare reform law through FY2010. TANF funding levels, rules, and program requirements remain mostly unchanged. Exceptions include the discontinuation of supplemental grants to 17 states after FY2008 and the repeal of $300 million in TANF bonuses to states. The DRA also introduces new grants for promoting healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. Changes to TANF work participation require states to engage more of their caseloads in activities or reduce cash assistance caseloads from FY2005 levels. Under the TANF program, states must meet minimum work participation standards or face penalties. These standards require a percentage of families receiving assistance to be engaged in specified activities for a minimum number of hours. States must meet two standards annually: 50% of families with an adult recipient must have a work participant, and 90% of two-parent families must meet participation rules. The 1996 welfare reform law included a caseload reduction credit, reducing standards for caseload declines since FY1995. The federal welfare reform law in FY1995 led to significant declines in cash assistance caseloads for many states. Caseload reduction credits were given to states, lowering their effective TANF work participation standards below 50%. The DRA revised the credits so that states will only receive credit for future caseload reductions starting from FY2005. The TANF program, created in 1996, requires states to meet a maintenance of effort requirement by spending at least 75% of what they had spent in FY1994. Caseload reduction credits under the DRA will be based on declines from FY2005 onwards, excluding changes due to eligibility adjustments. The 1996 TANF program allows states to have separate state programs (SSPs) for certain activities like assisting two-parent families and special populations. The DRA now requires states to include families in SSPs when calculating work participation rates, impacting the 90% standard for two-parent families. The DRA requires states to include families in separate state programs when calculating work participation rates, impacting the 90% standard for two-parent families. HHS regulations define TANF work activities and aim to ensure consistent measurement of work participation rates. The HHS regulations issued in 2006 define work activities for TANF participation rates, including job readiness activities like substance abuse counseling. States must verify recipients' work participation and have procedures in place to identify who is subject to work standards. HHS regulations require states to submit work verification plans detailing how recipients' activities are counted as TANF work activities. The 1996 welfare reform law excludes child-only TANF families from work participation calculations, and the DRA specifies which families with parent caretakers should be included. Immigrant parents ineligible for assistance are excluded from the participation rate, with states making case-by-case determinations for parent recipients. The regulations specify which families with parent caretakers should be included in the work participation rate, with a focus on parents removed from the assistance unit due to time limits or sanctions. Non-recipient, non-parent caretakers are exempt from work participation standards, and states can exclude parents caring for disabled family members from the participation rate calculation. Mandatory child care funding has increased from $2.717 billion to $2.917 billion per year from FY2006 through FY2010 under the DRA. The DRA establishes new categorical grants within TANF for healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood initiatives, funded at approximately $100 million per year. Activities include research projects, grants awarded by the Secretary of HHS, and technical assistance to states and other entities. The DRA establishes grants for healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood initiatives, with activities including education on marriage value, social skills, and conflict resolution. Participation in these activities is voluntary, with a focus on addressing domestic violence concerns. Up to $50 million per year is available for responsible fatherhood initiatives through competitive grants. The DRA establishes grants for responsible fatherhood initiatives, including promoting marriage, teaching parenting skills, supporting employment services, and developing media campaigns. These initiatives receive funding from HHS and target states, territories, Indian tribes, community organizations, and religious organizations."
