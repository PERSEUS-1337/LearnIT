Walker, warned of potential cost overruns, estimating the CVC's price tag to increase to between $552 million and $559 million. Walker noted that delays and cost increases were largely outside of AOC's control. The GAO's analysis highlighted weaknesses in AOC's schedule and contract management, leading to delays and cost overruns in the Capitol Visitor Center project.
