Child labor is defined as performing services in exchange for remuneration, subsistence, goods, or services, or under circumstances similar to involuntary servitude by individuals below the minimum age, except for light work by those no more than 2 years younger than the minimum age that is not harmful to their health or development. Child labor exemptions include work on family agricultural holdings for local consumption, work in schools for education, and work as part of an educational program for persons at least 14 years old. Child labor exemptions also apply to artistic performances authorized by the country's competent authority, with restrictions for individuals under 18 to protect their health, safety, and morals. The term \"minimum age\" refers to the age at which children complete compulsory schooling or reach the age of 15, whichever is older. In certain circumstances, a country may specify a minimum age of 14 for a limited duration. This is to ensure that individuals involved in work activities are adequately protected and have received proper training. The term \"entry\" in the context of child labor refers to the entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption in the United States. An article is considered to be manufactured with child labor if it was fabricated, assembled, or processed with child labor. The United States authorizes appropriations for contributions to international organizations addressing child labor, including the International Labor Organization and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
