    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 467.5 of the Vehicle Code in California is amended to define a \"pedicab\" as a bicycle with three or more wheels that can transport passengers for hire, including those with trailers or sidecars. It also includes four-wheeled pedal-powered devices with a seating capacity of eight or more passengers, limited to 15 miles per hour. Article 4.5 of the Vehicle Code in California introduces regulations for the operation of pedicabs. Pedicabs must have a seating capacity for up to 15 passengers, be authorized by local ordinance, and operated by someone at least 21 years old with a valid California driver's license. The pedicab must have seatbelts, seat backs, brakes, reflectors, headlights, and grab rails. It needs to be inspected annually for compliance with these requirements. The operator must have one million dollars general liability insurance and an additional five hundred thousand dollars general umbrella insurance. Additional proof of financial responsibility may be required by the local jurisdiction. Pedicabs must be authorized to operate on local highways, report accidents annually, avoid loading/unloading on roadways, and stay close to the right-hand curb while operating. If alcoholic beverages are consumed on board a pedicab defined in subdivision (c) of Section 467.5, it must comply with local ordinances, have a safety monitor present, and ensure the monitor is sober while passengers drink. Both the operator and safety monitor of a pedicab must complete alcohol and drug education training. Alcoholic beverages can only be supplied by passengers in sealed containers labeled according to regulations. Alcoholic beverages can be consumed by passengers on a pedicab only while on board. Passengers must be 21 or older if alcohol is consumed. No license is needed for the operator or safety monitor as long as they do not sell alcohol. The section will be in effect until January 1, 2020. The article allows local authorities to impose stricter requirements on pedicabs. Section 23229 of the Vehicle Code is amended to exempt passengers in buses, taxicabs, limousines, and pedicabs from certain regulations. No reimbursement required by this act under California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
