    "content": "The Civil Service Retirement Act of 1920 established a pension system for federal employees, including Congress. The law was initially repealed due to public opinion but was reinstated in 1946 with higher contributions and benefits for Congress members. The Special Committee on the Organization of Congress believed that a retirement plan for Congress would promote independence and bring in younger members with fresh perspectives on national issues. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 required federal employees hired in 1984 or later and all Members of Congress to participate in Social Security. This led to the development of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, establishing the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) in 1987. The Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) was established in 1987 under the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335). Employees hired in 1984 or later were automatically enrolled in FERS, while those hired before 1984 had the option to remain in CSRS without Social Security coverage or switch to FERS. Members of Congress elected in 1984 or later were required to participate in Social Security, with options to enroll in FERS or remain in CSRS with Social Security coverage. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) made significant changes to the retirement benefits of Members of Congress covered by FERS after December 31, 2012. This included decreasing the FERS benefit accrual rate and adjusting the retirement age and years of service requirements. Members of Congress and congressional staff paid a higher percentage of salary for their retirement benefits before P.L. 112-96 was enacted. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) decreased the FERS benefit accrual rate and increased employee contributions for Members of Congress covered by FERS after December 31, 2012. Newly covered Members are required to contribute 3.1% of pay to FERS. Subsequent legislation further increased employee contributions for all individuals, including Members of Congress. Members of Congress and federal employees covered by FERS after December 31, 2013, are required to contribute 4.4% of pay to FERS. This contribution rate is the same for all individuals covered by FERS, regardless of their employment status. Members of Congress elected after December 31, 2012, still have earlier retirement eligibility under FERS. As of October 1, 2016, there were 611 retired Members of Congress receiving federal pensions, with 335 under CSRS and 276 under FERS. Those under CSRS had an average annuity of $74,028 after 23.5 years of service, while those under FERS had an average annuity of $41,076 after 15.8 years. The average age of retired Members was 76 for CSRS and 73 for FERS. Members elected before 1984 may have Dual Coverage or CSRS Offset retirement plans. Coverage options for federal employees include full coverage by both CSRS and Social Security, CSRS Offset which reduces CSRS contributions and benefits by the amount of Social Security contributions and benefits, FERS which includes the FERS basic annuity, Social Security, and the Thrift Savings Plan, and Social Security Only if the Member declines other coverage. Members of Congress elected before 1984 may have Dual Coverage or CSRS Offset retirement plans. Members had the opportunity to switch from CSRS to FERS during open seasons in 1987 and 1998, with a low percentage of eligible employees switching in both years. Members elected in 1984 or later are automatically covered by FERS. Members of Congress elected before 1984 may have Dual Coverage or CSRS Offset retirement plans, while those elected in 1984 or later are automatically covered by FERS. FERS consists of Social Security, the FERS basic annuity, and the Thrift Savings Plan, with the option for additional contributions. Senators and Representatives serving before September 30, 2003, can decline coverage, but those entering office after that date are required to participate. Members of Congress elected before 1984 may have Dual Coverage or CSRS Offset retirement plans, while those elected in 1984 or later are automatically covered by FERS. FERS consists of Social Security, the FERS basic annuity, and the Thrift Savings Plan, with the option for additional contributions. Senators and Representatives serving before September 30, 2003, can decline coverage, but those entering office after that date are required to participate. Members with five years of previous federal employment covered by CSRS can choose the CSRS Offset Plan over FERS. Retirement eligibility is based on age and service requirements determined by the plan at the time of retirement, with options for immediate or deferred pension based on age and years of service. Full or reduced pension eligibility is determined by age, years of service, and annuity starting date. Four retirement scenarios are possible for Members covered by CSRS or the CSRS Offset Plan, with immediate, full pension available for Members aged 60 or older with 10 years of service in Congress. Retirement options for Members of Congress include full pension for those aged 60 or older with 10 years of service, or aged 62 with 5 years of federal service. Reduced pension is available for Members aged 55 to 59 with at least 30 years of service. Deferred, full pension is an option for those leaving Congress before minimum retirement age. Full pension can be taken at age 62 with 5-9 years of federal service, or at age 60 with at least 10 years of congressional service. At least 10 years of service in Congress is required for a Member to be eligible for a deferred pension. Different retirement scenarios are available based on age and years of federal service for Members covered by FERS. Retirement options for former Members of Congress under FERS include full pension at age 62 with 5 years of service, or reduced pension at 55 to 57 with 10 years of service. A temporary supplement fills in until Social Security eligibility at 62. The FERS supplement is paid from retirement until age 62, regardless of Social Security application. It is reduced for earnings above a limit and available for retirees aged 55 to 57 with 20 years of service. Members of Congress must pay Social Security taxes and follow the same rules for benefits as other workers. Retirement benefits under Social Security are based on the full retirement age, which is 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954. A minimum of 40 quarters of covered employment is required to qualify for benefits. The age for full benefits is gradually increasing to 67 for those born in 1960 or later. Benefits can be taken as early as age 62, but they are permanently reduced. For example, a worker retiring at 62 in 2015 would receive 75% of the full retirement age benefit. When the full retirement age reaches 67 in 2022 and later, Social Security benefits are reduced for beneficiaries under age 66 with earnings exceeding defined thresholds. In 2018, beneficiaries lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above $17,040 annually. The annual earnings limit for Social Security beneficiaries who reach full retirement age is $45,360 in 2018. Individuals lose $1 in benefits for every $3 in earnings above this threshold. Retirees past full retirement age receive full benefits regardless of earnings. Federal employees enrolled in FERS have 1% of their base pay contributed to the TSP by their agency, with matching contributions of up to 5% for employee contributions. In 2018, employees enrolled in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) can make voluntary contributions of up to $18,500, with an additional $6,000 for those aged 50 or older. Contributions can be made on a pretax basis or through a qualified Roth contribution option. Employees enrolled in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) contribute a percentage of their pay, with their agencies also contributing on their behalf. Members of Congress under CSRS contribute a specific percentage of their salary, with additional contributions for those under the CSRS Offset Plan. Federal employees under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) contribute a different percentage of their pay. Members of Congress and congressional staff covered by FERS prior to December 31, 2012, contribute 0.8% of pay, while their agencies contribute 13.7% of pay. Those enrolled in FERS also contribute 1.3% of salary, with Congress paying 20.8% for Members and 19.1% for employees. Additionally, they contribute 6.2% of pay to the Social Security trust fund. Employees hired after December 31, 2012, but before January 1, 2014, face increased contributions as per P.L. 112-96. Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, FERS employees hired in 2013 contribute 3.1% of pay to their annuity, with agencies contributing 11.9% of pay. Members of Congress and congressional employees hired in 2013 also contribute 3.1% of pay. Additionally, FERS enrollees contribute 6.2% of pay to the Social Security trust fund, with agencies matching this contribution. Employees hired after December 31, 2013, face increased FERS contributions under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Employees hired after December 31, 2013, contribute 4.4% of pay to their FERS annuity, while agencies contribute 12.0% of pay. Members of Congress and congressional employees hired after 2013 also contribute 4.4% of pay. FERS enrollees contribute 6.2% of pay to the Social Security trust fund, with agencies matching this contribution. Employee contribution rates under CSRS and FERS increased in 1999 and 2000. Employee contribution rates increased in 1999 and 2000, with further increases scheduled for January 1, 2001. Contributions were set to revert to 1998 levels after December 31, 2002. The Balanced Budget Act temporarily raised contribution rates for federal workers, but this was repealed for all except Members of Congress. Members' contribution rates reverted to 8.0% under CSRS and 1.3% under FERS on January 1, 2003. All Members of Congress pay Social Security payroll taxes, with a tax rate of 6.2% on wages up to $128,400 in 2018. Members of Congress pay Medicare Hospital Insurance taxes on all earnings at a rate of 1.45% of pay. Total payroll deductions for federal retirement programs depend on the coverage plan. In 2018, those with full CSRS coverage plus Social Security contribute 14.2% of the first $128,400 of salary and 8.0% to CSRS on salary above that amount. Members in the CSRS Offset Plan pay 6.2% to Social Security and 1.8% to CSRS on the first $128,400 of salary, and 8.0% to CSRS on salary above $128,400. Members first covered by FERS before 2013 pay 1.3% to FERS. Members covered by FERS contribute varying percentages of their total salary to FERS and Social Security, depending on when they were first covered by FERS. All members also pay 6.2% of their first $128,400 in salary to Social Security. Pension benefits under both CSRS and FERS are calculated based on the retiree's average annual salary, years of service, and accrual rate. The CSRS pension is calculated based on years of service, accrual rate, and average salary. The accrual rate for each year of congressional service is 2.5%. The maximum CSRS pension is 80% of the Member's final annual salary. The smallest starting pension under CSRS is 12.5% of high-3 salary. The CSRS pension for Members of Congress is calculated based on years of service, accrual rate, and average salary. The smallest starting pension is 12.5% of high-3 salary for those with five years of service. Members under the CSRS offset plan have their pension reduced by the amount of Social Security benefits they are entitled to. For FERS Members before December 31, 2012, the accrual rate is 1.7% for the first 20 years and 1.0% for each year beyond. For Members of Congress under FERS before December 31, 2012, the accrual rate is 1.7% for the first 20 years and 1.0% for each year beyond. Members who began congressional service before 1984 and elected to join FERS will receive credit from January 1, 1984. A participant retiring at the end of 2016 with 20 years of service and a high-3 salary of $174,000 would receive an annual FERS pension of $59,160. Members covered by FERS after December 31, 2012, have an accrual rate of 1.0% per year, increasing to 1.1% per year if they have at least 20 years of service and serve until age 62. The FERS pension rate is 1.1% per year of service, with no maximum pension. Members first covered by FERS before 2013 can receive a minimum unreduced pension of 8.5% of high-3 salary with five years of service, payable at age 62. Those with 10 years of service can receive a reduced pension at age 55. Members who switched from CSRS to FERS in 1987 are entitled to a CSRS pension for years before 1984. Members who switched from CSRS to FERS in 1987 are entitled to a CSRS pension for years before 1984, provided they had at least five years of service under CSRS by December 31, 1983. Their pension is calculated using the CSRS formula for pre-1984 years and the FERS formula for post-1984 years, with the same high-3 salary used in both calculations. Retirement eligibility and pension amounts are determined by FERS rules for these Members. Members who were participating in CSRS before January 1, 1984, and chose not to switch to FERS could elect to have full coverage under both CSRS and Social Security or stay in CSRS with their contributions and benefits reduced by Social Security taxes paid and benefits received. New Members with at least five years of previous civilian federal employment covered under CSRS can join the CSRS Offset Plan, paying 6.2% of salary to Social Security and 1.8% to CSRS. When earnings reach the Social Security taxable maximum, the Member pays 8.0% to CSRS. Retirement under this plan involves a reduction in the CSRS pension by the amount of Social Security benefits. During retirement, the individual's CSRS pension is reduced by the amount of the Social Security benefit attributable to federal service, starting at age 62. For example, a Representative or Senator retiring with 31 years of congressional service could see an annual reduction of approximately $25,900 if retiring at age 65 in December 2014. Pension plan adequacy is often evaluated. The adequacy of pension plans is assessed by comparing retirement benefits to pre-retirement earnings. Pensions in CSRS and FERS are based on the average of the highest three consecutive years of earnings. Table 1 displays the percentage of high-3 average pay replaced by a congressional pension for Members retiring under CSRS or FERS at specific ages and years of service. FERS benefits apply to service after 1983, with 2014 being the first year a Member could potentially complete 30 years of FERS service. FERS annuities have lower replacement rates than CSRS annuities and are adjusted for inflation annually based on the CPI-W. Congress mandated that FERS annuities will increase by less than the CPI-W when the annual rate of increase exceeds 2.0%. The FERS annuities are adjusted annually based on the CPI-W, with increases capped at 2%. CSRS pensions may exceed final pay over time, but COLAs only maintain purchasing power. The Thrift Savings Plan allows federal employees to save for retirement. In 2018, FERS participants can invest up to $18,500 in the TSP, with an additional $6,000 \"catch-up\" contribution for those aged 50 and above. Employer matching contributions are available for FERS participants, while CSRS participants can also invest in the TSP but do not receive matching contributions. Members of Congress and congressional staff become vested in a 1.0% \"agency automatic contribution\" after two years of service. All participants in FERS are immediately vested in their contributions and government matching contributions to the TSP. Contributions to the TSP are pretax unless choosing the Roth option, which allows for tax-free distributions. Withdrawals before age 59\u00bd may incur a 10% tax penalty. Withdrawals before age 59\u00bd may incur a 10% tax penalty, unless the individual is aged 55 or older and eligible for an immediate pension from CSRS or FERS, takes withdrawals in the form of a life annuity, or in a series of substantially equal periodic payments based on life expectancy. Employees leaving federal employment can defer taxes on TSP account balances by leaving the money in the TSP or transferring funds to an IRA or 401(k). At retirement, TSP participants can withdraw money in four ways: single payment, monthly payments for a fixed period or amount, or based on IRS life expectancy. Participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) can make withdrawals in various ways, including a lump sum, monthly payments, or an annuity. Withdrawal elections must be made by specific deadlines based on age and years since the first contribution. Contributions can continue until separation from federal service. Until the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-83), Members of the U.S. House of Representatives entering office on or after September 30, 2003, cannot decline coverage under FERS. Senators and Representatives serving before this date can still opt out. The vesting requirement for pension benefits under CSRS or FERS is five years. Members who do not meet this requirement, like one-term Representatives, are not entitled to a pension. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives with less than five years of service are not entitled to an annuity under CSRS or FERS. To qualify for Social Security benefits, an individual must accumulate at least 40 quarters of covered employment. Even Members with limited service may qualify for Social Security benefits based on their lifetime earnings and employment history. Members of Congress who participate in FERS are immediately vested in their own contributions. Under FERS, Members of Congress and congressional staff are vested in their TSP accounts after two years of service. Federal employees, including Members of Congress, may forfeit their retirement annuity if convicted of treason or espionage. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 addresses ethical standards for government officials. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 amended 5 U.S.C. Section 8332 to exclude certain felonies from creditable service towards a retirement annuity for Members of Congress. The law specifies various offenses including bribery, fraud, racketeering, and perjury. The Office of Personnel Management is directed to issue regulations on this matter. The STOCK Act amended 5 U.S.C. Section 8332 to address benefit payments for spouses or children of individuals convicted of specified offenses. It also states that Members of Congress lose credit for service if convicted of corruption offenses while in office. The STOCK Act amended federal criminal laws to include offenses such as conflicts of interest, making false claims, vote buying, and obstruction of proceedings before government agencies. Conviction of these offenses would result in losing creditable service as a Member of Congress for federal pension purposes."
