Congress finds that millions of children in the US suffer from undetected vision problems, which can hinder their development and educational progress. These problems range from common conditions to rare, potentially life-threatening issues. Early detection in preschool and early school-age years is crucial for effective treatment. Early detection in preschool and early school-age years is crucial for effective treatment of vision problems in children. Various identification methods, including vision screening and comprehensive eye examinations, can help identify children needing services. Public awareness about the prevalence and consequences of vision disorders in children needs to be increased. Early detection of ocular and vision disorders is important for timely evaluation and treatment. Increasing awareness of warning signs and symptoms can help in early detection. Grants for vision care for children are addressed in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may award grants to States for providing comprehensive eye examinations and treatment for children with vision problems, prioritizing those under 9 years old. The Secretary will develop criteria for the grant program and coordinate with other relevant programs to provide educational materials on recognizing signs of visual impairment in children. The grant program under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, title XIX of the Social Security Act, and title XXI of the same Act, along with other Federal or State programs, requires States to submit an application detailing existing children's vision programs and a plan for grant fund utilization to complement State efforts. The grant program requires States to submit an application detailing existing children's vision programs and a plan for grant fund utilization, including partnerships with non-profit entities, identifying eligible children, and using funds as a secondary payer for items or services not covered by other programs. To be eligible for a grant, a State must submit evaluations of vision services utilization, children's vision data analysis, and other required information. Grants are contingent on States agreeing to limit expenditure as specified. The State must agree to limit expenditure to 20 percent of the grant amount for the purpose described in subsection (a). Matching funds of at least 25 percent of the costs must be provided by the State for activities under the grant. Contributions can be in cash or in kind. For the purpose of carrying out this section, $65,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. A comprehensive eye examination includes various assessments performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Services assisted or subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be included in determining non-Federal contributions. The House of Representatives passed the bill on October 15, 2007. Attest: LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
