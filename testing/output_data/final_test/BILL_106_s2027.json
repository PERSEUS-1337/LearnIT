    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fort Peck Fish Hatchery Authorization Act of 2000\". Congress finds that Fort Peck Lake, Montana needs a warm water fish hatchery due to the burden on the state to raise and stock warm water fish species. Eastern Montana has only one inadequate hatchery, which could endanger fish populations in the region. The multipurpose project at Fort Peck, Montana, authorized in 1935, was intended for irrigation projects and other activities. The Fort Peck Dam project in Montana, authorized in 1935, aimed to promote economic growth through irrigation projects. However, many projects were left incomplete, negatively impacting local communities. The need for greater support for recreation activities and fish stocking in Fort Peck Lake has been recognized. The State of Montana has funded fish stocking since 1947, which is seen as an undue burden. Developing a viable warm water fishery in the region could stimulate economic development. The Act aims to authorize funding for a warm water fish hatchery at Fort Peck Lake, Montana, and ensure its stable operation and maintenance. The project includes the design and construction of the hatchery and associated facilities necessary for sustaining a warm water fishery. The Federal share of the cost for designing and constructing the hatchery project at Fort Peck Lake, Montana is set at 75 percent. The non-Federal share can be provided in various forms, including cash, land, services, or other in-kind contributions determined appropriate by the Secretary. The State of Montana's cost of stocking Fort Peck Lake since January 1, 1947 will be credited towards the non-Federal share. The operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the hatchery project at Fort Peck Lake is primarily a non-Federal responsibility, except for costs associated with raising threatened or endangered species, which are a Federal responsibility. The Secretary will provide low-cost project power for all hatchery operations. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, with additional funds as needed for section 6(b)(2). The allocated funds will remain available until expended."
