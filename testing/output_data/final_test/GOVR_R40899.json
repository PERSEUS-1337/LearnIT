    "content": "Child abuse and neglect is a significant social concern, leading to various negative outcomes for children such as developmental delays, behavioral issues, criminal behavior, mental health problems, and poor health outcomes in adulthood. Reporting laws were enacted in every state between 1963 and 1967 to address this issue, with assistance from the Children's Bureau under the Administration for Children and Families. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) was passed in 1974 to address child abuse and neglect, establishing federal standards for reporting laws. CAPTA has been reauthorized and amended multiple times, most recently in 2003. It authorizes state grants and discretionary activities to improve child protective services. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) authorizes federal funding for various activities related to child abuse prevention and treatment. This includes discretionary activities such as federal data collection, dissemination, and technical assistance efforts, as well as competitive grants for research and demonstration projects. Additionally, community-based grants are provided to states and territories to support activities and services aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect. The FY2009 appropriation for Children's Justice Act Grants was $41.7 million, with $20 million provided from the federal Crime Victims Fund. Funding authorization for CAPTA grants expired in FY2008, but the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 allocated roughly $110 million for CAPTA grants in FY2009. Additionally, $20 million was set aside from the Crime Victims Fund for Children's Justice Act grants. The FY2010 appropriations legislation pending in Congress would provide funding for child abuse and neglect cases. Children rely on adults for care and support, but some children are not properly cared for. Anyone who suspects abuse or neglect can contact child protective services. CPS agencies investigate these cases and provide services to children in need. CPS workers must differentiate between safe home situations, those needing additional support, and those requiring removal for protection. The report discusses definitions of child abuse, CPS response to allegations, tasks of CPS workers, demographic characteristics of victims, services provided post-investigation, and risk factors for poor child outcomes. The report discusses risk factors for poor child outcomes in families investigated for abuse or neglect. CPS agencies are the \"front-end\" of child welfare services, with a large number of children and families coming into contact with them each year. Child abuse and neglect are defined as any recent act or failure to act by a parent or caretaker resulting in harm to the child. States that receive state grant funds under CAPTA must define \"child abuse and neglect\" to be consistent with the federal definition, which includes physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse/exploitation, and emotional abuse or mental injury. Many states have developed more detailed definitions of child maltreatment, elaborating on different types of maltreatment. In FY2007, 80% of substantiated child abuse or neglect cases involved parents as perpetrators, with other relatives and unmarried partners also being involved. Non-parent caregivers like foster parents and legal guardians accounted for less than 1% of perpetrators. In FY2007, child protective services agencies received 3.2 million allegations of abuse or neglect concerning an estimated 5.8 million children. Investigations were conducted for the majority of allegations, involving around 3.5 million children, with 794,000 determined to be victims of child abuse or neglect. This accounts for roughly 11 children per 1,000 in the population. Any person can report child abuse and neglect to CPS, with certain individuals mandated to report such cases. States operate 24-hour hotlines for reporting, and have procedures for cross-agency cooperation. States also have policies on sharing information and rules for screening out allegations that do not meet the state's definition of abuse. When an allegation is screened out by CPS, it may not meet the state's definition of child abuse or neglect, involve insufficient information for an investigation, or pertain to individuals over 18. In such cases, there is typically no further CPS response, although some localities may refer screened-out allegations to community groups for potential follow-up. Conversely, a screened-in allegation becomes a \"report\" and triggers a CPS investigation or assessment. In FY2007, 58% of child abuse referrals for investigation or assessment were made by professionals who encountered the alleged victim as part of their job. In FY2007, professionals encountered the alleged child victim as part of their job and made 58% of child abuse referrals for investigation or assessment. Education personnel accounted for 17% of reports, followed by legal/law enforcement personnel (16%), social services personnel (10%), medical personnel (8%), mental health personnel (4%), and foster care/child day care providers (2%). Non-professionals like anonymous individuals, relatives, parents, and friends/neighbors also made reports. The number of children investigated for abuse and neglect increased from 1990 to 2004 but has since remained stable at around 3.5 to 3.6 million annually. The Child Protective Services (CPS) investigates about 3.5 to 3.6 million children annually for abuse or neglect, with a focus on determining the child's safety and assessing the risk in the home. A national survey found that agencies also assess other children in the family for maltreatment and determine service needs during investigations. Additionally, recommendations for court intervention are made if necessary. Local CPS agencies commonly instruct investigators to review prior CPS records, visit families without appointments, interview relevant individuals, conduct criminal background checks, and collaborate with multi-disciplinary teams during investigations. Investigators are also required to provide short-term services to families as needed and refer them for further services post-investigation. Some states have implemented alternative response systems for reports of abuse or neglect where children are not deemed at imminent risk. This approach focuses on assessing family strengths and needs to ensure children's safety without making a formal determination of abuse or neglect. A survey found that 39% of local CPS agencies had implemented some form of alternative response, with workers required to follow standard practices. In FY2007, HHS estimates that 794,000 children experienced child abuse or neglect, based on reports from state CPS agencies. Activities conducted as part of alternative response typically included interviews with caregivers and children, discussions with CPS workers, and family visits by appointment. In FY2007, states reported on substantiated victims of child abuse and neglect, with close to 96% of children counted as victims having a substantiated investigation finding. Some states also reported on children for whom abuse or neglect was \"indicated,\" with 15,000 children in four states having this determination. In FY2007, states reported on substantiated victims of child abuse and neglect, with close to 96% of children counted as victims having a substantiated investigation finding. Some states also reported on children for whom abuse or neglect was \"indicated,\" with 15,000 children in four states having this determination. When determining whether to substantiate a child abuse or neglect report, CPS investigators must consider the state's definition of abuse and neglect and the level of evidence required. States varied in their requirements, with some needing a \"reasonable\" determination, others a \"preponderance\" of evidence, and a few the most rigorous standard of \"clear or convincing evidence.\" In FY2007, states had varying levels of evidence required for substantiating child abuse and neglect cases. States with the least restrictive standard had a victim rate of over 13, while those with the most restrictive standard had a victim rate of below 2. Approximately 2.7 million children were considered \"non-victims\" in child abuse and neglect investigations, with 72% of them having unsubstantiated findings. The finding category used by all states is often undefined but generally means there was not enough evidence to determine maltreatment. States with stricter evidence requirements have lower substantiation rates. Children in investigated families have more risk factors, and some non-victims still receive services. More than 1 in 10 non-victim finding categories are reported by states. In FY2007, states reported various \"non-victim\" finding categories, including \"no alleged maltreatment,\" \"alternative response,\" and \"closed with no finding.\" These categories represent siblings of abused or neglected children, cases with no evidence of maltreatment, and cases closed without a finding, respectively. The number of reported child maltreatment victims declined to 794,000 in FY2007, representing less than 11 victims for every 1,000 children. The rate of children found to be victims of child maltreatment peaked in the early to mid 1990s, with roughly 1 million children reported annually. The number of reported child maltreatment victims declined to 794,000 in FY2007, less than 11 victims per 1,000 children. The decrease is attributed to changes in investigation findings and data reporting methods by some states. In FY2007, 794,000 children were victims of child abuse or neglect, with neglect being the most common type of maltreatment. Physical and sexual abuse rates have declined over the past 15 years. Young children and African-American/American Indian children have the highest rates of maltreatment. In FY2007, child maltreatment rates varied by age, with infants having the highest rate at nearly 22 victims per 1,000 infants. Rates decreased for older children, with 16 and 17 year olds having the lowest rate at five victims per 1,000 children. Race was not directly linked to child abuse and neglect in National Incidence Surveys. Certain racial groups are disproportionately likely to be counted as victims of child abuse and neglect, with African Americans, American Indian/Alaska Native children, and children of two or more races having higher rates. White and Hispanic children have somewhat lower rates, while Asian children have much lower rates. The overrepresentation of children of color in the child welfare system may be due to disproportionate need, as they are more likely to live in poor or single-parent homes. Children of color are more likely to live in poor or single-parent homes, leading to higher rates of child abuse or neglect. They also receive disproportionate attention from social service workers, leading to biased decision-making in referring them to Child Protective Services. These children have fewer community resources available to them, resulting in a higher likelihood of being involved in the child welfare system. Three-fourths of CPS agencies provide short-term services to families during investigations and refer them for post-investigation services as needed. Post-investigation services offered to families often include parenting classes and substance abuse programs. Other less frequently offered services may include marital counseling, family system therapy, grief counseling, advocacy services, dental exams, homemaker/chore services, employment services, and financial planning. Roughly one in five children found to be victims of child abuse or neglect were removed from their homes within 90 days of the investigation. About two in five received services while living at home, while the remaining two in five did not receive any additional services. Some victims may not receive post-investigation services if their needs were met during the investigation, or if services are not available. In recent years, CPS workers have conducted roughly 1.9 to 2.0 million child abuse or neglect investigations annually, typically involving as many as 3.5 or 3.6 million children. Roughly one out of four \"non-victims\" received some services following an investigation, while a small percentage were removed from their homes. Children not found to be victims of abuse or neglect may still be in need of post-investigation services. Many families investigated for abuse or neglect by CPS face challenges such as limited support, financial difficulties, poor parenting, mental health issues, domestic violence, and substance abuse. A significant number of these families had prior contact with CPS, indicating ongoing issues. Prior contact with CPS was common among families investigated for abuse or neglect. Over half had prior reports, a quarter had substantiated abuse, and nearly 30% had received services from the agency. Families with higher risk factors were more likely to have a child removed from the home. High cumulative caregiver risk predicted placement. The presence of cumulative caregiver risk factors predicted placement in out-of-home care or receipt of services for children investigated for abuse or neglect. Investigative caseworkers emphasized caregiver cooperation and a child's inability to self-protect as critical factors in their decision-making process. Special health or other needs were important for older children. Children in families investigated for abuse or neglect have a higher risk for developmental delays, behavior problems, lower academic scores, and higher levels of depression compared to the general population. This risk is present across all investigated families, not just those with substantiated allegations or removed children. States must have procedures to refer children found to be at risk under CAPTA. Researchers analyzing survey data found that up to 34% of children under age three in families investigated for abuse or neglect had developmental delays qualifying them for special education services. This percentage is higher than the general population, which ranges from 2% to 23%. Developmental delays were not limited to victims of abuse and neglect. Children with unsubstantiated reports of child abuse or neglect (38%) were more likely to need Part C services for developmental delay or medical conditions compared to children with substantiated reports (28%). However, those with unsubstantiated reports were less likely to receive services. The role of child welfare agencies in providing services to all investigated children, regardless of substantiation status, is an area for future research and policy consideration. The report discusses grants programs and activities authorized by CAPTA, focusing on preventing child abuse and neglect. CAPTA is crucial for ensuring children's safety and is the only federal program dedicated to this purpose. Federal child welfare programs aim to protect children, promote strong families, and foster overall well-being. Activities authorized and funded under CAPTA, such as state grants for improving CPS systems and data reporting requirements, are crucial for preventing child abuse and ensuring children's safety. CAPTA state grant funds are distributed to all eligible states by formula to improve the state CPS system. Funds can be used for various purposes such as receipt and investigation of reports of child abuse and neglect, educating the public on CPS, developing training protocols, improving intake assessment, screening, and investigation of reports, enhancing case management, and delivering services to children and families. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing community-based programs to prevent child abuse, training CPS workers on collaboration with families and personal safety, and improving interagency collaboration in child protection. Collaboration between agencies is crucial to improve services for children moving between child protection and juvenile justice systems, as well as to provide child abuse prevention and treatment services. Legal preparation and representation must be enhanced to address appeals of substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires states to have systems in place for responding to reports of child abuse and neglect, including appointing trained individuals to represent child victims in court. States must update technology systems to track and exchange information on abuse cases. All states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories receive CAPTA grants, which require states to submit applications every five years as part of a broader Child and Family Services Plan. The CAPTA state grant application requires states to outline how they will use the funds to improve their CPS system and provide child abuse prevention services. States must also coordinate the CAPTA grant program with other federal programs like the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services and Promoting Safe and Stable Families programs. States applying for CAPTA state grants must certify that activities related to preventing, responding to, or treating child abuse or neglect meet requirements. The state plan must include training for mandatory reporters and CPS workers, notify HHS of any law changes affecting eligibility, and assure the implementation of statewide policies on receiving, screening, and investigating abuse and neglect allegations. States must have procedures for receiving reports of child abuse and neglect, including immediate screening, risk assessment, and investigation. Health care providers must notify CPS of infants affected by prenatal exposure to illegal substances. CPS must be notified of suspected medical neglect, and procedures for coordination with health care facilities must be in place. During investigations, CPS workers must inform alleged perpetrators of the allegations against them. The state must inform alleged perpetrators of abuse allegations and provide avenues for appeal. Immunity is granted to those reporting suspected abuse. Procedures for referring children to services and ensuring their safety are required. Special procedures and laws must be in place to respond to child maltreatment victims, including infants under three years old, infants affected by prenatal exposure to illegal substances, and cases involving medical neglect. States are required to appoint a guardian ad litem for legal representation of children in abuse and neglect proceedings. The state must appoint a guardian ad litem to represent child abuse or neglect victims in judicial proceedings and maintain confidentiality of records. Access to confidential information is granted to specific entities like child fatality review panels and citizen review panels. Information on child abuse and neglect cases resulting in death must be released to the public. States can release child abuse and neglect records to individuals involved, courts, and authorized entities for legitimate purposes. Public access to court proceedings is allowed with safeguards for safety. Confidentiality rules apply to all recipients of information from these cases. States must have civil sanctions in place for panel members who re-disclose information from a CPS case without authorization. Records related to unsubstantiated cases must be expunged from public access and background checks. CPS agencies can keep information on unsubstantiated cases for future assessments. States can refuse to disclose identifying information about those who report child abuse or neglect. Training, worker retention, and supervision are also important aspects. States are required to establish citizen review panels composed of volunteers representative of the community to improve training, retention, and supervision of CPS workers. Citizen review panels, composed of volunteers broadly representative of the community, evaluate the effectiveness of state and local CPS agencies in protecting children. They meet quarterly, provide public outreach, and submit annual reports with recommendations for CPS improvements. States must respond to these recommendations within six months. Termination of parental rights is a legal process that severs the relationship between a parent and child for safety and permanency. States must expedite this process for abandoned infants and ensure no child of a parent convicted of heinous crimes is required to be in their care. States must also grant citizen review panels access to case information and staff assistance for their duties. States must ensure that criminal background checks are completed for prospective foster or adoptive parents and report child abuse and neglect data to HHS. Termination of parental rights is a legal process that severs the relationship between a parent and child for safety and permanency. The curr_chunk discusses the number of children reported as abused or neglected, the services they received, reunification with families, deaths due to abuse or neglect, appointments of individuals to represent children's best interests, and out-of-court contacts. The curr_chunk provides data on out-of-court contacts between appointed representatives and children, custody transfers from child protection to juvenile justice systems, families receiving preventive services, CPS worker ratios for intake and investigation, agency response times for abuse/neglect cases, and annual citizen review panel reports required by HHS for CAPTA state grants. HHS awards CAPTA state grants to 56 jurisdictions, including states and territories, based on child population. Grant amounts varied from $85,000 to over $3.0 million in FY2009. No matching funds are required. Indian tribes or tribal organizations are not eligible for these grants. States receiving CAPTA state grants in FY2008 planned to allocate funds for prevention and support services, protective services, training, and intensive family preservation. These funds aim to improve prevention activities and the CPS system for responding to abuse or neglect reports. Title II of CAPTA specifically supports community-based prevention activities. The federal government provides funds for community-based child abuse prevention activities, but not specifically for state CPS systems. States primarily fund CPS systems using non-federal sources, with only a small portion coming from federal funding streams like the SSBG. For FY2007, states reported spending $270 million through the SSBG for child protective services, which was less than 8% of all state spending on CPS. CAPTA Title II community-based grants, also known as CBCAP grants, are a key source of federal funding dedicated to preventing child abuse and neglect. These funds are distributed to state-designated lead entities and then redistributed to community-based groups for prevention-focused programs and activities. This includes services like home visiting, respite care, and parenting education to support families and prevent child abuse. The CBCAP funds are distributed to state-designated lead entities for prevention-focused programs and activities to support families at risk of child abuse. The funds are used for services like home visiting, respite care, and parenting education. The distribution is based on each state's child population and ability to leverage non-federal funds for prevention activities. Prevention-focused programs aim to strengthen families and prevent child abuse by offering support, promoting parenting skills, involving parents in program planning, and addressing the needs of families with children with disabilities. Grants prioritize effective programs serving low-income communities, young parents, and families with young children. Foster a continuum of prevention efforts. The curr_chunk discusses funding and supporting community-based family resource and support programs to prevent child abuse and neglect. It emphasizes collaboration between state and community partners, maximizing funding for services, financing public information campaigns, and involving parents in planning. The curr_chunk outlines key steps for providing a continuum of family support services, including assessing community needs, developing partnerships, offering core services like parent education and respite care, involving parents in program design, mobilizing resources, and collaborating with community groups for prevention activities. To be eligible for funding, a state must designate a lead entity to direct CBCAP funding and efforts, provide assurances related to the qualifications of the lead entity, submit an application with planned activities and budget, and submit annual program reports to HHS. The lead entity can be public, private nonprofit, or quasi-public and must integrate child abuse prevention services, leverage funds, and blend resources. In some states, a public agency serves as the lead entity. The lead entity for CBCAP funding can be a public, private nonprofit, or quasi-public agency. They must provide community-based prevention programs, have a collaborative structure, and ensure direction for child abuse prevention efforts. The lead entity for CBCAP funding must have clear direction and oversight, leverage funding from various sources, centralize assessment and planning activities, provide training and technical assistance, and ensure integration with child abuse and neglect activities. The state must ensure the lead entity involves parents in program development and operation. The lead entity for CBCAP funding must have clear direction and oversight, leverage funding from various sources, centralize assessment and planning activities, provide training and technical assistance, and ensure integration with child abuse and neglect activities. The state must submit an application to HHS describing the lead entity responsible for administering the CBCAP grant and overseeing community-based programs funded. The application should include descriptions, assurances, and plans related to the administration of CBCAP and the role of the lead entity in supporting families to prevent child abuse and neglect. The lead entity for CBCAP funding must oversee community-based programs, integrate family support services, provide operational support, training, and technical assistance, advocate for systemic changes, and select/fund prevention programs. The lead entity for CBCAP funding must oversee community-based programs, integrate family support services, provide operational support, training, and technical assistance, advocate for systemic changes, and select/fund prevention programs. The state must submit a program budget and assure that federal CBCAP funds will be used to supplement, not supplant, other funds for community-based, prevention-focused programs serving children. The lead entity for CBCAP funding must oversee community-based programs, integrate family support services, provide operational support, training, and technical assistance, advocate for systemic changes, and select/fund prevention programs. The state must assure that federal CBCAP funds will be used to supplement, not supplant, other funds for community-based, prevention-focused programs serving children and families. Provide performance and other reports or information deemed necessary by HHS. The application must describe how the work of the lead entity and of the community-based programs it funds will be evaluated. The state must assure that it will provide HHS with annual reports on the program, including information on \"performance measures\" that demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs in meeting the requirements of CBCAP. The CBCAP funding requires states to establish, operate, and evaluate community-based programs to prevent child abuse and neglect. States must have a plan to involve parents in program design and demonstrate innovative funding mechanisms. $41.7 million was appropriated for FY2009, with 1% reserved for grants to Indian tribes. States must designate a lead entity, submit an application, and provide necessary reports to be eligible for CBCAP funds. HHS can set aside funds for program support and technical assistance activities, with the remaining funds allocated to states by formula. Tribal and migrant programs receive a 1% reservation distributed competitively. In FY2009, around $417,000 was available for three grantees, with grants expected to extend for three years. Technical assistance and program support are also provided using CBCAP funds. The Children's Bureau reserves some CBCAP funds for ongoing support of the FRIENDS national resource center and technical assistance. The remaining funds are distributed to states based on population, with a minimum allotment for each jurisdiction. In FY2009, 30% of CBCAP state funding, approximately $12 million, is distributed based on the non-federal funds leveraged by each state for child abuse and neglect prevention activities in the prior fiscal year. States leveraged over $322 million in non-federal funding in FY2007, determining their share of leverage funding awarded under the CBCAP program for FY2008. In FY2008, funding awarded under the CBCAP program ranged from $200,000 to $3.6 million per state, with a median grant of $567,000. CAPTA authorizes support for various activities related to child abuse and neglect prevention, with funding typically awarded by HHS through competitive means. HHS receives CAPTA funding for research, data collection, and technical assistance. In FY2009, $41.8 million was allocated, with $16.4 million directed for specific purposes including home visitation, a feasibility study for a national registry of child abuse cases, and projects in eight states. HHS is mandated to support research, projects, and provide technical assistance under CAPTA. HHS receives CAPTA funding for research, data collection, and technical assistance. HHS is mandated to establish a national clearinghouse on child abuse and disseminate information related to child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment. The Child Welfare Information Gateway website provides resources on identifying, reporting, and responding to child abuse. The Child Welfare Information Gateway website provides resources on programs for preventing, assessing, and treating child abuse and neglect, best practices for improving child protective systems, addressing the needs of abused children, and training resources at state and local levels. HHS funds national resource centers and quality improvement centers to meet these requirements. The Child Welfare Information Gateway website provides resources on programs for preventing, assessing, and treating child abuse and neglect. HHS funds national resource and quality improvement centers to meet these requirements, including the National Quality Improvement Center on Differential Response in Child Protective Services and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare. HHS has established the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) to collect and analyze data on child abuse and neglect. The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) compiles and analyzes data on child abuse and neglect reported by states. States voluntarily submit data to NCANDS annually, which can be accessed by researchers through the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect. Technical assistance is provided to agencies and organizations to develop programs related to prevention, assessment, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect. HHS funds research programs to protect children from abuse and neglect, including interdisciplinary and longitudinal projects. They compile, analyze, and publish research findings, establish priorities, solicit public input, and make annual grant announcements for child abuse and neglect research. The HHS funds research programs for child abuse and neglect, establishing priorities and making annual grant announcements. The research focuses on various topics related to child abuse and neglect, including causes, prevention, effects on development, and best practices for improving child protective services systems. The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 required HHS to conduct a national survey on child abuse and neglect, reporting back to Congress by July 2007. The survey aimed to evaluate services, prevent abuse, and provide information on the national incidence of child abuse and neglect. The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 mandated a national survey on child abuse and neglect, focusing on demographic characteristics, changes in abuse cases, substantiated reports, judicial findings, false reports' impact, lack of resources for mandatory reporters, and unfounded reports affecting responses to serious cases. The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 mandated a national survey on child abuse and neglect, focusing on various aspects such as unsubstantiated reports leading to out-of-home placement, recurrence of unsubstantiated reports as more serious cases, abuse and neglect in foster care, and abuse allegations in family court proceedings. Data was collected from 2005 to 2007, with a pending report to Congress. A peer review process for awarding grants or contracts was also recommended to ensure quality. The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 mandated a national survey on child abuse and neglect, focusing on various aspects such as unsubstantiated reports leading to out-of-home placement, recurrence of unsubstantiated reports as more serious cases, abuse and neglect in foster care, and abuse allegations in family court proceedings. Data was collected from 2005 to 2007, with a pending report to Congress. A peer review process for awarding grants or contracts was also recommended to ensure quality. Experts in the field make grants under the CAPTA research program to enhance research quality. HHS activities include establishing an Office of Child Abuse and Neglect, an Advisory Board, and supporting research on prevention of child abuse and neglect. The Federal Interagency Working Group on Child Abuse and Neglect, with representation from over 40 federal agencies, meets regularly to coordinate and exchange ideas on child abuse and neglect programs. An Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect is appointed to make recommendations on related issues. The current law requires specific qualifications for members appointed to the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect. Previous reports from the Board made recommendations on responding to abuse, preventing neglect, and reducing child abuse-related fatalities through various strategies. The statute allows for funding research and activities to improve child abuse prevention and treatment, including collaboration across various agencies and groups to enhance CPS responses and services. This includes efforts to improve school-based prevention, identification, and assessment of child abuse and neglect. The statute allows for funding research and activities to improve child abuse prevention and treatment, including collaboration across various agencies and groups to enhance CPS responses and services. This involves improving training for CPS workers, recognizing substance abuse or domestic violence in neglect situations, and better health evaluations and forensic diagnosis of abuse or neglect. Grants may be provided to states, agencies, or organizations to enhance training for child welfare workers and child protective services workers on best practices and legal responsibilities. HHS may provide grants for the development of risk and safety assessment tools, training for mandated reporters, and improvement in recruitment and training of volunteers in child, youth, and family service organizations to prevent child abuse. Additionally, grants can be used for establishing safe visitation locations, developing procedures for safe placement of children with kin, supporting parent self-help programs, and providing respite and crisis nursery services. The Children's Bureau provides grants for parent support programs, respite services, and hospital-based information for parents of children with disabilities or who have been abused. Grants are typically awarded at the end of the fiscal year, with directives from Congress for specific programs. The Children's Bureau provides grants for parent support programs, respite services, and hospital-based information for parents of children with disabilities or who have been abused. Congress used the appropriations process in FY2008 and FY2009 to respond to a request by the Bush Administration for additional CAPTA discretionary activities funds to support a home visitation initiative. The Bush Administration received $10 million for this purpose in FY2008 and $13.5 million in FY2009 to continue the initiative. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request seeks funding for home visitation programs for families with young children. Congress allocated $500,000 of CAPTA discretionary funds for a feasibility study on a national registry of substantiated child abuse. Prior to this, HHS used general funds for a feasibility study, which identified barriers to implementation and highlighted the lack of data on the potential benefits of a national registry. The study concluded that states could voluntarily participate in the registry. The statute allows for voluntary state participation in a national registry of substantiated child abuse, but there are concerns about the lack of sufficient information to accurately identify perpetrators and the unclear intent of the registry. Issues related to due process, such as differences in evidence standards and appeal procedures, are also highlighted. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $500,000 for a study on the national child abuse registry. The study will focus on the need for procedural protections at the state or local level, including notification of inclusion, and the implications of being listed on the registry. HHS believes that submitting jurisdictions must certify that minimum due process protections were available to the perpetrator. The study will also examine the prevalence of perpetrators listed in multiple states' registries and states' interest in participating in a national registry. Child abuse registries are a focus of concern for states, with discussions on national registry participation, data systems, legal issues, and due process procedures. Congress allocates funds for specific projects through the CAPTA discretionary activities account. Grants under Section 107 of CAPTA, known as \"Children's Justice Act grants,\" support improvements in handling child abuse cases. Funding for these grants is provided annually. The Children's Justice Act (Title I of P.L. 99-401) provides annual funding of $20 million from the Crime Victims Fund for grants to states, territories, and tribes to improve handling of child abuse and neglect cases, with $17 million for states and territories administered by HHS and $3 million for tribes administered by the Department of Justice. The funds aim to enhance investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse and exploitation, while minimizing trauma to child victims. The Children's Justice Act provides annual funding to states, territories, and tribes to improve the handling of child abuse and neglect cases, focusing on child sexual abuse and exploitation. States must establish a task force with professionals from various fields to review and evaluate how these cases are handled. The Children's Justice Act provides funding to states to improve handling of child abuse cases. States must establish a task force with professionals to review and evaluate the handling of cases. States use grants for system improvements, training, and conferences. The Children's Justice Act provides funding to states for improving handling of child abuse cases through various means such as appointing special advocates, funding training, co-locating staff, and building facilities. States must meet eligibility requirements, establish a task force, receive recommendations, and implement them to receive grants. The Children's Justice Act provides funding to states for improving handling of child abuse cases through various means such as appointing special advocates, funding training, co-locating staff, and building facilities. States must meet eligibility requirements, establish a task force, receive recommendations, and implement them to receive grants. For FY2009, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were expected to receive Children's Justice Act funds. HHS distributes the funds to states based on their relative share of the child population. The Children's Justice Act provides funding to states for improving handling of child abuse cases through various means such as appointing special advocates, funding training, co-locating staff, and building facilities. For FY2009, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were expected to receive Children's Justice Act funds based on their share of the child population. Pennsylvania did not apply for the grants, so funding was reallocated to states that did apply. Funding for Children's Justice Act grants is funded under an annual set-aside from the Crime Victims Fund, not under CAPTA. The funding authorization levels and appropriations described in CAPTA relate to grants and activities for child abuse cases. CAPTA has separate funding authorizations for state grants and community-based grants. Actual appropriations usually fall below authorized levels. Section 112 of CAPTA provides a general funding authorization level for Title I, which was set at $120 million for FY2004. Congress appropriated $68.3 million for Title I CAPTA purposes for FY2009. Congress appropriated $68.3 million in funds for Title I CAPTA purposes for FY2009 (P.L. 111-8), with pending legislation (H.R. 3293) for a similar amount in FY2010. Section 112 mandates that 30% of Title I funding be allocated for \"discretionary activities\" under CAPTA. However, Congress often divides the funds into separate accounts for \"Child Abuse State Grants\" and \"Child Abuse Discretionary Activities.\" The latter supports research, technical assistance, and other activities consistent with CAPTA purposes. Funding for discretionary activities has ranged from 40% to 60% in past years. Funding for discretionary activities under CAPTA has ranged from 40% to 60% of overall Title I funding. For FY2009, funds appropriated for discretionary activities totaled 61% of the overall Title I funding. Section 210 of CAPTA authorizes funding for community-based grants to prevent child abuse and neglect, with funding authorization levels set at $80 million for FY2004 and at such sums as necessary for FY2005-FY2008. Congress appropriated $41.7 million for FY2009 and pending legislation would appropriate the same amount for FY2010. The FY2007 program data includes the number of child abuse or neglect allegations received by CPS, investigations conducted, and the number of children found to be victims. Referrals and investigations involve multiple children, with 3.2 million referrals received nationally in FY2007 related to an estimated 5.8 million children. In FY2007, CPS responded to 1.9 million referrals involving approximately 3.5 million children. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) examined risk factors among children in families investigated for abuse or neglect. Table B-2 presents NSCAW findings on family and caregiver risk factors among children investigated for abuse and neglect, regardless of substantiated findings. Table C-1 shows national estimates of children investigated for abuse or neglect and victims. Data quality varies by year under NCANDS. In recent years, data quality on child maltreatment has improved with nearly all states reporting. Trends in types of maltreatment experienced by victims have been tracked, with changes in reporting methods since FY2007. Before FY2007, children experiencing multiple types of maltreatment were counted in each category, but from FY2007 onwards, a separate category for \"multiple maltreatments\" was introduced by HHS. A separate category for children experiencing \"multiple maltreatments\" (two or more types of abuse or neglect) was introduced by HHS from FY2007 onwards. Table D-1 in Appendix D estimates the number of children receiving post-investigation services based on state-reported data, although not all states provided this information."
