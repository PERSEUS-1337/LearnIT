    "content": "The \"Second Amendment Enforcement Act\" is the short title of this Act. Congressional findings are outlined in the following section. Congress finds that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals to keep and bear arms, including law-abiding citizens in the District of Columbia who are deprived of firearms commonly used for sporting and self-defense. The District of Columbia has the highest per capita murder rate in the Nation, attributed in part to local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding persons. Federal regulations and existing criminal laws already address firearm possession by violent criminals and felons, making local laws disarming law-abiding citizens unnecessary. Legislation is needed to correct the District of Columbia's restrictive firearm laws, which infringe on citizens' Second Amendment rights and hinder public safety. Legislation is needed to reform the District of Columbia Council's authority to restrict firearms, addressing concerns about Second Amendment rights and public safety. The Act prohibits the District of Columbia from restricting the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms by individuals not prohibited under Federal law, emphasizing the protection of Second Amendment rights.
