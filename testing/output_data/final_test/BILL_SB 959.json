    "title": "SB 959",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares the need for transparent competitive bidding at the University of California to prevent illegal employment practices and ensure fair wages for employees. This is to avoid increased costs for public benefits and to protect victims of wage theft. The University of California must avoid past instances of wasting public resources by contracting with for-profit private contractors. Amendments to the Public Contract Code aim to promote responsible contracting, with the effective date delayed until January 1, 2018, to allow time for preparation and reduce costs. Section 10507.6 is added to the Public Contract Code to address these concerns. Section 10507.6 of the Public Contract Code outlines the requirements for bidders to qualify as the lowest responsible bidder or best value awardee for various services including building maintenance, cleaning, security, transportation, and healthcare services. Bidders must certify that their employee compensation package is within 5% of the average value for comparable work at the University of California. The University of California requires bidders to certify that their employee compensation package is within 5% of the average value for comparable work at the university. Bidders must also certify that they have not been found liable for certain violations in the past five years. All records provided by a bidder or contractor to the university must be disclosed to the public upon request, with confidential information redacted. The university will delay disclosing any records submitted by a bidder until after the bid process is complete. Section 10507.7 of the Public Contract Code is amended to exclude certain employees from certification requirements and disclosures, effective January 1, 2018. This section does not apply to work subject to Chapter 1 of the Labor Code. The Regents of the University of California must award contracts for goods and materials over $100,000 annually to the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, or reject all bids. Contracts for services over $100,000 annually must also go to the lowest responsible bidder, or all bids will be rejected. If the successful bidder fails to execute the contract, it may be awarded to the second lowest bidder. If the second lowest responsible bidder fails to execute the contract, the regents may award it to the third lowest bidder meeting specifications. Section 10507.7 is added to the Public Contract Code, effective until January 1, 2018, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The Regents of the University of California must award contracts over $100,000 annually to the lowest responsible bidder for goods and materials, or reject all bids. Contracts for services over $100,000 must also go to the lowest responsible bidder, or all bids will be rejected. If the successful bidder fails to execute the contract, it may be awarded to the second lowest bidder. If the second lowest responsible bidder fails to execute the contract, the regents may award it to the third lowest bidder meeting specifications. Contracts for services over $100,000 annually, including renewals or extensions, will be subject to this section starting January 1, 2018."
