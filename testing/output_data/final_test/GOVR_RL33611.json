The FY2013 budget included $1,570,005,000 for Contributions to International Organizations, $2,098,500,000 for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities, and $327,300,000 for International Organizations and Programs. The President requested $90,900,000 for U.S. voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency and $1,350,000 for U.S. voluntary contributions to the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 Trust Fund. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the United Nations system, with contributions totaling over $4.8 billion in 2007. This included assessed contributions to the regular budgets of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, contributions to war crimes tribunals, and voluntary contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations. In recent years, Congress has been pushing to reduce U.S. funding for many U.N. system programs, with a focus on the appropriate level of funding, reform efforts, and accumulated arrearages. This report tracks how Congress provides funding for U.S. contributions to the United Nations, its agencies, peacekeeping operations, and voluntary programs. It includes information on the President's request, congressional response, and legislative initiatives during this process. The United Nations system is funded by contributions from member states, including assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions finance the regular budgets of the United Nations, specialized agencies, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The assessed contribution is a legal obligation for countries joining the United Nations, providing regular income for staffing and authorized programs. U.N. peacekeeping operations are funded through special assessed accounts, with U.S. contributions coming from the State Department's budget. Congress authorizes these funds as part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. Regular assessed budgets of U.N. organizations are included in Contributions to International Organizations (CIO), while peacekeeping contributions are funded in Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA). Voluntary contributions finance special programs and offices created by the U.N. system, such as UNDP, UNEP, UNICEF, and UNDEF. Payment of these contributions is up to each country; no legal obligation. U.S. voluntary contributions are funded through foreign assistance legislation, primarily through the IO&P account. This account does not fund U.S. contributions to UNHCR and UNRWA, which are funded separately.

General Assembly has adopted a scale of assessments for member countries to contribute to the organization's expenses, with the United States paying the maximum of 22% of the U.N. regular budget. Each member has one vote on budget decisions, and budgets have been adopted by consensus since 1988. The U.N. General Assembly's budget decision process, based on one nation, one vote, has been criticized as unfair. Efforts were made to adopt the U.N. regular budget by consensus between 1985 and 1988 to give major contributing nations a stronger voice. However, in 2006, the practice of consensus was broken when the Fifth Committee voted on a resolution regarding Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposals. In 2006, the Fifth Committee voted on a resolution regarding Secretary-General Kofi Annan's 23 proposals. The United States voted against a related budget resolution in December 2007 but joined the consensus on a biennial budget of $4.17 billion. U.S. representatives expressed concerns over the budget resolution's \"piece meal\" and \"ad hoc\" approach. U.S. Ambassador Mark Wallace addressed the General Assembly's Fifth Committee on the proposed 2008-2009 budget, highlighting a $4.19 billion initial budget with additional \"add ons\" bringing it to $4.8 billion. This represents a 15% increase over the previous budget and is the largest regular budget in UN history. The proposed 2008-2009 UN budget started at $4.19 billion, with additional \"add ons\" bringing it to $4.8 billion, the largest increase in UN history. The final budget is expected to exceed $5.2 billion, a 25% increase from the previous budget, mainly going towards increasing the size of the UN Secretariat. The 2008/2009 UN budget saw a significant increase to over $5.2 billion, with a focus on expanding the UN Secretariat. Concerns were raised about the lack of proposed cuts or offsets by the Secretary-General or member states, with the top contributors shouldering a large portion of the budget. In 2010 and 2011, the top three contributors to the U.N. regular budget were the United States, Japan, and Germany, paying a total of 42.548%. The top 10 contributors, including all five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, covered 72.203% of the budget. The Russian Federation's contributions were 1.20% in 2009 and 1.602% in 2010. Former U.S. Ambassador John Bolton suggested using purchasing power parity (PPP) for calculating gross national income in the scale of assessments. The World Bank uses PPPs as an analytical tool but not for income comparisons. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended not increasing the current rate of assessment and considering economic factors like purchasing power parity. The House Appropriations Committee directed the State Department to report on whether the current assessment formula should be revised. The Contributions committee, consisting of 18 members, advises the UN Assembly on assessment scales for member states. In 2006, they recommended a scale for 2007-2009, with the US assessment remaining at 22%. The UN General Assembly approved the new scale on December 22, 2006. The assessment levels for various countries were adjusted for the period 2010-2012 by the UN General Assembly. The US assessment remained at 22%, while assessments for other countries either increased or decreased. Specialized agencies within the UN have their own assessment formulas. The U.N. uses a specific scale for assessments, while other agencies have their own formulas resulting in lower U.S. assessments. Countries with arrears lose their vote in the U.N. General Assembly if arrears exceed assessments for two preceding years. As of December 31, 2009, the U.S. owed $859,999,766 in assessed contributions, broken down into different categories. The United States owed $1,231,008,190.87 in assessed contributions to the United Nations as of September 22, 2010. This included arrears for the U.N. regular budget, International Tribunals, Capital Master Plan, and peacekeeping assessed accounts. The U.N. Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1993 and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to investigate and prosecute serious crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in 1994 to investigate and prosecute genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda. The funding for the tribunal comes from a special assessed account, with contributions from U.N. member states based on the scale of assessments for the regular budget and peacekeeping operations. The United States contributes based on a 22% scale for each tribunal's account. The U.S. contributes to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda based on a 22% scale for each tribunal's account. The Security Council extended the terms of office for trial and appeals judges until December 31, 2012, and established a new body to finish the remaining tasks of the tribunals. The Security Council established a new body to complete the remaining tasks of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia by the end of 2014. A budget of $1.88 billion was approved by the U.N. General Assembly for the U.N. Capital Master Plan to be completed by 2014. The U.N. General Assembly approved an accelerated strategy for renovating the U.N. headquarters complex, with completion scheduled for 2013 instead of 2016. The entire Secretariat building would be emptied in one phase, offsetting increased leasing costs with lowered renovation costs. The main buildings in the complex were constructed between 1949 and 1952. The Dag Hammarskjold Library was completed in 1961, and no substantial renovation has occurred since then. A 2001 report highlighted that the buildings no longer met safety codes. In 2002, a plan for renovation was approved by the U.N. General Assembly. In 2002, a plan for the renovation of the U.N. headquarters was approved, including the construction of a \"swing space\" building financed separately. The estimated direct costs were $1.2 billion, with initial financing planned through a loan from the United States. The U.S. government offered a $1.2 billion interest-bearing loan to the United Nations for the Capital Master Plan, to be repaid over 30 years at 5.54% interest. However, the loan agreement was not authorized by the U.N. membership or the New York State Legislature. Louis Frederick Reuter, IV, was appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as Assistant Secretary-General-Executive Director of the Capital Master Plan. He recommended a phased renovation approach for the Secretariat and General Assembly buildings, estimating a total cost of $1.587 billion. Financing options were explored, with a multiyear assessment of U.N. member states deemed the most viable. Mr. Reuter recommended a multiyear assessment of U.N. member states for the Capital Master Plan, along with establishing a reserve fund of $45 million to ensure stable cash flow. The Assembly approved the CMP in December 2006, with a total project budget not to exceed $1,876.7 million for completion by 2014. The Assembly approved a total project budget of $1,876.7 million for the Capital Master Plan to be completed by 2014. Member states were apportioned amounts for the period from 2007 to 2011, with options for one-time payments or multiyear payments. Additionally, $42 million was allocated for design and pre-construction phases, and a working capital reserve of $45 million was established. The Assembly approved a letter of credit facility for the Capital Master Plan, with drawdown as a last resort. U.S. Congress appropriated a $6 million loan subsidy for the plan in 2004. Contributions to the United Nations are financed through the Contributions to International Organizations account. Congress appropriated $6 million in a loan subsidy for the United Nations Capital Master Plan, specifically for renovating its headquarters in New York. The funds are available to subsidize a total loan principal of up to $1.2 billion. The CIO account in the Appropriations Act is allocated for CMP planning and activities. Congress provided funds for a task force to oversee U.S. participation in the U.N. headquarters renovation project, with $1,000,000 set aside for this purpose. This provision has been included in subsequent appropriations acts. The Department of State Appropriations Act, 2008 includes a provision regarding the renovation loan for the United Nations headquarters building in New York not exceeding $600,000,000. The provision was in the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Act, 2008, but was not included in the final act signed by the President. On March 3, 2010, the U.N. Secretary-General announced the appointment of the Advisory Board for the Capital Master Plan. The U.N. Secretary-General announced the appointment of the Advisory Board of the Capital Master Plan for a two-year term starting January 1, 2010. This board was suggested by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2000 and approved by the General Assembly in 2002 to advise on financing and project issues. In 2005, prominent candidates declined to serve on the board due to the extensive knowledge and time commitment required. The newly appointed Advisory Board for the Capital Master Plan faced challenges such as implied liability, obtaining advice from experts, potential competition, lack of an executive director, and under-staffing. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Michael Adlerstein as executive director on July 2, 2007, who recommended an accelerated strategy and other changes. The Board held its first meeting on May 17 and 18, 2010, and its second meeting on September 13 and 14, 2010. In 2006, the Assembly recommended an accelerated strategy for the Capital Master Plan, which was approved in 2007. Progress in 2010 included relocating U.N. staff, opening new buildings, and temporary Security Council relocation. Congress has influenced U.S. policy at the United Nations through various means, including resolutions and hearings. Congress has influenced U.S. policy at the United Nations by reducing or increasing funding requests and withholding funding for certain programs. This includes prohibiting contributions for projects benefiting the PLO, SWAPO, and other activities not approved by Congress. The U.S. has withheld funds for various UN programs, including those related to Palestinians. Congress has influenced U.S. policy at the UN by adjusting funding levels and prohibiting contributions for certain projects. The United States adjusted its contributions for U.N. peacekeeping from 2006 to 2010 to comply with statutory limits set by Congress. This was done through amendments in various appropriations acts, allowing the U.S. to pay arrears attributed to the cap for assessments made during specific calendar years. The Senate passed a bill requiring the President to submit an annual report on U.S. contributions to the United Nations and affiliated agencies. The report would detail the total amount of contributions, percentage compared to other sources, and specifics of each contribution. The Senate passed a bill mandating an annual report on U.S. contributions to the United Nations and affiliated agencies, detailing the purpose and recipient of each contribution. This provision became law as Section 1225 of P.L. 109-364 (H.R. 5122) in 2007. During House consideration of H.R. 5672, a similar amendment was proposed but later withdrawn. The State Department issues an annual report on U.S. contributions to international organizations as required by P.L. 81-806. The report covers assessed and voluntary contributions but excludes international financial institutions and organizations with fewer than three members. The State Department issues an annual report on U.S. contributions to international organizations, covering assessed and voluntary contributions but excluding international financial institutions and organizations with fewer than three members. The report includes details on the cost to the U.S. government of salaries and expenses of U.S. employees, loans to be repaid, and contractual arrangements with organizations. The last published report was in July 1993 for FY1991, totaling 170 pages with three tables of special interest. The FY2004 report, only 10 pages long, is considered a minimum response to the reporting requirement. The reporting requirement for U.S. contributions to the U.N. system is no longer organized due to the absence of the last three charts. Various reporting requirements were in place, including a semiannual report on U.S. government voluntary contributions to international organizations and an annual report on U.S. participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. These reports lacked organization and analysis, with the latter report now required from the State Department. The 2008 and 2009 Annual Reports on United Nations Peacekeeping were transmitted to Congress. Reform of the United Nations has been an ongoing issue, with provisions in the Charter for potential changes. Congress has also made efforts to seek change at the United Nations. Recent congressional efforts have focused on making the United Nations more effective and efficient within budgetary constraints. Concerns arose in Congress between 1985 and 1988 regarding the use of regular budget funds and voting direction in the U.N. General Assembly. The Kassebaum-Solomon amendment was adopted in 1985 to reduce U.S. assessed contributions by 20% unless steps were taken to give major contributors more influence on budget questions. In December 1985, the U.N. General Assembly established a Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to review the efficiency of the United Nations. The Group proposed 71 recommendations, most of which were approved in 1986. The Assembly also adopted a revised budgeting process to give major contributing countries more influence. Congress recognized the U.N.'s response to concerns in 1987 with the State Department Authorization Act. The State Department Authorization Act, FY1988-1989, created a new payment schedule for U.S. contributions to the U.N. regular budget. 40% could be paid on October 1, another 40% when progress was certified in U.N. reform, and the remaining 20% after Congress received the certification. Congress had the option to prohibit the payment through a joint resolution. President Reagan certified progress in 1988 and released $44 million in 1987 and $144 million in 1988 for the U.N. regular budget. He also called for a plan to pay over $500 million in arrears over the next few years. Congress later stipulated that 10% of the U.S. assessed contribution to the U.N. regular budget would only be available upon certification by the Secretary of State regarding the establishment of an independent office similar to Inspectors General. The United Nations established an Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in 1994 to address \"waste, fraud, and abuse.\" The office, headed by an Under-Secretary General, conducts monitoring, auditing, and investigative activities. The U.S. government pushed for U.N. reform in the 1990s, tying payment of arrears to these reforms. In the 1990s, the U.S. government linked payment of arrears to United Nations reforms. High-level negotiations led to the Helms-Biden agreement, which conditioned arrears payments on specific reform benchmarks. P.L. 106-113 authorized appropriations for payment of U.S. arrears to international organizations, totaling $819 million. In the 1990s, the U.S. government linked payment of arrears to United Nations reforms. The Helms-Biden agreement authorized payment of $819 million, with $107 million forgiven if applied to reduce U.S. peacekeeping account arrears. U.S. conditions included reducing regular budget assessments to 22% and peacekeeping assessments to 25%. The U.N. General Assembly agreed to financial restructuring, reducing the U.S. share of the regular budget to 22% and peacekeeping to 28.14%. FY2005 appropriations legislation directed $1.5 million to the U.S. Institute for Peace. The U.S. Institute for Peace was directed to create a Task Force on the United Nations with a budget of $1.5 million. The Task Force, co-chaired by Newt Gingrich and George Mitchell, recommended reforms including an Independent Oversight Board, Chief Operating Officer, and greater independence for the Department of Peacekeeping. The House passed H.R. 2745, the Henry J. Hyde United Nations Reform Act of 2005, which included withholding 50% of U.S. assessed dues to the U.N. if certain reforms were not implemented. Key changes sought included making funding for 18 U.N. programs voluntary, creating an independent Oversight Board, establishing a U.N. Office of Ethics, and reducing funding for certain U.N. services. The House passed H.R. 2745, the Henry J.

The House passed H.R. 2745, the Henry J. Hyde United Nations Reform Act of 2005, which included withholding 50% of U.S. assessed dues to the U.N. if certain reforms were not implemented. The Bush Administration had reservations about the legislation due to withholding provisions and potential infringement on the President's foreign affairs authority. A U.N. reform measure was also introduced in the Senate, S. 1383, allowing the President to withhold U.S. contributions if sufficient progress on reforms was not made. Kofi Annan announced a two-track reform program in 1997 after being elected U.N. Secretary-General. Kofi Annan announced a two-track reform program in 1997. The first track included immediate managerial changes within the Secretary-General's authority, such as reducing budget and staffing levels. The second track focused on U.N. core missions and improving management efficiency, proposing a new leadership structure and overhauling human resources policies. The Strategic Planning Unit proposed significant changes at the U.N., including reducing jobs, cutting costs, promoting sustainable development, enhancing peacekeeping efforts, combating crime and terrorism, and revamping various departments and functions. Other proposals included refocusing the General Assembly's work, establishing a commission to review U.N. Charter, and designating the year 2000 General Assembly session as \"a Millennium Assembly.\" In 1997, the U.N. General Assembly affirmed policy formulations and management changes proposed by Secretary-General Annan, including creating a Deputy Secretary-General post. In 2000, the General Assembly authorized results-based budgeting for the 2003-2003 budget. In 2001, Annan was elected for a second term starting in 2002. In 2002, Annan called for additional reforms aligning U.N. activities with the 21st century. In 2004, the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change issued a report. The High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change issued a report with recommendations for significant changes in the U.N., including enlarging the Security Council and strengthening the role of the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General issued his own report, In Larger Freedom, based on these proposals for discussion at a U.N. summit in 2005. The 2005 U.N. Summit agreed to the 2005 World Summit Outcome resolution, which included reform measures.
