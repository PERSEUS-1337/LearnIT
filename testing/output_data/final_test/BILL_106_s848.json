    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the Otay Mountain region in California is a pristine location known for its unique plants and critical role in biodiversity conservation. The area's proximity to the border requires important law enforcement efforts to combat illegal immigration and protect wilderness values, presenting challenges for fire management. The rugged topography in the Otay Mountain region presents unique fire management challenges for protecting lives and resources. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"public land\" as specified in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"Wilderness Area\" as the Otay Mountain Wilderness. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION. Certain public land in California Desert District is designated as wilderness, comprising approximately 18,500 acres known as Otay Mountain Wilderness. The Wilderness Area designated in California Desert District shall have a map and legal description filed by the Secretary with relevant committees, with the same force and effect as if included in the Act. The map and legal description will be available for public inspection, and the Secretary will ensure the southern boundary of the Wilderness Area along the United States-Mexico Border. The Secretary will ensure that the southern boundary of the Wilderness Area is 100 feet north of the trail depicted on the map and not less than 100 feet from the United States-Mexico international border. SEC. 6. WILDERNESS REVIEW: Public land within the Southern Otay Mountain and Western Otay Mountain Wilderness Study Areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management have been adequately studied for wilderness designation and are no longer subject to certain management requirements. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION OF WILDERNESS AREA. The Wilderness Area shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act, with adjustments for effective dates and agency references. Due to its proximity to the US-Mexico border, common management actions include drug interdiction, border operations, and wildland fire management. The Wilderness Area is managed by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act, including drug interdiction, border operations, and wildland fire management. Management actions in the area must comply with the Wilderness Act and conditions set by the Secretary. Any land acquired by the United States within the Wilderness Area will become part of it and be managed according to wilderness area laws. The designation of the Wilderness Area will not create protective perimeters or buffer zones outside its boundaries, allowing nonwilderness activities outside the area."
