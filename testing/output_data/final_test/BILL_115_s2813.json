    "content": "The \"Local Cheese Promotion and Dairy Support Act of 2018\" provides assistance for small cheese producers under the Agricultural Adjustment Act by adding a new section for their support. The section defines eligible institutions as land-grant colleges, local offices of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, regional expert groups advising beginning farmers, and nonprofit organizations. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a grant program for small cheese producers, giving preference to those using locally sourced products. Grant funds can be used for equipment or renovations. The grant program for small cheese producers allows funds to be used for equipment, facility renovations, business development, marketing, financial literacy, food safety upgrades, and job training in cheese-making quality and production variety. The Secretary may allocate up to 10 percent of funds for a pilot project at eligible institutions to establish a cheese-making resource center, provide assistance to small cheese producers, and offer guidance from experienced producers or experts. To receive funding for a pilot project, an eligible institution must demonstrate capacity, technical expertise, support from the agricultural community, and available resources of value. The pilot project's mission is to receive $5,000,000 annually from 2019 to 2023 for implementation."
