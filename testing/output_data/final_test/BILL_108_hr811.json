The Congress finds that protecting children's health requires a caring adult involved in their life and a connection between the child and their school. Schools are crucial for community support and promoting health and education. Primary care and behavioral health services are essential for children's well-being. School safety and violence prevention are also critical. Children's well-being is crucial for optimal learning. Schools play a vital role in promoting good health and providing access to medical and mental health care. Increasing rates of behavioral and physical illnesses in children highlight the importance of early intervention. New prevention strategies are needed to address these challenges effectively. Effective prevention strategies must be community-based, designed, and implemented. Schools are ideal for providing health services to children with limited access, which can help reduce disease rates and the need for treatment. Higher disease rates lead to loss of vitality and more complications, even with adequate health services. School-based health programs should focus on improving behavioral and physical health, including addressing obesity. Effective community-based prevention programs result in significant savings for the Federal Government and States by reducing expenditures in health services programs. Savings should be reinvested in further prevention efforts to achieve more savings and should not be redirected to unrelated purposes or penalized by funding reductions. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS FOR EXPANSION OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide demonstration grants to expand school-based health programs operated by eligible entities. The program must be coordinated with various healthcare programs and agencies. The Act allows for demonstration grants to expand school-based health programs operated by eligible entities, including public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education or local educational agencies. These programs must provide preventive and behavioral health services, such as nutrition and physical activity, in coordination with other community entities. Grants under subsection (a) are limited to specific entities for expanding school-based health programs in Baltimore, Dallas, New Mexico, and Los Angeles. The grant program aims to expand school-based health programs in various locations such as Los Angeles, New Haven, and Chicago. Applications for the grant must be submitted to the Secretary in the required format with necessary information. The Secretary establishes health outcome goals for school-based health programs funded by grants, based on Healthy People 2010 objectives or other appropriate measures. Evaluations are conducted to assess program effectiveness in meeting goals and increasing children's access to health services. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2004, detailing the findings and recommendations for a national program providing grants for school-based health programs. This program aims to improve children's health status, reduce disease rates, and save costs in federal and state health services programs. Definitions for terms used in the section are provided: \"institution of higher education\" as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, \"local educational agency\" as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2003 through 2008 to carry out the section's purpose."
