    "content": "The Act titled \"Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2007\" focuses on the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to include a definition of a \"deficient dam\" as a dam that fails to meet minimum safety standards and poses an unacceptable risk to the public. The term 'publicly-owned dam' refers to a dam owned by State agencies, local governments, or nonprofit organizations established by governments that provide public benefits like flood control and water utilities. Rehabilitation refers to the repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to include a Program for Rehabilitation and Repair of Deficient Dams. \"Rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams are addressed in SEC. 8A.\" The Director will establish a program within FEMA to provide grant assistance to States for rehabilitating publicly-owned deficient dams. States can apply for grants by submitting an application with required information as prescribed by the Director. Grants may be awarded for dam rehabilitation based on the submitted application. The Director will enter into a project grant agreement with States for rehabilitating deficient dams. States receiving the grant must comply with requirements for Federal funds. The Director will establish a priority system in consultation with others. The Director, in consultation with the Board, will develop a risk-based priority system for identifying deficient dams eligible for grants. Funds allocated for grants to States will be divided equally among applying States and based on the number of non-Federal publicly-owned dams identified as a danger to human health within each State. The funds provided under this section cannot be used to rehabilitate Federal dams, perform routine maintenance, modify dams for hydroelectric power, increase water storage capacity, or make any modifications that do not improve dam safety. The Federal share of rehabilitation costs for deficient dams cannot exceed 65 percent. As a condition for receiving a grant under this section, a State must ensure that contracts for various services related to rehabilitation projects are awarded based on qualifications, following specific guidelines outlined in federal law or equivalent state requirements. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 2008 to 2012 includes amounts ranging from $10,000,000 to $100,000,000. Additionally, $400,000 is authorized for FEMA staff employment for fiscal years 2008 to 2010. Amounts made available under this section shall remain available until expended. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must issue a proposed rule within 90 days and a final rule within 120 days after the enactment of the Act regarding amendments to the National Dam Safety Program Act."
