    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hazardous Materials Cooperative Research Act of 2005\". Congress finds that there are over 1,000,000 hazardous material shipments per day in the United States, totaling 2,100,000,000 tons annually. Hazardous materials are transported by various modes, with 400,000 large trucks, 115,000 railroad tank cars, and 3,000 tank barges dedicated to this purpose. Multiple federal agencies are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of these shipments, along with state and local agencies. Various State and local agencies, along with industry groups and government entities at different levels, are responsible for regulating hazardous materials shipments. Federal agencies, State and local governments, carriers, shippers, and other groups continuously conduct research on the transportation of hazardous materials. There is a need for a cooperative research program involving all modes and actors in the transportation of hazardous materials to conduct national and multi-modal assessments. SEC. 3. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation may allocate up to $2,000,000 annually from funds under title 49 for a hazardous materials cooperative research program. An independent board will be established to select projects, with representatives from various transportation administrations. The hazardous materials cooperative research program includes representatives from various organizations such as government agencies, emergency responders, hazmat employers, manufacturers, and research institutions, among others. The Secretary of Transportation may allocate up to $2,000,000 annually for this program. The hazardous materials cooperative research program prioritizes cross-cutting studies that address gaps in existing research programs. Emphasis is placed on studies that enhance risk analysis, mitigation, and first responders' capabilities. One study must focus on integrating safety and security measures. The hazardous materials cooperative research program aims to integrate safety and security measures for transportation of hazardous materials, identify areas of conflict or complementarity in current safety measures, outline a comprehensive approach, and develop state and local risk response plans. Performance data for bulk containers is also a focus of the research program. The research program aims to provide recommendations for a nationwide system to collect and analyze performance data from bulk containers involved in transportation accidents. It also includes developing conditional release probabilities for container design specifications and identifying appropriate packaging requirements for hazardous materials frequently involved in release incidents. The research program aims to identify components for risk and consequence analysis in transportation for hazardous materials shipments and regulations. It also includes assessing response coverage for incidents and improving response capabilities. The research program aims to develop response guidelines for emergency responders and handlers dealing with hazardous materials incidents. The Secretary of Transportation will make grants to the National Academy of Sciences for implementation. A report must be transmitted to the Committee on Transportation within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will report to Congress on the effectiveness of the hazardous materials transportation research program. Definitions for \"hazmat employer\" and \"hazmat employee\" are provided in section 5102 of title 49, United States Code."
