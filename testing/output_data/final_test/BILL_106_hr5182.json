The \"Day Laborer Fairness and Protection Act\" defines key terms such as day laborer, day labor, and day labor service agency. A day laborer is an individual who contracts with a day labor service agency for occasional or irregular employment, with wage payments made by the agency or third party employer.

The \"Day Laborer Fairness and Protection Act\" defines key terms such as day labor service agency, Department, Secretary, and third party employer. A day labor service agency employs day laborers for third party employers under contract. SEC. 3. EQUAL WAGES. Equal Rate: A day labor service agency must notify third party employers of the wage rate to be paid, which should be equal to the rate paid to their permanent employees for similar work. Day laborers must be paid at least the stated wage rate for all work performed. Employers cannot reduce an employee's wage rate to comply with this requirement. (c) Agency Processing Delay: If a day labor service agency takes more than 30 minutes to process a day laborer's work assignment, they must pay the day laborer for the additional waiting time at a rate not less than the Fair Labor Standards Act or State minimum wage. Transit time to and from the work site or agency is not included in processing time.\n\n(d) Unpaid Wages: Any amounts owed to an employee that have been withheld in violation of the Act are considered unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation for enforcement purposes. Any employer who violates subsection (a) shall be liable to affected employees for damages equal to the amount of denied wages, plus interest. A criminal provision applies to employers or agents who willfully refuse to pay owed wages with the intent to defraud. Any employer who fails to pay wages due to an employee within 15 days of the order shall be fined 10 percent per day to the employee. A day labor service agency must provide a detailed deduction statement to each day laborer at the time of wage payment. Each day of violation of wage payment constitutes a separate offense.

The Act requires day labor service agencies to provide public access areas with restrooms and water. It prohibits agencies from restricting day laborers from accepting permanent positions with third-party employers or from offering employment to day laborers. Agencies can still receive placement fees from third-party employers for temporary work contracts. SEC. 5. INJURIES.
