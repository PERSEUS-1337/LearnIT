    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Judicial Mandate and Remedy Clarification Act of 1996.\" The Congress finds that a variety of judicial remedies are available for legal violations, and the imposition of taxes by courts is not necessary. Imposing taxes by judicial order is not appropriate and goes against American principles. Federal courts should not exceed their boundaries. Federal courts should not exceed their jurisdiction by imposing or increasing taxes through orders or settlements. Settlement agreements should align with existing frameworks. The Congress has the authority to limit and regulate the jurisdiction of federal courts, including limiting their remedial authority. Federal courts should not impose taxes, and Congress acknowledges that they have overstepped constitutional authority in some cases. The Federal courts should not impose taxes as a remedy for violations, and specific rules must be followed before any tax can be imposed as part of a settlement or order. Limitation on federal court remedies. Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to prohibit federal courts from ordering states or political subdivisions to impose taxes to enforce federal or state laws unless no other remedy is available and the tax is narrowly tailored to address the specific issue. The proposed tax must meet certain criteria: it should not worsen the deprivation, result in revenue loss for the political subdivision, decrease property values, violate tax laws, or exceed the maximum tax rate set by the appropriate authorities. Plans submitted by State and local authorities may not effectively address the issues at hand. A finding under this paragraph is subject to immediate review and shall be reviewed annually. Any aggrieved person residing in the political subdivision where a tax is imposed has the right to intervene in proceedings concerning the tax. Interveners can present evidence and appear before the court. Interveners can present evidence and appear before the court to present testimony, appeal findings related to tax imposition, and termination of taxes after 1 year if court findings are met. The court can terminate deprivation rights if deemed resolved, and this statute does not override State restrictions on tax use. Federal courts cannot use State taxes to fund orders and cannot compel tax changes. The court must make findings before ordering a political subdivision to impose taxes, and there is a presumption that tax imposition is not a narrowly tailored remedy for rights violations. If a Federal judge's use of judicial taxes is found illegal, this statute does not approve or validate it."
