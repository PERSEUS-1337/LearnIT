    "content": "The \"Minnesota MSA Empowerment Act of 2002\" establishes a deduction for Minnesota public employee MSAs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Minnesota MSA Empowerment Act of 2002\" allows eligible individuals to deduct contributions to the Minnesota public employee MSA, limited to $10,000 per year. Eligible individuals include those receiving retirement benefits from the State of Minnesota or its political subdivisions, or those over 45 years old who are employees with vested defined benefit plans. The Minnesota Public Employee MSA is an Archer MSA exclusively for paying qualified medical expenses. Contributions can only be made by the eligible individual or their employer, and trustee-to-trustee transfers are allowed. The Minnesota Public Employee MSA allows trustee-to-trustee transfers to and from another Minnesota public employee MSA, with specific requirements for the trustee. The terms 'Archer MSA' and 'qualified medical expenses' are defined in section 220(d). Special rules apply to Minnesota public employee MSAs, including exceptions to certain subsections. Inflation adjustments are made to the dollar amount in subsection (b) for taxable years after 2003. In the case of a Minnesota public employee MSA, reports must include the fair market value of assets at the end of each calendar year and be provided to the account holder by January 31 of the following year as prescribed by the Secretary. Coordination with the limitation on the number of taxpayers is required. The deduction for Minnesota public employee MSAs is allowed whether or not the taxpayer itemizes. Tax on excess contributions to Archer MSAs is also applicable to Minnesota public employee MSAs. Coordination with the limitation on the number of taxpayers is necessary. The table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding new items. The amendments made by this section regarding Minnesota public employee MSAs and cross references apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
