    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002\". The Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002 finds that cable modem services and digital subscriber line services compete and should be regulated in the same manner by the Federal Communications Commission. The Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002 states that broadband providers should be regulated equally regardless of the platform used. Government regulation should not show favoritism among competitors. Inappropriate regulation leads to higher costs for consumers, while regulatory certainty and parity can lower costs and increase demand for high-speed internet services. Regulatory certainty and parity will incentivize high-speed Internet deployment, benefiting communities with improvements in medicine, education, national security, and work from home. The US lags behind other countries in high-speed data services deployment. Consumer choice and lower prices will result from fair competition among broadband providers under the same rules. SEC. 262 of the Communications Act of 1934 aims to establish parity in regulatory treatment between broadband service providers and broadband access service providers. This will promote fair competition, consumer choice, and lower prices, ultimately incentivizing high-speed Internet deployment for the benefit of various sectors such as medicine, education, national security, and remote work. The Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002 mandates regulations to ensure equal regulatory requirements for all broadband services and providers, without increasing existing regulations. The Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002 prohibits state jurisdiction over broadband services and access, ensuring incumbent local exchange carriers provide necessary telecommunications to internet service providers for broadband access. The Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002 ensures that incumbent local exchange carriers provide telecommunications services to internet service providers for broadband access on just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions. This section also includes savings provisions that do not affect certain requirements and obligations under the Communications Act of 1934. The Broadband Regulatory Parity Act of 2002 defines 'broadband service' as any service used to access the Internet with a minimum transmission rate of 256 kilobits per second and 'broadband access service' as a service combining processing, storage, routing, and transmission for Internet access."
