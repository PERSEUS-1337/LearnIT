    "content": "The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-276) includes provisions for bioterrorism-related procurement, emergency use of countermeasures not FDA-approved, and a 10-year program to develop new countermeasures for CBRN agents. Project BioShield focuses on procuring developed countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile, allowing the government to enter contracts for procurement up to eight years before completion. Project BioShield allows the government to enter contracts to procure countermeasures in development up to eight years before delivery. The government guarantees purchase at a specified price once requirements are met, with payment only upon delivery to the Strategic National Stockpile. If requirements are not met, the contract can be cancelled without payment. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act modified Project BioShield to allow milestone-based payments. The Project BioShield Act (P.L. 109-417) allows milestone-based payments for up to half of the total award before countermeasure delivery. The procurement process involves actions by DHS, HHS, and the President, with a Material Threat Assessment (MTA) determining if a CBRN agent poses a national security threat. The DHS Secretary makes a Material Threat Determination (MTD) based on the MTA analysis. The Material Threat Determination (MTD) for procurement using BioShield funds does not prioritize agents or guarantee countermeasures. DHS has issued MTDs for 13 agents, including biological and radiological/nuclear agents. The first four MTDs were completed before the Project BioShield Act, with nine more issued in September 2006. HHS stated no additional MTDs would be issued unless necessary. In 2006, nine MTDs were issued by HHS. HSPD-10 and HSPD-18 direct DHS to perform risk assessments for biological agents. The assessments help prioritize federal planning and response to biological agent threats. HSPD-18 requires a comprehensive risk assessment integrating all CBRN agents by June 1, 2008. The risk assessment required by HSPD-18 must be completed by June 1, 2008 to prioritize CBRN countermeasure research and acquisition. DHS contributes to the process by developing attack scenarios and HHS assesses public health consequences for agents with MTDs. OPHEMC, under ASPR, coordinates the analysis and determines the need for new countermeasures using Project BioShield authorities. The HHS and DHS Secretaries may recommend using BioShield funds to acquire countermeasures, with HHS responsible for establishing requirements and managing the contracting process. OPHEMC coordinates the process with input from interagency working groups, and HHS maintains a website detailing all Project BioShield solicitations and awards. The implementation of Project BioShield has faced criticism, leading to the creation of BARDA under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. HHS plans to expand OPHEMC's responsibilities and rename it as the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority, including funding for countermeasure development. Presidential approval is required for Project BioShield contracts. The President delegates approval for procurement contracts and countermeasure development to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, following a joint recommendation from the Secretaries of HHS and DHS. The interagency process for priority-setting involves multiple agencies such as HHS, DHS, Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies. The process was changed by HSPD-18, directing the HHS Secretary to lead the interagency efforts. The interagency process for priority-setting involves multiple agencies such as HHS, DHS, Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies. The WMD MCM Subcommittee, part of the NSTC Committee on Homeland and National Security, plays a key role in coordinating science and technology policy related to biodefense. The Public Health and Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) is an interagency working group established in July 2006 to define and prioritize requirements for public health medical emergency countermeasures. It involves various government agencies such as HHS, DHS, Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies. The Public Health and Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) coordinates research, development, and procurement of medical countermeasures for public health emergencies. It is an interagency working group that sets deployment strategies for the Strategic National Stockpile. The Director of the HHS Office of Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures (OPHEMC) also oversees PHEMCE. The membership and reporting structure of PHEMCE are not clearly defined. The transfer of duties from the NSTC to PHEMCE may impact the efficiency of the Project BioShield acquisition process. HSPD-18, issued in 2007, aims to change the interagency process by establishing a government-wide strategy for acquiring civilian WMD countermeasures. It requires the HHS Secretary to set up an interagency committee for medical countermeasure requirements and a strategic planning activity. The HHS Secretary is required to establish a strategic planning activity to integrate risk-based requirements for medical countermeasures. The PHEMCE strategy aligns HHS programs to fulfill the interagency committee and planning activity requirements of HSPD-18. The interagency committee must inform the Biodefense Policy Coordination Committee of countermeasure progress. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act may also impact Project BioShield decision-making. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417), enacted in December 2006, affects the Project BioShield interagency decision-making process. It requires the HHS Secretary to develop a strategic plan integrating biodefense and emerging infectious disease requirements with research, development, and procurement of countermeasures. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-90), provided $5.593 billion for civilian medical countermeasures procurement from FY2004-FY2013. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004 established the \"Biodefense Countermeasures\" account with $5.593 billion for civilian medical countermeasures procurement from FY2004-FY2013. Only a portion of the funds became available for obligation upon enactment, with specific limits on obligations in FY2004 and FY2004 through FY2008. Any unobligated funds would remain available through FY2013. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 designated the \"Biodefense Countermeasures\" account as a special reserve fund for acquisitions. It placed restrictions on fund use, requiring a material threat determination, Presidential approval for purchases, and limiting funds to procurements only. Countermeasures against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents could be acquired from this account. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 established a special reserve fund for acquisitions of countermeasures against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents. Congress has the power to adjust the funding for Project BioShield, with two rescissions totaling $25 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 reduced the amount available for obligation in FY2004 by $5 million, resulting in a total reduction of $5.588 billion for FY2004-FY2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 reduced the amount available for obligation for Project BioShield from $5.593 billion to $5.588 billion. An across-the-board rescission of 0.8% removed $20 million from the available funds for FY2005-FY2008. This reduced the total special reserve fund by an equal amount, resulting in a decrease to $2.508 billion for FY2005 and $5.568 billion until FY2013. Future across-the-board rescissions are unlikely to affect the special reserve fund, except in FY2009 when the remaining $2.175 billion becomes available. In FY2009, $2.175 billion becomes available for Project BioShield obligations. Congress can adjust the funding amount. HHS has awarded $2.331 billion in contracts for Bacillus anthracis, smallpox, botulinum toxin, and radiological/nuclear threats. Distribution of awards: $1.429 billion for Bacillus anthracis, $500 million for smallpox, $364 million for botulinum toxin, and $38 million for radiological/nuclear threats. Additional requests for countermeasure information have not led to contracts. The HHS terminated an anthrax countermeasure contract in 2006 due to failure to meet milestones, resulting in the cancellation of the first and largest Project BioShield-funded contract. Despite multiple countermeasure requests, no contract offers have been made. The HHS has obligated $1.454 billion to date for government acquisitions, following a pattern of information gathering, contract solicitation, award, and product delivery. The HHS issues RFIs to identify products for government needs, which can be broad or specific. RFIs help shape policy and contract requirements but don't always lead to solicitations. Some Project BioShield RFIs did not result in contract offers. The HHS issues RFIs to identify products for government needs, which can be broad or specific. RFIs help shape policy and contract requirements but don't always lead to solicitations. Four of the eight contract solicitations did not have an RFI and were for specific products from specific companies, not subject to open competition. Project BioShield solicitations fall into two categories: sole source and Requests for Proposals (RFP). Four of the eight contract solicitations were sole source, including AVA-based anthrax vaccine, botulinum antitoxin, and radiation treatments. The other four solicitations went through the RFP process, resulting in contracts for rPA-based anthrax vaccine, anthrax therapeutics, and MVA-based smallpox vaccine. The government awarded contracts for anthrax therapeutics and smallpox vaccine. Some contracts were terminated due to not meeting requirements. Project BioShield awarded contracts to six companies, with some completed through sole source contracting. HHS awarded contracts for products through Project BioShield, some requiring further development. Five contracts were for products needing development, but none have been delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile yet. The rPA anthrax vaccine contract was cancelled, while development continues for the remaining four products. Project BioShield's countermeasures against anthrax include vaccines and treatments. The rPA anthrax vaccine, a second-generation vaccine, was developed for postexposure prophylaxis after an anthrax attack. The Institute of Medicine supported the development of this new vaccine due to shortcomings in the current AVA vaccine. HHS awarded VaxGen, Inc. an $877.5 million contract for the delivery of 75 million doses of the rPA vaccine in 2004. In 2004, HHS awarded VaxGen, Inc. an $877.5 million contract for the delivery of 75 million doses of rPA vaccine to the Strategic National Stockpile. The contract was terminated in 2006 due to VaxGen's failure to meet a milestone. The vaccine required additional clinical testing before acceptance by the government, and delivery was repeatedly delayed due to technical difficulties. Critics have scrutinized this contract award. Critics question HHS' decision to award VaxGen an $877.5 million contract for an rPA vaccine due to the company's past failures and financial issues. HHS defended the decision, citing a rigorous evaluation process. Delays in vaccine development were attributed to changing government requirements. After the contract was canceled, HHS reaffirmed its commitment to obtaining an rPA-based anthrax vaccine for the Strategic National Stockpile. The FDA-approved anthrax vaccine regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis requires six doses over 18 months. The DOD uses this vaccine for personnel in certain areas. Judicial review prompted a halt to mandatory vaccinations, which later resumed in 2006. Several DOD employees planned to sue to block mandatory vaccinations. Employees plan to sue to block implementation of mandatory vaccinations. HHS awarded contracts to Emergent BioSolutions for 10 million doses of AVA vaccine for $242.7 million. Critics question the high cost and adverse reactions associated with the vaccine. Emergent BioSolutions defended AVA vaccine as safe and filling an urgent need. ABthrax, an antibody-based treatment, is under development with a high cost per dose. Human Genome Sciences received a contract for 20 thousand doses of ABthrax for $165.2 million. ABthrax and Anthrax Immune Globulin are antibody-based therapeutics with high costs per dose, suggesting they would be used as treatments for those already infected with anthrax. Anthrax Immune Globulin is derived from vaccinated individuals' blood and is still under development. The United States acquired a new smallpox vaccine due to high complications with the current vaccine, especially for vulnerable populations. The new vaccine, based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral strain, was awarded a $500 million contract for 20 million doses. The new smallpox vaccine based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral strain is considered safer for vulnerable populations. HHS plans to use it as a pre-exposure prophylactic following a smallpox release. Additional research is needed before FDA approval. A $1.1 billion contract includes options for 60 million additional doses and clinical research for children, the elderly, and HIV-infected individuals. Cangene Corp. was awarded a $362.6 million contract for botulinum antitoxin to treat botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Delivery is expected by the end of 2007. The contract for heptavalent antitoxin against seven types of botulinum toxins is expected to be delivered by the end of 2007. The antitoxin, extracted from horse blood, would be administered to those showing symptoms of toxin exposure. $50 million was obligated from the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004 to support the botulinum antitoxin. After the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act was enacted, $50 million was allocated to support the botulinum antitoxin program. The funds were used to process horse blood collected by the DOD and establish horse farms for new blood. These funds were not eligible for Project BioShield Act funding, as it limited funds to procuring products. HHS contracted for countermeasures against radiation sickness and radioactive contamination. HHS contracted for countermeasures to address radiation sickness and contamination. Contracts were awarded for liquid potassium iodide to treat exposure to radioactive iodine. Potassium iodide can protect the thyroid gland from injury caused by radioactive iodine. Potassium iodide can protect the thyroid gland from injury caused by radioactive iodine. Liquid preparation designed for pediatric use. HHS awarded a contract for chelators to treat exposure to radioactive material from various sources. The curr_chunk discusses the use of chelators for internal decontamination after a dirty bomb or nuclear attack, as radioactive materials can be incorporated into organs and emit radiation. The Project BioShield fund manages resources for this purpose. The Federal Emergency Management Agency transfers funds to the Preparedness Directorate through HHS OPHEMC. In FY2004, $885 million was available for obligation, with all budget authority obligated that year. In FY2005, $2.508 billion became available, with $189 million obligated and $2.324 billion carried over to FY2006. FY2006 saw $856 million obligated, leaving $1.468 billion for FY2007. Anticipated obligations for FY2007 are $1.045 billion, leaving $423 million for FY2008. In FY2004, $885 million was available for obligation, with $50 million obligated for the botulinum antitoxin program. However, conflicting figures arise from countermeasure awards reported by HHS. The President's FY2006 Budget documents state that $885 million was obligated in FY2004, with $190 million for \"other services\" and $695 million for \"other purchases of goods and services from Government accounts\". The exact nature of these amounts is unclear. The $50 million HHS obligated for the botulinum antitoxin program support may fall under the \"other services\" category, but the amount does not correlate. There is a possibility that the rPA vaccine contract was accounted for in FY2004 instead of FY2005. The total obligation exceeds the budget authority in FY2004. In FY2005, HHS awarded three contracts totaling $1.008 billion for bio-defense countermeasures. The DHS FY2007 Congressional Justification documents list the rPA, KI, and AVA contracts as accomplishments. The discrepancy in funding amounts between HHS and the President's Budget continues in FY2006, with HHS reporting $824 million in obligations. The President's FY2008 Budget states $32 million less in actual obligations compared to FY2006. There is a discrepancy in reporting between the President's Budget and HHS documents, with $48 million more obligated according to the Budget. Clear knowledge of remaining funds is crucial for effective management and oversight of Project BioShield. The amount of funds remaining available is unclear due to conflicting statements from executive branch agencies. HHS reports $2.331 billion obligated as of June 2007, excluding $878 million. Project BioShield has obligated $2.331 billion as of June 2007, with an additional $878 million expected to be recovered. This leaves $1.889 billion available for obligation in FY2007-FY2008 and $4.064 billion until the program's end in FY2013. The initiative plays a vital role in the government's response to terrorism threats by purchasing countermeasures in development, aiming to boost the Strategic National Stockpile and incentivize companies to develop countermeasures. Project BioShield aims to encourage companies to develop countermeasures and address concerns about the rate of Material Threat Determinations. Legislation has been introduced to assess all known CBRN agents by December 31, 2007. The Project BioShield program aims to prioritize and balance countermeasure acquisition strategies for CBRN threats. HHS has not issued contracts for all agents with MTDs, but predicts no new MTDs unless technology advances or threat understanding changes. Appropriators set limits on obligated funds, and HHS awards contracts at a pace aligned with these limits, indicating progress towards program goals. The Project BioShield program is progressing towards its goals, with HHS unable to spend money faster than it becomes available. Critics have raised concerns about some countermeasures chosen by HHS, but the program allows for contracts that require up to eight years of development, shifting the development risk to the company rather than the government. The government bears the majority of the development risk in Project BioShield, with the possibility of contracts being cancelled due to product failure. The establishment of BARDA may reduce the likelihood of contract failures during advanced development. BARDA, established under P.L. 109-417, aims to support advanced research and development of countermeasures to reduce the risk of failure under Project BioShield contracts. Approximately $1 billion was authorized for this purpose for FY2007 through FY2008, with $99 million transferred from NIH accounts in FY2007 to fund BARDA. It will take time to determine projects to fund and see returns on investments. HHS is working to address criticisms of the Project BioShield procurement process by publishing its PHEMCE Strategy for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threats, inviting public comment, and reaching out to stakeholders. Critics suggest that the Project BioShield process has been poorly managed, with annual accounting discrepancies between HHS and DHS. It remains to be seen how the decision to combine BARDA with the HHS office responsible for Project BioShield will impact both programs. Accounting discrepancies between HHS and DHS are being addressed through management changes following the establishment of PHEMCE, the enactment of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, and the issuance of HSPD-18."
