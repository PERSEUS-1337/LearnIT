The Congress finds that the USPSTF and Canadian Preventive Services Task Force recommend against screening for suicide, citing limited evidence on the accuracy of screening tools. The Surgeon General's 1999 report acknowledged conflicts in defining mental health and illness. The challenge of defining mental health has hindered the development of programs to promote mental well-being. Diagnosis of mental disorders is complex due to the lack of definitive laboratory tests, especially in children where the science is challenging due to ongoing development. The criteria for mental illness diagnosis in children and adolescents are challenging due to the overlap between signs of disorders and normal development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual acknowledges the vagueness of diagnostic criteria and the subjectivity of behavioral characteristics. This subjectivity makes it easy for psychiatrists to label individuals. The 1998 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference stated that further research is needed to establish ADHD as a brain disorder, along with other psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. Psychiatrists may easily label disagreements with their political beliefs as mental disorders. A school violence prevention program suggested that children with traditional values may be prone to instigating violence. There has been a significant increase in the prescription rates of psychiatric drugs in children, with a 300-percent rise in psychotropic drug use in young children from 1991 to 1995 and a similar increase in children from 1987 to 1996. More money is spent on psychiatric drugs for children than on antibiotics or asthma medication. The cause of ADHD remains speculative despite years of clinical research and experience. The FDA found that most studies on antidepressants for depressed children were no more effective than placebos, with only positive trials being published by the pharmaceutical industry. The lack of effectiveness of antidepressants in pediatric populations has been known since at least 2000. The Surgeon General's report questioned the long-term benefits of stimulant medication like Ritalin for pediatric populations. The FDA revealed in 2004 that newer antidepressants are linked to suicidal thoughts in children, with Prozac being the only approved drug for use in children. Other potential side effects of psychiatric medication exist. Possible side effects of psychiatric medication in children include mania, violence, dependence, weight gain, insomnia, cardiac toxicity, growth suppression, psychosis, violence, and diabetes. Parents are pressured to medicate their children, leading to tragic outcomes. Mandatory mental health screening and treatments may exacerbate this issue. The Johnston Family, Salazar Family faced child abuse charges for refusing psychiatric medications. Supreme Court ruled parents have right to direct children's upbringing. Mandatory mental health screening violates parental rights. Federal funds shouldn't support programs leading to over-medication or stigmatization of children. The curr_chunk discusses the potential violation of Americans' liberty and privacy through mandatory mental health screening, which could lead to sensitive information being accessible to government officials and special interests without the patient's consent. The curr_chunk prohibits federal funding for universal or mandatory mental health screening. The curr_chunk prohibits federal funding for universal or mandatory mental health screening programs, and restricts the use of refusal to consent as a basis for child abuse or education neglect charges. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for individuals who are automatically screened for mental health treatment, including specific programs and age restrictions."
