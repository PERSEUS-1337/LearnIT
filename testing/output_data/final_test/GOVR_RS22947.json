The EFV is designed to launch 25 miles offshore for over the horizon operations, but concerns exist about its vulnerability to enemy fire. The EFV is a high-speed amphibious vehicle designed to transport Marines from ships to inland objectives. It is armored, fully tracked, and can carry 17 combat-equipped Marines. Concerns have been raised about its vulnerability to enemy attacks, such as the 2006 Hezbollah C-802 cruise missile attack. The EFV is a high-speed amphibious vehicle with a 345-mile range and 45-kilometer-per-hour speed on hard-surfaced roads. It is designed with modular armor, mine blast protection, and a 30mm cannon in a stabilized turret. The EFV can communicate in joint networks and operate as part of a joint land force. There are two variants - EFV-P1 for carrying a Marine rifle squad and providing direct fire support, and EFV-C1 for command and control capabilities. It is the Marines' top priority ground weapon system acquisition program and the only ACAT 1D program managed by the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps EFV Program Office is collocated with the prime contractor, General Dynamics, in Woodbridge, VA. The Marine Corps EFV program, managed by General Dynamics, has successfully reduced design costs and streamlined decision-making processes. The program has progressed through various phases, winning awards for cost and technology management. General Dynamics was awarded a contract in 1996 for full-scale engineering development, followed by a cost-plus contract in 2001 for the Systems Development and Demonstration phase. In July 2001, General Dynamics and the Marines began the Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the program, aiming to complete it by October 2003. However, the schedule was deemed too ambitious. In 2003, the program was renamed the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that the original SDD schedule was too short to allow for necessary testing and design changes. As a result, the EFV program was \"rebaselined\" in November 2002, adding an additional year to the schedule. The EFV program was rebaselined in November 2002 and again in March 2003, adding extra time to the schedule. In December 2004, EFV prototypes faced major failures with the hull electronics unit and bow flap, leading to reliability issues and a reduced mean time between operational mission failure rate. The EFV program faced major failures in December 2004, leading to reliability issues and a reduced mean time between operational mission failure rate. In 2006, the EFV failed an Operational Assessment due to critical failures and repeated breakdowns, not meeting reliability requirements. The vehicles could only operate for 4.5 hours between breakdowns, requiring 3.4 hours of corrective maintenance for every 1 hour of operation. The EFV program faced major failures in December 2004, leading to reliability issues and a reduced mean time between operational mission failure rate. In 2006, the EFV failed an Operational Assessment due to critical failures and repeated breakdowns, not meeting reliability requirements. The vehicles could only operate for 4.5 hours between breakdowns, requiring 3.4 hours of corrective maintenance for every 1 hour of operation. Poor reliability resulted in 117 Operational Mission Failures and 645 Unscheduled Maintenance Actions during testing, with significant problems in limited visibility, excessive noise, and difficulty in reloading the main gun. The EFV prototypes were too heavy to achieve desired high water speed and had issues accommodating equipment needed by Marines for special climatic conditions. Marines \"went back to the drawing board\" after the 2006 Operational Assessment. In response to failures and reliability issues, the EFV program faced setbacks including cost breaches and performance requirement relaxations. The Marines awarded General Dynamics additional funds for redesign, leading to a repeat of the SDD phase with a new completion date of 2011, eight years behind schedule. In 2008, the Marines and General Dynamics signed a contract for seven new EFV prototypes with upgraded features. The EFV passed its Critical Design Review in December 2008, with mature critical technologies and a stable design, allowing for the establishment of critical manufacturing processes. The EFV prototypes have undergone critical manufacturing processes after passing the CDR. The new prototypes include 400 engineering design improvements to enhance reliability, potentially adding weight. The Marines have received four EFV prototypes for testing at Camp Pendleton, with plans for reliability testing to run through late January 2011. The EFV prototypes have undergone critical manufacturing processes and 500 hours of reliability testing. Marine officials have reported no significant surprises in the vehicle's performance. The program will cost $11.163 billion to field 573 EFVs, with concerns about the high cost potentially consuming 90% of the Marines' ground equipment budget. General James Conway expressed concerns about affordability with potential defense budget cuts. Terminating the EFV program would cost approximately $185 million. The EFV program faces concerns about vulnerability to IEDs due to its flat-bottomed design. Marines suggest adding underbelly armor after landing for protection. They believe the vehicle's mobility can help evade IEDs, but critics argue this assumption ignores potential threats. The EFV program faces concerns about vulnerability to IEDs due to its flat-bottomed design. Marines suggest adding underbelly armor after landing for protection. Secretary of Defense Gates directed the QDR team to assess the need for a new capability to transport troops from ship to shore, questioning the necessity of amphibious actions in the 21st century. The 2010 QDR did not recommend eliminating the EFV. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) did not recommend canceling the EFV program or eliminating major amphibious operations capabilities. The Sustainable Defense Task Force suggested canceling the EFV program to save $8-9 billion between 2011 and 2020, proposing to refurbish current AAV7A1s and build an updated version instead. The Navy and DOD are conducting a review of the EFV business case in response to a June 2010 GAO Report. The Marines are conducting a force structure review to determine the Corps' post-Afghanistan size and equipment needs, focusing on returning to amphibious roots and vehicle requirements. Secretary of Defense Gates ordered a review to define a distinct 21st-century mission for the Marines separate from the Army. The Marines are conducting a force structure review to define a 21st-century mission separate from the Army. Secretary of Defense Gates recommended terminating the EFV due to its aggressive requirements resulting in a heavy armored vehicle for amphibious assaults. The EFV, originally conceived during the Reagan administration, has faced significant technology problems, development delays, and cost increases. It has already consumed over $3 billion to develop and will cost another $12 billion to build. Fully executing the EFV would consume the entire Marine vehicle budget and most of its total procurement budget. Recent analysis suggests that existing air and sea systems could handle scenarios requiring power projection from the sea. The decision to cancel the EFV program was made due to its high costs and the belief that existing air and sea systems could handle power projection from the sea. Secretary Gates assured that the Marines' amphibious assault mission would not be affected, and funds would be allocated for a more affordable amphibious assault vehicle. The Marine Corps will be seeking industry support for their required amphibious capabilities. Reports suggest that the Marines will release requests for information to develop solutions for the \"New Amphibious Assault Vehicle\" and accelerate the Marine Personnel Carrier development. Congressional opposition may challenge Secretary Gates's decision to cancel the EFV program, with concerns about the Marines' amphibious assault capabilities and potential job losses in manufacturing. Members have sent letters opposing the EFV cancellation to the President and Secretary of Defense Gates. Some Members oppose canceling the EFV program and suggest funding ongoing testing for future amphibious vehicle development. General Dynamics proposes building 200 EFVs to save termination costs. General Dynamics proposes building 184 EFVs for amphibious lift, saving $6 billion in costs. Approval of $243 million in FY2011 and $129 million in FY2012 is needed. If successful, redirected funds could be used for a New Amphibious Vehicle (NAV) and upgrading current AAVs. Marines plan to allocate $500 million to NAV and $1 billion to AAV over five years. The Marines plan to allocate $500 million to the New Amphibious Vehicle (NAV) and $1 billion to upgrading current AAVs over five years. Additionally, they are considering using $200 million to recapitalize the HMMWV fleet, $400 million to develop the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC), and $488 million for general procurement needs. A new competition has been initiated to upgrade existing AAVs and develop a successor to the EFV, now called the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). The Marines are looking for a new Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) to carry a squad-sized force from a 12-mile distance from shore, maneuver with Marine units, and have a counter-IED capability. General James Amos aims to field the ACV within four years. Congress may evaluate General Dynamics' proposal to build 200 ACVs instead of 573 based on performance in operational testing. Testing is reportedly exceeding requirements by 90 percent, but final decisions are pending. The Marines are considering the acquisition of technologically advanced EFVs, with General Dynamics proposing a procurement of 200 vehicles. However, if the EFV program is terminated as Secretary Gates intends, there could be potential cost savings and knowledge transfer for the AAV upgrade and ACV programs. Congress may need to examine the implications of this decision. Congress should consider examining the Marines' plan to migrate EFV technologies to the ACV to ensure value added and cost-effectiveness. They may also review the ambitious timeline for fielding the ACV by 2024, as opposed to General Amos' initial desire for a quicker acquisition process similar to the MRAP vehicle. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James Amos, has committed to fielding the ACV within four years, raising questions about the feasibility of this timeline. Some believe rushing the development and testing process to meet this deadline may not be advisable."
