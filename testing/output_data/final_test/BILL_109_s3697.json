This allows individuals to elect to receive benefits through these accounts. The Medicare Health Savings Accounts Act of 2006 allows eligible beneficiaries to choose benefits from a Medicare Health Savings Account instead of parts A, B, or D. Eligible beneficiaries must be entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled in part B, have a health savings account or certify their intent to establish one, and be enrolled in a high deductible health plan. The Medicare Health Savings Accounts Act of 2006 allows eligible beneficiaries to choose benefits from a Medicare Health Savings Account instead of parts A, B, or D. The Secretary will establish procedures for Medicare Health Savings Accounts to be available starting January 1, 2007. Individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled in part B can still receive those benefits if they do not elect to use a Medicare Health Savings Account. Personal funds can be deposited by individuals. Individuals can deposit personal funds into a Medicare Health Savings Account, subject to contribution limitations under section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Medicare Health Savings Accounts program allows individuals to deposit personal funds, with contribution limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Medicare Health Savings Accounts program, also known as the Medicare HSA program, provides individuals with an amount equal to 95% of the annual MA capitation rate for the Medicare Advantage payment area they are in. This amount can only be used for specific purposes, such as contributing to a health savings account. The Medicare HSA program provides individuals with an amount for specific purposes like contributing to a health savings account or paying premiums for a high deductible health plan. The Secretary ensures individuals are notified of the amount provided 90 days before payment is made. Payment of the amount provided under the Medicare HSA program will be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. In case of termination before the end of a plan year, a procedure for recovery of remaining amounts will be implemented. The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty of up to 25 percent of the recovered amount if fraud is found in the termination of a plan year. The provisions of section 1128A apply to this penalty in the same manner as they apply to civil money penalties under section 1128A(a). The Secretary will establish procedures for providers and suppliers to accept payment for items and services provided to Medicare HSA program enrollees based on original Medicare fee-for-service rates.

References to previous parts of the Social Security Act will be deemed as references to the updated part. Amendments will be made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding Medicare eligible individuals. The amendment made by this subsection will set the zero premium for individuals receiving benefits under parts A, B, or D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act starting from January 1, 2007. Additionally, the MSA plan will no longer be available as a Medicare Advantage plan beginning on the same date. Starting from January 1, 2007, the MSA plan will no longer be available as a Medicare Advantage plan under this part."
