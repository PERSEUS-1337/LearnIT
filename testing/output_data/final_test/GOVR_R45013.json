    "content": "The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense and defense-related activities of other federal agencies. It establishes defense policies and restrictions, addressing organizational administrative matters. Congressional action on the FY2018 NDAA reflected a debate about the defense budget given budgetary issues facing the United States. Annual limits on discretionary spending set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 remain in place through FY2021, shaping congressional actions on federal spending, including defense funding. Congress and the executive branch face a complex and unpredictable international security environment with threats from nonstate violent extremist organizations, Russian-backed proxy warfare, North Korean missile tests, China's nuclear expansion, and Iran's support for terrorist organizations. Congress completed action on the FY2018 NDAA before the Trump Administration's updates. The Trump Administration's initial FY2018 budget request served as a placeholder while strategic assessments were being completed. An exception was the $5.9 billion amendment for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, including funds for deploying 3,500 more personnel. The requested amounts were incorporated into the enacted version of the NDAA. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA/ P.L. 112-25) enacted measures to reduce the budget deficit by $2.1 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. It established annual limits on discretionary spending, with separate caps on defense and nondefense budgets enforced by sequestration. Sequestration automatically cancels previously appropriated spending to meet the limits specified in the BCA. Defense outlays have increased significantly over the past six decades, projected to reach $662.3 billion in 2022. In contrast, net mandatory spending is projected to increase at a much higher rate, reaching $3.16 trillion in the same year. The share of federal spending on defense has decreased from 49.2% in 1962 to 13.7% in 2022, while mandatory spending and interest on the national debt are projected to account for 76.2% of outlays in 2022. The defense share of the GDP has also declined steadily since 1962. The Trump Administration proposed a $603 billion base budget for national defense discretionary spending in FY2018, $54 billion above the BCA cap. Without statutory changes, this would trigger sequestration. The proposal called for raising defense discretionary caps for FY2018 and beyond, while maintaining BCA-like limits on nondefense discretionary spending through FY2027. The Trump Administration proposed a $603 billion base budget for national defense discretionary spending in FY2018, exceeding the BCA cap. The proposal included raising defense discretionary caps for FY2018 and beyond, while maintaining limits on nondefense discretionary spending through FY2027. The President's budget plan suggested a $1 trillion reduction in federal discretionary spending, with projected defense spending increases offset by significant cuts in nondefense spending. The House and Senate passed versions of the FY2018 NDAA that disregarded the defense spending cap, potentially triggering sequestration. The caps on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense programs in FY2018 and FY2019 were increased as part of P.L. 115-123, allowing for a base budget of $629 billion for discretionary defense appropriations in FY2018. President Trump directed a \"30-day Readiness Review\" of military readiness, leading to a $30 billion budget request to address immediate challenges. The FY2018 Budget Request focuses on balancing the program, rebuilding readiness, and preparing for future growth. The initial budget request includes priorities such as improving warfighting readiness, filling capacity and lethality gaps, reforming DOD business practices, supporting servicemembers and their families, and overseas contingency operations. The Trump Administration's budget request for national defense-related activities totaled $677.1 billion. The FY2018 Budget Request for national defense-related activities totaled $677.1 billion, with $667.6 billion requested for discretionary spending and $9.6 billion for mandatory spending. About 95% of the total is allocated for military activities of the DOD, with the remaining balance for defense-related atomic energy activities and activities of other agencies. The FY2018 Budget Request for national defense-related activities totaled $677.1 billion, with $612.5 billion allocated for the base budget and $64.6 billion designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The OCO funding includes $4.8 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to enhance the U.S. military presence. The FY2018 Budget Request for national defense-related activities totaled $677.1 billion, with $612.5 billion allocated for the base budget and $64.6 billion designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The OCO funding includes $4.8 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to enhance the U.S. military presence in Europe as a counter to menacing Russian military actions. The Administration's request for ERI included $1.7 billion to increase U.S. military personnel in Europe, $2.2 billion for prepositioned stocks of military equipment, and $150 million for Ukrainian capacity building. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 was passed by the House and Senate after modifications and amendments. The Senate incorporated text from over 100 amendments and adopted an additional 49 amendments en bloc. One amendment to repeal joint resolutions on the Authorization of Military Force was rejected by a vote of 61-36. The Trump Administration amended its fiscal 2018 budget request, increasing DOD funding by $5.87 billion for missile defense programs, repairing damaged destroyers, and covering costs for deploying additional troops in Afghanistan. The FY2018 NDAA authorized additional funds for missile defense, ship repair, and an enlarged U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Congress exempted these funds from the BCA defense cap in the FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill. The INF Treaty was signed by the United States and Soviet Union in 1987. The United States and Soviet Union signed the INF Treaty in 1987, banning land-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Concerns have been raised about Russian violations of the treaty, including the deployment of a new ground-launched cruise missile. Legislation has been proposed to enforce compliance with the treaty. The Senate bill (\u00a71635) aims to bring Russia back into compliance with the INF Treaty by mandating the development of a U.S. land-based missile of INF range. The final version of the bill authorizes funding for active defenses, counterforce capabilities, and countervailing strike capabilities to enhance U.S. capabilities. The final version of the NDAA includes policy provisions to counter Russian aggression in Europe and support the European Deterrence Initiative. It requires a five-year plan for EDI activities, extends training authorities for Eastern European security forces, and authorizes joint security assistance to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The House and Senate bills express support for Ukraine, Georgia, and Baltic countries, while also extending security assistance and prohibitions on military cooperation with Russia. Both bills include provisions for defensive lethal assistance, intelligence support, and medical treatment for wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Additionally, they prohibit funding for military-to-military cooperation with Russia and activities recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea. The bills also extend prohibitions against contracts with Russia for atomic energy defense activities. The House bill includes provisions on U.S. alliances with Korea and threats from North Korea. It requires a report on Iran and North Korea's cooperation on weapons programs and defense assessment for Hawaii against North Korea. The bill emphasizes the importance of U.S. alliances with Korea and Japan. The NDAA conference report emphasizes the importance of U.S. alliances with Korea and Japan, the need to strengthen deterrence capabilities against North Korean aggression, and the requirement for a strategy on North Korea's nuclear, ballistic missile, chemical, biological, and conventional weapons programs. It also includes a briefing on the risks posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions and military-to-military cooperation between Iran and North Korea. The final version of H.R. 2810 includes provisions extending restrictions on Guantanamo Bay detainee transfers until December 31, 2018. It prohibits funds for transferring detainees to the US, constructing detainee housing facilities in the US, and transferring detainees to specific countries. The final version of H.R. 2810 includes provisions extending restrictions on Guantanamo Bay detainee transfers until December 31, 2018. It prohibits funds for transferring detainees to the US, constructing detainee housing facilities in the US, and transferring detainees to specific countries. Additionally, the bill includes provisions related to DOD-focused cybersecurity and cyberspace issues, with modifications made to the original House version. Section 1631 of the final version of the bill requires quarterly legal reviews of cyber capabilities intended for use as a weapon. Section 1654 focuses on enhancing regional cyber planning and countering propaganda by China and North Korea. Section 1641 includes a modified version of this requirement. Section 1655 mandates a report on the review of the dual-hat arrangement of the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency. The FY2018 NDAA bill requires the President to develop a national policy for cyberspace, cybersecurity, and cyberwarfare. The FY2018 NDAA bill mandates a cyber posture review involving key officials and an expanded study on cyber operations, laws, policies, and deterrence. It also includes a provision for continual red-teaming reviews of defense systems and infrastructure. The FY2018 NDAA bill includes provisions for an annual report on Russian military developments, information warfare strategies, and efforts to propagandize U.S. Armed Forces. It also requires the integration of DOD organizations responsible for information operations, military deception, public affairs, electronic warfare, and cyber operations. The final version of the FY2018 NDAA bill includes provisions for the appointment of DOD's Chief Information Warfare Officer by the President, an update on the federal cyber scholarship-for-service program, and the integration of DOD organizations responsible for information operations, military deception, public affairs, electronic warfare, and cyber operations. The Senate incorporated two bills into the NDAA related to cybersecurity and government data transparency. The final version of the NDAA did not include the provision for the \"Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act\". The final version of the NDAA included provisions from the Senate version, known as the \"Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017,\" which authorize the creation of working capital funds for agencies to improve legacy IT systems. Additionally, the NDAA included provisions prohibiting federal agencies from using software developed by Kaspersky Lab due to security concerns. The final version of the NDAA included provisions banning federal agencies from using Kaspersky Lab software due to security concerns. It also requires a report on procedures to remove suspect software from federal IT systems and a DOD report on the potential applications of blockchain technology by foreign powers, extremist organizations, or criminals. The FY2018 budget request aims to maintain the active-duty end-strength of the Army and Marine Corps, which peaked in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Obama Administration proposed a drawdown in end-strengths, but Congress rejected this trajectory in the FY2017 NDAA. The FY2018 budget request increased the Army's authorized end-strength to 476,000 and the Marine Corps end-strength to 185,000. The enacted FY2018 NDAA authorized a larger number of personnel for the Army and Marine Corps than requested. The FY2018 budget request proposed a 2.1% increase in basic pay for military personnel instead of the 2.4% increase that would occur automatically. In most years from 2001 through 2010, increases in basic pay were above ECI. From 2011 through 2014, raises were equal to ECI as per the statutory formula. From 2014 through 2016, the rate of military pay raises slowed as the President invoked his authority to set an alternative pay adjustment below the ECI. In 2017, the President proposed a pay raise lower than the ECI, but Congress set the pay raise at the ECI rate in the FY2017 NDAA. In FY2018, Congress required the 2.4% statutory formula for basic pay increase, despite the President's proposal of 2.1%. Over the past decade, there has been significant attention on sexual assault and harassment in the military, leading to various strategic initiatives and congressional actions. The FY2018 NDAA included provisions on sexual assault prevention, victim services, reporting, and military justice. One new provision criminalized the wrongful distribution of intimate images. The Trump Administration continued nuclear modernization programs as planned. The FY2018 budget includes funding for the development of the B-21 long-range bomber and the Long Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO) to replace the Air-Launched Cruise Missile. The budget also supports the President's request for these programs. The Navy's top priority program is the Columbia-class program to design and build 12 ballistic missile submarines to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs. The FY2018 budget includes funding for this program, as well as refurbishing Trident II missiles. The House bill, Senate amendment, and final bill all support the budget request for the Columbia-class program. The United States has been developing and deploying ballistic missile defenses since the late 1940s, with a key focus on the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) to replace Minuteman III missiles. President Reagan's enhanced effort for BMD in 1983 led to significant funding for research, development, and deployment of BMD systems. The United States has deployed a global array of sensors and interceptors for defense against ballistic missiles, with a significant budget allocated for research and development. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request included $9.2 billion for missile defense, with $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). An additional $4.0 billion was added to the missile defense request, with $905.0 million for the Army's Patriot and PAC-3 antimissile interceptors. The FY2018 budget request included $905 million for the Ground-Based Mid-course Defense System (GMD) with 44 interceptor missiles deployed in Alaska and California to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles. An additional $823 million was allocated for improvements to the GMD system, including upgraded interceptor missiles and improved radar for deployment in the mid-2020s. The final version of the NDAA in the mid-2020s authorized increased funding for the GMD system, including $200 million for a third interceptor launch site in Alaska and $268 million for 20 interceptors. The bill also allows for the deployment of 20 additional interceptors in Alaska. The Secretary of Defense authorizes the deployment of 20 additional interceptors in Alaska and plans to increase the total number of interceptors to 104. The budget includes $700.5 million for the Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles. Both the House and Senate versions of the NDAA would authorize an additional $318.4 million. The final version of H.R. 2810 authorizes $1.3 billion for THAAD, with an additional $634 million for the Patriot system. Patriot is a mature BMD system used in combat and fielded worldwide, working with THAAD to defend against incoming missiles. The final version of H.R. 2810 authorizes $1.1 billion for Patriot procurement, with an additional $634 million in the House bill and an additional $650 million in the Senate bill. The budget amendment requested a total of $1.1 billion for Patriot procurement. The President's budget request included $6.9 billion for National Security Space activities, including $1.9 billion for satellite launchers under the EELV program. The final version of H.R. 2810 authorizes funding for Patriot procurement and satellite launchers under the EELV program. The Senate version of the NDAA included a provision regarding the Delta IV launch vehicle. The final version of H.R. 2810 no longer requires the Delta IV for the National Reconnaissance Office. The House proposed a Space Corps, but it was not included in the enacted NDAA. The Senate bill wanted to limit the creation of independent corps, and also required a six-year term for the Commander of Air Force Space Command. The final version of the bill retains the six-year term requirement for the Commander of Air Force Space Command and expands their authority over Air Force space activities. It also accelerates the modernization programs for armored combat vehicles and procurement of long-range equipment. The final version of the bill accelerates the procurement of long-range artillery rockets and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) to replace the 1980s-era High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). It also authorizes the remounting of the Army's Paladin artillery piece on a new chassis, acquisition of the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), and the Marine Corps' Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). The Army requested $647.4 million for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) to replace M-113 personnel carriers in various support roles within armored brigade combat teams. The Marine Corps requested $340.5 million for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) to replace its aging amphibious assault vehicles. The ACV 1.1 wheeled vehicles will be fielded first, followed by the tracked ACV 1.2. The enacted bill authorizes $340.5 million for the development of new vehicles, including the acquisition of the first 26 ACV 1.1s. The Navy's new force goal is to have 355 ships, replacing the previous goal of 308 ships. Both the House bill and Senate amendment declare U.S. policy to have a 355-ship force. The FY2018 NDAA includes this provision as Section 1025. The Navy's proposed FY2018 budget requested the procurement of nine new ships. The FY2018 budget, as amended on June 29, 2017, requested the procurement of nine new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two DDG-51 class destroyers, two Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), one TAO-205 class oiler, and one towing, salvage, and rescue ship. The request was amended to include the second LCS. The House bill and Senate amendment would authorize a $5.8 billion increase for shipbuilding, including funding for the nine ships. The NDAA as enacted authorizes a $5.8 billion increase for shipbuilding, including additional ships such as a DDG-51 class destroyer, LCS, LPD-17 or LX(R) class amphibious ship, expeditionary sea base ship, cable ship, and ship-to-shore connector landing craft. $4.5 billion was requested for Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers, with funding allocated for the second and third ships of the class. The Senate bill approved $11.4 billion for the second ship of the Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers and $1.9 billion for the third ship. The House bill approved $3.74 billion, citing that the remaining funds were not needed in FY2018. The FY2018 NDAA authorized the requested amount, including a provision limiting the cost of future aircraft carriers. The Senate amendment also included funding for refueling and modernizing the carrier George Washington and equipment procurement for the carrier John C. Stennis. The FY2018 budget request includes $40.3 billion for acquisition of manned and unmanned aircraft, with $528 million designated as OCO funding to replace damaged UAVs and helicopters. Authorization actions for selected fighter, attack, tanker, transport, and cargo aircraft are summarized in tables provided. The FY2018 budget request includes $9.0 billion for the procurement of 70 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, with additional funding for modifications, spare parts, and continued development. Both chambers proposed additions to the President's budget request for the F-35 program. The final version of the budget provides 90 F-35s, an increase of 20 from the initial request. The Air Force also continues investments in modifying legacy fighter aircraft, with a significant portion of its budget allocated to this effort. The A-10 fleet will be maintained at its FY2017 inventory levels. The House and Senate versions of the NDAA fully support the President's budget request for these aircraft. The final bill authorizes $103 million for replacement wings for A-10 aircraft and funds to mitigate a shortfall in the Navy's fleet of strike fighters by buying new F/A-18s and upgrading existing planes. The Administration requested $1.3 billion for procurement of 14 F/A-18s and upgrades to the existing fleet. The Navy's UPL included an additional 10 F/A-18s as a top priority if more funding is available. Both the House and Senate bills generally supported the President's budget request for the F/A-18 program. The House and Senate generally supported the President's budget request for the F/A-18 program, recommending procurement of additional aircraft. The enacted NDAA provides 24 F-18s to match the Navy's UPL. The SASC expressed concern about the reliance on certain fleets for missions in various regions, recommending an additional $1.2 billion for the Air Force for light attack/observation aircraft. The final bill provides $400 million for this purpose. In FY2018, the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker program is in its fourth year of low-rate initial production, with a request for $3.1 billion for 15 additional aircraft. The NDAA provides $400 million for two more KC-46s and $94 million for RDT&E. The President's budget also includes $1.0 billion for nine C-130 aircraft, with recommendations for increased procurement quantities from both the House and Senate committees. The House and Senate recommended substantial increases in procurement quantities for C-130 aircraft, with the final version authorizing $2.0 billion for 23 aircraft. Both chambers also supported funding for research, development, and evaluation for Air Force One replacement and the VH-92 presidential helicopter. The House bill included cost control measures, but the final version funded the requested amounts. Additionally, there were recommendations for increased funding for patrol and surveillance aircraft. The House and Senate recommended increased funding for procurement of P-8 Poseidon aircraft and RQ-4 Global Hawk modifications. The final version of H.R. 2810 included $1.8 billion for P-8s, authorizing three more than requested, and $101.8 million for Global Hawk modifications. Additionally, there were recommendations for increased funding for various types of helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft. The final version of H.R. 2810 authorized additional funding for the procurement of helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft, including AH-64 Apaches, CH-47 Chinooks, and V-22 Ospreys, as well as upgrades to various aircraft models. The House and Senate bills also included provisions for additional aircraft procurement beyond the requested amounts. Additionally, efforts to reform the Department of Defense's acquisition processes have been ongoing since the 114th Congress. The final version of the FY2018 NDAA addressed various areas, including expanding the range of products considered commercial items for faster procurement. The bill included a provision for the General Services Administration to establish a program for procuring commercial products through online marketplaces. The final version of the FY2018 NDAA included modifications such as phased implementation, limiting acquisitions to the simplified acquisition threshold, and requiring GAO assessment. The Senate bill aimed to expand DOD's acquisition of products under commercial procedures, including items sold to foreign governments. A provision in the final bill allowed a contract for a commercial item to serve as a prior commercial item determination for future purchases. The final version of the FY2018 NDAA included provisions to prioritize commercial and nondevelopmental items over small business set-asides. Both House and Senate versions aimed to improve oversight of service contracts, with some modifications in the final bill. The final version of the FY2018 NDAA included provisions to improve oversight of service contracts, with modifications such as extending the authority for multiyear services contracts and dropping certain service contracting provisions. The FY2018 NDAA included provisions to improve oversight of service contracts by identifying categories of industry with commercial services providers for DOD requirements. Changes were proposed in the acquisition process management, including excluding defense business systems from the definition of an MDAP and incorporating new requirements for reliability and maintainability in weapon system design. Operating and support costs were also codified for evaluating major programs at every acquisition stage. The final version of the NDAA includes a provision for a three-year pilot program requiring certain companies to pay DOD processing costs for bid protests when GAO denies all elements of the protest. The pilot program is set to begin two years after the bill's enactment. The Administration requested $9.8 billion in the base budget and $600 million in OCO funds for military construction and family housing in FY2018, totaling $10.4 billion. In FY2018, DOD proposed an increase in military construction funds to address priorities such as new missions, support to combatant commands, medical facility recapitalization, and quality of life improvements. Funding requests for seven projects exceeded $100 million each, with four projects receiving full approval in the final bill. The final enacted version of the bill allocated funds for various projects including a National Security Agency operations facility, hospitals at Fort Bliss, Bethesda, and Rhine Ordnance Barracks, and approved partial funding for projects like a new headquarters complex in St. Louis, a maintenance complex for Air Force One, and a hospital at Fort Leonard Wood. The Administration requested $638 million in OCO funds for military construction, with a significant portion allocated for European Reassurance Initiative projects. The House and Senate versions of the NDAA included provisions to prohibit an additional BRAC round in 2021. The Administration requested $638 million in OCO funds for military construction, with a focus on European Reassurance Initiative projects. The House and Senate approved the ERI construction requests, along with additional funding for specific projects like a new airfield in Jordan, an enlisted barracks at Guantanamo Bay, and security upgrades at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. Funding for DOD-owned military family housing has remained steady since FY2014 after privatization of most government-owned housing in the US. The DOD's FY2018 budget request included $1.4 billion for family housing, with the House and Senate bills proposing cuts to the funding. However, the final version of the NDAA fully funded the request, including construction projects on Guam and Kwajalein Atoll."
