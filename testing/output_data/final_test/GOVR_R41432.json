    "content": "This report discusses mortgage markets in selected nations, comparing homeownership rates, housing prices, primary and secondary mortgage markets, and international connections. It focuses on the United States, Canada, Denmark, and Australia, exploring differences and similarities that impact homeownership rates. Canada and the United States have similar homeownership rates, but Canada has stricter mortgage qualifications. Canada has not experienced the same price level collapse or increase in foreclosure rates as the United States. Canada funds its mortgages mainly with bank deposits, while the United States relies on domestic and international financial markets. The homeowner in the United States typically has a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, whereas the Canadian homeowner has a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage designed to be paid in full after 25-30 years. According to OECD, Canadian and U.S. home prices peaked in 2007 and 2006 respectively. Denmark has strict mortgage standards and offers covered mortgage bonds. Homeowners in Denmark can prepay mortgages based on market value. In Denmark and the United States, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are common. Danish house prices peaked in 2007 at 150% higher than in 1991. Australian mortgages mostly have adjustable interest rates, allowing homeowners to make extra payments that can be withdrawn. Home prices in Australia increased by 107% between 1991 and 2009. Homeownership rates depend on various factors such as housing costs, nonfinancial aspects, income, savings, age, marital status, tax system, government regulations, and immigrant status. Factors such as land use, zoning, building codes, and immigrant status influence homeownership rates. Mortgage terms also play a role in determining the rate. In the United States, homeownership rates have varied over time and across regions. For example, the Midwest had the highest rate at 70.8%, while the West had the lowest at 61.4% in 2010. Homeownership rates in developed countries in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia show a range of values. Homeownership rates in selected developed countries in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia vary from 35% to 97%. The European Union (EU) has an average rate of 66.8%, with Germany at 43.2% and Lithuania and Romania at 97.0%. Factors like subsidies, cost of ownership, and rental protections influence rates. Switzerland and Japan have lower rates due to high costs and renter protections. Australia has a rate of 69.8%. Australia has a homeownership rate of 69.8%, while Japan's rate is around 60%. International comparisons of homeownership rates can be misleading due to differences in data collection methods. Real house prices were stable from 1991 to 2000, then increased until 2008 before declining. Ireland experienced the greatest price increase of 28% in 1998. Between 1991 and 2008, house prices in the United States increased by 50%, Canada by 60%, Denmark by 150%, and Australia by 107%. The largest price increase of 28% occurred in Ireland in 1998. Countries with the largest house price declines were Ireland, the United States, and Iceland. Real house prices declined in Japan, Korea, and Switzerland during this period. Figure 2 illustrates the price levels for various countries, showing that many nations had greater housing price increases than the United States. The section discusses how mortgage interest rates are determined in the United States, Canada, Denmark, and Australia. It explains a framework for determining interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which depend on factors such as government bond rates, borrower risk, property characteristics, and structural differences. The term \"spread\" is used to represent the sum of adjustments to the base rate. In the United States, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is typically paid off in 7 years. In the United States, mortgage interest rates are determined based on the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond. A decrease in the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries leads to lower mortgage interest rates and more prepayments as borrowers refinance to take advantage of lower rates. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) use various interest rates plus a spread instead of Treasury bonds to determine the borrower's interest rate. Lenders offer ARMs with lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages because the rate increases if the index rate rises, protecting the lender. Borrowers may find ARMs attractive due to potentially lower rates. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer lower interest rates and the potential for future rate decreases, with limits on rate increases. Borrower risk is assessed based on credit history, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and property type. Mortgages with high LTVs, investor-owned properties, condominiums, and manufactured housing pay higher interest rates due to higher risk. In the United States, lenders charge higher interest rates on mortgages than on Treasury bonds to compensate for the lower value of home mortgage loans. Lenders may seek full recourse from defaulting homeowners depending on state law. Borrower and property characteristics like FICO score and LTV jointly determine mortgage interest rates. In the United States, mortgage rates are adjusted based on borrower and property characteristics. Canadian banks offer various mortgage rates, with borrowers able to negotiate discounts. In Denmark, mortgage interest rates are fixed at the time of the loan, with bonds financing the loan matching the terms exactly. Borrowers pay the market interest rate at the time of the loan. In the United States, mortgages can be split into three groups: conforming, government insured, and other. Conforming mortgages meet government purchase standards, while government-insured mortgages are guaranteed by FHA, VA, or USDA. Other mortgages do not qualify as conforming or government-backed. The \"other\" group of mortgages includes non-conforming and non-government insured loans, such as jumbo mortgages, subprime mortgages, and Alt-A mortgages. Interest rates on FHA-insured and Veterans Affairs-guaranteed mortgages are fixed, while rates for conforming and \"other\" mortgages are based on risk factors. Federal Reserve research shows that GSEs reduce mortgage rates by less than 0.5%. In the current economic environment, market activity reduces mortgage interest rates by less than 0.5% due to the presence of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Without GSEs, mortgage availability would be lower and interest rates higher. Homeowners in the United States pay various transaction costs such as real estate appraisals, inspections, title insurance, origination fees, and closing costs, which are lower in most other nations. The conforming loan limit in 2010 is $417,000, except in high-cost areas. The loan limit in the United States varies from $417,000 to $729,750 in high-cost areas in the contiguous 48 states, and is $625,500 in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. FHA-insured mortgages have a limit of $271,050, except in high-cost areas where it can go up to $625,500. Borrowers typically have a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and may need to purchase private mortgage insurance if they do not make a 20% downpayment. Home mortgages in the U.S. are usually for 30 years with monthly payments that amortize the loan. In the United States, home mortgages are typically for 30 years with monthly payments that amortize the entire amount borrowed. Biweekly mortgage payments are less common. Mortgages with interest-only payments stopped being available after the 2007-2009 recession. Most prime mortgages in the U.S. can be prepaid without penalty, often done to refinance or when the homeowner moves. Subprime mortgages often had low introductory rates and prepayment penalties. U.S. mortgages can be refinanced for lower interest rates or to take out equity from the home. Refinancing with an equity withdrawal, known as cash out refinancing, allows homeowners to take out equity from their home by increasing the mortgage size. Closing costs are incurred again in refinancing. Some homeowners have reduced the new mortgage amount by using cash to pay down the balance. Cash in refinancing is done when more equity is needed to qualify for the mortgage. An assumable mortgage allows a new purchaser to take over the existing mortgage, usually advantageous for obtaining a lower interest rate. An assumable mortgage allows a new purchaser to take over the existing mortgage, usually advantageous for obtaining a lower interest rate. Most conforming mortgages are not assumable, but government-insured mortgages are assumable if the new borrower meets credit standards and the original borrower agrees to be responsible if the new borrower defaults. Foreclosure is governed by state law, and some states allow lenders to seek unpaid balances through the courts. Home mortgage interest is generally tax deductible for U.S. taxpayers who itemize. There is a 100% capital gains exemption on a home that the owners have lived in for two of the last five years. Special tax credits were available for qualifying homebuyers between April 9, 2008, and June 30, 2010. Subprime mortgages are loans made to borrowers with less than prime credit histories. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke noted the growth of the subprime market from $35 billion in 1994 to $600 billion in 2006. Government policies to increase homeownership by low-income households include FHA-, VA-, and USDA-insured loan programs. The United States and Denmark offer long-term fixed-rate mortgages, while other countries have shorter-term mortgages with adjustable interest rates. Canada mitigates the risk of payment affordability by offering adjustable mortgages. Denmark and Canada prioritize homeownership less than the United States and Australia. In Canada, Denmark, and Australia, government intervention in housing markets differs from the United States. They support low-income housing through various programs and do not emphasize homeownership as much. Canada and Australia provide tax support for owner-occupied housing and focus on supporting indigenous and immigrant populations. Underwriting standards in these countries are stricter than in the United States, with Canadian mortgages more likely to have adjustable rates and prepayment penalties. Canadian mortgages with less than 20% down are 100% guaranteed under the National Housing Act by CHMC. Mortgages typically roll over every five years, with minimal closing costs. Canadian policy supports affordable housing for all residents, with government and nonprofits reducing costs for low-income homeownership. In the United States and Canada, government interventions aim to make homeownership more accessible to low-income households. Minimum downpayments vary, with Canada's currently at 0-5% and the US at 3.5% for FHA mortgages. Canadian mortgage payments can be synchronized with pay schedules. Various government entities and nonprofits work together to reduce the cost of low-income homeownership. Comparing mortgage costs between the two countries is challenging, but studies suggest that prime borrowers pay similar amounts when considering interest rates, refinancing costs, and mortgage insurance. The Canadian government supports homeownership through CMHC, which is partially self-funded and covers assisted housing and mortgage insurance. Mortgage brokers are licensed by provincial governments and have a fiduciary responsibility to borrowers. Unlike the US, there are no fixed limits on securitized mortgages or eligibility limits on government mortgage insurance. In 2008 and 2009, the Canadian government enacted mortgage requirements, including limiting LTVs. In 2009, the Canadian government enacted mortgage requirements such as limiting LTVs to 95%, prohibiting interest-only loans, and establishing standards for government mortgages. They also committed to purchasing up to C$ 125 billion of insured mortgage pools, with approximately half spent. Conventional mortgages in Canada have an LTV of 80% or less, while low downpayment mortgages are called high-ratio mortgages. Federally regulated depositories can hold high-ratio mortgages with mortgage insurance from CMHC or private companies. CMHC guarantees 100% of the loan amount, private insurers guarantee 90%, and the typical new Canadian mortgage has an LTV of 75%. Interest rates on Canadian mortgages can be fixed for the life of the mortgage. Canadian mortgages can have fixed or adjustable interest rates. Adjustable rates can modify the amount paid or the life of the mortgage. Variable rate mortgages are tied to market rates and adjust the payment amounts for principal and interest when the rate changes. Most Canadian mortgages have fixed rates for four to five years initially, with some having rates fixed for one year or less, and only a few for more than five years. Only 12% of Canadian mortgages have fixed interest rates for more than five years. Payments are typically weekly, biweekly, or monthly, designed to take 25 to 30 years to pay off. The balance is due at the end of the term, with the option to roll it over into a new mortgage without fees. Refinancing is possible, but may be challenging if the mortgage balance exceeds the home value or if lenders reduce lending. Prepayment penalties can apply to closed mortgages. Some Canadian mortgages have prepayment penalties, with closed mortgages incurring penalties even if the homeowner moves. Closed mortgages have a prepayment period, while open mortgages can be prepaid like a U.S. mortgage. Canadian lenders can force delinquent borrowers into bankruptcy and pursue them for unrecovered losses after foreclosure. Mortgage interest is not tax deductible in Canada. Canada does not allow tax deductions for mortgage interest. The country has a small non-prime mortgage market, with low non-prime mortgage originations compared to the United States. Affordable housing programs in Canada target both rental and homeownership, with a focus on indigenous populations. Denmark's mortgage finance system dates back to 1797, with underwriting criteria established by law and high securitization rates. Both Denmark and the United States offer 30-year mortgages. Denmark and the United States offer 30-year mortgages with fixed interest rates. Mortgages in Denmark are subject to underwriting criteria by authorized banks, with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for owner-occupied homes. Borrowers typically need to qualify for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Recent legislation allows banks to issue Danish mortgage bonds. EU requirements have led to changes in mortgage regulations. In Denmark, borrowers have two options to refinance their mortgages: they can refinance as in the United States or purchase their mortgage at the current market price. Danish homeowners can buy back their mortgages out of the bonds when interest rates increase, a feature not available in the United States. Danish mortgage bonds are issued at market rates, while in the United States, FDIC regulations limit the use of mortgage bonds. The Danish mortgage bond system issues bonds at market rates with the same interest rate for all borrowers. Unlike the US, Denmark does not have risk-based tranches or varying repayment priorities. Foreclosure and deficiency judgments in Denmark are based on national law and take about six months, providing less protection for homeowners compared to the US. Danish mortgage banks retain credit risk and pass on prepayment and interest rate risk to investors, unlike in the US where most originators pass on all risk to the secondary market. The Danish mortgage system offers three types of mortgages: fixed rate, adjustable rate, and floating rate. Fixed-rate mortgages typically last for 30 years with a constant interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages have interest rates that change at set intervals based on an index rate. ARMs usually have lower initial rates but future payments can fluctuate. Investors in the secondary mortgage market take on credit risk for MBS, while in the US, most originators pass on all risk. Floating-rate mortgages in Denmark are similar to ARMs but adjust at shorter intervals. They are based on a reference rate like Cibor and can have initial interest-only payments. Most Danish mortgages are Kroner-denominated and for 30 years. Prepayment options vary, but all borrowers can prepay by purchasing their bond in the market. Mortgage transaction costs are lower in Denmark compared to the US. Fixed-rate mortgages can be prepaid by paying the balance owed. Fixed-rate mortgages in Denmark can be prepaid by paying the balance owed. Adjustable-rate mortgages can be prepaid at any interest rate reset or by purchasing the bond on the market. Floating-rate mortgages can be prepaid in three ways: at an interest rate reset, at a previously agreed price, or by purchasing the underlying bonds. There are no absolute limits on the size of Danish mortgages, but there are limits on the LTV. A typical residential foreclosure in Denmark takes six months from default to sale of the property. In Denmark, a typical residential foreclosure takes six months from default to property sale. Homeowners are responsible if sale proceeds don't cover the amount owed, leading to possible legal action if no repayment arrangements are made. Danish mortgages can be assumed by the house purchaser, with tax-deductible interest payments and no tax on capital gains from selling a primary residence. The U.S. and Australian housing finance systems differ, with Australians more likely to choose ARMs over FRMs due to lower interest rates. In the United States, approximately 85% of mortgages are fixed rate, while Australians can withdraw prepaid funds on their mortgages. Some Australian mortgages allow for redraws with a credit card tied to the prepaid funds, unlike in the U.S. where home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) require a new loan application. The Australian mortgage finance system offers fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, with fixed-rate mortgages generally limited to 15 years or less. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs), also known as floating-rate mortgages in Australia, are more common than Fixed-Rate Mortgages (FRMs) in the Australian market. Most Australian mortgages have a term of 20-30 years, with the typical maturity being 25 years. Lenders in Australia typically charge the same rate to most borrowers, but discretionary discounts of up to 0.70% may be offered. Low documentation loans are available but come with higher interest rates, especially for self-employed borrowers. ARMs do not have prepayment penalties, while FRMs may have fixed penalties or penalties based on interest rate differences. In Australia, mortgages can have fixed penalties or penalties based on interest rate differences. Some borrowers pay off their mortgages early by making extra monthly payments. \"Redraw\" facilities allow withdrawals of excess payments and offer tax advantages. Refinancing costs average 1.4% of the mortgage amount, with prepayment fees over 40% of the refinancing cost. Mortgages cannot be assumed, and there is no government mortgage insurance. Authorized deposit-taking institutions must meet Basel II requirements set by APRA for mortgage loans. Standard mortgages require documented income, verified collateral, and property appraisal. In the United States and Australia, mortgages have different capital requirements based on factors like LTV ratios and lender insurance. Private mortgage insurance is usually required for mortgages with LTVs above 80%. Lenders can use foreclosure or sequestration to recover debts from delinquent borrowers. State laws determine if a borrower's assets can be seized in the US. Australia's tax system does not offer special treatment for mortgages. Australia's tax system does not provide special treatment for mortgage interest. Capital gains on a principal residence are not taxed if not used for income production. The First Home Owners Grant (FHOG) was introduced in July 2000 with AU$7,000. Additional assistance programs have been implemented, but only the $7,000 FHOG remains. The tax rate on savings for purchasing a first home has been reduced since October 2008. Subprime borrowers could obtain mortgages at higher interest rates than prime borrowers. Mortgages are designed to help households buy homes beyond their immediate financial means. The challenge lies in funding long-term mortgages, like the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, due to the mismatch in duration of funding available to lenders. The US and other countries have different solutions to this issue. In the United States, funding long-term mortgages can be challenging due to the mismatch in duration of funding available to lenders. Banks can minimize interest rate risk by matching mortgage terms to deposit terms, but when mortgages exceed five years, new funds must be obtained. One solution is adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), popular in other countries, which shift interest rate risk to the borrower. In the United States, ARMs have been popular during high fixed interest rate periods like the 1970s. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae purchase existing mortgages and pool them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) sold to investors. These MBS represent monthly payment claims on mortgages, with guarantees from the GSEs. Between 2001 and 2009, GSEs held a significant share of the MBS market, with Ginnie Mae and GSEs issuing 95% or more of MBS since 2008. In the United States, new MBS volume was 10.1% of mortgages outstanding, while in Canada it was 3.6%. Denmark had new MBS at 0.1% and new covered bonds at 58.5%. Australia had new MBS at 15.6%. Covered bond issues were negligible in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Covered bonds are commonly used in many nations to raise mortgage funds in financial markets, providing legal commitment to pay interest and principal with specific mortgages as collateral. In Canada, mortgage bonds are similar to MBS but usually not divided into tranches. NHA loans pooled by CMHC are the only MBS in Canada, guaranteed by the government. CMHC also guarantees timely payment on Canadian Mortgage Bonds. Non-NHA loans are not included in MBS. In Canada, the Canada Housing Trust purchases NHA MBS and issues mortgage bonds with payment streams similar to corporate and government bonds. Depositories hold 69% of residential mortgage debt, with chartered banks holding 56%. Danish mortgage banks sell mortgage bonds to match the term and interest rate of mortgages, following the \"balance principle.\" Danish bonds use \"tap\" funding to add mortgages. The Danish mortgage system follows the \"balance principle\" by using \"tap\" funding to add mortgages to bonds for two or three years. Bond rates are reported in Danish media, and the interest rate on a specific mortgage depends on the bond used to fund it. Mortgage banks pass homeowner payments to investors holding the bond and charge a margin for operating costs. Danish mortgage banks issue bonds to match mortgage terms and interest rates, with seven banks currently operating in Denmark. Australian MBS mostly have adjustable rates, and the four largest banks retain most mortgages. The Australian mortgage market is dominated by banks, with CUBS securitizing a smaller percentage of mortgages. APRA prohibits covered bonds in Australia. Mortgage markets in the United States, Canada, Denmark, and Australia have more differences than similarities, but similar homeownership rates. Demographic similarities may be more important than institutional details in influencing homeownership rates.
