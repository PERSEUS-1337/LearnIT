    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network (MCCRLN) Act of 2009\". The Congress finds that Medicare spending involves beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, leading to duplicative tests, contradictory information, adverse medication responses, and preventable hospital visits. Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage are not designed to meet the unique needs of these beneficiaries. Medicare has implemented demonstration projects to improve care for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, but translating evidence-based results to the wider chronic care community has been limited. Evidence-based approaches to care coordination and management show promise in reducing illness burden and improving health for at-risk patients. The population of Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions is increasing. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should test care models, analyze outcomes, and implement best practices. The US Government should partner with healthcare institutions to develop and translate improvements in coordinated care for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. The Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network aims to develop and apply improved practices in coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Network's initial period will be at least five years, with the possibility of extension or permanency based on demonstrated benefits to the Medicare program. The Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network aims to facilitate the development of evidence-based chronic care management practices for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic illnesses. The Network enables qualified healthcare organizations and universities to establish a research infrastructure that enhances the quality of care provided. The Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network develops and evaluates evidence-based chronic care management practices for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, focusing on those in the fee-for-service program with high healthcare costs. The Network builds upon successful interventions from CMS demonstrations like the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration project. The Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network is tasked with researching, designing, implementing, testing, and validating interventions to improve care management for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. They aim to standardize best practices for all Medicare beneficiaries and establish target enrollment numbers and payment rates for care management interventions. The Medicare Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network consists of at least 12 initial project sites, with the option for additional sites to be appointed by the Secretary. These sites must meet specific characteristics and collectively be a group of healthcare organizations, universities, or researchers and clinicians in health. Healthcare organizations, universities, or researchers with experience in research and care management services for Medicare beneficiaries. The Network will consist of healthcare organizations, universities, or researchers with experience in care coordination projects. A Coordinating Center will be established to facilitate communication and training, while an Advisory Board will be composed of CMS administrator and appointed members. The Board, appointed by the Secretary, includes representatives from various fields to further the work of the Network. The Board will conduct internal and external evaluations of each Network project. The Network Board conducts internal and external evaluations of projects. Biennial reports are submitted to Congress and public reports on effective chronic care models are issued every two years. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain provisions. The Secretary has the authority to waive provisions of the Social Security Act for the Network to conduct activities. $60,000,000 is authorized for this section from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund over a 5-year period starting in fiscal year 2010. Definitions include the Medicare program as programs under title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the Network project site as the site of a chronic care management program. The curr_chunk is about defining a \"site\" as the location where a chronic care management program is conducted under the authority of the Network."
