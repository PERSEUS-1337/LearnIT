    "content": "The \"Defense of the Environment Act of 1997\" requires Members of Congress to vote on provisions that reduce environmental protection and mandates the Office of Management and Budget to provide information for assessing the impact of such provisions. The \"Defense of the Environment Act of 1997\" applies to provisions in bills before Congress that reduce environmental protection. A provision is considered to reduce protection if it allows increased pollution of air, water, or impacts national parks and public lands. The \"Defense of the Environment Act of 1997\" identifies provisions in bills that may diminish environmental protection by impacting outdoor recreational opportunities, endangering species, increasing children's exposure to contaminants, shielding violators of environmental laws, or limiting judicial review of agency actions. The baseline for evaluating these effects is the scenario without the provision in place. SEC. 4. DUTIES OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. When a committee reports a bill that reduces environmental protection, the accompanying report must include: identification and description of the provision, assessment of the reduction in protection, actions taken to avoid the reduction, and any relevant statements received. SEC. 5. DUTIES OF THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to assess the impact on environmental protection of bills, joint resolutions, and conference reports requested by committees of the House of Representatives or the Senate. Additionally, the Comptroller General can provide assistance to committees in evaluating the environmental implications of legislative provisions. SEC. 6. DUTIES OF OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT OF BUDGET. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must ensure that each department or agency collects and organizes information on environmental impacts of proposed legislation for Congress and the public. SEC. 7. LEGISLATION SUBJECT TO POINT OF ORDER. It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, or conference report that is reported by a committee unless the committee has complied with section 4. In the House of Representatives, it shall not be in order to consider a rule or order that waives the application of subsection (a). SEC. 8. DEBATE ON PROVISIONS REDUCING PROTECTION. Amendment of House Rules to allow motion to strike any provision reducing environmental protection from bills, joint resolutions, or amendments. The motion takes precedence over other motions and allows for 40 minutes of debate. Similar provision for Senate voting process. Motion to limit or close debate in the Senate by striking any provision reducing environmental protection from bills, joint resolutions, or amendments. The motion takes precedence over other motions and allows for 40 minutes of debate. Amendment to House Rules and Senate voting process. The House Rules and Senate voting process are amended to include provisions protecting the environment. The Defense of the Environment Act of 1997 amends subsections (a), (b), and (c) by replacing \"nongermane matter\" with \"matter or provision.\" The provisions in this section and sections 4 and 7 are enacted by Congress as an exercise of rulemaking powers, allowing each House to change rules related to them. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will be in effect upon enactment."
