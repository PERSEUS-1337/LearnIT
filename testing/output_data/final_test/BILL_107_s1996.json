    "content": "The \"Second Amendment Preservation Act of 2002\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that some State and local governments are suing firearms manufacturers, importers, and dealers to impose heavy legal costs, potentially threatening their ability to defend themselves or stay in business. Many of these businesses are small and privately owned, unable to afford the legal expenses of defending themselves in multiple court cases. States and local governments, compared to firearms businesses, are wealthy entities able to spend taxpayers' money on legal battles. Fairness dictates that governments should bear the cost of unsuccessful lawsuits against gun manufacturers, and taxpayers should not have to pay for legal fees from awards meant for crime victims. The Second Amendment requires this. The Second Amendment requires Congress to protect citizens' right to own firearms, including providing protection from excessive legal fees. SEC. 3. RULES GOVERNING ACTIONS TO CURTAIL FIREARM SALES FOR LEGAL PURPOSES. Sec. 926B of Chapter 44 of title 18, US Code, defines civil actions to curtail firearm sales for legal purposes as those seeking damages exceeding $1,000,000 or 50% of the defendant's net assets, targeting firearms manufacturers, importers, or dealers. The text discusses holding manufacturers, importers, or dealers responsible for damages caused by the unlawful use of firearms. It also limits attorney's fees in civil actions aimed at restricting firearm sales for legal purposes. In civil actions to restrict firearm sales, if the defendant is not primarily liable, the plaintiff must reimburse reasonable attorney's fees. Any court decision on this issue can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court. The amendment regarding rules for actions to limit firearm sales takes effect upon enactment of the Act and applies to pending or future actions."
