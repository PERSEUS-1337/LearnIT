    "content": "The Act of 1996 is known as the \"Deep Water Outfall Treatment Systems Act.\" It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that insular areas, including US territories, have unique characteristics and island environments. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act should be flexible to consider these characteristics. Scientific evidence shows deep water outfall systems can protect marine environments effectively and cost-efficiently compared to secondary treatment. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act should be flexible to consider unique characteristics of insular areas. States should have the opportunity to apply for a waiver for new deep water outfalls under existing standards. The Act allows certain States and territories to apply for a waiver to construct deep water outfalls and meet effluent standards more effectively. Section 301 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allows eligible States to conduct studies on the feasibility of constructing deep water outfalls for treatment works that use primary treatments. This study may recommend suitable locations for deep water outfalls to benefit the marine environment. An application for modification can be submitted by the owner of a publicly owned treatment works in an eligible State for a location recommended in a study. The Administrator will issue a draft initial determination within 90 days and a final determination within 270 days of the application submission. The Administrator will issue a final determination on a modification under paragraph (2). If granted, the new deepwater outfall must be operational within 5 years of enactment. Pending applications for modifications under paragraph (2) are exempt from certain requirements. During the application period, definitions for \"eligible State\" and \"territory of the United States\" were provided, including insular areas like Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
