Congress finds that vast grassland once provided critical habitat for plant and animal communities in North America, but today, much of it has been converted to other uses, threatening unique species. A significant portion of remaining grassland is on working ranches, where ranchers have an economic interest in preserving it for their livestock. Many ranchers also value the open spaces and \"big sky\" central to their way of life. Ranches themselves are disappearing, with a faster rate expected as older ranchers retire. A grassland reserve program is needed to assist ranchers as many reach retirement age. Ranch land serves as important open-space buffers for animal and plant habitat and forms the economic backbone of rural areas in the western United States. Currently, there are no Federal programs conserving grassland on a national scale, making a grassland reserve program crucial for providing economic assistance to struggling ranchers and agricultural producers. A grassland reserve program is crucial for providing economic assistance to struggling ranchers and agricultural producers as many reach retirement age. This program aims to conserve grassland on a national scale, which serves as important open-space buffers for animal and plant habitat and forms the economic backbone of rural areas in the western United States. The Secretary will establish a grassland reserve program through the Natural Resource Conservation Service to assist owners in restoring and conserving eligible land. The program will enroll a maximum of 1,000,000 acres, with specific acreage requirements based on location and easement types. The Secretary will establish a grassland reserve program to enroll eligible land for conservation, including natural grass or shrubland with ecological value potential. Incidental land may also be included if necessary for easement administration.

Incidental land may also be included if necessary for easement administration. SEC. 1238A pertains to easements and agreements. To enroll land in the grassland reserve program, the landowner must grant an easement to the Secretary, create a deed restriction, provide consent from interested parties, show proof of ownership, comply with easement terms, and retire any existing cropland base. An easement under the grassland reserve program allows common grazing practices, haying, mowing, fire breaks, and fences with restrictions on timing to protect bird nesting seasons. The grassland reserve program easement allows common grazing practices, haying, mowing, fire breaks, and fences with restrictions on timing to protect bird nesting seasons. Easements also prohibit agricultural activities that disturb the land surface and include additional provisions determined by the Secretary. Ranking criteria for easement applications are established in conjunction with State technical committees. The Secretary establishes criteria to evaluate and rank applications for easements under the grassland reserve program, emphasizing support for native grass and shrubland, grazing operations, and biodiversity. Restoration agreements for easements include terms for land restoration, duties of the landowner and Secretary, and Federal share of payments. Violations of easement or restoration agreement terms result in the easement remaining in force, with potential refund requirements for the owner. The Secretary may require the owner to refund payments received under this subchapter with interest. Periodic inspections of easement land are conducted to ensure compliance with terms, with the landowner allowed to be present during inspections. \"SEC. 1238B. DUTIES OF SECRETARY.\" The Secretary will provide easement payments, restoration funds, and technical assistance to landowners in exchange for granting an easement. Easement payments are based on the fair market value of the land minus the grazing value, with different percentages depending on the duration of the easement. The Secretary will provide easement payments, restoration funds, and technical assistance to landowners in exchange for granting an easement. Easement payments may be made in one to ten annual payments, and the Federal share of restoration costs is up to 75 percent. Technical assistance will be provided to execute easement documents and restore the grassland, with reimbursement by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Commodity Credit Corporation will reimburse the Secretary for up to 10 percent of easement acquisition costs and restoration payments. If an entitled owner is unable to receive payment, the Secretary will make it in a fair manner. Easement payments received will not affect other eligible payments for the owner. The owner will receive payments under other Federal laws, without affecting other eligible payments. SEC. 1238C. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary may allow private organizations or State agencies to hold and enforce easements for grassland conservation if certain conditions are met. Organizations must apply for approval, and the Secretary will approve those that are constituted for this purpose. The Secretary may authorize qualified organizations to hold and enforce grassland easements for conservation or ranching purposes. If an organization holding an easement terminates, the landowner must reassign the easement to another approved organization or to the Secretary. Regulations for this subchapter must be issued within 180 days of enactment. SEC. 4. FUNDING. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to include subchapter D in addition to subchapter C for funding purposes."
