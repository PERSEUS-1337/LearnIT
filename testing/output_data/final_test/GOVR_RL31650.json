    "content": "The congressional intelligence committees launched a Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve the Intelligence Community's ability to prevent future attacks. Public hearings began in September 2002 and concluded in October, with testimony from the DCI and FBI Director. The Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks concluded with a final report expected in early 2003. Congress passed the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act to establish an independent commission led by Thomas H. Kean to further investigate and make recommendations for preventing future attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, there was a push for an independent commission to investigate the performance of relevant agencies and prevent future terrorist attacks. Despite concerns about the demands on senior policymakers during a crisis, public anxieties about a possible \"intelligence failure\" led to the establishment of the commission. The investigation into the 9/11 attacks was initially considered as part of the FY2002 Intelligence Authorization bill, but was later dropped in favor of Congress conducting its own investigation focused on intelligence and law enforcement agencies. A Joint Inquiry by the two intelligence committees was initiated in February 2002, with difficulties arising over staff assignments. The first staff director resigned due to concerns about staff appointments, and Eleanor Hill took over. Public hearings were postponed several times. The Joint Inquiry staff, led by Eleanor Hill, consisted of twenty-four professionals from various backgrounds. They were divided into five investigative teams to look into different aspects of the 9/11 attacks. The teams focused on the CIA, FBI, and NSA, and also collected documents and conducted interviews at various federal agencies and private sector entities. Over 400,000 pages of documents were reviewed, 66,000 pages were identified for the central records, and around 400 interviews were documented. The hearings also revealed some disagreements. The Joint Inquiry staff, led by Eleanor Hill, conducted over 400 interviews and technical discussions. Some Members expressed concerns about procedures, complaints about uncooperative intelligence agencies, and disagreements within the committee. Despite challenges, the public hearings in September-October 2002 provided insights into the staff's directions and conclusions. The Joint Inquiry staff, led by Eleanor Hill, conducted interviews and public hearings to investigate possible terrorist attacks before September 11. Intelligence agencies had general warnings but lacked specific information on the timing and location of the attacks. The Intelligence Community had information prior to September 11 that identified the details of the attacks. A Counterterrorist Center was established at the CIA in 1986, focusing on Al Qaeda. Various terrorist attacks were monitored, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and plots to attack other locations. Ms. Hill discussed the threat posed by Al Qaeda, highlighting attacks on the Los Angeles Airport in December 1999, U.S. Embassies in Africa in August 1998, and the USS Cole in October 2000. Despite casualties, effective intelligence and law enforcement efforts disrupted other planned attacks. By the mid-1990s, a new breed of terrorists without state sponsors, like Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, emerged with an Islamic agenda and a penchant for violence. Ms. Hill discussed the increasing focus on terrorism by intelligence and law enforcement agencies, including the creation of special units to track terrorist groups and cooperation with foreign governments. She mentioned growing warnings of attacks in 2001, with a briefing in July predicting a significant terrorist attack by Bin Laden against U.S. and/or Israeli interests in the coming weeks. The Intelligence Community had consistently reported on Al Qaeda activities, but a comprehensive listing of terrorist threats to the United States had not been prepared. Despite threat warnings in mid-2001, there was not a comprehensive effort to educate the American public. The FBI field office in Phoenix called for further investigation of individuals with possible ties to terrorist organizations attending flight school. The FBI field office in Phoenix called for further investigation of individuals with possible ties to terrorist organizations attending flight schools in the U.S. The communication, known as the \"Phoenix Memorandum,\" was not given sustained attention by FBI Headquarters before September 11. Ms. Hill argued that administrative, legal, and policy barriers may have hindered the FBI from perceiving a pattern of planning for a terrorist attack using commercial aircraft. The Inquiry also addressed three hijackers who had come to the attention of the Intelligence Community prior to September 11, 2001. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, hijackers of Flight 77, were identified in early 2000 as having ties to Al Qaeda. The Joint Inquiry staff concluded that their names should have been included in watchlists, but a formal system was lacking. The CIA only recommended watchlisting Bin Laden-related individuals in August 2001. The CIA recommended watchlisting four Bin Laden-related individuals in August 2001, including al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who were already in the U.S. The failure to provide earlier information on them drew criticism, with questions raised about accountability. The Inquiry also looked into the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen detained in August 2001 on charges of conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy. FBI officials in Minnesota sought a warrant to investigate Zacarias Moussaoui's notes and computer disks before September 11, but authorization was not approved. There were debates over the type of warrant to use, with the FBI considering deporting Moussaoui to France for a search. Additionally, concerns were raised about the U.S.'s limited ability to monitor Al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan. Diplomatic pressure was mentioned as a tactic to address these challenges. Ms. Hill highlighted the lack of integration of national power instruments to address the Al Qaeda threat, mentioning the absence of public mobilization efforts by government agencies. She criticized both the Clinton and Bush Administrations for not effectively communicating the danger of terrorist attacks to the American public before September 11. The Staff Director expressed concerns about the FBI's focus on individual prosecutions rather than making necessary changes to fight terrorism in the US. She highlighted the Bureau's lack of officials dedicated to counterterrorism and its decentralized structure hindering intelligence collection on terrorist plots. The FBI's case-based approach led to a narrow view of the terrorist threat, with little focus on radical activity in the U.S. Former National Security Adviser Berger testified that the FBI assured him of minimal radical activity in the country. There was a lack of attention to suspects outside the U.S. who could potentially enter the country, highlighting a gap in the U.S. government's counterterrorism structure. The FBI's limited attention to domestic threats reflects a lack of focus on how international terrorist groups might target the U.S., with no agency regularly assessing the threat to the homeland.

The FBI's limited attention to domestic threats reflects a lack of focus on how international terrorist groups might target the U.S. The Joint Inquiry staff concluded that the FBI's focus on gathering evidence on crimes hindered strategic analysis of threats to the homeland. Law enforcement tools became the primary instrument of American counterterrorism strategy, leading to prosecutions of individuals with terrorist connections for immigration law violations. However, these efforts targeted underlings rather than masterminds who were abroad and beyond the reach of U.S. justice. The FBI's need to prepare for trials also hindered cooperation with intelligence agencies. The FBI's disinclination to cooperate with intelligence agencies due to concerns about evidence being tainted by links with intelligence agencies. Institutional \"walls\" were erected to govern information use, derived from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to protect Fourth Amendment rights. FISA procedures have been under judicial review. The \"walls\" established to maintain separation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies became unworkable bureaucratic hurdles, hindering effective information sharing. An FBI official expressed frustration over the lack of information sharing, foreseeing potential consequences of inefficiency in addressing critical issues. The FBI faced limitations in using intelligence information for criminal investigations, hindering the search for al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi before 9/11. Inadequate communication between intelligence and law enforcement agencies was a major issue, despite claims of information sharing between the FBI and CIA. The events of September 11, 2001 highlighted the need for better information sharing and coordination between intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the United States. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on civil liberties with the removal of barriers separating different types of information and analytical functions. The public hearings by intelligence committees focused on the reaction to radical Islamic terrorism in the 1990s, Clinton Administration's actions against Bin Laden's organization, and failures in sharing terrorist information with State Department and INS. The FBI's Phoenix office memo on flight school students with terrorist connections was also discussed. The hearings discussed the FBI's unsuccessful attempts to search Moussaoui's belongings and proposals to reorganize intelligence and law enforcement agencies for better counterterrorism capabilities. Testimony revealed awareness of Al Qaeda's intentions, thwarted attacks, and challenges in sharing information between agencies. Suggestions were made for improved guidance on handling these issues. The hearings on September 18 included emotional testimony from family representatives of 9/11 victims, highlighting government failures and calling for an independent investigation into intelligence failures. Kristen Breitweiser and Stephen Push emphasized the need for accountability and better intelligence sharing to prevent future attacks. Former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger testified about the Clinton Administration's increased focus on counterterrorism, successes in thwarting attacks, and the FBI's lack of emphasis on counterterrorism compared to the CIA. Berger highlighted the need for improvement in this area. Former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger emphasized the need for improved coordination and integration of intelligence, predictive intelligence, human intelligence, covert action capability, and resource allocation. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III provided a summary of information on the nineteen hijackers and their activities leading up to September 11, 2001. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III summarized the 19 terrorists who carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks, highlighting their use of simple tools and sophisticated knowledge to plan and execute the attacks without detection. Mueller acknowledged valid criticisms and emphasized the need for improved coordination and intelligence integration. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III acknowledged valid criticisms from the Committee, including the need to disseminate important memos and review FISA warrant requests. Testimony from Mueller was supplemented by his predecessor Louis Freeh, who described the Bureau's counterterrorist efforts during his tenure, which included doubling the number of FBI special agents assigned to counterterrorism and establishing legal attaches in U.S. embassies worldwide to improve information acquisition on terrorist activities. Additionally, 56 Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) have been established. The FBI's Counterterrorism Center was established in 1996 to coordinate threat analysis and counterterrorist operations in the U.S. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh testified about the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, acknowledging the national security threat it posed. Cooperation was received from the Saudi government, and suspects with potential Iranian connections were identified. Freeh emphasized that such threats were beyond the FBI's authority to address alone. Louis Freeh acknowledged longstanding IT problems in the FBI, with necessary upgrades delayed until September 2000. After 9/11, rules changed for FBI agents, allowing them to visit suspect groups' websites. In May 2002, new guidelines were issued to remove restrictions. Admiral Lowell Jacoby expressed concerns about barriers hindering intelligence operations. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) highlighted barriers preventing analysts from accessing all available information, advocating for a new paradigm where analysts, not collectors, own information. Analysts are often separated from source material, hindering all-source analysis. There is support for breaking down barriers to information exchange among law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Mary Jo White and General Michael Hayden emphasized the need to address barriers between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in international terrorism investigations, including issues related to FISA searches and surveillances. They highlighted the challenges in conducting electronic searches for law enforcement purposes compared to foreign intelligence purposes. Mary Jo White and General Michael Hayden emphasized the challenges of electronic searches for law enforcement purposes compared to foreign intelligence purposes. They called for a national dialogue to determine the balance between security and liberty. James Gilmore also testified on domestic response capabilities for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. The Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, testified about the Intelligence Community's tracking of Bin Laden as a terrorist leader and a comprehensive operation plan prepared in 1999 to disrupt Al Qaeda finances and bring Bin Laden to justice. Tenet emphasized the importance of intelligence and information sharing in combating terrorism. The CIA recruited and trained officers fluent in Middle Eastern and South Asian languages for counterterrorist assignments. By 9/11, they had extensive information and assets in place to support military campaigns against Al Qaeda. Director Tenet highlighted successes in bringing terrorists to justice and preventing attacks, as well as efforts to dismantle terrorist groups with European governments. The CIA, in conjunction with European governments, worked to identify and dismantle terrorist groups in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. Director Tenet noted an increase in reports of potential terrorist activities in 2001, with a focus on the Middle East. There was awareness of the threat of an Al Qaeda attack, both abroad and within the U.S., using chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. While instances of airplane hijackings and plots to drive airplanes into buildings were known in the past, analysts did not prioritize these reports among the vast flow of data. Budget cuts in the early 1990s affected the CIA, leading to a loss of positions, but funding for counterterrorism had increased significantly before September 11. Tenet requested a significant increase in intelligence funding for FYs 2000-2007, but only small portions of the requests were approved. Supplemental appropriations supported the counterterrorist mission, but were not reliable for multi-year programs. The intelligence committees released findings and recommendations in December 2002, with Senator Shelby also sharing his additional views. These documents can be found on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence website. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released findings emphasizing the lack of information on the 9/11 attacks, systemic weaknesses in intelligence and law enforcement, and the absence of a government-wide strategy to combat terrorism. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found systemic weaknesses in intelligence and law enforcement after the 9/11 attacks. Recommendations included creating a Director of National Intelligence to prioritize collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence, as well as establishing a government-wide strategy for combating terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security was also advised to become an effective terrorism information fusion center for improved counterterrorism analysis and intelligence dissemination. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence recommended improving counterterrorism analysis and intelligence dissemination by giving DHS full access to relevant intelligence information, enhancing FBI's intelligence capabilities, addressing NSA's technological challenges, and investing in long-term counterterrorism capabilities. Senator Shelby expressed additional views on the matter in an 84-page statement. Senator Shelby criticized the DCI for not exerting greater management and budgetary authority over the Intelligence Community. He called for a reexamination of the intelligence provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 and faulted senior leaders for hindering inter-agency cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Shelby emphasized the need for the Intelligence Community to be more agile and responsive to modern threats. Senator Shelby emphasizes the need for an agile and responsive Intelligence Community to evolve with shifting threats. He advocates for improved coordination, information sharing, and the ability to swarm resources as needed. He criticizes the dominance of collection agencies and supports Admiral Jacoby in modernizing intelligence practices for the 21st century. Senator Shelby supports Admiral Jacoby's call for improved access to data for analysts in the Intelligence Community. He criticizes the FBI for its collapse in counterintelligence and counterterrorism functions, suggesting radical reform is necessary. Senator Shelby supports Admiral Jacoby's call for improved access to data for analysts in the Intelligence Community and criticizes the FBI for its collapse in counterintelligence and counterterrorism functions, suggesting radical reform is necessary. He also emphasizes the importance of human intelligence (HUMINT) in counterterrorism and advocates for undercover agents to be placed among the target population, highlighting the valuable experience of law enforcement agencies in this area. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2003 established an independent commission to investigate the background of the September 2001 attacks, ensuring transparency and thorough examination of all relevant factors regardless of security restrictions. The commission will evaluate evidence from various government agencies, including the Joint Inquiry, and provide findings, conclusions, and recommendations for corrective measures. The independent commission established by the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2003 will investigate the September 2001 attacks, gather information from government agencies, conduct hearings, and submit findings, conclusions, and recommendations within 18 months. It may also study organizational arrangements for handling terrorist threats and consider giving the DCI additional authority over intelligence resources. The issue of the DCI having direct control over major intelligence agencies in the Defense Department remains unresolved. Some observers suggest an independent commission should review the relationship between intelligence and information functions in the Department of Homeland Security before they are formalized. Frederick Hitz, a former CIA Inspector General, believes Congress should reconsider the prohibition on CIA involvement in domestic law enforcement activities. Some observers are concerned about the extensive use of traditional intelligence methods in domestic law enforcement efforts, fearing it could undermine civil liberties. Senator Graham called for a re-examination of the scope and limitations of domestic collection of terrorism-related intelligence post-9/11. The Joint Inquiry has focused on balancing civil liberties with national security concerns post-9/11 attacks. There are concerns about sharing intelligence information among agencies and the effectiveness of the current government structure in collecting intelligence. The need to enhance domestic collection capabilities is being considered. Some critics argue that mixing intelligence and law enforcement roles in addressing post-9/11 security concerns may undermine civil liberties. An independent commission is suggested to help find a balance between national security and civil liberties. The final report of the intelligence committees, expected in 2003, may include assessments of agency performance and leadership. The Joint Inquiry staff is conducting investigations and assessments related to the September 11 attacks. They are focusing on bridging the gap between intelligence and law enforcement, as well as enhancing the FBI's counterterrorism efforts. Statutory changes have been made, and further adjustments in intelligence and law enforcement are deemed necessary. Some believe more precise statutory protections of civil liberties are necessary for the lengthy campaign against international terrorism. Discussions continue on the character and extent of potential changes."
