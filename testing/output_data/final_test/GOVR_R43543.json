    "content": "The report provides background information on the LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ship program, including the deferral of LPD-31 procurement to FY2021. It also discusses the Navy's plans for LHA-9 in FY2024. Issues for Congress include funding decisions for LPD-31 and LHA-9 in FY2020 and the overall emphasis on amphibious ships in the Navy's budget. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission emphasizes amphibious ships, which could impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Navy amphibious ships transport U.S. Marines and their equipment to distant areas for expeditionary operations. These ships support Marine landings against military forces and are also used for operations in permissive environments. Amphibious ships are versatile for combat and noncombat operations, with large storage spaces and the ability to transfer people, equipment, and supplies from ship to shore using helicopters and landing craft. Forward-deployed U.S. Navy amphibious ships are often organized into amphibious ready groups (ARGs) and are used for peacetime engagement activities with foreign countries. Navy amphibious ships are versatile for various operations, with big-deck ships like LHAs and LHDs resembling aircraft carriers, and smaller LPDs or LSDs. LHAs and LHDs can carry more Marines and equipment, while LPDs and LSDs have smaller capacities. The Navy's 355-ship force-level goal aims to achieve a balanced fleet composition. The Navy's goal is to maintain a 38-ship amphibious force, including LHAs, LHDs, LPDs, and LSDs. Meeting combatant commander requests would require 50 or more amphibious ships. As of FY2018, the Navy had 32 amphibious ships. The FY2020 shipbuilding plan projects the force of amphibious ships. The Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan projects an increase in the force of amphibious ships to 38 ships by FY2026, remaining at 36-38 ships from FY2027 to FY2034, declining to 34-35 ships in FY2035-FY2038, increasing to 36-37 ships in FY2039-FY2046, and staying at 35 ships in FY2047-FY2049. The plan aims to maintain an average of about 35.8 ships over the 30-year period, close to the required 38 ships, but the lift capability may vary due to the mix of ships in service. The aging Whidbey Island/Harpers Ferry class ships were procured between FY1981 and FY1993, with 12 ships in service. The Navy's plan includes replacing 12 aging ships with new LPD-17 Flight II ships, starting with LPD-30 in 2025. The new ships are based on the design of the San Antonio class amphibious ships. The Navy plans to replace 12 aging ships with new LPD-17 Flight II ships, starting with LPD-30 in 2025. The Flight II design is somewhat less expensive and in some ways less capable than the original LPD-17 design, but still similar in appearance and capabilities. The LPD-17 Flight II design is similar in appearance and capabilities to the LPD-17 Flight I design. The Navy plans to procure a total of 13 LPD-17 Flight II ships, with the first ship procured in FY2018. The procurement schedule has been adjusted, with LPD-31 now planned for FY2021 and LPD-32 for FY2023, followed by the remaining 10 ships at a rate of one per year starting in FY2025. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission reduces the number of LPD-17 Flight II ships to be procured from four to two in FY2020-FY2024. LPD-17 Flight II ships cost approximately $1.8 billion each. The Navy plans to procure LHA-9 in FY2024, estimated to cost $4.1 billion. The procurement cost of LHA-9 is approximately $4.1 billion. There is interest in accelerating the procurement to achieve better production learning curve benefits and reduce costs. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the 7-year span until LHA-9 is procured in 2024 and suggests reducing this span for workforce efficiency and increased learning curve. The Senate Armed Services Committee urges the Secretary of the Navy to accelerate procurement of LHA-9 to not later than 2021, with $350 million in unrequested funding provided to encourage earlier procurement. The Navy's FY2020 budget does not request additional funding for LHA-9, planned for procurement in FY2024, but there is interest in reducing the 7-year span for workforce efficiency and cost reduction. The Navy plans to use two-year incremental funding to procure LHA-9, with Huntington Ingalls Industries/Ingalls Shipbuilding as the current builder. The supplier base for LHA production includes 457 companies in 39 states. Congress faces procurement decisions for FY2020, including whether to procure LPD-31 in FY2020 or FY2021. The Navy is considering whether to procure LPD-31 in FY2020 or FY2021 with full or incremental funding, and the amount of procurement or AP funding for LPD-31 and LHA-9 in FY2020. Supporters argue that procuring LPD-31 in FY2020 could help achieve the 38-ship amphibious force-level goal sooner, while others believe FY2026 is an acceptable timeline. The Navy is considering procuring LPD-31 in FY2020, which may impact funding for other Navy programs. Supporters argue that full funding for LPD-31 could allow for more budgetary room in FY2021 and beyond. Supporters of funding LPD-31 with incremental funding argue that it could reduce FY2020 funding needs, preserving more funding for other Navy or DOD programs. Congress may consider factors such as Navy's work schedule and estimates for FY2020, and how procurement timing for LPD-31 and LHA-9 could impact the type and amount of work to be done on these ships. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission is placing reduced emphasis on amphibious ships compared to other types of Navy ships, such as attack submarines and destroyers. Some argue that amphibious ships are as important and in high demand by U.S. combatant commanders, while others acknowledge their value but suggest prioritizing within a finite budget. The Navy's FY2020 budget is focusing less on amphibious ships compared to other types like attack submarines and destroyers. Some argue for prioritizing critical ships like attack submarines and destroyers to counter China's naval capabilities. Congress may also need to address shortfalls in attack submarines, large surface combatants, and small surface combatants. Technical risks in the LPD-17 Flight II and LHA programs are also a concern highlighted in a 2019 GAO report. The Navy's FY2020 budget prioritizes attack submarines and destroyers over amphibious ships like the LPD-17 Flight II. The Flight II design includes 200 modifications from Flight I, with a new radar system in development. Ship construction is expected to begin by December. The Navy plans to start ship construction for LPD 17 Flight II by December 2019 without incorporating radar testing lessons into the design. They have a non-competitive acquisition strategy for Flight II, awarding sole-source contracts to Huntington Ingalls. The program did not request a separate cost estimate for Flight II, leading to a lack of visibility into specific costs for Flight II. The Navy plans to start ship construction for LPD 17 Flight II by December 2019 with a non-competitive acquisition strategy, awarding sole-source contracts to Huntington Ingalls. The program did not request a separate cost estimate for Flight II, constraining visibility into specific costs. The program office stated that LPD Flight II is included under the existing LPD 17 acquisition program baseline. The LHA 8 incorporates significant design changes and is scheduled to be delivered in January 2024. The LHA 8 program, scheduled for delivery in January 2024, is relying on technology from the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar program. The radar, considered the program's highest development risk, is crucial for self-defense and situational awareness capabilities. Delays in radar delivery could lead to design issues and testing delays. However, radar developers assure that it is on schedule for delivery. The Navy's construction of the LHA 8 ship began with only 61 percent of the 3D product model completed, which goes against best practices. The shipbuilder is not expected to complete 100 percent of the model until June 2019, causing potential schedule delays. The program office assures that all design changes, including reintroducing the well deck and incorporating EASR, are understood by the Navy.

Congressional action on the Navy's FY2020 funding request for the LPD-17 Flight II and LHA-9 programs is summarized in Table 4."
