    "content": "Offshore aquaculture involves raising marine organisms in ocean waters beyond coastal influence, primarily in the federal waters of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Advocates believe it could boost U.S. seafood production and benefit coastal communities, while opponents fear environmental harm and negative impacts on fishing. Developing offshore aquaculture will require addressing regulatory, environmental, and management challenges. Regulatory uncertainty is a key barrier to its development. Regulatory uncertainty is a major barrier to developing offshore aquaculture in federal waters of the United States. A clear regulatory regime is lacking, creating an environment of uncertainty that hinders investment in the industry. Governments need to create a supportive political climate and regulatory conditions for offshore aquaculture to fully develop. Congressional action may be necessary to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture. Offshore aquaculture faces regulatory challenges due to a lack of comprehensive legislation. Controversy arises from differing views among aquaculturalists, environmentalists, and fishermen. Environmental concerns include degradation of the environment and harm to wild fish populations. Some in the fishing industry oppose aquaculture due to potential development on fishing grounds and competition with wild products. Advocates argue that advancements in technology and proper regulation have minimized environmental impacts and improved efficiency. Renewed efforts in the 116th Congress aim to improve regulatory efficiency and minimize environmental degradation in marine aquaculture. Factors like technical advances, economic feasibility, and government support will impact the industry's future growth. Establishing offshore aquaculture in federal waters requires a regulatory framework but may need additional services like program administration and research. Technical uncertainties in harsh offshore conditions and higher operating costs may slow industry development. The report examines challenges in offshore aquaculture development in federal waters, including regulatory, environmental, and economic issues. It also highlights potential concerns for Congress and recent legislation introduced. Global aquaculture production rivals wild seafood production for human consumption. Global aquaculture production has grown significantly, now accounting for 47% of global fish production. In contrast, wild fisheries production has leveled off due to unsustainable fishing practices. With advancements in aquaculture technologies, it is expected that aquaculture production will continue to expand to meet the demands of the growing population. In the United States, aquaculture production is mainly from inshore areas, while wild fisheries are limited by the productive capacity of U.S. waters. U.S. aquaculture production has stagnated and makes up a small portion of total seafood production. Approximately 8.2% of the total seafood production in the U.S. comes from aquaculture, with most production consisting of freshwater species. The growth in U.S. seafood consumption relies heavily on imports, which provide 80% to 90% of the seafood consumed in the country. Aquaculture in the United States provides 80% to 90% of seafood consumed, with 50% of imports coming from aquaculture. Changes in policies are needed to address regulatory obstacles hindering aquaculture expansion. Aquaculture involves propagating aquatic species in various environments, including freshwater, land-based closed systems, coastal areas, and offshore locations. Hatcheries are often used to spawn and grow fish and shellfish to specific stages before transferring them to facilities. Aquaculture operations involve growing organisms from specific stages to marketable size in controlled environments. Intensive systems like freshwater catfish farming focus on maximizing growth while minimizing costs through controlled inputs like water, feed, and disease treatment. Commercial salmon aquaculture facilities use net pens in protected marine areas. Bivalves like oysters and clams are grown in estuaries and inshore areas. Bivalves such as oysters and clams are grown in estuaries and inshore areas, feeding on plankton and detritus filtered from seawater. Aquaculture methods vary, including suspension on lines, wire cages, and rafts. Oyster larvae are raised in hatcheries and transferred to structures to grow to market size. In Alaska, hatcheries enhance salmon fry production for release into the wild. Public stocking programs by states and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service aim to achieve various objectives. Catfish aquaculture has been the dominant food fish production in the United States, but has declined by 44% due to factors like competition from Asian imports. Crawfish production and revenue increased significantly, while salmon and oyster production also saw growth. Cultured oysters showed the largest increases in production and revenue, likely due to higher demand. Offshore aquaculture is seen as a potential alternative to land-based and nearshore aquaculture, with supporters believing it can increase U.S. seafood production and provide economic opportunities for coastal communities. The potential of offshore aquaculture in the United States varies by species, region, and technology. Offshore aquaculture in the United States is likely to differ by species, region, and technology. Currently, no commercial offshore aquaculture facilities operate in the U.S. EEZ, but some are located in nearshore state waters. Inshore marine production may be constrained by various factors, leading to increasing attention on potential aquaculture development in offshore areas. Operating offshore may have higher costs due to challenging environments, but research shows it is feasible. Offshore aquaculture expansion into clean, well-flushed waters shows great potential, but faces technological and operational challenges. Structures and materials need to withstand harsh oceanic conditions while keeping costs low. Initially, species with established markets like Atlantic salmon, white sea bass, cobia, and blue mussel may be used. Currently, salmon net pen facilities operate in protected inshore waters, but offshore aquaculture is being explored for future growth. Several net pen aquaculture facilities have operated in exposed state waters of Hawaii and Puerto Rico, with characteristics similar to offshore areas. Permits have been issued for research and limited commercial aquaculture in the EEZ. Three mussel farms recently received permits to operate in offshore waters, with other ventures proposed. Researchers are adapting inshore facilities for offshore aquaculture, using systems like submersible cages, net pens, and longline arrays. Systems have been developed to withstand harsh open ocean conditions. Offshore aquaculture systems have been developed to withstand harsh open ocean conditions, including submersible cage designs and single-point moorings. Cage-mounted autonomous feeding systems can operate at the surface and submerged. Mechanized and remote systems are being developed for control from land-based facilities. Federal agencies play various roles in aquaculture regulation, research, and support, with the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 encouraging industry development and federal coordination. The National Aquaculture Act of 1980 established the Subcommittee on Aquaculture (SCA) to coordinate federal activities and enhance cooperation among agencies. SCA's functions include reviewing national needs for aquaculture research, technology transfer, and assistance programs, collecting and disseminating information, and recommending actions on aquaculture issues. SCA operates under the Committee on Environment of the National Science and Technology Council and is chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Subcommittee on Aquaculture (SCA) coordinates federal activities related to aquaculture, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior. SCA includes nine additional departments and agencies with an interest in aquaculture, meeting quarterly to discuss topics such as fish disease and regulation. Federal aquaculture activities are primarily carried out by the Department of the Interior, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture, with other agencies indirectly involved in regulatory programs. Examples include USACE, EPA, and the Food and Drug Administration. The USDA plays a key role in supporting freshwater aquaculture, funding research centers and conducting national aquaculture census. The Animal and Plant Inspection Service provides health certifications for exports and veterinary biologics. The Farm Service Agency administers farm lending. The Farm Service Agency administers farm lending programs, including disaster loans for aquaculture operations. USDA's programs for land-based agriculture may be adapted for marine aquaculture development. DOI's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supports stocking programs for recreational fishing and operates the National Fish Hatchery System to enhance fish stocks. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) supports fish stocking programs and operates facilities to enhance fish stocks. FWS and NMFS regulate aquaculture activities to protect endangered species and marine mammals. NOAA's Office of Aquaculture focuses on regulatory and scientific services for marine aquaculture, with regional coordinators overseeing permitting activities. Aquaculture in federal waters is regulated under the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. NOAA released a strategic plan for marine aquaculture in 2015, aiming to create a robust U.S. marine aquaculture sector. The plan outlines goals, strategies, and crosscutting strategies to increase aquaculture production. The strategic plan for marine aquaculture released by NOAA in 2015 aims to increase aquaculture production through coordinated regulatory processes, environmentally responsible practices, technology development, and public awareness. The plan includes goals, strategies, and crosscutting strategies to strengthen partnerships, improve communication, build agency infrastructure, and ensure consistent management within NOAA. NOAA programs, including the National Sea Grant Marine Aquaculture Grant Program, support aquaculture directly and indirectly by funding industry challenges. The NOAA supports aquaculture development through grants focusing on industry challenges like improving feeds, enhancing seafood safety, and diversifying species. Offshore aquaculture faces challenges in production technology, economic costs, and environmental impacts. Generalizations on addressing these challenges are difficult due to the variety of species, technologies, and scales of operation. Offshore aquaculture development faces concerns including legal and regulatory issues, environmental harm, economic challenges, and stakeholder interests. Ownership rights in the marine environment are a key issue, with a proposed partnership model between government and industry for clarity and stability. This contrasts with land-based industries like catfish farming. The government already grants specific rights for resource extraction on the continental shelf, such as for oil and gas and wind energy development. Aquaculture regulation depends on geographic location and facility characteristics. States have jurisdiction over areas extending 3 nautical miles from the coast and internal waters. Federal agencies regulate aquaculture facilities in waters from 3 to 200 nautical miles from the baseline. Some federal laws apply to marine aquaculture in US waters, including facilities in state and federal marine waters. No single federal agency can approve offshore aquaculture in federal waters. USACE, NMFS, and EPA regulate activities for aquaculture facilities. Permitting process involves consultation and review requirements. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act prohibits unauthorized obstruction or alteration. Section 10 prohibits unauthorized obstruction or alteration of navigable waters, requiring authorization from USACE before construction, including aquaculture facilities within 3 nm from shore. USACE regulates the use of navigable waters, not aquaculture itself. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act extends USACE authority over artificial islands and installations attached to the seabed. Offshore aquaculture permits are required for structures like cages, net pens, or lines attached to the seabed. A Section 10 permit is needed for construction in federal waters, assessing impacts on navigation and public interest. The permit decision considers benefits versus harm to important resources. Permit requirements for aquaculture beyond 3 nm may vary. Aquaculture development beyond 3 nm may have different permit requirements compared to within 3 nm. EPA regulates water quality under the Clean Water Act, requiring NPDES permits for pollutant discharges into federal ocean waters from point sources. Aquaculture facilities may discharge pollutants such as fecal matter, excess feed, and antibiotics. EPA regulates these facilities as point sources if they meet specific criteria. Commercial aquaculture operations in federal waters may require a NPDES permit. NMFS has management authority over offshore aquaculture, regulated under the MSA. The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) regulates fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through federal fishery management plans. While the MSA does not explicitly mention aquaculture, its authority over all fish in the EEZ and the definition of \"fishery\" provide a basis for regulating aquaculture. Regional fishery management councils operate under the MSA's authority. The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) regulates fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through federal fishery management plans. Regional fishery management councils and NMFS oversee offshore aquaculture, with NMFS authorizing it for research purposes under limited-duration permits. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (GMFMC) approved an aquaculture FMP in 2009, with NMFS implementing it in 2016. The plan allows for up to 20 facilities with a combined total production of 64 million pounds annually of Gulf of Mexico native species. Applicants must obtain other federal permits before starting operations. A recent legal decision has raised doubts on NMFS's authority to regulate aquaculture under the MSA in the Gulf of Mexico. The court found that NMFS exceeded its authority when adopting a regulatory scheme for aquaculture operations, stating that the MSA's grant of authority to regulate \"fishing\" and \"harvesting\" did not include aquaculture. The recent legal decision raised doubts on NMFS's authority to regulate aquaculture under the MSA in the Gulf of Mexico. Concerns exist about regional management of offshore aquaculture under the MSA potentially adding additional administrative requirements. Commercial aquaculture is less likely to occur in federal waters under the jurisdiction of other regional fishery management councils. Regulatory authority over species in aquaculture remains unclear. Regulatory authority over species, such as mussels, not managed under a federal FMP is unclear. Federal permitting programs trigger consultation and review requirements. Environmental requirements may require agencies to minimize adverse impacts before issuing permits. States can develop coastal management programs under the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) focuses on federal consistency, requiring federal agency activities to align with state coastal management plans. Applicants for Federal licenses must certify compliance with state policies for activities affecting coastal resources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires federal activities to align with state coastal management plans. Federal licensing and permitting fall under one of four categories that may be reviewed for consistency with state policies. Applicants must submit data and a certification ensuring compliance with the state's approved program. If activities are outside the coastal zone, the state must describe the geographic location in its management program. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires federal activities to align with state coastal management plans. Federal licensing and permitting are categorized as listed or unlisted activities in the state's Coastal Management Program (CMP). Unlisted activities undergo a review process by the state, federal agency, and NOAA Office of Coastal Management (OCM) to determine consistency with the coastal zone. The state can object, issue conditional concurrence, or permit the activity based on various outcomes. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider environmental consequences of proposed actions. Agencies must document impacts in an environmental impact statement (EIS) if significant, or prepare an environmental assessment (EA) if uncertain. NEPA sets procedural requirements but does not dictate specific actions. NEPA sets procedural requirements for federal agencies to consider environmental consequences of proposed actions, such as preparing an EIS if significant impacts are identified. NMFS and FWS have responsibilities under the ESA and MMPA to review project proposals that may affect marine mammals or endangered species. Consultation may be required under Section 7 of the ESA if a federal permit may harm a listed species, with reasonable and prudent alternatives suggested to avoid harm. The MMPA prohibits actions that may harm marine mammals. The MMPA prohibits harassment, hunting, capturing, killing, or taking of marine mammals without a permit. Aquaculture facilities need a Marine Mammal Authorization Program certificate to interact with marine mammals. The MSA requires consultation with NMFS for activities that may harm essential fish habitat. NOAA manages national marine sanctuaries under the NMSA. Under the National Marine Sanctuary Act (NMSA), NOAA manages national marine sanctuaries. Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary of Commerce before activities that may harm sanctuary resources. If harm is likely, the Secretary recommends measures to avoid damage. The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires federal agencies to assess potential adverse effects on listed properties. Federal agencies must consult with state and/or tribal historic preservation officers to determine the impact on properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places, including shipwrecks and prehistoric sites. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act mandates consultation with FWS, NMFS, and state wildlife agencies for activities affecting bodies of water. The Coast Guard has authority over private aids to navigation in U.S. waters, requiring structures like aquaculture facilities to be marked for maritime safety. Aquaculture facilities must be marked with lights and signals for maritime navigation safety. Private aid to navigation requires authorization from the U.S. Coast Guard district. BSEE oversees offshore energy industry on the outer continental shelf and reviews aquaculture applications for potential conflicts with mineral operations. BOEM manages energy and mineral resources on the outer continental shelf and requires a right-of-use easement for aquaculture operations near oil and gas facilities. Previous aquaculture bills focus on environmental protection and monitoring. Critics of offshore aquaculture express concerns about environmental degradation and conflicts with existing marine uses. They mention issues like escapes of organisms, disease introduction, pollution, and habitat loss. Supporters argue that opposition lacks understanding of aquaculture benefits and risks, despite scientific literature contradicting perceived risks. They highlight farming experiences, technology, siting, and regulation as factors reducing environmental impact. Technological advances, proper siting, and industry regulation have reduced environmental impacts and improved efficiency in marine aquaculture. Moving operations offshore and selecting appropriate sites can further decrease impacts, as offshore waters are less prone to environmental harm. Limited knowledge about offshore aquaculture's potential harm exists due to few studies focusing on it. Most information comes from inshore areas where aquaculture farms are established. Characteristics of inshore and offshore operations are similar. Offshore aquaculture differs from inshore operations in characteristics such as currents, wind, waves, water quality, and depth. Various issues related to marine aquaculture include water pollution, habitat degradation, sustainability of fish feeds, antibiotic use, invasive species introduction, escape of cultured organisms, and spread of waterborne diseases. The impacts of net pen aquaculture on the environment include the discharge of fish waste and feed, which can affect water quality and the seafloor. Effluent treatment is not feasible as wastes are directly released into the ocean. Factors influencing environmental impacts include feed quality, digestion, feeding rate, fish biomass, and species. Nutrient dispersion and impacts from net pen aquaculture are influenced by factors such as feed quality, digestion, metabolism, feeding rate, biomass of fish, species, cage design, depth, currents, water quality, and benthic features. Water quality impacts include increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, lipids, turbidity, and oxygen depletion. Eutrophication can occur at high densities with poor water body flushing. Aquaculture's nitrogen contribution varies depending on environmental factors and species, with some nutrients flushed away from cage areas. Management practices like selecting sites with adequate current and depth can help mitigate impacts. Management practices such as choosing sites with adequate current and depth can improve circulation and waste dissipation in water bodies. Solid feed and fish waste descending through the water column may accumulate around aquaculture facilities, leading to hypoxia and changes in sediment chemistry. Advances in technology, improved facility siting, better feed management, and stricter regulations have helped reduce harmful environmental impacts from marine aquaculture in the United States. Advances in technology, improved facility siting, better feed management, and stricter regulatory requirements have led to reduced waste outputs in aquaculture. Feed formulations have been adjusted for better digestibility, resulting in less waste and nutrients released into the environment. Feeding practices have been modified to prevent overfeeding and waste, with some facilities using underwater devices for monitoring. Environmental monitoring guides farmers on site management and feeding adjustments. Multi-tropic aquaculture, incorporating other organisms like invertebrates and seaweeds, is proposed to create a natural food chain within aquaculture systems. Offshore aquaculture may have fewer environmental impacts than nearshore operations due to nutrient dispersion in open ocean waters. Critics question the relevance of experimental facilities to future commercial operations. Environmental impacts in aquaculture vary based on management, location, and species. Fish diseases in aquaculture are caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites common in wild populations. The global aquaculture industry faces significant losses due to fish diseases, costing an estimated $6 billion annually. In 2007, the Chilean aquaculture industry experienced a severe outbreak of infectious salmon anemia virus, resulting in the loss of 350,000-400,000 mt of production and $2 billion. Pathogens can easily spread in net pen enclosures, where fish are kept at high densities, increasing the risk of disease transmission. Research suggests that farmed fish can transfer pathogens to wild fish, and non-native pathogens may be introduced through fish movement. Sea lice pose a serious problem for Atlantic salmon farming, leading to lost production and high costs of disease management. Studies show that high host densities in net pens facilitate the transmission and growth of the parasite. There is debate over the impact of sea lice on wild salmon populations, with some asserting harm caused by infested salmon farms. Transmission occurs from wild to cultured fish, and back to wild salmon hosts, with the extent of impact on wild salmon populations being a matter of ongoing discussion due to various influencing factors. The debate over salmon population abundance is influenced by various factors, with a recent study highlighting the critical impact of sea lice on Atlantic salmon populations. Control strategies include using approved drugs and fallowing sites between production cycles. Different drugs like disinfectants, antibiotics, and anthelmintic agents are used to prevent diseases, treat infections, remove parasites, and aid in spawning. Drugs are used in aquaculture to aid in spawning, treat infections, remove parasites, and sedate fish for transport. The FDA approves drugs for specific species and purposes, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Monitoring and management practices help control viral diseases, but depopulation may be necessary in some cases. The USDA regulates infectious diseases and requires permits for certain fish imports. The use of aquaculture drugs, such as antibiotics, in fish farming can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the use of these drugs is declining due to the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing bacterial diseases. For example, salmon farming in Norway has seen a 95% decrease in antibiotic use, and antibiotics are now rarely used in Maine. Offshore aquaculture is promoted for its cleaner water conditions compared to inshore areas. The occurrence of fish diseases could be lower for offshore aquaculture due to better oxygenated water conditions. The escape of non-native species from aquaculture facilities is an environmental concern, which can lead to long-term harm to the ecosystem. For example, Asian carp introduced for water quality improvement in the United States have negatively impacted native species and genetic diversity. Interbreeding between hatchery-raised and wild fish could lead to a loss of genetic diversity and fitness in the population. Concerns also include the establishment of non-native fish competing with wild fish for resources. Escapes of farmed Atlantic salmon have been observed, with over 100,000 escaping from facilities in Washington in 2017. Escapes of Atlantic salmon from Cook Aquaculture facilities off Cypress Island, WA were recovered, with some fish unable to adapt to a natural diet. In British Columbia, escaped salmon have spawned wild offspring, but it is uncertain if they have established self-reproducing populations. Farmed salmon have been found on spawning grounds during wild salmon spawning, with genetic changes due to domestication and selective breeding for specific traits. Present-day farm production is based on five Norwegian strains, leading to potential hybridization between farmed and wild salmon. The interbreeding of farmed and wild salmon in Norway and Ireland has led to changes in genetic variability, affecting the survival of wild populations. Large-scale experiments show reduced survival rates of farmed and hybrid salmon compared to wild salmon. Measures are recommended to reduce escapes from aquaculture farms and prevent further loss of genetic diversity. The loss of genetic diversity in aquaculture can be addressed by using native species for farming and implementing measures to prevent escapes. One approach is to use wild broodstock with genetic similarity to local populations, but this may limit the benefits of selective breeding. Another option is to use sterile fish created through various techniques, although this may increase production costs. Interactions between aquaculture operations and marine wildlife, such as predators being attracted to aquaculture facilities, are common in certain regions like Chile, British Columbia, and Norway. Interactions between aquaculture operations and marine wildlife are common in Chile, British Columbia, and Norway. Predation by sea lions, seals, otters, and seabirds can lead to fish loss, equipment damage, and stress. Deterrence measures like predator nets and bird nets are used to protect fish. Offshore facilities may impact endangered species by altering essential habitat. Limited information is available on incidental entanglement and mortality in offshore areas. NOAA investigated longline aquaculture gear for mussel production. NOAA investigated longline aquaculture gear for mussel production and found rare interactions with marine wildlife. Researchers question if the low number of interactions indicates benignity or detection/reporting failures. Minimizing impacts on protected species may require monitoring and research on natural predator-prey interactions. Management strategies could include spatial planning and gear modifications. Wild fish attracted to net pens may benefit by consuming feed, reducing environmental impacts, but could also pose risks like disease transfer. Fish feed is crucial for aquaculture operations as it provides essential nutrients for fish growth and health. The use of fish meal and oil in feed for carnivorous species like salmon is important to mimic their wild diet. The composition of aquaculture feeds must balance growth and health with cost considerations. Negative impacts of aquaculture include disease transfer between farmed and wild fish, changes in wild fish physiology, and distribution. Researchers are focusing on finding substitutes for fish meal and oil in aquaculture feeds to balance growth and health with cost considerations. Plant-based ingredients now make up the majority of feed components, but fish meal and oil are still important in many cases. Fish feeds are formulated based on species, life stage, and management objectives to provide essential nutrients for growth at a low cost. Fish meal and oil have historically been key ingredients in aquaculture feeds, sourced from reduction fisheries targeting small pelagic species. These ingredients provide essential nutrients for growth at a low cost. The annual global supply of fish meal ranges from 4.49 mmt to 5.86 mmt, and fish oil from 0.86 mmt to 1.08 mmt. In 2016, the United States produced 253,600 mt of fish meal and 80,500 mt of fish oil, accounting for approximately 5% and 8% of the global supply. In the last 20 years, global production of fish meal and oil has declined due to increased use of fish for direct human consumption and tighter fishing regulations. Reduction fisheries supply 70% of fish meal and oil, with the rest coming from fish processing wastes. Despite a global decrease in total fish meal production, there has been an increase in production from fish processing wastes. Fish meal and oil are crucial ingredients for fish growth, with feeds formulated to increase efficiency by using high-energy lipids for better protein conversion. Fish feeds for fish like Atlantic salmon contain protein, oil, plant proteins, terrestrial animal protein, carbohydrates, moisture, ash, vitamins, and minerals. Fish are efficient in converting feed to flesh, with a feed conversion ratio of approximately 1.15 for salmon. In 2013, Norwegian salmon feed consisted of 18% fish meal and 11% fish oil. The use of plant-based substitutes has reduced the amount of marine fish protein and oil needed. The \"fish in fish out\" ratio varies for different species, with higher ratios for carnivorous fish like eels (1.75). Research on fish dietary requirements has led to the development of substitutes for fish meal and oil, with terrestrial plant ingredients now supplying the bulk of feed ingredients for most fish species. The Norwegian salmon industry has notably reduced its use of fish meal and oil in fish food. The Norwegian salmon industry has decreased the use of fish meal and oil in fish feed by utilizing plant proteins and oils. This shift has allowed for the expansion of aquaculture feed production by 6% to 8% annually. Rising demand and limited supply of fish meal and oil have tripled prices for these ingredients. Researchers are exploring feeding techniques and alternative sources to reduce costs and waste in aquaculture. Substitution of fish meal and oil with plant proteins and oils in fish feed has become more attractive due to rising prices. However, limitations still exist, such as lower growth rates, disease resistance, and nutritional value. Some fish meal and oil will still be needed in feed formulations due to deficiencies in essential amino acids and other factors in plant meals. The nutritional quality of plant proteins can be enhanced through processing, while fish oils containing omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for immune responses and fish health. Research into alternative feed options is likely to increase as fish meal and oil prices rise. Proper feed formulations are crucial for promoting fish health and preventing disease outbreaks, especially in high-density farming. Research has shown that plant oils and fatty acids can impact fish immune response. Dietary additives like immunostimulants, probiotics, and prebiotics can enhance immunity, feed efficiency, and growth. Improving feed formulations for newly domesticated species is a challenge. Seafood benefits human health with high-quality protein, oils, minerals, and vitamins. Omega-3 fatty acids in diets can aid brain and eye development, reduce heart disease, and cognitive decline. Plant-based substitutes in feeds can affect seafood product quality. Plant-based substitutes in fish feeds can impact seafood product quality by reducing beneficial fatty acids. Two ways to maintain omega-3 levels in fish are through genetically modified organisms or adjusting fish diets. Public health concerns include pollutants like PCBs and heavy metals in farmed fish. The accumulation of contaminants in farmed fish varies by location and sources of pollutants, with fish fed fish meal and oils potentially having higher levels. Using plant protein and oil in fish feed can lower contaminant levels compared to wild seafood products. Consumer perceptions of fish raised with substitute feeds may impact acceptance of aquaculture products. Studies have shown differences in taste and texture of fish farmed with alternative proteins and oils. Consumer preference studies on fish farmed with alternative proteins and oils have yielded mixed results. Concerns about aquaculture products include the use of antibiotics, crowding, and the industrial nature of fish farming. Stakeholders have raised sustainability issues related to the use of fish meal and oils derived from forage species. Forage species play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem by producing fatty acids that are consumed by fish and transferred up the food chain. Forage species have low economic value but large biomass, serving as prey for higher tropic level fish species. Aquaculture demand may lead to overfishing of forage fish populations. Research suggests fishing for forage species should be limited to support production of other marine species. Research using ecosystem models suggests that forage fish should be fished at lower rates to benefit the ecosystem rather than at rates for maximum yield. Recommendations include reducing catch rates by half and doubling forage fish biomass. However, some researchers question the connection between forage fish abundance and their predators, advocating for harvest policies guided by various factors. The future of offshore aquaculture development in the United States is uncertain due to limited experiences in establishing operations. The future of offshore aquaculture in the United States is uncertain due to limited experiences in establishing operations. Greater regulatory certainty may encourage development, but economic viability will ultimately determine industry expansion. Factors such as technical advances, economic conditions, social acceptance, and environmental costs will play a role in the industry's potential growth. User conflicts and political factors are also likely to impact offshore aquaculture development. The economic potential will depend on seafood prices. The economic potential of offshore aquaculture depends on seafood prices and production costs. Factors like demand, competition with other protein sources, and consumer preferences will influence profitability. The demand for seafood products is increasing globally and domestically due to rising population levels and incomes. Consumer preferences are shifting towards seafood for its health benefits, moving away from traditional protein sources like beef. Offshore aquaculture may produce higher-quality products with clean water flow through net pens, potentially containing fewer toxin residues. Domestic sources of seafood may increase marginally as overfished stocks recover, but most fisheries are already at their natural limits. Offshore aquaculture products may appeal to health-conscious consumers if they contain fewer toxins and are raised without aquaculture drugs. FDA and NOAA programs can reassure consumers about the safety and quality of domestic seafood, including offshore aquaculture products. Economic conditions influence the amount of seafood produced by aquaculturalists, with production costs mainly driven by feed and stocking of early life stages. Costs in aquaculture include fixed costs like equipment depreciation, insurance, taxes, and lease payments. Supply shifts due to input price changes influenced by technology, weather, and other factors. Aquaculturalists make short-term choices like feed quality and quantity adjustments, while long-term decisions involve species, location, technology, and scale changes. Offshore aquaculture costs are higher due to resilient cage materials, shore-side infrastructure, specialized vessels, and automation. Offshore aquaculture facilities face increased costs for fuel, monitoring, harvest, and security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, facilities operating over 25 nm from shore may not be profitable. Economies of scale are necessary to offset high transportation costs between inshore and offshore facilities. Large-scale operations require new coastal facilities and logistics networks for supplying feed, materials, fingerlings, and harvested fish. Startup costs may deter smaller producers from entering the offshore aquaculture industry. The high cost of coastal real estate and financial risks associated with offshore aquaculture may deter smaller producers from entering the industry. Assessing risk is complex due to different species, technologies, and lack of experience in offshore areas. Attracting investment is challenging as offshore aquaculture is a new industry with limited investor experiences to evaluate. Investors require a greater revenue stream as risk and uncertainty increase. Risks can be reduced by using stronger materials and insurance. Insurance premiums may be higher for offshore areas due to greater uncertainty. Policymakers consider broader costs beyond private production costs. Externalities are spillover costs or benefits associated with economic activities, such as pollution from aquaculture affecting commercial fishermen. When externalities are not considered, markets become inefficient. Policymakers can examine tradeoffs between private benefits and environmental harm from aquaculture production, including pollution, escaped organisms, and disease transmission. The government may need to intervene to address externalities in offshore aquaculture, such as pollution and disease transmission. The DOC is concerned about the high percentage of seafood imports in the U.S., with seafood trade now exceeding meat and poultry trade. High-value seafood from wild fisheries and aquaculture dominates these imports. In 2017, the United States imported approximately 2.7 mmt of edible seafood valued at $21.5 billion, with imports exceeding exports by $15.8 billion. Farmed shrimp and salmon are the main imported products, accounting for $6.5 billion and $3.5 billion respectively. Offshore aquaculture development is seen as a way to reduce the seafood trade deficit and improve food security. Advocates of aquaculture argue that the United States has advantages compared to other countries in developing the industry due to its extensive coastline, skilled labor, technology, domestic feed production, stable government and economy, and large seafood market. They believe that supporting other industries where other countries have an advantage would benefit the United States. Federal waters in the United States face harsh weather conditions, while other countries have more favorable conditions for aquaculture development with lower operating costs and environmental standards. Some believe that foreign producers have a competitive advantage due to lower costs, but domestic producers have advantages like a large market and lower shipping costs. The government may provide trade protections to new industries to level the playing field. Protection through tariffs or import quotas may be justified for new industries, such as infant industries needing time to overcome cost disadvantages. Tariffs can act as subsidies, increasing domestic prices until the industry becomes more efficient. However, once established, it may be challenging to remove the tariff. U.S. aquaculture production is small compared to global levels, with a focus on freshwater catfish, crayfish, and trout. Catfish production has seen significant growth over the years. The U.S. aquaculture industry has seen fluctuations in production, with factors like research, marketing, and imports affecting the market. Catfish farms have faced challenges due to lower prices from increased imports of pangasius and tilapia. Salmon aquaculture struggles to compete with cheaper imports from countries like Norway, Chile, and Canada. Stagnant prices, competitive imports, and environmental regulations have impacted U.S. salmon production. There is potential for expansion in the industry. Expansion of inshore net pen salmon aquaculture in Maine, Washington, and Alaska faces opposition due to environmental concerns and impacts on existing fishing industries. Countries like Norway and China are leading efforts to move offshore in aquaculture development, but commercial operations are not yet established. Norway is a leader in developing technology for offshore aquaculture, with companies experimenting in offshore waters. Other countries like Mexico, Panama, and Turkey are also developing offshore aquaculture facilities. Profitability of offshore concepts in Norway is uncertain, with long-term strategies still focused on inshore waters. Future development in marine aquaculture may focus on new species in tropical and subtropical regions, with potential growth in offshore areas. Concerns about offshore aquaculture include environmental degradation, competition for ocean space, and market interactions with wild fishery products. User conflicts have historically arisen in aquaculture. Environmental concerns and user conflicts are key issues in aquaculture, particularly in inshore areas. Fishermen often oppose aquaculture due to perceived competition and lower prices. Offshore aquaculture expansion is controversial, with concerns about harm to marine resources. Stakeholders cite pollution, use of wild species for fishmeal, fish escapement, and disease threats as major worries. Aquaculture faces environmental concerns such as pollution, use of wild species for fishmeal, fish escapement, disease threats, and harm to marine wildlife. Industry advocates stress research and management practices to mitigate risks. Offshore aquaculture is seen as a way to support the seafood industry and create infrastructure that benefits both sectors. Seafood imports from aquaculture have impacted markets and coastal communities, causing economic difficulties for Alaska salmon fishermen and processors. Wild salmon prices have partially recovered due to consumer preference for wild products. Competition from imported farmed products is expected to continue, leading to globalization and industry concentration. Marine aquaculture, particularly offshore aquaculture, faces challenges such as industry concentration, limited support, and opposition from environmental and fishing groups. To become a viable commercial industry, offshore aquaculture needs to overcome regulatory hurdles and gain political strength. Developing a regulatory framework is crucial before establishing offshore aquaculture in U.S. federal waters. A potential regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture in U.S. federal waters would need to fulfill public trust responsibilities, be flexible to evolving technology, and have clear statutory authority. It should include requirements for leasing offshore areas, agency coordination, and environmental protection to minimize harm. Supporters advocate for a more efficient permitting process that is transparent and involves public input. NMFS is the lead federal agency for marine aquaculture, both inshore and potentially offshore. According to a 2008 GAO study, there is no clear federal agency for regulating offshore aquaculture, and no comprehensive law addressing its administration. Stakeholders support NOAA managing federal aquaculture research, including offshore technologies. NMFS has tried to regulate offshore aquaculture under the MSA, but a recent court decision questioned NOAA's authority. Studies recommend granting NOAA clear authority for offshore aquaculture regulation. NOAA already evaluates marine activities to protect marine life. Currently, offshore aquaculture development in the EEZ lacks a specific permitting or leasing program, with leases depending on permits and consultation requirements under various laws and agencies. Developers seek exclusive rights through leases for specific activities in the EEZ. Aquaculture developers require exclusive rights via leases or permits for specific ocean areas to secure loans and funding. A leasing system could provide defined rights to ocean space, including transferability of the lease. Without long-term permitting or leasing, offshore aquaculture may struggle to obtain capital and insurance. The Gulf of Mexico Aquaculture Fishery Management Plan offers a 10-year site. The Gulf of Mexico Aquaculture Fishery Management Plan provides 10-year site permits and 5-year permit renewals. Industry representatives are concerned about the short intervals for profitability. Environmentalists prefer shorter timeframes for more frequent reviews of environmental impacts. Maine grants 10-year leases for salmon net pen aquaculture in state waters, while Hawaii grants 20-year leases for permits in its waters. Public concerns focus on minimizing harmful effects on the environment and conflicts among ocean uses. A leasing framework will require a review of potential environmental impacts, likely through a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) and site-specific assessments. The preparation of a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for offshore aquaculture is suggested to reduce the need for facility-specific reviews. Some propose permits on a case-by-case basis, while others advocate for ocean planning to identify suitable and restricted areas for aquaculture. This approach may help regulators assess potential sites for aquaculture permits independently. Regulators may assess potential aquaculture sites independently of permit applications to ensure predictability and consistency. Some suggest limiting permits to low-risk areas to reduce harm to marine mammals, but concerns exist about the selection of viable sites. A regulatory framework will likely include specific conditions based on species and technology, with common requirements for environmental quality and inspections. The Gulf FMP outlines operational requirements that could be applied to offshore aquaculture in other regions. The Gulf FMP outlines operational requirements for offshore aquaculture, including placing 25% of the facility in the water within two years, using electronic locating devices, sourcing juveniles from certified hatcheries, providing health certificates, complying with FDA regulations, monitoring environmental parameters, and allowing inspections. Recommendations include contingency plans for fish escapes and marking/tagging of facilities. Some fishery management councils support marking or tagging hatchery fish to track escaped organisms, but concerns exist over the added costs. Monitoring is necessary to track interactions with marine life and environmental changes. State regulators in Maine and Washington have established monitoring requirements for net pen salmon aquaculture, including monitoring the benthic community and notifying disease outbreaks. Federal monitoring requirements could be adjusted based on state experiences and new information. The Gulf FMP includes reporting requirements for stocking, escapement, and pathogen episodes. The Gulf FMP includes reporting requirements for stocking, major escapement, pathogen episodes (disease), harvest, change of hatchery, marine mammal and sea bird entanglement, and other activities. Aquaculture facilities in offshore areas may conflict with other ocean uses like oil and gas development, wind and tidal energy, and fisheries. A national aquaculture management framework should consider overall ocean policy and potential conflicts over access to federal waters for aquaculture development. Some ocean managers suggest overlaying maps of different jurisdictions, ocean uses, and aquaculture conditions to avoid user conflicts. Improving coordination among federal, state, territorial, and tribal entities is crucial for developing a regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture. The Subcommittee on Aquaculture facilitates communication among federal agencies to enhance coordination. Fishery management councils under the MSA may play a role in offshore aquaculture development. Fishery management councils develop FMPs for wild marine fisheries and consider offshore aquaculture in federal waters. Concerns include potential harm to wild fisheries and essential fish habitat. State involvement in regulating offshore aquaculture and stakeholder opinions on opt-out provisions are important considerations. Some suggest a 12 nm distance for states to refuse offshore aquaculture development in federal waters. Harmonizing regulations with adjacent states could benefit future development. Government assistance may be necessary for initial industry development, ranging from research support to financial aid. Comparisons to well-known agriculture sectors highlight the uncertainties in offshore aquaculture. Offshore aquaculture, unlike animal husbandry, faces uncertainties and requires new culture techniques. The U.S. Oceans Commission recommended more assistance and federal research in developing fish feeds, best practices, managing disease, and studying interactions with wild fish populations. Further research on aquaculture-environment interactions and potential harm to specific species and ecosystems could inform decisions on site selection and monitoring needs. Questions remain on which agency will support offshore aquaculture development, with concerns about NOAA and USDA's institutional experience and resources. Legislation in the 116th Congress may address adapting NOAA and/or USDA programs to support offshore aquaculture. Currently, the development of offshore aquaculture faces regulatory, technical, and economic uncertainties. Congress is considering legislation to provide regulatory certainty for the industry while ensuring environmental quality. Research shows offshore aquaculture is technically feasible, but profitability and investment depend on regulatory certainty. The development of offshore aquaculture relies on regulatory certainty for success. Businesses have faced challenges due to unclear regulations, leading to operations moving to other countries. Stakeholders seek secure property rights and clear regulations before investing in large-scale operations. Concerns about environmental degradation require assurances of adequate regulation and enforcement. Congressional actions have focused on providing support for aquaculture, including planning and research. The development of offshore aquaculture requires institutional support, clear regulations, and coordination to address environmental concerns. Congressional action may be necessary to support commercial development and environmental protection, with past attempts to pass legislation in multiple Congresses. In past Congresses, bills were introduced regarding offshore aquaculture development, but none were enacted. Stakeholders struggle to find a common vision for the industry's future. In the 116th Congress, bills related to offshore aquaculture have been introduced, such as the Keep Finfish Free Act of 2019 and the Commercial Fishing and Aquaculture Protection Act of 2019. The Commercial Fishing and Aquaculture Protection Act of 2019 (S. 2209) would provide assistance to eligible fishermen and aquaculture producers for losses due to various conditions. Other bills include the Prevention of Escapement of Genetically Altered Salmon to the United States Act (H.R. 1105) and the Shellfish Aquaculture Improvement Act of 2019 (H.R. 2425). In the 115th Congress, the AQUAA Act (S. 3138 and H.R. 6966) aimed to establish a regulatory framework for aquaculture development in federal waters. The AQUAA Act (S. 3138 and H.R. 6966) would have designated NOAA as the lead federal agency for federal waters aquaculture permitting. It required the development of programmatic environmental impact statements for suitable areas, while ensuring compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The Secretary of Commerce would consult with other agencies, states, and councils to establish environmental and management standards for offshore aquaculture. The bills S. 3138 and H.R. 6966 aimed to establish 10 standards for offshore aquaculture permitting, including considerations for other ocean uses and minimizing environmental impacts. They proposed creating the Office of Marine Aquaculture within NOAA to coordinate regulation, research, outreach, and international issues, replacing the current Office of Aquaculture. NOAA would lead a research and development aquaculture grant program. A bill (H.R. 223) was introduced to prohibit permits for finfish aquaculture in the EEZ without proper authorization. Similar bills in previous Congresses aimed to regulate offshore aquaculture development in federal waters, balancing aquaculture rights with environmental protection. In contrast, various bills in different Congresses aimed to regulate offshore aquaculture development by focusing on potential impacts, determining appropriate locations, issuing regulations, and supporting research. Most bills sought to prohibit permits for marine aquaculture facilities in the EEZ until specific requirements are met. The United States, being the largest seafood importer, has seen legislative efforts to address offshore aquaculture development. Aquaculture development in the United States has been hindered by factors like inexpensive imports, regulatory policies, and user conflicts. There is potential for offshore aquaculture facilities in federal waters to address these challenges, but it would require overcoming significant obstacles such as regulatory frameworks, technology development, and competition with existing seafood sources. The lack of a governance system for regulating offshore aquaculture is seen as a barrier to industry development. The lack of a regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture in the United States hinders industry development. Legislation is needed to establish clear requirements for offshore aquaculture in federal waters, balancing commercial development with environmental concerns. Challenges such as higher costs and risks compared to inshore operations remain. Offshore aquaculture faces financial risks due to lack of experience and limited knowledge of culture techniques for marine species. Federal support may be necessary for finance, research, extension, market development, and disaster assistance, similar to USDA support for agriculture."
