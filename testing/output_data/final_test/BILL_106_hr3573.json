    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that prior to June 7, 1956, no statutory health care program existed for retired members of the uniformed services who served a minimum of 20 years or had a service-connected disability. Recruiters led members to believe they would receive fully-paid lifetime health care upon retirement. In 1956, statutes entitled those who entered service after June 7, 1956, to medical and dental care in uniformed services facilities. After multiple base closures and drawdowns of military medical facilities, access to \"space available\" health care for many military retirees is virtually nonexistent. The current military health care benefit is no longer fair compared to benefits for other retired federal employees, leading to inadequate health care for retired uniformed service members. This lack of adequate health care is discouraging retired members from recommending military service as a career choice. The United States should provide fully paid health care for military members who entered active duty before June 7, 1956, and earned retirement. Additionally, adequate health care should be extended to all retired uniformed service members by offering coverage under various health benefits programs. SEC. 3. Coverage of military retirees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The amendment allows retired members of the uniformed services who began service before June 7, 1956, and their surviving spouses to enroll in approved health benefits plans under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The amendment provides 100 percent Government contribution for health benefits to certain employees and their surviving spouses. The Secretary of Defense will provide coverage to eligible beneficiaries through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Eligible beneficiaries include retired members of the uniformed services who began service before June 7, 1956, and their surviving spouses. The amendment provides 100 percent Government contribution for health benefits to certain eligible beneficiaries, including members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, dependents of deceased or living members, and their families. Eligible beneficiaries, including members of the uniformed services and their families, can enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan under chapter 89 of title 5 for self-only or self and family coverage. They are not required to meet eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89, except as provided in certain circumstances. An eligible beneficiary who enrolls in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program under chapter 89 of title 5 is not eligible to enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefits plan under this section. They shall not be eligible to receive health care under section 1086 or section 1097 but can continue to receive care in a military medical treatment facility, reimbursed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. An eligible beneficiary enrolled in a Federal Employees Health Benefits plan can change plans like any other beneficiary. Government contributions are limited to what would be payable for an employee in the same plan. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management mandates separate risk pools for health benefits plans under chapter 89 of title 5. Management requires health benefits plans under chapter 89 of title 5 to maintain a separate risk pool for establishing premium rates for eligible beneficiaries enrolling in the plan. SEC. 4. Extension of coverage of civilian health and medical program of the Uniformed Services by amending Section 1086 of title 10, United States Code. Subsection amendments effective January 1, 2001."
