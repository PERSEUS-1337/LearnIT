    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bureau of Reclamation Transparency Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of the Bureau of Reclamation's aging water resources infrastructure, valued at $94.5 billion in 2013, which supports various sectors in 17 states. Efforts have been made to manage these assets, including an annual review called the \"Asset Management Plan\". Actionable information on infrastructure conditions at the asset level, including maintenance needs due to aging infrastructure, is crucial for Congress to oversee Reclamation facilities and meet public needs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"asset\" in this Act refers to various assets used by the Bureau of Reclamation to manage water resources, including facilities, equipment, and structures essential to their mission. The term \"Asset Management Report\" refers to the annual plan prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation and any publicly available information summarizing their efforts to evaluate and manage infrastructure assets. \"Major repair and rehabilitation need\" includes major nonrecurring maintenance at Reclamation facilities, safety-related dam maintenance, deferred major maintenance, and significant repairs. The term \"Reclamation facility\" refers to infrastructure assets owned by the Bureau of Reclamation at a Reclamation project, including buildings, structures, facilities, or equipment for which operations and maintenance are performed by the Bureau of Reclamation. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. \"Transferred works\" are Reclamation facilities where operations and maintenance are carried out by a non-Federal entity under a formal agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation. SEC. 4. Asset management report enhancements for reserved works. The Secretary must submit an Asset Management Report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The report describes efforts to maintain reserved works at Reclamation facilities and standardize data reporting. It also includes a detailed assessment of major repair needs. The Asset Management Report to Congress must include a detailed assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for all reserved works at Reclamation projects, along with an itemized list of repair needs for individual facilities. The itemized list should include budget cost estimates and categorical ratings for each item. The system for assigning ratings should be consistent with specified requirements. The Secretary will issue guidance on the rating system for Reclamation facilities under paragraph (2)(B) and make the Asset Management Report publicly available, including on the Internet. The Asset Management Report may exclude sensitive information from the public version but must provide it to specific Senate and House committees. The report must be updated every 2 years and consultation with the Secretary is required. The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of the Army to assist in preparing and updating the Asset Management Report. SEC. 5. ASSET MANAGEMENT REPORT ENHANCEMENTS FOR TRANSFERRED WORKS. The Secretary will coordinate with non-Federal entities for reporting requirements on the condition and maintenance of transferred works. A rating system for transferred works will be developed based on input from water and power contractors, and included in updated Asset Management Reports. SEC. 6. OFFSET. The Federal share of a project's cost authorized by the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 will be reduced by $2,000,000. This is part of the efforts to manage infrastructure assets, as required by S. 1800."
