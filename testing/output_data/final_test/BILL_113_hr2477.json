The failure to treat symptoms of cancer and side effects of treatment can impact the health and quality of life of survivors. Low-income individuals and ethnic minorities may lack access to adequate cancer care. Shared decision-making and coordination of treatment options are often lacking for cancer patients. Quality cancer care should include access to psychosocial services and symptom management, shared decision-making for survivors, and a comprehensive care plan for follow-up monitoring and treatment of late effects. Individuals with cancer should have access to initial treatment recommendations, a treatment plan communicated to them, necessary resources for treatment, access to clinical trials, coordinated services, and psychosocial support services. The Institute of Medicine recommended these services for cancer survivors completing primary treatment. Individuals with cancer completing primary treatment should receive a comprehensive summary of their care and a follow-up survivorship plan, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine. Cancer care inadequacies for elderly Medicare beneficiaries should be addressed through the Medicare program to improve shared decision-making, symptom management, and monitoring of late effects of cancer treatment. Changes in Medicare payment for cancer care planning and coordination will enhance shared decision-making and improve care for individuals with cancer from diagnosis to end of life. The Social Security Act is amended to include coverage for cancer care planning and coordination services. The Social Security Act now covers cancer care planning and coordination services, which involve developing a treatment plan that assesses the individual's diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, and psychosocial needs, engages them in decision-making, and details all aspects of care including curative treatment and palliative care. The Social Security Act now covers cancer care planning and coordination services, including developing a treatment plan that assesses the individual's diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, and psychosocial needs. The plan must be provided in person or in writing to the individual promptly after diagnosis, consider cultural and linguistic needs, and adhere to appropriate standards set by the Secretary. Treatment plans should be revised as necessary to address any significant changes. The development of a follow-up survivorship care plan for individuals who have completed primary cancer treatment, including necessary revisions to address changes in condition, disease recurrence, treatment preferences, or care elements. The survivorship care plan includes an assessment of diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, functional status, pain control, and psychosocial needs. It engages the individual in shared decision-making, describes primary treatment elements, provides recommendations for subsequent care, and is furnished in person or in written form soon after primary treatment completion. The survivorship care plan includes assessment of diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, functional status, pain control, and psychosocial needs. It engages the individual in shared decision-making, describes primary treatment elements, provides recommendations for subsequent care, and is in accordance with appropriate standards. The plan is revised as necessary to account for changes in the individual's condition, diagnosis of a second cancer, preferences for survivorship care, or significant revisions for follow-up care. The Secretary will establish standards for revising treatment plans and follow-up survivorship care plans based on changes in the individual's condition or treatment intent. Standards will also cover communication of the plan to the individual, in consultation with relevant organizations. The shared decision-making process involves considering diagnosis, treatment options, medical evidence, risks, benefits, and individual preferences to develop a treatment plan. Amendments to the Social Security Act include payment under the physician fee schedule. The physician fee schedule amendment provides the same payment rate for cancer care planning and coordination services as transitional care management services. The effective date for these amendments is the first day of the first calendar year after the enactment of the Act."
