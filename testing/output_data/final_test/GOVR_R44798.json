    "content": "Following each decennial census, the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided among the 50 states, with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. Congressional redistricting must occur every 10 years to ensure equal population distribution among districts. This process involves state and federal legal requirements, including constitutional provisions like the Elections Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Elections Clause and Equal Protection Clause ensure fair elections and equal protection under the law. Redistricting maps must also comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which enforces the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition against voting discrimination based on race. Congress has the power to enforce these requirements. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits discriminatory voting practices based on race, color, or language minority, including in congressional redistricting plans. It allows challenges by the federal government or private citizens and ensures equal access to electoral processes for minority groups. Until 2013, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required certain states to obtain preclearance for any voting law changes to ensure no discrimination based on race or language minority. The purpose was to protect the ability of minority citizens to elect their preferred candidates. In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which required certain states to obtain preclearance for voting law changes to protect minority citizens' ability to elect their preferred candidates. This decision rendered Section 5 inoperable, releasing nine states and jurisdictions within six additional states from the preclearance requirement. The Supreme Court invalidated the VRA's preclearance requirement in 2013, releasing several states from this obligation. This decision has impacted redistricting disputes and the drawing of congressional districts, addressing population equality, Voting Rights Act compliance, partisan gerrymandering, and the constitutionality of independent redistricting commissions. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to require equal population in congressional districts, known as the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote.\" This principle was established in cases like Wesberry v. Sanders and Reynolds v. Sims for both congressional and state legislative redistricting. The Supreme Court has established the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote\" principle for congressional and state legislative redistricting. The Court has outlined the importance of precise population equality among districts, with less deviation allowed for congressional districts compared to state legislative districts. In Preisler v. the Supreme Court invalidated a congressional redistricting plan with a maximum population deviation of 5.97% as too great. In Karcher v. Dagett, the Court established that \"absolute\" population equality is the standard for congressional districts unless necessary for a legitimate state objective. Legitimate objectives include achieving greater compactness, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbents. The Court rejected a 0.6984% deviation in population between districts in Karcher. The Supreme Court clarified in Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission that congressional districts do not need precise mathematical equality but must be justified with legitimate state objectives. The Court outlined a two-pronged test based on Karcher to determine the constitutionality of a redistricting plan, shifting the burden to the state to justify population differences if challengers prove they could have been avoided. The state's burden is flexible and depends on the size of the deviation. The Supreme Court in Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission upheld a 0.79% maximum population deviation between congressional districts, emphasizing the state's burden to justify population differences based on legitimate state objectives. The Court considered factors such as avoiding contests between incumbents, maintaining county boundaries, and minimizing population shifts between districts as valid state policies. Alternative redistricting plans achieving greater population equality were deemed less effective in vindicating the state's objectives. The Supreme Court's redistricting jurisprudence addresses the interplay between the VRA and equal protection standards. While the Equal Protection Clause prohibits redistricting based on race without justification, the VRA requires consideration of race in drawing district lines. The Court provides guidance on balancing these considerations to prevent voter disenfranchisement. In some cases, the VRA may necessitate creating \"majority-minority\" districts to protect voting rights. The creation of majority-minority districts can prevent minority vote dilution by ensuring that racial or language minority groups have the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The Supreme Court's 1986 decision in Thornburg v. Gingles established a three-pronged test for proving vote dilution under the VRA, requiring the minority group to show they are large and geographically compact, politically cohesive, and face bloc voting by the majority. The Thornburg Court established that a violation of Section 2 is determined by the \"totality of the circumstances\" where plaintiffs may not have an equal opportunity to participate in the political processes. Factors such as history of discrimination and voting patterns are considered in assessing the situation. The factors considered in determining a violation of Section 2 include the extent of racially polarized voting, use of discriminatory voting practices, denial of access to candidate slating process, effects of discrimination on minority groups in education, employment, and health, racial appeals in political campaigns, and representation of minority groups in public office. In Bartlett v. Strickland, the Supreme Court ruled that for the first prong of the Gingles test to be satisfied, a minority group must constitute more than 50% of the voting population in a district. The Court rejected the argument that Section 2 requires drawing district lines to allow minority voters to join with others to elect their preferred candidate, even if the minority group comprises less than 50% of the voting age population in a district. The Supreme Court ruled in Bartlett v. Strickland that a minority group must make up more than 50% of the voting population in a district to satisfy the first prong of the Gingles test. The Court found it challenging to meet the third prong of Gingles in districts where majority voters are needed to join with minority voters to elect the minority's preferred candidate. In certain circumstances, Section 2 may require the creation of majority-minority districts in a congressional redistricting plan. In congressional redistricting, majority-minority districts are necessary to prevent racial vote dilution and ensure equal opportunity for minority voters. The Supreme Court requires minority voters to constitute over 50% in such districts. Redistricting plans must also adhere to equal protection standards under the Fourteenth Amendment. If race is the primary factor in drawing district lines, a \"strict scrutiny\" standard applies, requiring a compelling governmental interest for creating majority-minority districts. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of majority-minority districts in redistricting, requiring a compelling governmental interest and proving that race was not the dominant factor in drawing district boundaries. This tension between compliance with the Voting Rights Act and equal protection standards is known as \"racial gerrymandering.\" The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of majority-minority districts in redistricting, requiring a compelling governmental interest and proving that race was not the dominant factor in drawing district boundaries. In a long-running litigation, the State of North Carolina appealed a lower court decision deeming a 47% black district as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Court determined that the district boundaries were drawn based on political behavior rather than race, shifting the burden of proof to the challengers to demonstrate that race predominantly influenced the redistricting plan. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of majority-minority districts in redistricting, requiring a compelling governmental interest and proving that race was not the dominant factor in drawing district boundaries. In cases where a majority-minority district is challenged, the challenger must show alternative ways for the legislature to achieve its political objectives. The Court's 2015 decision in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama emphasized a district-by-district analysis to determine if race is a predominant factor triggering strict scrutiny in redistricting. The Court upheld the constitutionality of majority-minority districts in redistricting, requiring a compelling governmental interest and proving that race was not the dominant factor. In Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, the Court emphasized a district-by-district analysis to determine if race is a predominant factor triggering strict scrutiny in redistricting. The Court confirmed that traditional redistricting principles should not be weighed against the use of race to determine predominance. The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County clarified that a minority-majority district must be drawn to maintain a minority's ability to elect their preferred candidate. This ruling is significant as it pertains to the requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Additionally, the Court provided clarification on racial predominance in gerrymandering claims in a recent case. In Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, the Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs challenging a state redistricting plan on racial gerrymandering grounds do not need to prove conflict with traditional criteria. The case was remanded to determine the validity of 11 out of 12 \"majority-minority\" districts created in Virginia in 2011. The redistricting was done after the 2010 census and had to comply with the Voting Rights Act's protections. In Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, the Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs challenging a state redistricting plan on racial gerrymandering grounds do not need to prove conflict with traditional criteria. The case involved 12 registered Virginia voters who filed suit in federal district court, arguing that the districts were racial gerrymanders in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Court clarified that demonstrating a conflict or inconsistency between the redistricting map and traditional criteria is not a mandatory requirement for establishing a claim of racial gerrymandering. The Supreme Court rejected Virginia's argument that racial gerrymandering harm comes from grouping voters of the same race without shared interests. The Court emphasized that the constitutional violation in such cases stems from the racial purpose of state action, not just the outcome. It stated that courts must consider the actual reasons behind crafting a redistricting map, not theoretical justifications that were not used. The Supreme Court is currently considering Cooper v. Harris, a case involving the 2011 North Carolina congressional redistricting map. The map was deemed unconstitutional due to racial gerrymandering, with two new majority-minority districts created. Plaintiffs argue that the VRA's preclearance requirements were used as a pretext to pack African-American voters. The North Carolina congressional redistricting map was found unconstitutional for racial gerrymandering, specifically in districts 1 and 12. The court determined that race was the primary factor in creating these districts, not traditional redistricting criteria. The creation of these districts was not purely political as argued by the state. The court applied strict scrutiny due to the racial predominance in the districts' creation. The court found insufficient evidence to support the creation of CD 1 and invalidated CD 12 due to the lack of compelling interest in using race to draw the district. The VRA may require the creation of \"majority-minority\" districts under certain circumstances. In congressional redistricting, the creation of \"majority-minority\" districts is necessary to prevent voting rights denial based on race. Redistricting maps must adhere to equal protection standards. If race is the main factor in district lines, the state must prove a compelling interest and narrow tailoring. Recent case law requires a district-by-district analysis for racial predominance determination. Challengers of racial gerrymandering don't need to show a statewide impact. The Supreme Court is considering cases on racial and partisan gerrymandering. Challengers of racial gerrymandering don't need to show conflict with traditional criteria. The Court has defined partisan gerrymandering as favoring one party over another. However, a standard for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering remains undecided. In Jubelirer, the Court addressed a claim of partisan gerrymandering based on the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. In Vieth, the Court debated the justiciability of political gerrymandering claims, with Justice Kennedy ultimately holding the deciding vote. In Vieth, Justice Kennedy suggested that future cases of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering may be better addressed through the First Amendment, as it involves protecting citizens from being penalized for their political participation, voting history, party affiliation, or political views. In Vieth, Justice Kennedy proposed addressing unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering through the First Amendment, focusing on protecting citizens from penalties based on their political participation, voting history, party affiliation, or political views. He emphasized that analyzing redistricting plans under the First Amendment may provide a more effective basis for intervention by considering whether the plan burdens the representational rights of voters due to ideology, beliefs, or political association. In its 2006 decision, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (\"LULAC\"), the Supreme Court was divided on the question of whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable. The Court disagreed with Texas voters who challenged a redistricting plan as motivated by partisan objectives, ruling that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are justiciable but did not agree on a standard for adjudicating such claims. In the aftermath of LULAC, the Supreme Court left open the possibility of adjudicating unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering claims in the future. Recently, in the Whitford v. Gill case, the Court had the opportunity to establish a standard for such claims. In Whitford v. Gill, a Wisconsin state legislative redistricting map was deemed unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. The Republican Party won a disproportionate number of seats despite receiving less than half of the statewide vote share in the 2012 and 2014 elections. Democratic supporters challenged the redistricting plan. The Wisconsin state legislative redistricting plan was challenged for unequal treatment of voters based on political beliefs, violating the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee and burdening First Amendment rights. The district court ruled that drawing a redistricting map to impede a citizen's vote based on political affiliation is unconstitutional under the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause. The Equal Protection Clause protects a citizen's vote from discrimination based on political preferences. The Supreme Court considered the associational aspect of partisan gerrymandering claims, emphasizing the rights of individuals to associate for political beliefs and the right of voters to cast their votes effectively. Freedom of association is protected by the First Amendment. The court found that the redistricting plan aimed to secure the Republican Party's control of the state legislature. Despite having less partisan impact alternatives, the drafters chose a plan that increased the number of districts favoring one political party. The plan, while complying with redistricting principles, was deemed to be driven by partisan considerations. The court found that the redistricting plan aimed to entrench one party's control of the legislature for a 10-year period by allocating votes in a way that ensured one party would maintain over 50% of seats. The court introduced a new measure called the \"efficiency gap\" to calculate district asymmetry. The court introduced the \"efficiency gap\" (EG) as a measure of redistricting methods that diminish the electoral power of voters of one party through \"cracking\" and \"packing.\" Packing concentrates one party's voters in a few districts to win by large margins, while cracking divides voters across many districts to prevent a majority. The EG calculates the degree of cracking and packing in a district plan without requiring proportional seat allocation based on votes. The court introduced the \"efficiency gap\" (EG) as a measure of redistricting methods that diminish the electoral power of voters of one party through \"cracking\" and \"packing.\" The court relied on election results, academic analyses, and the EG measure to demonstrate that the state legislative redistricting plan created a burden on representational rights. The court concluded that neither the Constitution nor previous Supreme Court rulings precluded considering the EG to ascertain partisan gerrymandering. The court determined that the partisan effect of a redistricting plan must be justifiable, considering whether it can be explained by legitimate state prerogatives and neutral factors. The political geography of Wisconsin was deemed insufficient to explain the significant partisan effect of the plan, as shown by the results of the 2012 and 2014 elections. The court emphasized that the drafters had failed to justify the discriminatory effect of the plan. The court found that the Wisconsin state legislative plan constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, as the drafters had multiple alternative plans with less partisan advantage but chose not to use them. The court ordered the state to enact a new plan by November 1, 2017, for the November 2018 election, after enjoining the use of the current plan in future elections. The Supreme Court is still considering an appeal on the issue of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court is considering an appeal regarding congressional redistricting standards. Some states use independent commissions for redistricting to address concerns about partisan gerrymandering. Arizona and California have established such commissions through ballot initiatives, removing control from legislative bodies. The 2015 decision in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission upheld the constitutionality of independent commissions for redistricting. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an independent commission for drawing congressional district boundaries, established by a ballot initiative. The Court ruled that the Elections Clause permits a commission to draw districts instead of a state legislature, emphasizing that political power comes from the people. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause allows for the creation of an independent commission to draw congressional districts, rather than solely relying on the state legislature. The Court emphasized that the Clause was intended to prevent political manipulation of electoral rules by state politicians, and does not restrict how states enact such legislation. The term \"legislature\" in the Constitution varies in meaning depending on the context, as seen in previous cases reviewed by the Court. In a series of cases, the Supreme Court interpreted the term \"legislature\" in the Constitution to include not just the representative body, but also the veto power held by the people through referendums and governors. The Court also ruled that the term has a different meaning when ratifying constitutional amendments, excluding referendums and governor's vetoes. The Court found no constitutional barrier to states empowering their people with legislative functions through initiatives, stating that legislating through initiatives is in \"full harmony\" with the Constitution's conception that the people are the source of legislative power. The Court found that legislating through initiatives is in line with the Constitution's view that the people are the source of governmental power. It also held that Arizona's congressional redistricting process complies with federal redistricting laws. Congress intended for states to have the authority to use their own laws and regulations, including initiatives, in creating congressional districts. Congress amended the congressional apportionment statute in 1911, replacing \"legislature\" with \"the manner provided by the laws\" to accommodate states using initiative and referendum for lawmaking. The Court concluded that Congress intended redistricting by initiative when enacting Section 2a(c) in 1941. Arizona State Legislature clarifies that states can enact election laws affecting congressional elections through the initiative process, similar to California's independent commission for drawing congressional district boundaries. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that state constitutional provisions regulating congressional redistricting, like Arizona's independent commission, are likely to withstand challenge. The Court's case law has significantly influenced how congressional districts are drawn and the success of challenges to redistricting plans. The Supreme Court has ruled that congressional districts must have roughly equal populations, but deviations are allowed for legitimate state objectives. The Equal Protection Clause requires strict scrutiny if race is the main factor in district lines. States must show a compelling interest and narrow tailoring for majority-minority districts. The Supreme Court is currently considering cases on racial considerations in drawing district lines and partisan gerrymandering. A 2015 ruling allows states to create nonpartisan independent commissions for redistricting."
