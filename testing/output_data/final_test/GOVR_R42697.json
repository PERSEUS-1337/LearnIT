    "content": "During its October 2012 term, the Supreme Court decided four search and seizure cases. Florida v. Jardines questioned whether a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. Florida v. Harris examined if a trained drug-detection dog's alert establishes probable cause for a vehicle search. Bailey v. United States focused on the detention of an individual leaving premises to be searched under warrant. Missouri v. McNeely addressed the exigency of natural alcohol metabolization for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving cases. The Supreme Court questioned whether a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected grow house constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. In a case involving a suspected marijuana grower, the Court ruled that a search occurs when police use a drug-sniffing dog on the front porch of a private house. This decision marked a departure from past cases that relied on the \"expectation of privacy rationale.\" Authorities conducted a search at Jardines's house after a drug-sniffing dog alerted them to the presence of marijuana. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the dog's use constituted a warrantless search, leading to the seizure of marijuana plants in the house. The Supreme Court endorsed the trial court's decision that without the dog-sniffing evidence, there was insufficient probable cause for a search warrant. Drug-sniffing dogs were first introduced in the Court's jurisprudence in Place, where a trained dog alerted to drugs in luggage after a 90-minute delay, deemed excessive under Terry guidelines. The Supreme Court ruled that exposing luggage to a trained canine in a public place did not constitute a Fourth Amendment search. In Edmond, the Court mentioned the use of drug-sniffing dogs in public areas as not a typical search. The Court also found that a suspicionless drug checkpoint program, involving drug-sniffing dogs checking cars, did not qualify for the \"special needs\" exception to excuse seizures without probable cause or a warrant. The Supreme Court ruled that a vehicle stop at a highway checkpoint constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The use of narcotics-detection dogs during the stop does not turn the seizure into a search. In Caballes, the Court addressed whether reasonable suspicion is needed to use a drug-detecting dog during a traffic stop, concluding that it is not required. The Florida Supreme Court held that using a drug-sniffing dog on Jardines's front porch constituted a search requiring probable cause. This differed from previous Supreme Court cases involving minimally intrusive sniff tests on objects with no special protection. The Court's ruling suggested that a dog sniff during a lawful traffic stop, revealing only the location of illegal substances, does not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Jardines sniff test was a public spectacle conducted at a private home, with multiple police vehicles and officers present, causing public opprobrium and embarrassment. The court emphasized that the test was not conducted in a discriminatory or arbitrary manner. The Supreme Court raised concerns about the potential for dog sniff searches to be used in a discriminatory or arbitrary manner due to the lack of uniform training and certification for drug-detection canines. They concluded that such searches should only be conducted in the absence of exigent circumstances or non-law enforcement special needs. The dissenters in the case of Jardines argued that dog sniff searches must be based on probable cause, citing previous Supreme Court precedents. They disagreed with the majority opinion and highlighted the importance of privacy expectations and legitimate privacy interests. The Florida Supreme Court justices did not have the benefit of the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Jones. The United States Supreme Court's Jones decision clarified that a Fourth Amendment search occurs with any physical intrusion on constitutionally protected property. The \"expectation of privacy\" concept from Katz supplements, not conditions, the traditional protection of the Amendment. In the case of Jardines, the use of a drug-detecting dog at the front door and porch of a home was deemed a clear example of the Jones principle. In the Jardines case, Justice Scalia explained that a Fourth Amendment search occurs when there is physical intrusion on constitutionally protected areas like the curtilage. While a householder may grant some level of intrusion at the front door, it does not extend to conducting a search, including the use of a drug-detecting dog. The Court clarified that previous dog sniff cases did not change this interpretation. In the Jardines case, Justice Scalia affirmed that using trained police dogs to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor also supported this decision based on the expectation of privacy grounds, citing the Court's previous ruling in the Kyllo case. In the Jardines case, Justice Scalia affirmed that using trained police dogs to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The dissenters, including Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts, disagreed, arguing that the officer's presence at the front door with his dog did not constitute a search. The Florida Supreme Court's decision conflicted with established Fourth Amendment precedent. The Florida Supreme Court's decision in the Jardines case conflicted with established Fourth Amendment precedent by ruling that a trained narcotics-detection dog's alert is not enough to establish probable cause to search a vehicle. This decision was influenced by a previous case, Harris, where a trained dog's alert did not lead to the discovery of drugs in a vehicle search. The Florida Supreme Court's decision in the Jardines case conflicted with established Fourth Amendment precedent by ruling that a trained narcotics-detection dog's alert is not enough to establish probable cause to search a vehicle. The Harris case involved a trained dog alerting to drugs but none were found, leading to a reversal of the trial court's decision to deny suppression of evidence. Probable cause is necessary for a search warrant or warrantless search of a vehicle. Probable cause is essential for searching a vehicle without a warrant. The reliability of information and credibility of the source are crucial factors in determining probable cause. Previous court cases have highlighted the importance of evidence supporting an informant's tip to establish probable cause. The Court in Illinois v. Gates established a \"totality of the circumstances\" standard for probable cause, allowing for a common sense assessment of facts. Federal courts have generally accepted a reliable dog's alert as sufficient for probable cause. However, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in Harris that a dog's alert to a truck door did not establish probable cause without considering all circumstances. The court in Illinois v. Gates set a standard for probable cause based on the \"totality of the circumstances.\" While federal courts typically consider a reliable dog's alert as sufficient for probable cause, the Florida Supreme Court's ruling in Harris emphasized the need to consider all factors before establishing probable cause based on a dog's alert to a truck door. The court required the state to provide evidence of the dog's reliability through training and certification records, field performance records, and the handler's experience. The Florida Supreme Court emphasized the need for evidence of a dog's reliability in detecting illegal substances in a vehicle, including certification, training records, and the handler's experience. The burden is on the State to establish probable cause for a search, and shifting this burden to the defendant is unwarranted. The dissent argued that certainty was not required by the Fourth Amendment, only probability. The United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Florida Supreme Court's decision, stating that the Fourth Amendment only required probability, not certainty, in drug-detection dog cases. The Court emphasized the need for a common sense, totality-of-the-circumstances standard to determine if a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime. Justice Kagan noted that a sniff is considered reliable when it meets this test. Justice Kagan, for the Court, emphasized the defendant's right to challenge a dog's reliability but noted the prosecution's evidence of the dog's proficiency in detecting drugs. Harris did not contest this evidence but focused on the fact that the dog signaled drugs where none were found. However, the Court viewed this as confirming the dog's reliability, as Harris admitted to handling methamphetamine and the smell of drugs was present. This gave the officer probable cause to search. The Fourth Amendment allows searches and seizures with a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate based on probable cause. However, authorities can detain individuals without a warrant when executing a search warrant, as established in Michigan v. Summer. This limited detention authority is implicit in a search warrant for contraband. The Supreme Court clarified in Bailey that under the Summers rule, occupants must be taken into custody in the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched. In a specific case, officers detained two men matching the description of the apartment residents after they left the premises and drove away. After detaining two men matching the description of apartment residents, detectives seized Bailey's wallet and keys, drove his car back to the apartment, and found drugs and a handgun. Bailey was arrested, charged with possession of cocaine and a firearm, convicted, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of relief for ineffective assistance of counsel in a habeas corpus petition. They also affirmed the conviction. The court discussed the application of the Fourth Amendment in detaining individuals during a search, stating that police must detain individuals leaving the premises subject to search. However, the Supreme Court disagreed with this interpretation in the case of Summers. The Supreme Court disagreed with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' interpretation in the case of Summers. They held that a warrant to search for contraband includes the authority to detain occupants to prevent flight, evidence destruction, and harm to officers. The Summers rule allows for the detention of occupants during a search to prevent evidence destruction and harm to officers. The use of handcuffs may be necessary, especially when firearms are involved. Different federal courts have varying opinions on extending the Summers rule. The Second Circuit and other circuits have differing opinions on extending the Summers rule for off-site detention during search warrants. The Second Circuit's Bailey decision was criticized for misunderstanding the factors of the Summers rule and the limits of the Fourth Amendment on individual liberty. Justice Kennedy highlighted that Bailey's detention may have been justified under other rules besides the Summers rule. The Summers rule, based on the risk of harm to officers during search warrant execution, cautions against extending detainment powers away from the search premises. Detention within one's residence is a narrow exception to Fourth Amendment limits, with off-site detention causing more public stigma and inconvenience. Justice Kennedy noted that the Summers rule is specific to maintaining search integrity, not just preventing flight risks. The Supreme Court discussed the Summers rule, which limits detainment powers away from search premises to prevent harm to officers. Justice Kennedy highlighted the importance of maintaining search integrity and the narrow exception for detainment within one's residence. Justice Scalia emphasized that the Summers rule inquiry should focus on whether detention occurred in the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched. Justice Breyer and two other dissenters found the police conduct in Bailey reasonable based on the circumstances of the case. The Second Circuit upheld a valid search warrant for premises where detained persons were seen leaving, and the detention was prompt. The issue at hand is whether the natural metabolization of alcohol justifies warrantless blood testing in drunk-driving cases. The Fourth Amendment typically requires a warrant for searches, but exceptions exist, such as in the case of Schmerber v. California involving a warrantless blood test for a drunk driving suspect. State courts have debated whether the rate of alcohol metabolization alone justifies an exception. The police stopped Tyler McNeely for speeding and erratic driving, suspecting he was intoxicated. Despite his refusal, a blood test revealed his high blood alcohol level. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that a warrant was needed for the test, protecting McNeely's Fourth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that a warrant is generally required for a blood test, especially when it involves bodily intrusion, but exceptions can be made for emergency circumstances. The Supreme Court ruled that a warrant is generally required for a blood test, but exceptions can be made for emergency circumstances, such as the \"destruction of evidence\" exception. This exception is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering all relevant facts. In the case of Schmerber, the evidence could have been lost due to the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood and the need for immediate medical attention, which prevented the time to obtain a warrant. In the case of Schmerber, the Supreme Court held that the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not always justify conducting a blood test without a warrant. Justices Sotomayor, Scalia, Ginsburg, and Kagan disagreed with the dissenters, but Justice Kennedy rejected a per se exception."
