    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act\" and includes a provision for an Energy Efficiency Retrofit Pilot Program. The \"Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act\" defines an applicant as a nonprofit organization applying for a grant for energy-efficiency improvements, which are measures reducing energy demand from outside the building. This includes repairs, replacements, or installations like roofs and electrical wiring. The \"Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act\" defines an applicant as a nonprofit organization applying for a grant for energy-efficiency improvements, which includes repairs, replacements, or installations like roofs, electrical wiring, windows, doors, and heating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems. It also covers renewable energy generation or heating systems such as solar, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, or biomass systems. The \"Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act\" covers grants for energy-efficient improvements in nonprofit buildings, including renovations to make them more energy efficient. Nonprofit buildings are defined as those owned and operated by nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals, schools, youth centers, social-welfare facilities, houses of worship, and other nonresidential buildings. The Secretary of Energy will establish a pilot program to award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements. Grants may be awarded if applicants meet specified criteria and submit required information. The Secretary will award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements based on performance-based criteria prioritizing cost-effectiveness and evaluation plans. Grants will not exceed 50% of the energy-efficiency improvement or $200,000, with a minimum non-Federal cost-sharing requirement of 50%. In-kind contributions can be used as the non-Federal share for the program. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2014 to 2017 for carrying out this section. The Secretary of Energy will use funds from the Building Technologies Program to implement the pilot program established under section 2."
