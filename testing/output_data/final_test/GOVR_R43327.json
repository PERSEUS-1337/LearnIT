    "content": "The federal government supports airport infrastructure development through the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), local passenger facility charges (PFC), and preferential tax treatment for investors. Airports can also use state and local funds, operating revenues, and bonds for improvements. During World War II, a federal role in airport infrastructure emerged, with the Federal Airport Act of 1946 providing support for airport construction. Post-war, funding was used for converting military airports to civilian use and upgrading runways for commercial jets. In 1970, Congress passed laws to address airport congestion, leading to the establishment of the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and other programs. The Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 created the current Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and reactivated the trust fund. The Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 allowed the imposition of passenger facility charges to address funding concerns for airport development. Airports use various funding sources like AIP grants, PFCs, tax-exempt bonds, and airport revenues for financing projects. Small airports rely more on AIP grants, while larger airports use bonds and PFCs. Different funding sources come with legislative, regulatory, and contractual constraints. The availability of one funding source can impact others. In a 2015 study, GAO found that airport-generated income, AIP, and PFCs financed a significant portion of capital spending. AIP provides federal grants to airports for development and planning, with funding coming from various sources like airport sponsors, airlines, and state grants. AIP funds are limited to construction related to aircraft operations, reflecting congressional priorities for airport safety, security, capacity, and environmental mitigation. Commercial revenue-producing facilities and operating costs are generally not eligible for AIP funding. The AIP program provides federal grants to small state and community airports for capital projects without the burden of debt financing. AIP funds are limited to specific construction projects related to aircraft operations, and airports must adhere to program regulations and grant assurances. Airports must be listed in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) to receive AIP funds, with program structure set in FAA authorization acts. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) has undergone modifications over the years, but its basic structure remains unchanged. The most recent FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 authorized AIP funding through FY2023, ensuring a consistent funding source for federal airport and airway programs. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund, funded by aviation-related taxes, supports FAA activities such as facilities and equipment, research, engineering, development, and operations. The 2018 FAA reauthorization act established various revenue sources, including taxes on tickets, flight segments, cargo waybills, aviation fuel, international arrivals and departures, and \"frequent flyer\" awards. The trust fund's revenues have typically exceeded expenditures, leading to growth in unexpended balances. These balances are not a surplus as they may be committed to specific airport projects by the FAA. Most air carriers have changed pricing structures, adding ancillary fees like baggage fees not subject to the ticket tax. In 2017, $4.57 billion in baggage fees were collected, potentially costing the trust fund $343 million in revenue. Grant funding from the aviation trust fund has fluctuated since FY2000, with gaps between authorized spending levels and actual expenditures despite deficit reduction efforts. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR21) provided major increases in Airport Improvement Program (AIP) authorization, with funding near authorized levels from FY2001-FY2006. AIP grants peaked at $3.47 billion in FY2008, and annual obligation limitation was set at $3.515 billion from FY2008-FY2011. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act authorized AIP funding at $3.35 billion annually through FY2015, further extended by the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR21) increased Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding levels from FY2001-FY2006. A six-month extension (P.L. 115-63) was passed by the 115th Congress for aviation funding through March 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), extended funding through FY2018, including a $1.0 billion appropriation for AIP discretionary grants. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) funded AIP with additional supplemental funds for nonprimary, nonhub, and small hub airports. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) funded the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) at $3.35 billion annually from FY2019 to FY2023. Additional supplemental funding from the general fund was authorized for the AIP discretionary grants program, with at least 50% allocated to nonhub and small hub airports. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6), provided a $500 million supplemental appropriation for AIP grants, to remain available through September 30, 2021. The distribution system for AIP grants involves formula grants and discretionary funds. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 funded the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) at $3.35 billion annually from FY2019 to FY2023. A $500 million supplemental appropriation for AIP grants was provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. The distribution system for AIP grants includes formula grants and discretionary funds, with entitlements apportioned by formula to specific airports and discretionary funds available for projects in airport master plans. Formula grants and discretionary funds are not mutually exclusive, as airports receiving formula funds may also apply for discretionary funds. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is funded at $3.35 billion annually from FY2019 to FY2023, with a $500 million supplemental appropriation. AIP funds are divided into four categories: primary airports, cargo service airports, general aviation airports, and Alaska supplemental funds. Each category distributes funds by a different formula based on specific criteria. Most airports have up to three years to use their apportionments, with nonhub commercial service airports having up to four years. The formula distributions are contingent on an annual AIP obligation limitation of $3.2 billion or more. If this threshold is not met, formulas revert to prior authorized funding formulas. Primary airports receive apportionments based on the number of boardings during the prior calendar year. Primary airports receive apportionments based on the number of boardings during the prior calendar year. The amount apportioned for each fiscal year is determined by specific formulas based on passenger boardings, with a minimum allocation of $1 million and a maximum of $26 million. Cargo service airports receive 3.5% of AIP funds and general aviation airports receive 20% of the funds. General aviation, reliever, and nonprimary commercial service airports receive 20% of AIP funds. They get the lesser of $150,000 or one-fifth of the estimated five-year costs for airport development listed in the NPIAS. Remaining funds are distributed based on a state-based formula. FAA decides on project use in consultation with states. Alaska airports receive supplemental funds to ensure double the funding from 1980. Some states see this as an opportunity to address general aviation needs statewide. Under the Airport Development Aid Program in 1980, large and medium hub airports with a passenger facility charge of $3 or less have their AIP formula entitlements reduced by 50% of projected PFC revenue until they give back 50% of their AIP formula grants. For PFC above $3, the percentage forgone is 75%. A special small airport fund receives 87.5% of foregone funds, while the discretionary fund gets 12.5%. Discretionary grants are approved by FAA based on project priority and selection criteria, with FY2018 AIP discretionary funding at about 9.4% of total AIP funding. The discretionary fund for airport grants is not solely at FAA's discretion. Allocations are subject to set-asides for noise compatibility planning, military airport conversion, and grants for reliever airports in metropolitan areas with flight delays. The Secretary of Transportation directs that 75% of discretionary airport grants be used for capacity, safety, and security enhancements at primary and reliever airports, as well as noise compatibility planning. The FAA must allocate $5 million for testing aviation security systems from the remaining 25%. States receive block grants for projects at non-primary airports, combining formula funds and discretionary funds. The state block grant program allows states to select and fund AIP projects at small airports, following federal priorities. Participating states like Georgia, Illinois, and Texas take on project administration and oversight roles. Federal funding shares vary based on airport type, with large and medium hubs receiving 75% (80% for noise projects) and other airports receiving 90%. States in the block grant program can receive up to 90% federal funding for airport projects. The cost-share structure for airport projects varies based on airport type, with smaller airports receiving a higher federal share. Smaller airports are more dependent on AIP funding to meet their capital needs compared to larger airports. Noncommercial airports, like general aviation and reliever airports, heavily rely on AIP grants for capital needs, receiving over 25% of grants in FY2018. Air carriers argue against this allocation, stating that their passengers contribute the majority of trust fund revenue. However, general aviation advocates support AIP grants for noncommercial airports. AIP funds primarily support airside development projects such as runways, taxiways, and safety measures, with some allocated for state block grants and noise abatement. Road projects funded by AIP are limited to airport property access. AIP funds for road projects are restricted to airport property access. The FAA can issue a letter of intent for eligible projects, indicating federal approval and intent to fund in the future. This assurance can lead to favorable bond interest rates for airports funding major development projects with tax-exempt revenue bonds. The FAA issues letters of intent (LOIs) for airport development projects, ensuring that AIP-allowable costs will be reimbursed. LOIs use both entitlement and discretionary funds, with discretionary funds limited to 50% of available funds. Projects must enhance airfield capacity and be at primary or reliever airports. Grant applications require assurances for future airport operations. Assurances for airport use include non-discrimination, comparable charges, financial reporting to FAA, and proper use of revenue. Obligations from assurances last up to 20 years or indefinitely for land purchases with AIP funds. Airports can request release from AIP obligations. Airports can request release from their AIP contractual obligations by reimbursing the federal government or reinvesting in an approved AIP project. Concerns about AIP funding strings led to the creation of the Passenger Facility Charge as an additional funding source. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) was established in 1990 to allow public agencies controlling airports to impose a fee on passengers. Initially capped at $3 per airport and $12 per round trip, the PFC funds must be used for eligible airport projects and can also service debt. In 2000, the PFC ceiling was raised to $4.50 with an $18 limit per round trip. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) allows airports to charge passengers for improvements. Airports must show projects will enhance safety, competition, or reduce congestion/noise. Large/medium hub airports lose 75% of AIP funds if PFC exceeds $3. Approval requires a competition plan with gate availability, leasing, and capacity controls. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 made minor changes to the PFC program, allowing nonhub small airports to impose PFCs permanently. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 made the trial program for nonhub small airports to impose PFCs permanent. It also required a study on alternative ways to collect PFCs. The act maintained the $4.50 PFC cap with a maximum charge of $18 per round-trip flight. Additionally, a qualified organization was tasked with assessing airport infrastructure needs and making recommendations for upgrades. PFC revenues are mainly used for landside projects like terminals and transit systems. Annual PFC collections have significantly increased from $85.4 million in 1992 to over $3.4 billion in 2018. The PFC statutory language allows for a broader interpretation of \"capacity enhancing\" projects compared to AIP funds. Air carriers are less involved in PFC project planning and decision-making, as larger airports, which collect most of the revenue, tend to have substantial landside infrastructure. Primary airports, which collect most PFC revenue, have significant landside infrastructure. Smaller airports, reliant on AIP funding, have limited landside facilities. Airport bonds are a major funding source for capital projects, with $17.4 billion raised in 2018. Most bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds, allowing airports to raise funds more affordably. Airport bonds, specifically taxable Private Activity Bonds (PABs), may be used to finance facilities essential for aircraft operations. Tax-exempt PABs are available for airports owned by governmental entities to compensate for higher interest rates on taxable bonds. The majority of airport bonds are considered tax-exempt by the IRS due to this exception. Some proposals aim to extend tax-preferred treatment to privately owned airports for their bonds, similar to public authorities. This could enable public-private partnerships in airport financing, akin to the SAFETEA-LU provisions for highways. The safe operation of airports is a top priority, with disagreements on federal involvement in airport development and finance. Airline and airport operators support fully authorized funding for airport improvement programs, while some argue that too much has been spent, especially at smaller airports. The assessment of airport capital needs is crucial for determining federal support to maintain a safe and efficient national airport system. FAA and ACI-NA have projected long-term financial needs, with estimates ranging from $35.1 billion to $128.1 billion for FY2019-FY2023. Disagreements exist on what types of airport projects should be included in these estimates. The NPIAS report, based on airport master plans and state system plans, includes only designated NPIAS airports in FAA studies. ACI-NA argues that NPIAS underestimates AIP eligible needs as not all needs are in current airport plans. Their study includes projects funded by PFCs, bonds, or state/local funding. The ACI-NA study includes various airport projects funded by different sources such as PFCs, bonds, or state/local funding, including air traffic control facilities, security projects, and AIP-ineligible projects like parking facilities and terminals. The estimate is higher than the FAA's due to a broader scope and inflation adjustments, highlighting the importance of funding levels for the AIP program. The ACI-NA airport needs projection includes details not eligible for AIP grants, making accuracy less critical for AIP funding levels. The broader estimate is significant for policy choices on bond issuance and PFCs. FAA aims to increase capacity at top 35 U.S. airports by 30% in 10 years through the Operational Evolution Plan to meet growing demand for air travel and cargo. The FACT2 study expanded on the previous FACT1 analysis, identifying 21 non-OEP airports with potential capacity constraints. It projected capacity needs for airports in 2015 and 2025, highlighting four airports and the New York metropolitan area needing additional capacity in 2007. Additionally, 14 hub airports were identified as likely to face capacity constraints by 2025. FACT2 also noted that many non-OEP airports had higher capacities than initially thought, reducing the need for additional capacity. The FACT3 study, released in January 2015, forecasted a decrease in operations and enplanements at core airports in 2025 compared to previous projections. It highlighted major hub airports where delays would remain concentrated and suggested implications for AIP reauthorization. Large runway projects under the OEP may require AIP funding and have long lead times. Some projects needed by 2025 may require AIP funding in earlier years, especially for large and medium airports that levy PFCs. These airports must forgo a portion of their AIP formula entitlement funds, leading to a reliance on AIP discretionary funds for runway projects. The discretionary funds are the remaining annual funding after entitlement formula requirements are met. If the AIP budget is constrained in the future, large airports may face limitations in using AIP funds for major capacity expansion projects. The AIP program's structure has been modified over the years based on perceived needs and politics. A major overhaul is unlikely, but adjustments in fund distribution may be possible. One potential adjustment could involve shifting funds to enhance capacity at large and medium hub airports. Congress could achieve this by eliminating the requirement for large and medium hub airports to forgo a portion of their entitlements. This change would give larger airports a greater share of funding but reduce grants to small airports. Alternatively, changes in discretionary fund set-asides could also be considered. Changes in FAA authorization acts have increased entitlements and expanded landside projects eligible for AIP grants, benefiting smaller airports. However, this has limited discretionary grants at major airports. Giving airports more flexibility in using their entitlements could help smaller airports but may conflict with reducing congestion at major airports. The current apportionment system relies on a $3.2 billion fund. The current apportionment system at major commercial airports relies on a $3.2 billion funding trigger mechanism. If breached, entitlements for all airports would be drastically reduced. To reduce trust fund revenue needed for AIP, large and medium hub airports could opt out of AIP and rely on PFCs. This would require raising or eliminating the federal cap on PFCs. \"Defederalized\" airports could then be released from some AIP grant assurances, potentially reducing AIP spending. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program allows FAA to exempt up to 10 airports from federal restrictions on airport revenue use. Airport privatization involves transferring ownership from public to private entities, with some countries like Great Britain already privatizing government-owned airports. In the United States, major airports are still government-owned, but some on-airport facilities or management functions can be privately owned. The Airport Investment Partnership Program (AIPP) allows privatized airports to participate in the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) with a lower federal share. The AIPP requires approval from air carriers for the sale or lease of airport assets. Interest in the program has been limited, with only two airports completing the privatization process under the AIPP. Two airports completed privatization under AIPP, with Stewart International Airport reverting to public ownership. Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport is now the only commercial service airport under private management. Three airports are under FAA consideration for privatization: Hendry County Airglades, Westchester, and St. Louis Lambert International. AIP cost savings may not benefit other eligible airports as Congress could use savings for deficit reduction. Debate over FAA reauthorization includes proposals to alter AIP grant assurances, such as ensuring prevailing wages on airport construction projects and using airport revenue for operations. Critics argue that grant assurances raise project costs and complicate airport closure. Funding issues include whether to change the discretionary fund set-aside for noise mitigation. The noise set-aside for noise mitigation in FAA reauthorization acts is now 35% of discretionary funding. There is a debate on using AIP funds for noise mitigation projects outside the DNL 65 dB noise impact area, which could divert resources from capacity and safety projects. The central issue with PFCs is whether to raise the $4.50 per enplaned passenger ceiling or eliminate it altogether, with airports advocating for an increase and air carriers opposing it. The study explored raising the PFC cap to $6.47, $8.00, or $8.50, which would boost airport funding but potentially slow passenger growth. Supporters argue PFC is more reliable than AIP funding and promotes competition by aiding airport infrastructure. They also advocate for adjusting the PFC value due to inflation. Airport operators seek more flexibility in using PFC funds for off-airport projects. Airport operators seek streamlined FAA approval for transportation access projects and complain about airports using PFC funds for low-priority proposals. Major carriers are dissatisfied with limited influence over project decisions and the tax implications of private activity bonds. ACI-NA proposes expanding the definition of governmental airport bonds to include all airport bonds or those for public-use projects meeting AIP or PFC requirements. Opponents express concerns that changes to the AMT for income on airport bonds in an FAA reauthorization bill could reduce U.S. Treasury revenues. However, such changes would fall under the jurisdiction of the congressional tax-writing committees, not the committees overseeing most reauthorization provisions. Before World War II, airports were considered a local responsibility, with federal funding primarily through work relief agencies like the Works Progress Administration. During World War II, federal support for airport construction began, and after the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 created the Federal Aid to Airports Program. This program used funds from the general fund to convert military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s, funding was allocated to upgrade and extend runways for commercial jets. By the end of the 1960s, airport congestion led to concerns about inadequate capacity, prompting the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970 to establish the Airport Development Aid Program and Planning Grant Program. The Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, funded by levies on aviation users and fuel. The Nixon Administration's FAA budget requests for FY1971 and FY1972 under the new trust fund system led to conflict with Congress over budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues. The 1971 Amendments Act changed the trust fund to a capital-only account until FY1976, prohibiting the use of trust fund revenues for FAA operations. The 1976 Airport and Airway Development Amendments Act made adjustments to the ADAP and reauthorized the Airport and Airway Trust Fund through FY1980. It allowed the use of trust fund resources for air navigation services costs but included \"cap and penalty\" provisions to ensure adequate airport grant funding. The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 created the current AIP and reactivated the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. It altered funding distribution among airport categories, extended aid eligibility to general aviation airports, increased federal share of project costs, and earmarked funding for noise abatement. The act also required the Secretary of Transportation to publish a national plan for airport development in the US. Total ADAP grants were about $4.1 billion from 1971 to 1980. Congress did not pass authorizing legislation for ADAP in FY1981 and FY1982. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) identifies important airports for AIP funding. The Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 increased AIP spending and added cargo service apportionment. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 allowed airports to levy Passenger Facility Charges (PFC) and established the Military Airport Program (MAP). The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Acts of 1994 and 1996 made adjustments to AIP funding, penalties, and provisions, including intermodal planning and airport privatization programs. The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Acts of 1994 and 1996 made adjustments to AIP funding, penalties, and provisions, including intermodal planning and airport privatization programs. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century of 2000 (AIR21; P.L. 106-181) was enacted after two years of legislative effort to pass a multiyear FAA reauthorization bill. Initial debates focused on taking the aviation trust fund off-budget or creating budgetary \"firewalls\" to ensure trust fund revenues were spent on aviation purposes. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR21) increased funding for airport development projects, doubled formula funding for primary airports, raised state apportionment for general aviation airports, and increased the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) maximum to $4.50 per boarding passenger. Vision 100: Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-176; H.Rept. 108-334) signed by President George W. Bush on December 12, 2003, made significant changes to airport funding. It codified AIR21 spending guarantees through FY2007, increased discretionary set-aside for noise compatibility projects, and adjusted funding levels for airports participating in the Military Airport Program. Nonprimary airports were allowed to use entitlements for revenue-generating aeronautical support facilities. The Vision 100 Act of 2003 allowed nonprimary airports to use entitlements for revenue-generating aeronautical support facilities. It also included provisions for AIP grants and a trial program for small airports to impose PFCs. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 funded AIP for four years and allowed small airports reclassified as medium hubs to retain eligibility for federal funding. The 2012 act maintained the $4.50 PFC cap, with a maximum charge of $18 per round-trip flight. It also expanded the airport privatization pilot program and was extended through July 15, 2016. The 2016 FAA extension act funded AIP through FY2017 at $3.35 billion annually and provided temporary relief to small airports with passenger boarding fluctuations. The 2018 FAA reauthorization act funded AIP for five years from FY2019 through FY2023 at $3.35 billion annually. It also authorized additional funding from the general fund to AIP discretionary funds, with at least 50% allocated to nonhub and small hub airports. Small airports can receive 95% federal share of project costs for eligible projects. The 2018 FAA reauthorization act expanded the State Block Grant Program to 20 states and the Airport Investment Partnership Program to include more than 10 airports. It also included a provision prohibiting states from imposing taxes on businesses at airports unless for airport or aeronautical purposes. Commercial Service Airports are publicly owned airports with scheduled passenger service and at least 2,500 passengers annually. Primary Airports are those with higher passenger volumes. Commercial Service Airports are publicly owned airports that board at least 2,500 passengers annually. There are different categories based on passenger volume: Large Hub Airports, Medium Hub Airports, Small Hub Airports, Non-hub Primary Airports, and Non-primary Commercial Service Airports. General Aviation Airports do not receive scheduled commercial or military service but support various types of flying activities. The FAA designates different types of airports, including reliever airports to ease congestion, cargo service airports for cargo transport, and new airports planned for construction between 2019 and 2023."
