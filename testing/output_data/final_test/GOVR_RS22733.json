    "content": "Senate and House rules restrict the agreements conferees can propose, requiring them to resolve differences within \"the scope of the differences\" between House and Senate versions of a bill. Conferees can accept the House position, Senate position, or a compromise. Any position outside this range is considered \"matter not committed to them\" and can be challenged on the House and Senate floor. Despite these restrictions, the House often waives its rules, and the Senate grants conferees flexibility. The Senate grants conferees flexibility in reaching agreements with the House, allowing the inclusion of new matter as long as it is reasonably related to the bill. Senators can choose not to raise a scope point of order against a conference report, and Senate Rule XLIV restricts provisions that constitute \"new directed spending provisions.\" The Senate Rule XLIV applies only to the conference report, not the joint explanatory statement. The conference report contains the formal legislative language that becomes law if both chambers agree and the President signs the measure. Joint explanatory statements are not voted on and cannot be changed through formal amendment processes. Senate Rule XLIV applies to conference reports, specifically regarding provisions for actual spending. It applies to discretionary and mandatory spending, not authorizations of appropriations. Discretionary spending funds routine operations, while mandatory spending funds entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The rule distinguishes between \"scope\" and \"new directed spending\" point of orders. The Senate may pass a bill with an amendment, leading to a conference where funding for additional projects not listed in the original bills may be included. However, these new spending provisions could be subject to a point of order under Rule XLIV. The Senate can remove the new spending provisions but agree to the rest of the compromise in such cases. The rule creates a process to convert the text of a conference compromise into an amendment between the houses, minus any \"new matter\" or \"new directed spending provisions.\" A Senator can make a point of order against provisions in a conference report, and if sustained, the report is ruled in violation of the rule. The Senate has a process to remove any \"new matter\" or \"new directed spending provisions\" from a conference agreement. Once all points of order are addressed, a motion can be made to send a revised proposal to the House. Debate on the revised agreement is limited under the same rules as the original conference report. The Senate has a process to remove \"new matter\" or \"new directed spending provisions\" from a conference agreement. If the Senate agrees to the motion, the altered recommendation would be returned to the House as an amendment between the houses for further action. The House could agree to the modified compromise version or offer further amendments. The House can choose to accept the modified compromise version from the Senate, request a further conference, or take no action. Points of order can be waived with the support of three-fifths of all Senators. Under Senate procedures, a motion to waive points of order can be made against specific provisions or all possible points of order. If successful, no separate motions would be needed. Debate time is limited to one hour and divided between leaders. Waiving points of order means keeping potentially violating matters in the conference report. \"Scope\" and \"new directed spending\" points of order are considered separately. The Senate rules require a three-fifths vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair, limiting debate on an appeal to one hour. This ensures that either method to apply the rules requires a three-fifths vote, not a simple majority. Overturning a ruling on appeal becomes a precedent for future Senate proceedings, different from agreeing to waive a rule. The Senate rules require a three-fifths vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair, limiting debate on an appeal to one hour. Overturning a ruling on appeal sets a precedent for future Senate proceedings, unlike waiving a rule which does not impact future interpretation."
