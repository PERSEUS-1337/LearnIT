    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2170 of the Elections Code is amended to allow for conditional voter registration, where a registrant can submit an affidavit during the 14 days before an election or on election day. This allows eligible voters to register and cast a provisional ballot. Conditional voter registration is effective if the county elections official can verify the registrant's eligibility using databases from the California Department of Motor Vehicles or the federal Social Security Administration. If verification is not possible, the registrant will be issued a unique identification number and must provide proof of residence for the registration to be deemed effective. The county elections official offers conditional voter registration and provisional voting at all permanent offices, ensuring eligibility and verification of information provided on the registration affidavit. The process protects ballot secrecy and allows for the receipt and handling of each conditional voter registration. The county elections official offers conditional voter registration and provisional voting at satellite offices on election day, ensuring eligibility and verification of information provided on the registration affidavit. If deemed effective, the provisional ballot is included in the official canvass. A person completing conditional voter registration must provide proof of residence during the 14 days before an election or on election day, which can include a valid California driver's license, student ID with photo, or tribal ID with photo and signature. To complete conditional voter registration, proof of residence is required, such as a valid California driver's license, student ID with photo, or tribal ID with photo and signature. Additionally, photo identification and a current bill with the registrant's name and address are needed. If the registration is not effective, it will be processed according to specific sections, and if all eligibility requirements are met, the registration will be valid for future elections. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as per the Government Code."
