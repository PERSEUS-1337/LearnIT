    "content": "The federal government spends over $80 billion annually on IT investments, expected to increase to $89 billion in FY2017. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that these projects often face cost overruns and schedule delays, with little mission-related outcomes. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) aims to improve management and oversight in federal IT investments. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) aims to enhance the authority of agency CIOs, improve transparency and risk management of IT investments, establish a process for agency IT portfolio review, refocus the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to optimization, expand the use of \"IT Cadres,\" maximize benefits of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI), and create a government-wide software purchasing program. FITARA also codified elements of existing Federal CIO initiatives. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) aims to enhance agency CIO authority, improve transparency and risk management of IT investments, establish IT portfolio review processes, and optimize the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) by adopting cloud services. FITARA requires agencies to submit annual reports with data center inventories, consolidation strategies, performance metrics, and cost savings related to FITARA implementation. Agencies subject to FITARA include those identified in the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and their subordinate divisions. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) requires agencies identified in the CFO Act of 1990 to follow its guidelines, with the DOD, intelligence community, and some other agencies subject to certain portions. OMB published guidance on June 10, 2015, to implement FITARA requirements, aiming to align IT resources with agency missions and establish government-wide IT management controls. The guidance for implementing FITARA aims to establish universal roles, responsibilities, and authorities for agency CIOs, strengthen accountability for IT costs and security, improve relationships between agency and bureau CIOs, and ensure agency CIO involvement in cybersecurity policy management. It also aligns FITARA requirements with existing laws like the Clinger-Cohen Act and the E-Government Act. FITARA provided a framework to refine existing CIO initiatives like the Data Center Optimization Initiative and the Cloud First Policy. OMB released the Data Center Optimization Initiative in 2016, requiring agencies to consolidate inefficient IT infrastructure, improve security, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure. Agencies are prohibited from establishing new data centers or significantly expanding existing ones starting in February 2017. The Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) requires agencies to consolidate and optimize IT infrastructure, transition to cloud-based services, and automate power efficiency tools. Agencies must evaluate options for consolidation, shared services, and optimized data centers, while classifying data centers as \"tiered\" or \"nontiered.\" Tiered data centers have separate physical spaces for IT infrastructure. Under the new DCOI guidance, agencies must close 25% of tiered data centers and 60% of nontiered data centers by the end of FY2018. Priority should be given to closing data centers that cannot meet energy consumption targets or pose security risks due to age. Compliance with DCOI requires quarterly reporting on data center inventories, closure plans, and facility properties. The GAO made recommendations to OMB and 24 DCOI agencies to improve data center-related cost savings reporting and optimization targets. As of March 2018, 74 out of 81 recommendations were not fully addressed. The May report highlighted agencies' progress in meeting OMB's data center closure targets, planned savings goals, and optimization metrics. Despite the DCOI mandate, GAO found that the 24 agencies had not met the required percentage of data center closures by the end of FY2018. The GAO found that 24 agencies participating in the DCOI had mixed progress towards closing data centers by the end of FY2018. Over half of the agencies reported meeting or planning to meet their goals, resulting in the closure of 7,221 centers. However, some agencies did not have plans to meet all goals, and others were working on revised targets. Agencies reported achieving $1.04 billion in cost savings during FY2016 and FY2017, with an additional $0.58 billion in planned savings for a total of $1.62 billion for FY2016 through FY2018, falling short of OMB's savings goal of $2.7 billion. The GAO found that 12 agencies fell short of OMB's DCOI savings goal of $2.7 billion due to reporting less in planned cost savings. Only one agency had met four targets, while most agencies were not planning to meet OMB's FY2018 optimization targets. New guidance for cloud investment and shared services adoption has been provided by the DCOI. The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, implemented in 2011, requires agencies to consider cloud options before investing in IT infrastructure. In 2016, GAO assessed agencies' incorporation of key elements in cloud service agreements. SLAs define service aspects agreed upon by providers and users. The GAO analyzed cloud service contracts of five agencies with the largest IT budgets, finding that most contracts included key practices. However, some agencies did not fully incorporate these practices, leading to potential issues in measuring service performance and holding providers accountable. The new DCOI requires agencies to use cloud infrastructure when planning new applications or consolidating existing ones, considering cost, security, and application needs. GAO recommended key practices be included in future guidance, with some agencies agreeing to incorporate them into their SLAs. Agencies have increased the pace of cloud adoption by the end of 2017. The Office of the Federal CIO launched the IT Dashboard in 2009 to improve transparency and oversight of agency IT investments. The dashboard displays data from 26 agencies on the cost, schedule, and performance of over 7,000 IT investments, with detailed information on 700 \"major\" investments. Agency CIOs are responsible for updating the data, which is publicly available for review. The Federal CIO has recommended improvements to the IT Dashboard data reliability and consistency, including regular updates. The 25 Point Implementation Plan requires agencies to establish TechStat Accountability Sessions and the OMB created the PortfolioStat process. These processes aim to review agency IT portfolios and enhance risk management of IT investments. OMB launched TechStat Accountability Sessions to identify and improve underperforming IT investments using data from the Federal IT Dashboard. In 2010, OMB-led TechStat sessions resulted in $3 billion in cost savings and project delivery acceleration. Agency CIOs took over TechStat reviews in 2010-2011, identifying an additional $930 million in cost implications. Agency-led TechStats led to $900 million in cost implications. However, GAO reported in 2014 that TechStat sessions had minimal impact on improving risky projects due to a lack of mechanisms for change. The GAO recommended that agencies increase the number of TechStat sessions conducted and track outcomes more thoroughly. The Department of Commerce reviewed 58% of at-risk projects, while the Department of Health and Human Services only reviewed 13%. The Brookings Institution found that some agencies, like the U.S. Department of the Interior, had implemented their version of TechStat called iStat. The U.S. Department of the Interior implemented iStat, a comprehensive approach similar to TechStat, to assess project functionality and performance. iStat consists of the iStat Performance Review Board and iStat Executive Committee, which evaluate investments and recommend corrective actions. Through iStat, the DOI achieved $50 million in cost avoidance by terminating projects and implementing structural reforms. Despite FITARA requirements for TechStat sessions, OMB had not integrated TechStat results into the IT Dashboard as of November 2016. PortfolioStat is a yearly assessment of an agency's IT portfolio, focusing on eliminating duplication, enhancing capital planning processes, and maximizing IT investments. It allows agencies to identify duplication across bureaus and shift to shared IT services. Unlike TechStat, which focuses on project performance, PortfolioStat looks at the agency's IT portfolio as a whole. The PortfolioStat initiative aims to save $3.8 billion by shifting agencies to IT shared services. Congress closely monitors Federal CIO activities, focusing on data center use and cloud adoption to achieve FITARA goals. The 115th Congress introduced bills related to Federal CIO initiatives, including the Modernizing Government Technology Act and the FITARA Enhancement Act. The FITARA Enhancement Act of 2017 (H.R. 3243, S. 1867, P.L. 115-88) aims to establish IT modernization funds at specified agencies to enhance cybersecurity and efficiency. H.R. 2227 and S. 990, introduced in 2017, are related bills referred to committees for further action. The FITARA Enhancement Act of 2017 aims to establish IT modernization funds at specified agencies to enhance cybersecurity and efficiency. Both H.R. 3243 and S. 1867 would eliminate end dates for rules requiring risk assessments for IT investments and extend a data center consolidation to 2020. The House has held hearings related to FITARA. The GAO has conducted investigations into U.S. CIO initiatives, testified at congressional hearings, and held a forum. Data Center Optimization and IT implementation of high-risk recommendations are key focus areas. Further implementation of FITARA related recommendations is needed to better manage acquisitions and operations, as highlighted in various GAO reports. These reports emphasize the importance of sustained management attention to the implementation of FITARA, data center optimization, progress on high-risk areas, opportunities for improving acquisitions and operations, and the need for federal agencies to address aging legacy systems in information technology. On May 23, 2018, the \"FITARA Scorecard 6.0\" was issued at a House hearing, grading agencies' implementation of FITARA and MEGABYTE. This scorecard includes new areas required by the MGT Act and FISMA. The Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) scorecard showed changes in agency grades, with 5 increasing, 8 remaining the same, and 11 decreasing. Most decreases were due to a new grading methodology, including CIO reporting structure and MGT requirements. Without these changes, there would have been three As and five Bs. The Federal Information Technology Reform Act Scorecard 6.0 highlighted areas for improvement including data center consolidation, CIO responsibilities, IT contract approval, software license management, and federal IT system security. Despite $3.9 billion in cost savings from data center consolidation efforts, additional work is needed. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies, with 80 recommendations still pending as of May 2018. Laws like FITARA aim to enhance IT management. The GAO found that agencies have not fully addressed CIO responsibilities outlined in laws like FITARA. Recommendations will be made to improve CIO oversight of IT acquisitions and software license management to avoid unnecessary purchases. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings and made 135 recommendations for improvement. As of May 2018, 78 recommendations remained open, with agencies needing to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and protection of personally identifiable information. GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies to enhance federal system security, with 800 information security-related recommendations not yet implemented as of May 2018. Congressional Oversight during the 114th Congress included seven hearings related to Federal CIO initiatives, with no legislation introduced. The Federal Information Technology Reform Act Scorecard hearings and Congressional Oversight related to FITARA and Federal CIO initiatives were conducted on various dates in 2015 and 2016. The GAO conducted investigations into U.S. CIO initiatives, testified at congressional hearings, and highlighted billions in potential savings from IT reform. The GAO conducted investigations into U.S. CIO initiatives, testified at congressional hearings, and highlighted potential savings from IT reform in various reports from 2012 to 2015."
