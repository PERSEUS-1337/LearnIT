    "content": "The \"Terrorism Elimination Act of 2001\" may be cited as such. It establishes a Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund is created in the Treasury of the United States, funded by appropriations or credits as specified in the section. Amounts designated under section 6097 are transferred to the fund, and procedures are established for other contributions. Expenditures from the Trust Fund are outlined. The Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund is available for counter-terrorism efforts by the United States, including administrative expenses for the Department of the Treasury. Amounts received under section 6097 are processed and transferred to the Fund. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF FREEDOM BONDS. The Secretary is authorized to issue Freedom Bonds in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Proceeds will be used for recovery operations and anti-terrorism efforts. The bonds will have specific terms and conditions set by the Secretary. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF OVERPAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new part for the designation of overpayments and contributions for counter-terrorism efforts. The taxpayer can designate a portion of overpayment and cash contributions to be deposited into the Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund when filing their tax return. This designation must be made at the time of filing and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary. Overpayments designated in this way will be treated as refunded. For tax purposes, any overpayment designated by the taxpayer will be treated as refunded as of the deadline for filing the tax return. A new item is added to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Code. The amendments in Part IX designate overpayments and contributions for counter-terrorism efforts. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a visa application surcharge for counter-terrorism is introduced in Section 5. Section 5 introduces a 15 percent surcharge on visa applications for counter-terrorism purposes. The collected funds will be deposited into the Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund."
