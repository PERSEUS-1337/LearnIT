Responsibility for education in the region was transferred to the Palestinian Ministry of Education after the Oslo Accords. The Palestinian Ministry of Education took over education in the West Bank and Gaza after the Oslo Accords. Palestinian textbooks in these areas previously used Jordanian and Egyptian books, but now have new textbooks with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. The Israeli government no longer has control over the content in these textbooks. Palestinian Authority school children are taught anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content in textbooks, including warnings about Jews being treacherous and inciting civil war against Muslims. The textbooks also accuse Jews of killing and evicting Muslim and Christian inhabitants of Palestine. The Palestinian Authority textbooks teach anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, equating Zionism with Nazism and portraying Jews as enemies who do not want peace. The textbooks also deny the existence of Israel and refer to its creation as the Israeli occupation of 1948. The Palestinian Authority textbooks promote anti-Israel sentiment, advocating for the fight and elimination of Israel through Jihad and Martyrdom for Allah. Children are taught to conquer Jerusalem and liberate \"stolen land\" using modern weapons and resources. Fighting Israel is portrayed as a religious imperative on \"occupied Arab land.\" The Palestinian Authority textbooks promote anti-Israel sentiment, advocating for the fight and elimination of Israel through Jihad and Martyrdom for Allah. Children are taught to conquer Jerusalem and liberate \"stolen land\" using modern weapons and resources. Fighting Israel is portrayed as a religious imperative on \"occupied Arab land,\" with teachings emphasizing Jihad as a duty for every Muslim until the land is liberated. The Palestinian Authority promotes anti-Israel sentiment in textbooks, advocating for Jihad to liberate Jerusalem and eliminate Israel. This sentiment is also promoted on Palestinian television, with hateful portrayals of Jews and Israel. Publicly broadcast radio and television statements further perpetuate anti-Israel rhetoric. The Palestinian Authority-controlled media in the West Bank and Gaza broadcast anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, including portraying Zionism as a cancer and promoting Jihad. They refuse to acknowledge the state of Israel and incite violence against it. The United States has not provided direct aid to the Palestinian Authority since 1995, but in fiscal year 2000, there were still concerns about the content being broadcasted. In fiscal year 2000, the United States allocated $485 million in development assistance to NGOs in the West Bank and Gaza for education programs. Between 1995 and 1998, international aid from 21 countries and 4 organizations provided $226.9 million for educational projects in the Palestinian Territories. The European Community committed over $600 million from 1994 to 1999 for assistance, including education programs. No assistance will be given to the Palestinian Authority until the President confirms to Congress that anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content has been removed from textbooks and media in the West Bank and Gaza. Congress suggests that allies of the US should also impose similar restrictions on aid."
