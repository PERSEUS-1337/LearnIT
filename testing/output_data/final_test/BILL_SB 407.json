    "title": "SB 407",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14134.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to define \"comprehensive perinatal provider\" and \"perinatal\" services for Medi-Cal program participants. Comprehensive perinatal services include a range of services provided by qualified healthcare providers. The comprehensive perinatal provider is responsible for scheduling visits, tracking patients, and ensuring the provision of various services such as psychosocial assessments, nutrition assessments, and health education. They can employ or contract with medical practitioners to deliver these services. The California Medical Assistance Program and the Maternal and Child Health Branch, in consultation with the California Conference of Local Health Officers, establish standards for healthcare providers and services. This includes physicians, nurse midwives, licensed midwives, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, health educators, and dietitians. The department will define qualifications for practitioners not currently covered by regulations. Staffing patterns should reflect the linguistic and cultural needs of the population served. The department assists local health departments in establishing a community perinatal program, certifying and monitoring providers of comprehensive perinatal services. Technical assistance is provided for program implementation, utilizing local health departments if possible. Alternative means are used if funding for administrative costs is not available. The Legislature intends for the department to establish a reimbursement method for comprehensive perinatal providers, covering reasonable costs and including fees for coordinating services. Reimbursement may be through fees for service, capitated fees, or global fees, with minimum standards set for services provided. The comprehensive perinatal provider is not financially at risk for inpatient services unrelated to perinatal care. Reimbursement for inpatient services related to perinatal care will be in accordance with specific sections. The department will monitor and oversee these services, collecting information using a perinatal data form. Participation in these services is voluntary, with patient rights safeguards in place. The amendments made to Section 14134.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code by this act do not expand the scope of practice for licensed midwives. Licensed midwives will be eligible to serve as comprehensive perinatal providers. The State Department of Health Care Services will revise regulations for implementation by March 1, 2016."
