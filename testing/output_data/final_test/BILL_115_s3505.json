Congress finds that battlefields of the American Revolution, War of 1812, and the Civil War serve as important historical sites for understanding the nation's history, honoring those who fought for freedom, training grounds for the Armed Forces, and as heritage tourism destinations that benefit local economies.

Among these, almost 70 percent are located within urban areas. Only 31 battlefields have more than half of the surviving landscape permanently protected, while 227 battlefields have less than half protected. Additionally, 65 battlefields have no protection at all, and 113 battlefields are severely impacted by development or are at risk of being overwhelmed. Almost 70 percent of the 243 identified Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields are located in urban areas. 141 battlefields are lost or fragmented due to development, while 100 retain significant features but only 37 percent of the original scene. 82 of these surviving battlefields are partially protected by public and nonprofit stewards, with 18 lacking legal protection. The condition of two battlefields is unknown. The Act aims to preserve and protect significant battlefields from the American Revolution, War of 1812, and Civil War through conservation easements and purchases. It also seeks to create partnerships to enhance visitor experiences at these sites. Additional research is needed to determine the exact location and condition of two battlefields, emphasizing the importance of preserving what remains today.
