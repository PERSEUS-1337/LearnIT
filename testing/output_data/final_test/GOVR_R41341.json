    "content": "Coal combustion waste (CCW) is the inorganic material left after burning coal for electricity. Around 135 million tons were generated in 2009, a significant waste stream in the US. Disposal at power plants can lead to long-term accumulation, as seen in the 2008 TVA Kingston plant incident where 1.1 billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry were released, causing extensive damage and cleanup costs estimated at $1.2 billion. The incident at Kingston highlighted the risk of sudden, catastrophic releases from surface impoundments. The more common threat from coal combustion waste (CCW) is the leaching of contaminants like arsenic, selenium, and lead into groundwater, especially in unlined disposal units. Many surface impoundments are over 25 years old and lack liners or groundwater monitoring, posing a risk to human health and the environment. The EPA proposed two regulatory options for managing coal combustion waste (CCW) to address potential threats to human health and the environment. The first option would regulate CCW as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA, while the second option would establish criteria for landfills and surface impoundments under Subtitle D. EPA received over 11,000 public comments on these options before the November 19, 2010 deadline. Industry, environmental, and citizen groups, as well as state representatives and Members of Congress, expressed concerns over EPA's proposal to regulate coal combustion waste. Industry argues the Subtitle C option is costly and stigmatizing, while states worry about implementation costs. Environmental groups believe the waste meets hazardous criteria under Subtitle C. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders have concerns about EPA's decision to regulate coal combustion waste (CCW) under Subtitle C or D. They worry about the impact on coal-producing states, energy prices, CCW recycling, and the protection of human health and the environment. Legislative options have been proposed to direct EPA to choose one regulatory option over the other. The Coal Combustion Residuals Accessibility Act of 2011 and H.R. 1405 would prevent EPA from regulating coal combustion waste as hazardous under RCRA Subtitle C. Congress could consider giving EPA authority to regulate the waste under Subtitle D, including establishing national standards like composite liners for new disposal units. This could address enforcement issues and industry concerns about labeling the waste as hazardous. Congress could create a new subtitle under RCRA to address management of coal combustion waste (CCW), potentially directing EPA to develop waste management standards for disposal facilities accepting CCW. Another approach is the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273), amending Subtitle D of RCRA to establish a \"Coal Combustion Residuals Permit Program\" for states to manage and dispose of CCWs. The bill proposes a permit program for the management and disposal of coal combustion wastes in states. States can choose to adopt the program or have EPA implement it if they decline. EPA would provide notice if any program element is deficient, drawing on existing landfill criteria and state permit programs. If states do not implement the program, EPA would be required to do so. This report provides an overview of the current rulemaking and background information related to waste management. It discusses potential risks of mismanagement supported by new EPA data and outlines the regulatory proposal, including existing RCRA requirements. The report does not incorporate opinions of stakeholders but focuses on EPA's regulatory proposal. EPA's implementation timeline is uncertain. The EPA's regulatory proposal, which may be reflected in a June 21, 2010 proposal, is still undecided. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson stated that a final rule is not expected in 2011 due to a large number of public comments. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) was enacted in 1976 to manage solid and hazardous waste, with Subtitle C creating a hazardous waste management program. Subtitle D of RCRA established criteria for non-hazardous solid waste disposal, with state and local governments as primary regulators. EPA proposed hazardous waste management regulations in 1978, deferring special wastes for further study due to perceived lower risk. In 1980, Representative Tom Bevill introduced an amendment to defer hazardous waste regulations for fossil fuel combustion waste and discarded mining waste until their potential hazard could be determined. This was to prevent discouraging coal use and burdening the utility industry. EPA excluded regulation of fossil fuel combustion waste from its final hazardous waste regulations in anticipation of this legislation. The Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 included the \"Bevill Amendment,\" which excluded coal combustion waste (CCW) from hazardous waste regulation under RCRA Subtitle C. EPA determined in 2000 that CCW did not warrant regulation as hazardous waste but recommended national regulations under Subtitle D for CCW disposal due to potential health and environmental risks. EPA identified cases of damages from improper waste management, with gaps in regulatory programs. After 10 years of study, EPA proposed revising the Bevill regulatory determination for coal combustion waste. EPA proposed revising the Bevill regulatory determination for coal combustion waste to list it as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. The draft proposal was sent to OIRA for review, citing new risk analyses showing CCW samples meeting regulatory criteria for hazardous waste. Factors considered include toxicity, constituent concentration, migration potential, and mismanagement risks. Recent risk assessments have highlighted the dangers of coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal in unlined landfills and surface impoundments, which can lead to toxic constituents like arsenic and selenium contaminating surface and groundwater. EPA has observed instances of water contamination exceeding health standards when CCW was not properly disposed of in units with composite liners. Despite some progress in using lined disposal units, there are still concerns about the lack of necessary protections in place for a significant amount of waste disposal. The EPA questions the effectiveness of waste management programs in addressing identified gaps and protecting human health and the environment. Despite improvements in industry practices, cases of inadequate management and missing key protections persist. Changes in air pollution control technology at coal-fired power plants are expected to increase waste production and contaminants. The EPA emphasizes the importance of preventing contamination rather than remedying it after discovery. The EPA's regulatory proposal aimed to prevent contamination rather than just remedying it after discovery. The final proposal suggested two options, one of which would maintain the Bevill exclusion but establish national criteria for landfills and surface impoundments under Subtitle D non-hazardous solid waste requirements. The proposal to regulate CCW under Subtitle D was driven by industry concerns about stigmatization and increased disposal amounts. Both options included design and operating criteria for landfills. The June 2010 regulatory proposal aims to establish design and operating criteria for landfills and surface impoundments, including requirements for composite liners, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure of units, and post-closure care. The proposal also includes options for Subtitle C regulations, which would involve land disposal restrictions, financial assurance requirements, and a federal permit program. Retrofitting existing surface impoundments with liners and implementing land disposal restrictions would phase out surface impoundment disposal of waste. EPA's authority under RCRA to enforce these regulations is a key distinction between the proposals. Under the existing Subtitle C requirements, EPA has the authority to reverse the Bevill exclusion, identify waste as hazardous, and establish waste management standards. EPA has limited authority under Subtitle D to revise regulations for solid waste disposal facilities, with criteria enforceable by states or through citizen suits. EPA could regulate CCW if deemed hazardous under Subtitle C but lacks authority to enforce requirements for CCW landfills under Subtitle D. EPA acknowledges differing views on data supporting its rulemaking. Among state regulatory agencies, industry groups, citizen groups, and environmental organizations, there is strong support and opposition for regulating waste under solid waste requirements. Arguments in favor of regulation include lack of evidence of significant threat to human health or the environment, unnecessary cost and burden of hazardous waste regulation, and sufficient protection under current state regulations. Industry groups argue against labeling the material as \"hazardous\" or regulating it under. Industry groups argue against labeling the material as \"hazardous\" or regulating it under Subtitle C requirements, fearing stigmatization and limited reuse options. Environmental groups advocate for hazardous waste regulation, citing toxicity characteristics and risks to human health and the environment. They believe recycling could increase if disposal becomes costlier under Subtitle C. Their opposition to Subtitle D is based on EPA's lack of enforcement authority. Industry groups oppose labeling the material as \"hazardous\" or regulating it under Subtitle C, fearing stigma and limited reuse options. Environmental groups advocate for hazardous waste regulation due to toxicity risks. They argue that relying on citizen suits to enforce disposal standards is burdensome and unreliable. EPA's Subtitle D proposal lacks authority for financial assurance for cleanup. The public comment period for EPA's proposal ended on November 19, 2010. The EPA's public comment period for its proposal on coal combustion waste regulation ended on November 19, 2010. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson stated that final regulations were not expected in 2011 due to the large volume of comments received. Coal combustion waste includes bottom ash, boiler slag, fly ash, and FGD products generated during the combustion process. The EPA has been studying coal combustion waste (CCW) for 30 years, with stakeholders arguing it is largely benign. Recent data has identified over 40 constituents in CCW, with contaminants like antimony, arsenic, lead, and mercury being of environmental concern. The chemical composition of CCW depends on the type and source. The EPA has focused on the chemical composition of coal combustion waste (CCW), which varies based on coal type, combustion technology, and air pollution control methods. Advanced technologies aim to reduce air emissions but may transfer pollutants to CCW. EPA is researching toxicity levels of CCW, how they change with technology, and the potential for leaching of harmful constituents. The EPA is concerned about the accuracy of traditional test methods used to determine the toxicity and mobility of metals in coal combustion waste (CCW). Research shows that the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Producer (TCLP) method alone is not sufficient. New leach test methods are being used to assess CCW management conditions more accurately, revealing that CCW samples exceed toxicity and drinking water standards for various constituents. The disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion waste (CCW) are significant concerns due to the presence of hazardous contaminants like arsenic, selenium, lead, cobalt, barium, and chromium. Leach rates are influenced more by pH than the total amount of contaminants. In 2009, 69% of the 135 million tons of CCW generated was disposed of in landfills, surface impoundments, or as minefill, while 40.7 million tons were beneficially used in building materials, waste stabilization, and blasting grit. CCWs are managed in wet or dry disposal systems. The disposal of coal combustion waste (CCW) involves wet or dry systems. In wet systems, waste is sluiced to impoundment ponds where solids settle, leaving clear water. Surface impoundments hold CCWs with free liquids, which can be dredged periodically or taken to landfills. Landfill disposal involves depositing dry waste in engineered areas. EPA's regulatory proposal includes various disposal sites like piles, sand and gravel pits, quarries, and large-scale fill operations. The EPA estimates there are approximately 300 CCW landfills and 629 CCW surface impoundments in use at coal-fired power plants. After the Kingston release in 2009, EPA requested information on the structural integrity of surface impoundment units to prevent catastrophic releases. The survey identified 629 surface impoundments in 42 states, but did not request data on landfills. EPA's estimate of surface impoundments is based on recent data, while the estimated number of landfills is from a 2000 regulatory determination. In 2006, EPA and DOE conducted a study on state regulations for CCW landfills and surface impoundments built between 1994 and 2004. It was estimated that two-thirds of waste went to landfills and the rest to impoundments. The accuracy of these estimates is uncertain due to outdated data and inaccuracies in previous surveys. While not federally regulated, these facilities are subject to some regulations. The EPA has proposed national standards to regulate CCW disposal due to inconsistencies in state requirements. States have not adequately implemented CCW regulatory programs, with 36% of states lacking minimum liner requirements for CCW disposal units. Survey data shows that many states lack minimum liner requirements and groundwater monitoring for CCW disposal units, highlighting significant gaps in regulatory programs. EPA emphasizes the importance of proper regulation due to the risks associated with surface impoundments. CCW has potential beneficial uses in building materials. In 2009, approximately 30% of the 134.7 million pounds of CCW produced was beneficially used, with 36% in encapsulated form and the rest in unencapsulated form. EPA distinguishes between truly beneficial uses and those that are essentially disposal, considering a use beneficial if it provides functional benefits like increasing concrete durability or adjusting soil pH for plant growth. The EPA considers coal combustion byproducts (e.g., fly ash or FGD material) beneficial when used as a substitute for virgin materials, in wallboard production, or meeting product specifications. However, disposal in sand and gravel pits or large-scale fill operations is not considered beneficial and can result in environmental damage. The EPA identified environmental concerns with unencapsulated uses of coal combustion waste (CCW) and sought feedback on tighter federal regulations. Prior to the proposal, the EPA promoted beneficial CCW uses through the Coal Combustion Products Partnership (C2P2), but stopped after the regulatory proposal in May 2010. EPA's Office of Inspector General found that EPA did not follow standard practices in determining environmental damages from CCW disposal. The Inspector General found that EPA did not follow standard practices in assessing the safety of beneficial uses of coal combustion waste (CCW). The report highlighted the incomplete picture presented by the C2P2 program regarding potential risks from large-scale CCW placement. The presence of hazardous constituents in waste does not automatically indicate a risk to humans; actual risk depends on exposure pathways and levels. Stakeholders have debated the migration of hazardous constituents from deposition sites. The EPA regulatory proposal identifies primary pathways of exposure to contaminants from coal combustion waste, including leaching to groundwater, discharge to surface water, and fugitive dust emissions. Human exposure has mainly occurred through contaminant leaching in unlined landfills or surface impoundments. EPA was required to analyze potential risks and actual harm under the Bevill Amendment. In its June 2010 proposal, EPA re-evaluates its Bevill determination by citing findings from its risk assessment and documented damages from CCW management. EPA's documented damages include 27 proven cases of harm to surface and groundwater and 40 potential damage cases. The impacts on human health and the environment include elevated selenium levels in migratory birds, wetland vegetative damage, fish kills, amphibian deformities, snake metabolic effects, plant toxicity, mammal uptake, fish deformities, and inhibited fish reproductive capacity. The EPA's revised study in April 2010 found high risks of human exposure to carcinogens like lead, selenium, and arsenic from coal combustion wastes (CCW) in unlined landfills and surface impoundments. Surface impoundments pose higher risks due to waste leachate concentrations and hydraulic pressure. The study suggests that composite liners can safely manage CCWs, but questions the reliability of clay liners, especially in surface impoundments. The EPA's study in April 2010 highlighted high risks of human exposure to carcinogens from coal combustion wastes (CCW) in unlined landfills and surface impoundments. Recent incidents like the Kingston release show that current management practices can lead to catastrophic releases due to structural failures. The evolution of CCW regulation under RCRA involves a complex history. The EPA's study in April 2010 raised concerns about human exposure to carcinogens from coal combustion wastes (CCW) in landfills and impoundments. The current rulemaking process involves debates on EPA's authority under RCRA to regulate CCW as solid or hazardous waste, expanding existing regulatory requirements. The complexity of RCRA and selected provisions relevant to the regulatory proposal are discussed, focusing on EPA's existing authority to implement requirements for managing CCW. The EPA has authority to regulate hazardous waste from generation to disposal under Subtitle C, with limited authority under Subtitle D for CCW disposal facilities. EPA can only encourage states to implement regulations under Subtitle D, while having broad authority under Subtitle C to establish criteria, standards, and permit programs for hazardous waste management. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) by establishing a permit program and criteria for states to enforce their own programs. Solid waste is broadly defined as any discarded material, including liquids, solids, or semi-solids. Hazardous waste can be classified as \"characteristic\" or \"listed\" based on specific criteria set by the EPA. Industrial waste generators must determine if a waste is hazardous through testing or knowledge of the waste generation process. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) is a common test method to determine a waste's toxicity by simulating landfill conditions. EPA may list wastes as hazardous based on specific criteria, including the presence of toxic constituents and potential harm to human health or the environment. Various factors are considered, such as toxic constituent concentration and degradation potential. The EPA considered factors like toxic constituent concentration and degradation potential in determining the regulation of coal combustion waste (CCW) as hazardous. Recent studies found CCW samples exceeded toxicity levels for selenium, barium, arsenic, and chromium under plausible disposal conditions. If identified as hazardous, CCW would be subject to RCRA subtitle C requirements for waste management. The EPA regulates hazardous waste management from generation to disposal, requiring permits for facilities handling hazardous waste. States can implement their own programs under EPA oversight. If CCW is classified as hazardous, states can choose to follow EPA's regulations for management. Under EPA's Subtitle C, land disposal of hazardous waste is prohibited unless treated to meet certain standards or disposed in a unit with no migration of hazardous constituents. Facilities must clean up any releases of hazardous waste to protect human health and the environment. RCRA Subtitle C also requires facilities to demonstrate adequate financial resources for closure, post-closure care, cleanup, and liability from operations. Subtitle D of RCRA regulates solid wastes that are not hazardous or exempted, focusing on MSW landfills. EPA's authority is limited compared to Subtitle C, with enforceable criteria for MSW landfills only. Subtitle D promotes federal, state, and local cooperation in managing nonhazardous solid waste, setting minimum standards for human health and environmental protection. Under Subtitle D of RCRA, EPA provides technical assistance to states for developing environmentally sound waste management programs. Minimum national performance standards are set to prevent adverse health and environmental effects from solid waste disposal. Open dumping is prohibited under RCRA, with enforcement left to states and citizens. EPA's authority is limited compared to Subtitle C, focusing on MSW landfills. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 added Section 4010 to RCRA, requiring EPA to establish criteria for evaluating solid waste management practices. EPA promulgated regulations for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills, including location restrictions and design criteria. EPA may intervene if waste disposal practices pose a threat to human health or the environment. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 added Section 4010 to RCRA, requiring EPA to establish criteria for evaluating solid waste management practices, including design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure requirements, and financial assurance. States were directed to implement permit programs to ensure compliance with landfill criteria, with EPA authorized to enforce regulations for states lacking adequate programs. Subtitle D provisions under HSWA illustrate limitations on EPA's authority to develop landfill criteria. EPA may intervene if waste disposal practices pose a threat to human health or the environment. EPA has limited authority to develop landfill criteria for municipal solid waste landfills. Open dumping prohibitions are enforced by states or through citizen suits. Citizen suits can be filed for violations of permits, regulations, or if waste disposal poses a threat to health or the environment. EPA can take action in cases of imminent endangerment. Under Section 7003 of RCRA, EPA can take action if disposal of wastes poses an imminent endangerment to health or the environment. This provision allows EPA to initiate legal action or issue orders to waste generators or disposal facility owners. It can be used in situations where other enforcement tools are not applicable, such as at sites not regulated by environmental laws. Conditions for action include imminent endangerment, requiring documentation and scientific evidence. The endangerment standard under RCRA is broadly interpreted, focusing on past or present waste handling. EPA can take necessary action under Section 7003 on a case-by-case basis to address potential endangerments. This allows EPA to obtain relevant information. While EPA can develop criteria for landfills accepting waste, it lacks authority to enforce regulations or require state implementation. EPA could establish enforceable regulations under Subtitle D for states that choose to implement them. EPA is reconsidering whether to regulate waste under Subtitle C or D of RCRA, seeking input on both options to ensure protection of human health and the environment based on sound science. The proposals draw on existing requirements and authorities specified under Subtitles C and D, including regulatory requirements to address potential risks. The EPA is considering regulating waste under Subtitle C of RCRA, with regulatory requirements specific to managing CCW. This would involve existing Subtitle C requirements such as location restrictions, liners, leachate collection systems, closure requirements, storage requirements, corrective action, financial assurance, and permitting requirements. Unique requirements for CCW management are outlined in Table 1. Permitting and upgrade requirements for existing surface impoundments, along with land disposal restrictions for future wet disposal of CCW, would also be enforced. If the Subtitle C option is finalized, it would phase out surface impoundment disposal of CCW. States with authorized hazardous waste programs would need to adopt the regulations, which could take one to two years. CCW beneficially used would be excluded from hazardous waste regulation. Compliance with closure requirements for surface impoundments may take up to seven years. If EPA chooses the Subtitle D option, it would establish criteria for CCW surface impoundments and landfills to prevent adverse health or environmental effects. Non-compliant facilities would violate RCRA's open dumping prohibition. This proposal is similar to existing regulations for waste disposal facilities. The Subtitle D proposal for waste disposal facilities includes location restrictions and design requirements similar to existing regulations for municipal solid waste landfills. New disposal units must be above the water table, not in wetlands or fault zones, and have a composite liner. Existing units in unstable areas must meet closure requirements. Existing surface impoundments would need solids removed and retrofitted with a composite liner. Landfills do not require liner retrofitting. Impoundments would have stability requirements similar to MSHA regulations, along with dust and liquid control measures. Facilities must keep records publicly available for compliance verification. Groundwater monitoring and corrective actions are required for new and existing disposal units. The disposal units must undergo groundwater monitoring and corrective actions if hazardous constituents exceed standards. Closure must follow a plan, but EPA lacks authority to enforce requirements or approve state adoption of criteria. States can develop their own regulations. The EPA has proposed self-implementing requirements for facilities to manage coal combustion waste. States can develop their own regulations, but if they do not adopt the proposed standards, facilities would still need to comply with Subtitle D criteria. Limited enforcement mechanisms are in place, with the public able to enforce requirements if necessary. The EPA estimated the annual regulatory costs for managing coal combustion waste to be around $1.5 billion under Subtitle C and $587 million under Subtitle D. The analysis also considered potential environmental and public health benefits. Monetized benefits in the RIA for managing coal combustion waste include groundwater protection benefits such as human cancer prevention and avoided remediation costs at disposal sites. There is also a reduction in economic impacts from cleanup costs associated with surface impoundment failures and an increase in industrial beneficial uses of CCWs. EPA estimated annualized regulatory benefits under the Subtitle C option, which varied depending on potential changes in waste use. The RIA also considers potential changes in costs and benefits if recycling levels remain unchanged or if there is a decrease in beneficial use due to regulatory stigma effects. Under the Subtitle C option, EPA estimates a potential decrease in beneficial use of coal combustion waste due to regulatory stigma effects, leading to increased costs of $16.7 billion. However, increased recycling could result in a regulatory benefit of $7.4 billion annually. States and utilities argue that current regulatory programs are sufficient to protect human health and the environment from the waste, and regulating it under Subtitle C would be too costly. Industries advocating for beneficial use of CCW oppose regulation under Subtitle C. CCW argue that regulating the material under Subtitle C, even with exemptions for certain beneficial uses, would stigmatize it. Environmental groups believe EPA has enough data to show risks of unlined disposal units and states are not regulating waste effectively. EPA has limited authority under RCRA to set disposal criteria under Subtitle D. EPA has limited authority under RCRA to establish disposal criteria for CCW under Subtitle D. Congress has options to address concerns, including directing EPA to maintain the Bevill exemption or explicitly prohibiting the exemption for CCW. EPA has gathered data showing significant risks to human health and the environment from improper CCW management. Congress has the option to prohibit the Bevill exemption for CCW or give EPA additional authority to regulate it under Subtitle D, potentially establishing waste management criteria for facilities receiving CCW. This could include standards for landfills and surface disposal. Congress could potentially amend existing solid waste management criteria to include standards for landfills and surface impoundments accepting coal combustion wastes. This could involve creating a new subtitle under RCRA (Subtitle K) to address unique issues related to coal combustion waste management, directing EPA to develop waste management standards for disposal units accepting CCW, and authorizing EPA to regulate certain beneficial uses. The EPA is considering regulating certain beneficial uses of coal combustion waste, such as construction fill. Congress may choose to let the EPA continue its rulemaking process and select a proposal. The finalization date for the EPA's proposal is currently unknown. The CCW proposal was not included in the EPA's regulatory priorities for 2011."
