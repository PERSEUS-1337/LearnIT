They can compute the probability of statements and make accurate evaluations without explicit supervision. Machine learning models lack common sense and struggle with tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. Integration of prior knowledge is suggested to improve performance. The dataset highlights the challenge of answering questions that require common sense knowledge. Language models can extract this knowledge by scoring multiple choice questions using a simple method, achieving 63.7% accuracy. The trained language models can enrich human-annotated knowledge bases by adding new facts at a lower cost than human annotation. This method involves fine-tuning LMs to classify unseen facts and non-facts from ConceptNet, achieving improved accuracy. Trained language models can classify unseen facts and non-facts from ConceptNet with high accuracy, outperforming previous methods. Previous approaches to solving the Winograd Schema Challenge involved heavy use of annotated knowledge bases, rule-based reasoning, and hand-crafted features. Our work utilizes LSTMs to improve results on the Winograd Schema Challenge without fine-tuning, unlike previous methods that relied on hand-crafted features and supervised training data. We leverage unsupervised learning from texts, such as the skip-gram model, to capture commonsense knowledge. Neural language models (LMs) are used for tasks like Winograd Schema Challenge, requiring contextual information. Training LMs on large text corpora yields good results without supervised learning. LMs have also been successful in Cloze type reading comprehension tasks. They have broader applications in improving downstream tasks by providing better sentence or paragraph representations. Automated methods are proposed to increase knowledge base coverage, as human-constructed knowledge bases have limited coverage. In the context of neural language models, a study shows that a simpler model outperforms a supervised LSTM in scoring unseen facts from ConceptNet. The performance of deep neural networks degrades on novel test instances compared to training data, but trained LMs do not suffer from this issue. The study introduces a method using pretrained language models for the Winograd Schema Challenge, where the probability of a statement is used to judge its truthfulness by substituting pronouns with candidate choices. The study introduces a method using pretrained language models for the Winograd Schema Challenge, where the probability of a statement is used to judge its truthfulness by substituting pronouns with candidate choices. Language models are trained on text corpora, encoding human knowledge in natural language, and can assign probabilities to text during inference. The method involves substituting pronouns with candidate choices and using a language model to score the resulting substitutions, detecting key contributors to the sentence. The study utilizes pretrained language models for the Winograd Schema Challenge, scoring substitutions of pronouns with candidate choices based on the probability of the resulting sentence. The method aims to detect key contributors to the sentence by analyzing the probability of word positions. The study uses pretrained language models for the Winograd Schema Challenge, scoring pronoun substitutions based on sentence probability. It aims to identify key sentence elements by analyzing word position probabilities. In experiments, partial scoring is found to be more effective than full scoring. The study utilizes pretrained language models for the Winograd Schema Challenge, focusing on scoring pronoun substitutions using sentence probability analysis. Two types of Recurrent language models are considered, one processing word inputs and the other character inputs. Output layers are designed to generate word outputs, enabling both input processing types to collaborate in ensembles. To address human names, a large vocabulary is employed. The architectural design and training scheme from BID9 are followed with modifications to create more language model variants. Additional details on the language models can be found in Appendix A. In this section, the training text corpora used in experiments are described, including LM-1-Billion, CommonCrawl, SQuAD, and Gutenberg Books. Two commonsense reasoning tests are discussed: Pronoun Disambiguation Problems (PDP-60) and Winograd Schema Challenge. The latter consists of 273 questions designed to challenge traditional linguistic restrictions and common heuristics. In this work, the focus is on the official Winograd Schema Challenge test set and the Commonsense Knowledge Mining test. The data split on the ConceptNet knowledge base results in training, validation, and test sets of different sizes. The commonsense knowledge mining task involves classifying between facts and non-facts. Another test set includes instances with the highest novelty measurement computed against the training set. The text discusses training language models on various text corpora and testing them on Commonsense Reasoning tests. The models are then fine-tuned for mining novel commonsense knowledge on ConceptNet. Results show that a single-model resolver outperforms previous systems, even when compared to those using supervised deep neural networks or knowledge bases. By ensembling multiple language models, accuracy rates of up to 70% were achieved, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art result. Full scoring was found to be more effective than partial scoring for this task. In Section 6.3, full scoring outperforms partial scoring. On the WSC-273 task, incorporating supervised learning and knowledge base to USSM BID14 provides a small gain (+3%) compared to a larger gain on PDP-60 (+19%). Ensembling predictions from multiple LMs leads to nearly 10% absolute accuracy improvement, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art. BID29's approach for WSC is limited to 53 out of 273 test cases, not comparable to our results. After observing questions during evaluation BID24 BID29, a customized text corpus was built based on questions in commonsense reasoning tasks. The corpus does not include answers, providing no supervision to resolvers. Documents with the most overlapping n-grams with the questions were aggregated from the CommonCrawl dataset. The top 0.1% highest ranked documents were chosen as the new training corpus, resulting in nearly 1,000,000 documents named Stories. The dataset consists of documents resembling stories with coherent events. LMs trained on a text corpus called Stories show strong performance, with an accuracy of 63.7% in the final system. These LMs can outperform other methods on Commonsense Reasoning tests and help expand human-annotated knowledge bases by converting knowledge tuples into natural language sentences. LMs trained on a text corpus called Stories demonstrate strong performance in adapting to new data distributions and generalizing well to test instances. For fine-tuning, each commonsense fact in the training set is paired with a negative example to encourage perplexity discrepancy between positive and negative examples. This approach enhances the LM objective by adding a term that penalizes discrepancies beyond a certain threshold. LMs trained on a text corpus called Stories show strong performance in adapting to new data distributions and generalizing well to test instances. A word-level LM with \u03b1 = 0.5 performs best on the validation set, outperforming other methods on both tests. Unlike DNN BID12, LM ranking is robust to novelty-based test instances, while supervised DNN performance degrades significantly on this test due to overfitting with limited training data. Leveraging a massive amount of unsupervised training data, LM does not overfit to the limited training data for this task despite its large size of approximately 2 billion parameters. Analysis is performed on correct and incorrect predictions made by LM scoring on the Winograd Schema, and the influence of training data is examined. We introduce a method to detect keywords from the context at which our proposed resolvers make the decision between the two candidates c correct and c incorrect in the Winograd Schema. The choice between c correct or c incorrect is made based on the value of Q = t q t. By analyzing the individual q t values, we can identify words that have the most influence on the final decision. Visualizing the probability ratios q t provides further insights into the decision-making process of our resolvers. Partial scoring corrects incorrect predictions made by full scoring in the Winograd Schema Challenge by shifting attention to keywords that uniquely decide the correct answer. Special keywords are identified based on probability ratios q t, which provide insights into the decision-making process of the resolvers. Our resolver identifies special keywords in Winograd Schema questions by analyzing probability ratios q t, allowing for correct predictions based on key details. This approach demonstrates a strong understanding of context and commonsense knowledge in decision-making. The Winograd Schema Challenge relies on careful wording to test systems' ability to use context and commonsense knowledge in decision-making. A study using trained language models revealed biases in some models when context was gradually removed from questions, affecting their performance. The bias in language models is more pronounced when context is removed, impacting their performance. Including more context improves all language models, highlighting the importance of context in scoring. Incorrect predictions from a word-level language model are often due to rare words in the training corpus overpowering subsequent values. A simple fix involves normalizing the score with the unigram count of the word. The bias in language models is more pronounced when context is removed, impacting their performance. Including more context improves all language models, highlighting the importance of context in scoring. A simple fix involves normalizing the score with the unigram count of the word. This normalization fixes full scoring in 9 out of 10 tested LMs on PDP-60. On WSC-273, partial scoring, which ignores the word altogether, outperforms other scorings. The different behavior observed on PDP-60 is attributed to its small size. Training data on commonsense reasoning test performance shows that test performance improves with longer training text documents. The ensemble trained on a mix of different datasets performs best, emphasizing the importance of diversity in training data for commonsense reasoning accuracy. Pretrained language models can capture human knowledge and score textual statements, achieving higher accuracy on the Winograd Schema Challenge and mining novel commonsense facts from ConceptNet. Trained language models show key features for improved performance. The trained language models demonstrate the ability to identify key context features for accurate predictions without the need for expensive human annotation. Common sense knowledge can be learned and stored in distributed representations through language modeling. The base model includes two layers of LSTM with 8192 hidden units and utilizes peepholes and a projection layer to reduce output dimensionality. The potential for unsupervised learning to capture commonsense from other modalities like images or videos remains an open question. The text chunk discusses the process of input processing for word and character inputs in a model, including embedding lookups, concatenation, convolutional layers, and dropout before feeding into LSTM layers. The text chunk describes the training process of a language model, including dropout on LSTM tensors, fully-connected layer with Softmax operator, importance sampling for LM loss evaluation, AdaGrad BID5 algorithm for loss minimization, gradient clipping, sharding matrices, model variants, LM training text corpora, and similarity score histogram analysis. The curr_chunk discusses the hypothesis that training language models on complex references from pronouns in text can help in making correct predictions. It also mentions instances of incorrect or ambiguous annotations found in a dataset.
