Despite facing challenges, the country has made progress in stability and democracy. The U.N. mission in Timor-Leste, UNMIT, has been present since 2006 and is preparing to end operations by 2012. The history of Timor-Leste includes Portuguese colonialism, Indonesian rule, and a U.N.-organized referendum for independence in 1999. After gaining independence, the country faced violence from pro-integrationist militias. The United Nations has provided assistance in peacekeeping, capacity building, and humanitarian aid. The current situation in Timor-Leste is relatively calm, but underlying tensions, especially in the security sector, still need to be addressed. \"The main threat to Timor-Leste is internal strife due to weak state institutions, elite rivalries, and youth unemployment. Peacekeeping troops and UNMIT mission, revenue from Timor Sea, and political stability are aiding democratic progress. Economy relies on Timor Sea energy resources, managed in a Petroleum Fund. Withdrawals account for 90% of government revenues, with a balance of $10 million as of 2011.\" The main challenges facing Timor-Leste include managing its wealth from Timor Sea resources, economic development for job creation, internal security, human rights, and democratic institution building. The House Democracy Partnership has been involved in training Timorese legislators since 2006. Presidential elections were held in 2012, with parliamentary polls scheduled for July 7, seen as a crucial test for the nation's stability. In 2012, Jose Maria de Vasconcelos, a former rebel leader, was elected as Timor-Leste's third president in a runoff election. The Presidency is largely ceremonial but highly coveted, with the endorsement of Xanana Gusmao critical to Vasconcelos's victory. The U.N. described the presidential polls as \"clean and orderly.\" Twenty political parties are contesting July 7 elections for the 65-seat Parliament, the most powerful body in Timor-Leste's Parliamentary system. The two largest political parties in Timor-Leste are the ruling CNRT led by Gusmao and the rival Fretilin. The Democratic Party, supported by former president Jose Ramos-Horta, is also a key player. The United Nations' role in Timor-Leste is evolving, with plans for UNMIT to end in 2012. The Joint Transition Plan focuses on stability, national elections, and forming a government based on election outcomes. The Joint Transition Plan in Timor-Leste aims to assist with the handover of UNMIT activities and ensure continuity in the transition from peacekeeping to statebuilding. The High-Level Committee on Transition oversees working groups for this process, with the government requesting options for a post-UNMIT engagement. Four possible models for a future U.N. presence in Timor-Leste are currently under discussion. The management of the Petroleum Fund in Timor-Leste is a major economic challenge, with a balance of around $10 billion as of the end of 2011. The government has increased spending significantly in recent years, funded by the petroleum reserve. The FY2012 budget saw a 30% rise from the previous year, with funds allocated to infrastructure, rural development, and public services, as well as new funding mechanisms for large-scale projects. The government in Timor-Leste has increased spending significantly in recent years, funded by the petroleum reserve. The expansionary budget has led to allegations of unsustainable spending, reaching a small minority of the population, and inflation at 18%. The United States aims to improve financial controls through a $10 million Millennium Challenge Compact. Timor-Leste receives assistance from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Nations. There is a dispute with Australia over the development of hydrocarbon resources in the Timor Sea, with Timor-Leste favoring an onshore LNG processing plant and Woodside Petroleum preferring offshore processing. Woodside Petroleum favors offshore processing in Timor-Leste, causing disagreement with Australia. Timor-Leste seeks ASEAN membership and has good relations with Indonesia. China has increased assistance to Timor-Leste, including a $1 billion fund for Portuguese-speaking nations. Xanana Gusmao, former president and current prime minister, is a key figure in Timorese politics, known for his role in the independence movement. Xanana Gusmao, a key figure in Timorese politics, led the resistance against Indonesian occupation and became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002. He later served as prime minister after forming a coalition. President Taur Matan Rauk, a former Army chief, was elected in 2012 with support from Gusmao. Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Laureate, has also held positions of president and prime minister in Timor-Leste. Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Laureate, served as president and prime minister of Timor-Leste. He left before Indonesian troops invaded in 1975, represented Fretilin abroad, and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996. Ramos-Horta was appointed president in 2006 and survived an assassination attempt in 2008. Mari Alkatiri, former prime minister, resigned in 2006 and remains Secretary General of Fretilin. Alkatiri, a Muslim minority in Timor-Leste, has considerable support and a rivalry with Gusmao. The country has a unicameral parliament of 65 members, elected in 2007, with new elections in 2012. Timor-Leste gained independence in 2002 under a UN administration. The new constitution established an elected parliament with 52 to 65 members, but the Constituent Assembly declared itself as the first national parliament. Fretilin led the resistance to Indonesian rule. The parliamentary government includes a popularly elected President. Xanana Gusmao leads the coalition government formed after the 2007 election. The coalition, Alianca com Maioria Parlementar (APM), consists of four parties. The main opposition party is Frente Revolucionario do Timor-Leste Independence (Fretilin). The 65-seat national parliament faces numerous challenges. The 65-seat national parliament in Timor-Leste faces challenges with inexperienced members, language barriers, limited resources, and oversight capacity. The country is one of the poorest in the world, with high levels of poverty, unemployment, and reliance on subsistence farming. Generating employment is a critical issue for the government, with around 40% of the population living below the poverty line. Timor-Leste, one of the poorest countries in the world, has around 40% of its population living below the poverty line. The economy heavily relies on oil and gas revenues, small-scale agricultural exports like coffee, and tourism. The country faces challenges with infrastructure development, high unemployment, and insecurity as it transitions from post-conflict recovery to long-term economic and political development. Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand support Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste and Australia have a joint agreement for oil and gas exploitation in the Timor Sea. Timor-Leste has significant reserve funds from the Bayu-Undan field. There is controversy over the location of an LNG processing plant. Portugal controlled Timor-Leste from the 1640s until 1975. In 1975, Fretilin declared independence for Timor-Leste, leading to Indonesian invasion and occupation. A referendum in 1999 resulted in 78% of voters choosing independence, sparking retaliation by pro-Indonesian militias. In 1999, pro-integrationist militias, supported by elements of the Indonesian military, killed over 1,300 Timor-Lesteese. More than 260,000 were displaced in West Timor and 200,000 in Timor-Leste. The violence led to the destruction of 70% of Timor-Leste's economic infrastructure, 80% of schools, and most medical facilities. A U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission, INTERFET, led by Australia, was deployed to restore order. Australia has continued to support Timor-Leste since then. In 2006, a police mutiny worsened internal security, prompting the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia. In 2006, foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia were deployed to Timor-Leste at the invitation of the government. The Australian military contingent was the largest with 1,100 troops. The United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was established to support stability, democratic governance, and political dialogue. The turmoil in 2006 stemmed from the dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri. In July 2006, police in Timor-Leste broke into factions, with some joining rebels in the hills. The dismissal of protesting troops in March 2006 led to rioting, looting, and deaths, causing many to flee the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri stepped down due to his failure to denounce the transfer of weapons to civilians. Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced for authorizing weapon transfers to supporters and a hit squad. Gangs of unemployed youth also contributed to escalating violence in the country. In the aftermath of the 2006 police and military clashes in Timor-Leste, gang violence surged in Dili, resulting in deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader in the violent protests, attempted to assassinate the president and prime minister in 2008 but was killed. Reinado led a group of former soldiers who were fired from the army in 2006. The new leader of Reinado's group surrendered in 2008. The international humanitarian aid community in Timor-Leste, including the United Nations, NGOs, and donor governments, provided assistance to civilians displaced by civil disturbances in 2006. By 2008-2009, many IDPs returned home with support from the Ministry of Social Solidarity and international organizations like IOM. In November 2008, around 10,400 IDPs had returned. In November 2008, around 10,400 families received recovery packages and returned home, leading to the closure of approximately 21 camps. Transitional shelter sites were then constructed to house some of the displaced, with the last shelter closing on February 28, 2010. The housing assistance component concluded on May 31, 2010. Despite the absence of a humanitarian crisis in Timor-Leste, the population remains vulnerable due to ongoing challenges with poverty, food insecurity, and the impact of natural disasters. The deterioration in food security in Timor-Leste is attributed to unsettled land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence hindering the reintegration of IDPs. Resentment towards the government may arise from disruptive land title laws. The UNOCHA ended its formal mission in December 2008, indicating the end of the humanitarian crisis, although support for specific activities continues. Support from UNOCHA continues for specific, long-term activities, including disaster risk management workshops and climate change adaptation strategies. Australia and Timor-Leste are discussing establishing a regional processing center to address human trafficking and asylum seeker issues. Australia is considering opening asylum seeker processing centers on the mainland due to an increase in numbers. Prime Minister Gillard mentioned ongoing discussions with regional governments and the UNHCR. Concerns were raised about the impact on Timor-Leste, with activists and the Timorese parliament rejecting the plan. The Timorese parliament rejected Australia's proposal for an asylum seeker processing center in 2010. President Ramos-Horta stated that Timor-Leste had a humanitarian obligation but would only accept the center temporarily without bearing the costs. Ambivalence and opposition to the idea persisted in 2011, with uncertainty about the leadership and involvement of UNHCR. The idea of building a regional processing center in Timor-Leste lost momentum and is not a national or regional priority, as discussed at the Fourth Regional Ministerial Conference in Bali, Indonesia in March 2011. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) is working towards a withdrawal by the end of 2012, with a mandate to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues. The UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was mandated to support security, political, and humanitarian issues, including assistance with the presidential and parliamentary electoral process. The mission was extended annually through resolutions, with a focus on reconfiguring the police component to transfer responsibilities to the Timorese National Police Force. Resolution 2037 (2012) extends the UNMIT mandate in Timor-Leste until December 31, 2012, endorsing a phased drawdown plan. Finn Reske-Nielson (Denmark) is the Acting Special Representative of the Secretary General for Timor-Leste. The Secretary-General's report highlighted the calm overall situation in Timor-Leste and discussed long-term challenges, including the National Strategic Development Plan. The Secretary-General's report on UNMIT in Timor-Leste focused on key areas such as the National Strategic Development Plan, policing responsibilities, election of the Anti-Corruption Commissioner, dialogue and reconciliation, democratic governance, human rights, justice administration, international compact, Millennium Development Goals, socio-economic developments, and humanitarian assistance. The Secretary-General's report on UNMIT in Timor-Leste highlighted political and security developments, human rights promotion, support for national priorities, transition preparation, and financial aspects. Recommendations included preparations for elections, security concerns for the national police force, progress on reconciliation recommendations, and effective implementation of the Joint Transition Plan. The United Nations is preparing for its departure from Timor-Leste at the end of 2012, which will impact the future UN engagement in the country. Timor-Leste faces challenges such as reintegration of displaced individuals, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment, amidst fragile political and judicial institutions. The U.N. Security Council discussed these issues on February 22, 2012, with the U.S. representative highlighting key priorities including the transfer of policing responsibilities to the national police force and the need for stability during elections. Timor-Leste is focused on maintaining stability during the election period and developing national security institutions. The Government, with support from the United Nations and other partners, is preparing for the upcoming elections. Efforts are ongoing to strengthen rule of law and governance institutions. Collaboration between UNMIT and the Government is in progress to develop a transition plan for UNMIT's withdrawal. The future engagement of the United Nations and the Security Council in Timor-Leste post-withdrawal will involve the Government and international community. U.S. aid programs aim to build a self-sufficient economy, improve public services, and promote good governance in Timor-Leste. Total U.S. foreign assistance to Timor-Leste in FY2012 was $14.5 million, with a request of $12.8 million for FY2013. Assistance has supported economic and political development through media, civil society, political parties, electoral process, judicial institutions, and governmental capacity. A joint program with China aimed to promote food security. Timor-Leste's leadership has maintained practical relations with neighboring countries. Indonesia and Timor-Leste have worked to improve relations, putting past conflicts behind them. A joint Truth Commission report blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to expressions of regret and a push to move forward. Indonesia supports Timor-Leste's membership in ASEAN and the two countries are exploring energy cooperation. Progress has been slower in areas like border management and visa-free travel. Australia's political support has been crucial in the creation of Timor-Leste. Despite reducing military presence as security improves, tensions with Timor-Leste persist over Timor Sea energy resources. Prime Minister Gusmao urges Australia to be more transparent in negotiations. Timor-Leste urges Australia to be more transparent in negotiations over undersea hydrocarbon resources, aiming to assert independence. Timor-Leste stands to share $30 billion revenue from the Greater Sunrise field with Australia. Efforts to distance from Australia include acquiring patrol boats. Timor-Leste hopes for private companies to build a pipeline to enable development of processing facilities. Timor-Leste aims for independence in negotiations with Australia over undersea hydrocarbon resources. Private companies opt for a floating platform in the Timor Sea instead of a pipeline to Darwin or Dili. Woodside Corporation estimates the platform's value at $13 billion for both countries. China assists Timor-Leste with construction and patrol boats to combat illegal fishing. Chinese aid may be linked to energy resource interests in Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste's decision to purchase patrol boats from China instead of joining Australia's program may be driven by a desire to balance their relationship with Australia and obtain energy resources."
