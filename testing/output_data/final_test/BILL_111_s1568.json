    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Museum of Industrial History Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that the economic transition of the United States from an agricultural age to an industrial age, and the ongoing shift to a postindustrial society, embody the spirit and ideals of the country. It is crucial for people to learn about the history and impact of industrialization, preserve this history for future generations, and protect key structures and artifacts related to the process. The former Bethlehem Steel Plant, proposed site of the National Museum of Industrial History, holds key structures and artifacts relevant to industrialization history. Operations began in the 1850s, with significant events like the first commercial zinc production in 1853 and the birth of the modern American defense industry in 1887. The Bethlehem Steel Plant played a crucial role in the birth of the modern American defense industry. It produced armor plate for battleships like the U.S.S. Maine and U.S.S. Texas, perfected high-speed tool steel, and was the first rolling mill in the U.S. to produce large wide-flange steel beams. The site also contains significant remains of bessemer steel production. The purpose of the Act is to establish an interpretive center and museum in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to protect historical resources. The purpose of the Act in Pennsylvania is to protect historical resources related to industrialization and interpret its impact on the history of the United States.
