    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hoh Indian Tribe Safe Homelands Act\". The Hoh Indian Reservation in Washington, homeland of the Hoh Indian Tribe, has been significantly impacted by storm surges, flooding, erosion, and lack of river dredging. 90% of the Reservation is in a flood zone and has flooded repeatedly in the last five years, while 100% is in a tsunami zone, making most of it unsuitable for safe occupation. The Hoh Indian Reservation in Washington has faced serious flood and wind damage, causing safety hazards. Federal agencies have limited authority to assist due to the dangerous location. The Tribe has purchased land to move infrastructure out of the flood zone. The State of Washington's Department of Natural Resources has transferred ownership of 160 acres of land to the Tribe. An approximately 37 acre parcel of logged land, administered by the National Park Service, lies between the current Reservation land and those lands acquired by the Tribe. Together, these lands would create a safe area for members of the Tribe to live and rebuild their community. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal land,\" \"Reservation,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Tribe.\" It involves the transfer of lands to be held in trust as part of the Tribe's Reservation. The Secretary will transfer all US rights to Federal land to the Tribe to be held in trust for their benefit and excluded from Olympic National Park. Non-Federal land owned by the Tribe will also be placed into trust. Land taken into trust will become part of the Reservation as described in the Hoh Indian Tribe Safe Homelands Act. The Hoh Tribe will receive non-Federal land and Federal land south of the Hoh River, to be administered by the National Park Service. A map of the land transfer will be available for public inspection. Congress intends for the condition and natural environment of the Federal land to be preserved and protected. The Hoh Tribe and the National Park Service will cooperate on issues related to the land transfer described in this Act. SEC. 5. Preservation of existing condition of federal land; terms of conservation and use in connection with land transfer. The Federal land transferred under section 4 has restrictions on use, including no commercial, residential, or industrial buildings, maintenance of existing roads, no logging or hunting, authorization for tribal ceremonial uses, and boundary survey by the Tribe. The Tribe will submit the survey to the National Park Service for review. Congress urges cooperative efforts between the Secretary, Tribe, and National Park Service for mutual aid agreements, cultural education opportunities, and development of a non-motorized trail. SEC. 6. All lands taken into trust by the United States under this Act shall be part of the Hoh Indian Reservation. SEC. 7. No land taken into trust for the Hoh Indian Tribe under this Act shall be considered Indian lands for the purpose of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act."
