    "content": "The Hatch Act applies to all federal employees in the executive branch, except the President and Vice President. Employees in law enforcement or national security agencies have more restrictive rules on political activities, while others have less restrictive rules since 1993. Certain prohibitions on political activities still apply to all federal employees in the executive branch. Despite certain prohibitions on political activities for federal employees in the executive branch, the Hatch Act prohibits them from running as candidates in partisan elections. This is outlined in Title 5 of the United States Code. The Hatch Act prohibits federal executive branch employees from running for any partisan political office, including federal, state, local, or county offices where candidates represent a political party whose presidential electors received votes in the last election. The definition of \"candidacy\" under the Hatch Act is not limited to formal announcements or filings for office but may include preliminary activities leading up to it. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in activities that can be seen as seeking support for or undertaking a candidacy, not just formal declarations or filings for office. Activities that can be seen as seeking support for or undertaking a candidacy, such as qualifying for nomination, soliciting contributions, canvassing for voter support, conducting polls, planning campaign logistics, circulating petitions, or consenting to such activities, would violate the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from seeking support for or undertaking a campaign for nomination or election to office. While running in a nonpartisan election is allowed, candidacy in a partisan election is prohibited. Independent candidacy by a federal employee in a partisan election is generally not allowed. In nonpartisan elections, candidates are not to run representing political parties, even if their names are listed without party designation. However, candidates could still be affiliated with parties or seek party endorsements, making the election partisan. This poses a problem for federal employees running in nonpartisan elections, as opponents may seek party endorsements. In nonpartisan elections, candidates may seek party endorsements, which could make the election partisan and raise concerns about the propriety of an employee's candidacy. State and local laws designate nonpartisan elections, but evidence of partisan politics in campaigns can rebut this presumption. For instance, soliciting party endorsements or using party resources can indicate partisan involvement. In nonpartisan elections, candidates seeking party endorsements or using party resources may indicate partisan involvement, rebutting the presumption of nonpartisanship. Contact the office if a Municipal Judge candidate becomes associated with a political party. The Hatch Act allows federal employees in certain areas to participate in local political activities, including running as independent candidates in partisan elections. The Office of Personnel Management regulations allow federal employees in certain exempted localities to run as independent candidates in partisan elections. They can also solicit political contributions but are prohibited from soliciting from subordinates or engaging in political activities while on duty. The candidacy and service must not interfere with their duties or create a conflict of interest. Most federal employees in the executive branch are allowed to hold and campaign for positions in political parties. The Hatch Act excludes candidacy for partisan political office but permits holding positions within a political party or affiliated organization. Federal employees can run for and hold political party positions according to Hatch Act regulations. An employee in the executive branch can participate in political organizations, hold positions within a political party, and run for party positions according to Hatch Act regulations. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel clarified that a USPS employee can be a candidate for a county elected position representing a political party, where only members of the same party can vote in the primary election. The Hatch Act allows federal employees to run for party positions within a political party, such as Committeeman or Committeewoman, as long as they do not solicit or accept political contributions. This includes refraining from listing their name on fundraising materials for the party or partisan candidates. Employees are prohibited by the Hatch Act from engaging in political activities while on duty or in federal buildings. They are also restricted from using government property for political campaigns, including office supplies and equipment. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities while on duty or in federal buildings, using government property for campaigns, and using official authority to influence elections. It also restricts solicitation of campaign contributions and support from subordinates or individuals seeking action from their agency. The Act addresses the permissibility of federal employees running for public office. The Hatch Act does not regulate federal employees holding state or local public offices, but may restrict them from running for re-election in partisan elections. The Hatch Act does not prohibit federal employees from holding outside elective office, but it does restrict candidacy for re-election in partisan elections if the employee continues to work for a federal agency. Holding outside positions in state, local, or county governments is governed by conflict of interest and conduct regulations enforced by each agency. The standards of ethical conduct for federal employees restrict outside compensation and positions if they create conflicts of interest with their governmental duties or are restricted by federal law. Each agency enforces its own conflict of interest regulations, with supplemental ethics regulations approved by the Office of Government Ethics. The Office of Government Ethics enforces supplemental agency regulations limiting outside employment and requiring prior approval for certain non-federal employment.
