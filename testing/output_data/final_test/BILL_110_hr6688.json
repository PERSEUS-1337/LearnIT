    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2008\". The Congress finds that reducing regulatory burden on depository institutions while maintaining the usefulness of reports to law enforcement efforts is appropriate. The Comptroller General's report suggests that increasing the use of exemption provisions for certain transactions could reduce reporting requirements without hindering law enforcement efforts. The Comptroller General recommends eliminating the requirement for depository institutions to file biennial renewals for Phase II customer exemptions to reduce the burden of unnecessary cash transaction reports. The Comptroller General suggests removing the biennial renewal requirement for Phase II exemptions for depository institutions, stating that cash transaction reports for government entities and depository institutions are unnecessary. The amendments to the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 exempted depository institutions from filing cash transaction reports for these entities. The Comptroller General recommends eliminating the requirement for depository institutions to file exemption forms and conduct annual reviews for government entities and depository institutions, as it discourages the use of exemptions and creates cash transaction reports of little value to law enforcement efforts. The Comptroller General suggests changing requirements for depository institutions to exempt clients with frequent cash transactions within a shorter time period than 12 months, to avoid unnecessary cash transaction reports. SEC. 3. EXCEPTION FROM CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORTS FOR SEASONED CUSTOMERS. Section 5313(e) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to exempt depository institutions from filing reports for transactions involving United States coins or currency with qualified customers. The Secretary of the Treasury will define the term \"qualified customer\" for this purpose. The term \"depository institution\" is defined by the Secretary of the Treasury to include entities incorporated or organized in the US or a State, with a deposit account for at least 2 months or engaged in multiple currency transactions subject to reporting requirements. Regulations will be set by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury will require depository institutions to file a one-time notice of exemption designation for each qualified customer, with regulations specifying the form, content, and timing of the notice. The Secretary has the authority to suspend, reject, or revoke any exemption notice. The Secretary may establish conditions for exempt qualified customers of merged or acquired depository institutions to remain designated exempt qualified customers of the surviving institution. SEC. 4. EXCEPTION FROM CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORTS FOR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. Upon enactment of the Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt depository institutions from reporting requirements for transactions with other depository institutions, government departments, agencies, and political subdivisions.

The Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2008 exempts certain entities from reporting requirements for transactions, including those listed on major stock exchanges. The Secretary of the Treasury publishes a list of exempt entities in the Federal Register. Depository institutions have the option to report transactions despite the exemption. The Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2008 allows institutions to report transactions that would otherwise be exempt without facing penalties. A technical amendment was made to the heading of subsection (f) of section 5313 of title, United States Code."
