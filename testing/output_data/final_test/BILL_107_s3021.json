    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex Expansion and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act. Congress recognizes the importance of the western basin of Lake Erie as the largest freshwater ecosystem in the world and vital to the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made over the past 30 years to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes, including a shift towards a holistic ecosystem approach. The western basin of Lake Erie is a crucial part of the Great Lakes ecosystem, receiving most of its flow from the Detroit River. It supports diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, with the coastal wetlands hosting the largest variety of species in the Great Lakes region. Lake Erie's moderate climate due to its southern latitude sets it apart from other Great Lakes. The shallow western basin of Lake Erie, from the Lower Detroit River to Sandusky Bay, is home to a variety of marshes and wetland habitats, including Mouille, Metzger, and Magee marshes, the Maumee Bay wetland complex, Locust Point, and Sandusky Bay. The larger islands in western Lake Erie also have wetlands in small embayments. Lake Erie's wetland in the western basin is crucial for various bird species during migration, nesting, and feeding. It serves as a significant stopover for diving ducks and sea ducks, with international importance recognized through designated wildlife refuges. Lake Erie's western basin is a hub for tourism, fishing, and boating, generating billions in retail sales and supporting thousands of jobs. The area is renowned for walleye fishing, with millions migrating to spawn, driving a significant sport fishing industry in Ohio. The coastal wetlands have faced pressure for 150 years, once part of a vast marsh and swamp system before 1850. The coastal wetlands in Lake Erie's western basin have significantly decreased in size over the years. Only approximately 5,000 hectares remain today, with a 62 percent reduction along the Michigan shoreline. The development of Monroe, Michigan, has had a notable impact on the wetlands, leaving only about 100 hectares unaltered. The quality of remaining dike wetlands along Lake Erie's shores has been degraded by various stressors, including excessive sediment and nutrient loadings, contaminants, shoreline modification, exotic species, and wetland diking. Protective peninsula beach systems like Bay Point and Woodtick near the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay have eroded over time, exacerbating shoreline erosion and impacting breeding grounds. The purpose of the legislation is to address the degradation of dike wetlands along Lake Erie's shores caused by various stressors. The Act aims to establish a national wildlife refuge complex in Ohio to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitats in the western basin, in partnership with various organizations and individuals dedicated to habitat conservation.

Establishment of a national wildlife refuge complex in Ohio, including Ottawa Refuge, West Sister Island Refuge, and Cedar Point Refuge. Expansion of Ottawa Refuge to include surrounding land and water in Ohio. The map of the Refuge Complex is available for inspection at the US Fish and Wildlife Service offices. The Secretary can revise boundaries to acquire property or implement the Act. The Secretary can acquire land, water, and interests within the boundaries through donation, purchase, or exchange, with consent required. The Secretary can acquire Federal property within the Refuge Complex without owner consent. Administrative jurisdiction over other agency properties can be transferred to the Secretary. A study of fish and wildlife habitat in dredge spoil disposal sites will be conducted by the Secretary. The Secretary will conduct a study on two specific areas within Toledo Harbor near the Maumee River and submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will expand the southern boundary of the International Refuge in Michigan to include additional land and water east of Interstate Route 75, from Sterling State Park to the Ohio State line. The Secretary will administer federally owned land within the Refuge Complex in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 and this Act, with additional authority for conservation and recreation. Opportunities for fish and wildlife-dependent recreation will be provided in accordance with priority uses. The Secretary will ensure that hunting, trapping, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education are priority public uses of the Refuge Complex. Cooperative agreements may be made with Ohio or Michigan for managing non-federal land within the complex. The Secretary will encourage Ohio to use the recreational trails program for funding trails within the Refuge Complex. Authorization of appropriations for land acquisition, study, and development within the Refuge Complex."
