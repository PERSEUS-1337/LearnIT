    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Freedom and Democracy Support Act\". The Government of Iran is actively developing nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, with a successful ballistic missile program. Recent revelations suggest Iran is close to manufacturing nuclear weapons, despite not having a democratic government, being ruled by an unelected \"Supreme Leader\" with veto power. The April 2003 Department of State report on terrorism highlights Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2002. Iran supports terrorist groups like Hizballah, HAMAS, and others. Human rights in Iran have not improved under pseudo-reformers, with torture, executions, and censorship still prevalent. The Iranian government is openly hostile towards the United States, but the people desire better relations. The people of Iran wish for improved relations with the United States and a democratically-elected, more secular government committed to protecting human rights. They also seek these changes through an internationally-monitored referendum. The United States supports transparent democracy in Iran, an internationally-monitored referendum for a peaceful change in government, freedom for the Iranian people, and the establishment of a free press and democratic society. The Broadcasting Board of Governors mandates Radio Farda to develop programming with input from Iranian-Americans and MEPI, focusing on democratic change in Iran, including a referendum. The MEPI and ECA will provide grants to translate and distribute materials on democracy, rule of law, and free market economics for the Iranian people. They will consult with Iranian-American opposition groups to select materials for translation into Persian. MEPI and ECA are authorized to award grants for the Iran Democracy Support Initiative. The MEPI and ECA are authorized to award grants for programs promoting a democratic referendum in Iran, including radio or television broadcasting and advocacy for an internationally-monitored referendum. Not less than 5 percent of funds for fiscal year 2004 will be allocated to this purpose. The International Broadcasting Operations account for fiscal year 2004 will be used to implement the provisions of this Act. Immediate cessation of Iranian goods importation to the US, unless specific conditions are met for resumption as outlined by the President. The Act allows for the transfer of funds from international financial institutions to the United States Agency for International Development for child survival and HIV/AIDS programs if assistance is provided to Iran. The World Bank Group is considered a single institution for this purpose, and the authority of this section ends upon the President's certification to Congress. SEC. 8. REPORTS ON AL QAEDA PRESENCE IN IRAN. The President must report to Congress on the presence of al Qaeda elements in Iran within 90 days of this Act and annually thereafter."
