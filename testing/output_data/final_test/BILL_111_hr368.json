The Secretary may conduct a Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program to protect important coastal and estuarine areas with significant conservation values. Grants will be provided to coastal states with approved plans for property acquisition. The Secretary may allocate funds to coastal states or National Estuarine Research Reserves through a competitive grant process to acquire property that aligns with Coastal Zone Management Plans, National Estuarine Research Reserve management plans, watershed protection plans, or State coastal land acquisition plans.

Participating states identify conservation needs, values to protect, and threats to avoid. States ensure property acquisition complements working waterfront needs. Applicants must identify values to protect. The applicant must identify values to be protected, management activities planned, and relevant information from the landowner. Awards are based on demonstrated need for protection and ability to leverage funds. The governor or designated lead agency determines application consistency. Priority for land projects is given to those with significant ecological value and that are under threat of degradation or conversion. Guidelines for project selection are developed by the government to ensure consistency with approved coastal zone plans. The Secretary consults with stakeholders to develop guidelines for land acquisition and conservation. Coastal states and reserves can allocate grants to local governments.
