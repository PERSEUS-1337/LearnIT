    "content": "The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to designate national monuments on federal lands with historic or scientific significance. The Act aims to protect these sites from theft and destruction. President Theodore Roosevelt used this authority to establish Devils Tower in Wyoming as the first national monument. Since then, 158 monuments have been created by 17 of the 20 Presidents since 1906. Presidents since 1906 have created 158 national monuments, including iconic sites like the Grand Canyon and Statue of Liberty. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used this authority 36 times, while President Obama proclaimed about 554 million acres as monuments. The establishment of national monuments under the Antiquities Act has been controversial, leading to lawsuits and proposals to limit presidential authority. Legislative proposals aim to limit the President's authority in establishing and modifying national monuments. Concerns include the size of areas, types of resources, inclusion of nonfederal lands, and restrictions on land uses. Advocates of the Antiquities Act support its current form, while critics highlight issues with the lack of state or congressional approval and inconsistency with other laws. Advocates strongly support the Antiquities Act, arguing that it is crucial for preserving federal lands and resources efficiently. They defend the President's authority to protect vulnerable resources from looting, vandalism, and development, citing public support for monument designations and court rulings upholding presidential actions. Litigation and legislation have been ongoing throughout the Act's history. Throughout history, litigation and legislation have been pursued regarding the Antiquities Act. For example, challenges to President Roosevelt's national monument proclamation in 1943 led to a law prohibiting future monuments in Wyoming without congressional approval. Similarly, President Carter's monuments in Alaska in 1978 resulted in a law requiring congressional approval for large land withdrawals. President Clinton's 1996 proclamation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument also sparked legal challenges and legislative actions. The Antiquities Act has been the subject of debate and litigation throughout history. Some controversial monuments have been redesignated as national parks by Congress and are now popular tourist destinations with economic benefits. Presidents Obama and Trump have issued monument proclamations, sparking ongoing debate among various groups. The Antiquities Act has sparked debate and litigation throughout history. Presidents Obama and Trump issued monument proclamations, leading to lawsuits challenging presidential authority. There have been legislative proposals to limit the President's authority in creating monuments. Scholars have different opinions on the extent of the President's authority in this area. No President has abolished a national monument, but they have modified them in the past. Since the Antiquities Act's inception, Presidents have adjusted national monuments by changing boundaries and terms of proclamations. Modifications have varied in size and conditions, with examples including enlarging Muir Woods National Monument and diminishing Mount Olympus National Monument. President Roosevelt, for instance, altered Katmai National Monument's reservations in 1936. President Trump also made changes to Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. President Obama's 2016 proclamation for the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument included detailed management provisions and regulated activities. Congress has the authority to create, modify, or abolish national monuments on federal lands, not limited by the Antiquities Act. This allows for the establishment of national monuments with different land uses than typical ones created by the President. Congress has the authority to create, modify, or abolish national monuments on federal lands, allowing for different land uses than typical presidential monuments. Monuments vary widely in size, ranging from less than 1 acre to about 283 million acres. Over the past century, large monuments have been created under the Antiquities Act, ranging from 1.1 million acres for Katmai in 1918 to nearly 11 million acres for Wrangell-St. Elias in 1978. President George W. Bush established marine monuments like Papahanaumokuakea with 89.5 million acres and the Marianas Trench with 60.9 million acres. President Obama expanded the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument in 2014 by 261.3 million acres and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in 2016 by 283.4 million acres. Critics argue that large monuments violate the Antiquities Act, as it was intended to protect specific items of interest on a smaller scale. They believe that some monument designations exceeded the intended size limits set by Congress. Defenders argue that the Antiquities Act allows the President discretion to determine the necessary size of monument designations to protect resources, citing the example of the Grand Canyon. They point out that Congress rejected proposals to restrict the President's authority in setting the size of withdrawals, emphasizing that preserving objects of interest may require sizable areas. Preserving objects of interest may require withdrawing sizeable tracts of land to protect their integrity and relationships. The Antiquities Act allows the President to establish monuments on federal land with historic or scientific significance. Some proclamations identify specific objects needing protection, while others mention scenic, scientific, or educational features. Presidents may establish monuments citing threats to resources, although imminent threat is not required by the Act. President Clinton expressed concern about a coal mining operation while designating the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The Clinton Administration expressed concern about potential damage to resources from a large coal mining operation. Threats to lands in the Grand Canyon-Parashant Monument were also noted, with worries about potential mineral development. The National Trust for Historic Preservation identified the President Lincoln and Soldiers' Home National Monument as endangered. Critics are troubled by presidential monument designations without immediate resource threats, believing they are used to support environmental causes and limit development. Presidents have established monuments for various reasons, including environmental causes and political gains. Critics argue that the Antiquities Act is being used for broad purposes beyond its original intent of protecting specific objects. Supporters believe the act is necessary to combat development, looting, and vandalism. The Antiquities Act grants the President broad discretion to protect objects of historic or scientific interest, including privately owned lands that can be relinquished to the Federal Government for preservation. Land donation has been used for both early and recent presidential proclamations of national monuments. President's broad discretion to protect historic or scientific objects, including privately owned lands for preservation, has been demonstrated through early and recent presidential proclamations of national monuments. It is uncertain if nonfederal lands must be voluntarily relinquished or if the President can convert private property to federal property through condemnation when establishing a monument. No presidential declaration has converted private property to federal property yet. Private or nonfederal lands may be within the boundaries of proclaimed monuments. The ownership of nonfederal lands within proclaimed monuments does not change, but their inclusion can be controversial. The Antiquities Act applies only to federal lands, and monument designations cannot bring state or private lands into federal ownership. Some monument proclamations state that nonfederal lands will become part of the monument if acquired by the federal government. Monument supporters note that state or private landowners within a monument can pursue land exchanges with the federal government if they fear difficulties. Some monument proclamations have authorized land exchanges to further protective purposes. Monuments are typically managed by the National Park Service, but Congress and the President have created monuments managed by other agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service. President Obama established the Chimney Rock National Monument with the Forest Service as the managing agency in 2012. Monuments created in recent decades are usually managed by the agency responsible for the area before designation. The President's authority to choose a management agency other than the National Park Service has been questioned. Before 1933, national monuments were managed by different agencies, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt consolidated management in the NPS. In 1978, President Carter directed two Alaska monuments to be managed by the Forest Service and two by FWS, sparking controversy over agency management. Critics argue that assigning management to agencies other than the NPS is illegal, while others believe the President has discretion under the Antiquities Act. Some assert that establishing new monuments under different agencies does not constitute a reorganization of NPS functions. The President may have the authority to move NPS functions to other DOI agencies, as long as it is within congressionally approved authority. The main goal for monument management is to protect the objects described in the proclamations, allowing existing land uses that do not conflict with the monument's purpose to continue. Monument designation can restrict certain land uses, such as development or recreational activities. The declaration of national monuments can change federal land use, potentially restricting certain activities like mineral exploration and extraction. Concerns include the impact on existing rights and the cost of adhering to higher environmental standards. National monument designations may require a higher environmental review standard and increased mitigation costs. Proclamations typically prohibit new mineral leases, mining activities, and oil and gas leases. Concerns also arise regarding restrictions on commercial timber cutting in designated areas. Restrictions on timber cutting in national monuments are often implied to protect environmental, scenic, and recreational attributes. Supporters of logging argue for sustainable forest use, citing modern forestry practices. Proclamations for post-1996 monuments prohibit off-road motorized and mechanized vehicles, except for emergencies. Management plans for monuments address vehicular travel allowances on designated routes or areas. Some concerns raised about monument designations include impacts on hunting, fishing, and grazing activities. Restrictions on these activities may be imposed to protect monument resources, with some marine monuments prohibiting fishing. Controversy surrounds grazing provisions, with debates over whether it has been unnecessarily limited or not restricted enough for ecological preservation. President Obama's marine national monument expansions have heightened focus on fishing effects. Some argue that restrictions on federal lands for monument designations could harm economic development, while others believe the benefits of increased tourism and environmental protection outweigh any temporary economic gains. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to make land withdrawals under specified procedures, repealing previous withdrawal authority granted to the President. Critics argue that the Antiquities Act conflicts with FLPMA by giving executive power over land withdrawals, which should be Congress's responsibility. Despite extensive consideration, the Antiquities Act was not explicitly amended or repealed by the 94th Congress when enacting FLPMA. Supporters of the Antiquities Act argue that Congress intended to retain presidential withdrawal authority, while critics point out that monuments have been proclaimed without required environmental studies. Some suggest adding procedures for environmental review and public participation to the monument designation process to ensure significant withdrawals are based on scientific evaluation and economic considerations. President Obama designated 29 new national monuments in 17 states, the District of Columbia, and the Atlantic Ocean, ranging in size from 0.12 acres to 1.6 million acres. He also enlarged five monuments in California and Oregon, including marine areas off the California Coast and in the Atlantic Ocean. Critics argue that changes to the Antiquities Act should require scientific evaluation, economic information, and public input, while supporters believe consultation with government officials and the public suffices before establishing monuments. President Obama designated 29 new national monuments in 17 states, the District of Columbia, and the Atlantic Ocean, ranging in size from 0.12 acres to 1.6 million acres. Enlargements ranged from 1,665 acres to 283.4 million acres. The Obama Administration cited support for monument establishment from various stakeholders, including government officials, businesses, and local communities. Some areas designated as monuments were first proposed for protective designation in legislation. Opposition to monuments centered on concerns about the consultation process with Congress, local and state governments, and residents. President Trump proclaimed one new monument in Kentucky\u2014Camp Nelson\u2014with 380 acres, and reduced and modified two monuments in Utah. The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was reduced by about one million acres (47%), and the Bears Ears National Monument was reduced by about 1.15 million acres (85%). These actions followed a 2017 review of certain national monuments by the Secretary of the Interior, at the direction of the President. The final report recommended evaluating Camp Nelson and two other areas for national monument designation, along with boundary changes and modifications to Utah monuments. Recent Congresses have considered bills to restrict presidential authority in establishing monuments under the Antiquities Act. Recent Congresses have considered bills to restrict presidential authority in establishing monuments under the Antiquities Act, including measures to narrow the types of resources protected, ban nonfederal land inclusion, and promote public participation in the designation process. Other proposed measures aimed to change land uses, impose conditions on agency restrictions, address water use, and alter monument boundaries. Opposition to such legislation has been noted among some Members and the public. Some supporters have introduced legislation to prevent the President from reducing or abolishing national monuments, while other bills aim to increase funding for presidentially proclaimed monuments and dedicate funds for management plans and recreational infrastructure. President Obama designated 34 monument proclamations under the Antiquities Act, including Fort Monroe National Monument in Virginia in 2011. Several national monuments were designated by President Obama, including Fort Monroe in Virginia in 2011, Fort Ord in California in 2012, Chimney Rock in Colorado in 2012, and C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez in California in 2012. These monuments were established to preserve historical and cultural significance, attract tourists, and honor significant contributions to the history of the United States. President Obama designated several national monuments, including First State National Monument in Delaware and Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio on March 25, 2013.
