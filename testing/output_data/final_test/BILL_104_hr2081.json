    "content": "The Act titled \"Revised Statutes 2477 Rights-of-Way Settlement Act\" requires notice of rights-of-way across public lands granted under Revised Statutes Section 2477. The \"Revised Statutes 2477 Rights-of-Way Settlement Act\" allows for the filing of a notice of right-of-way across public lands granted under Section 2477 before 1976. The notice must be filed within 10 years of the Act's enactment, identifying the route and scope of the right-of-way. The Secretary will recognize or object to the right-of-way. The Secretary will notify the holder of the recognition or objections to the right-of-way within two years of filing. The Secretary will recognize any right-of-way established according to state laws or by an affirmative act of a state. If accepted, section 4 provisions will apply. If the Secretary objects to the right-of-way, they must specify their objections within two years. If no objections are raised, the right-of-way will be considered valid as originally presented. SEC. 3. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Quiet Title Action Relating to Objections: The Secretary may bring an action in court within two years of notifying a holder of objections to a right-of-way. The burden of proof lies with the United States to prove the validity of the right-of-way, including that it was not a public right-of-way or accepted according to state laws. The Secretary has two years to bring an action challenging a right-of-way, failing which it will be deemed valid. Only parties with a property interest in the right-of-way or served lands have standing to challenge the Secretary's actions regarding the right-of-way. The Secretary must record and manage accepted right-of-ways, while only parties with a property interest can challenge the Secretary's actions. Quiet Title Action: The holder of a right-of-way described in section 2 can bring an action at any time to quiet title under section 2409a of title 28, United States Code. This action must be brought within 12 years from the date of notice of objection from the Secretary or the termination of the limitations period. Relinquishment of a right-of-way granted under section 2477 of the Revised Statutes is not required, and failure to file the notice does not constitute relinquishment. The Act does not relinquish any right-of-way granted under section 2(a). State law determines the validity of rights-of-way, and NEPA does not apply to actions under this Act. The Secretary cannot close any right-of-way granted under section 2477 of the Revised Statutes. The Secretary can close a right-of-way granted under section 2477 of the Revised Statutes if notice is provided to the State and any political subdivision with jurisdiction over highways in that location. Closure cannot leave adjoining non-Federal lands without established access."
