    "content": "The federal government established a defense surplus program after World War II to dispose of surplus military equipment by making it available to civilians. This program allowed the public to purchase military goods, supplies, and scrap metal. Some equipment is used for historical collections, military exhibitions, and war reenactments. Before release, military equipment must meet demilitarization standards set by the Department of Defense, which involves destroying its military capability through processes like scrapping, melting, or alteration. Demilitarization involves scrapping, melting, or altering military equipment to prevent its further use for military purposes. It applies to both serviceable and unserviceable equipment, and once demilitarized, the equipment may be rendered inoperable. Issues with demilitarization enforcement have led to sensitive Air Force parts ending up in unauthorized auctions. This report examines the challenges associated with demilitarizing significant military equipment in the United States. The demilitarization of military equipment is crucial to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The process is overseen by the DOD through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS). Prior to 1972, each military branch had its own surplus equipment program. DRMS was established in 1972 to address issues with the defense surplus equipment program. It is headquartered in Battle Creek, Michigan, with offices in 37 states and 14 countries. In FY2005, DRMS processed 3.4 million line items worth over $20 billion. The DOD disposes of approximately $20 billion worth of excess and surplus property annually through DRMS. DRMS handles excess defense property, redistributing within DOD or to other federal agencies. Surplus items are donated to state/local governments or sold to the public. Less than 1% of weapons/equipment are transferred within DOD, 50% for foreign military sales, and 50% for provisional transfer/sale. When surplus and excess items requiring demilitarization are transferred to qualified individuals or groups, a provisional title transfer is granted, prohibiting them from selling or leasing the items to unauthorized parties. Property released through public sale is not considered sold until demilitarization is completed, as it is a condition of sale. If demilitarization is not done, the Department of Defense maintains that there is no sale. The Department of Defense (DOD) maintains that private owners cannot pass on ownership of DOD equipment without completing demilitarization. Each item is assigned a demilitarization code by the military services, determining if it contains military technology and what must be done before selling to the public. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) can challenge codes, but each service has final authority. Codes are reviewed every 5 years. Demilitarization codes are assigned to items before they are sold to the public, with nine categories based on USMLI or CCLI. Items coded with \"A\" require no demilitarization, while those with \"D\" need total destruction. Demilitarization rules vary by organization, with museums previously allowed to receive operational tanks. DOD is aware of museums with operational tanks but rendered guns inoperable. During the 109th Congress, hearings and investigations were conducted to address issues in the DOD surplus property system. A new investigation found ongoing problems, including the sale and donation of sensitive military equipment to the public. The Government Accountability Office reported that from FY2002 to FY2004, DOD disposed of $33 billion in excess property, with $4 billion in new or unused condition. Only 12% of this property was used within DOD, while the rest was transferred, donated, sold, or destroyed. During the probe into DOD's inventory control process, GAO staff purchased sensitive military equipment items improperly sold to the public. DOD continued purchasing the same items. DLA Director of Logistics Operations discussed efforts to improve surplus military equipment management, focusing on processing controls, inventory asset access, and reducing concurrent procurement. Congress had directed DOD to submit a plan to address these issues. During the 106th Congress, DOD was directed to address problems with surplus defense materials disposal. Senator Grassley highlighted the ongoing issue of lax disposal practices dating back to the 1970s. The Pentagon's current approach involves selling surplus parts with minimal oversight. The Pentagon sells military surplus on a worldwide web homepage, some of it classified, creating a potential market for terrorists. Despite decades of oversight, little has changed, prompting a call for Congress to take action to enhance law enforcement's ability to catch arms smugglers targeting military surplus. Senator Grassley has called for an investigation into the disposal of government surplus. Oversight and the Courts called for an investigation into the disposition of government surplus items due to \"unacceptably loose\" disposal procedures. Witnesses Dave Barrington and Jack Blackway testified to program deficiencies, including lack of resources and staff, with Mr. Blackway stating that current resources were insufficient for demilitarization program responsibilities. Senator Grassley highlighted these concerns before the hearing. The 1996 media investigations by 60 Minutes and U.S. News uncovered significant problems in the military surplus weapons program, leading to a congressional investigation and hearings in 1997. The investigation revealed deficiencies in weapon coding, lack of resources, and staff shortages in the demilitarization program. The investigation found that DOD incorrectly coded weapon components in the military equipment inventory, leading to mislabeling of parts sold at auctions. Scrap metal dealers bought these parts cheaply, some containing valuable metals or functioning pieces from sophisticated weapons systems. The investigation revealed that DOD released military weapon components, including parts from Cobra attack helicopters and a HAWK missile guidance component, through auctions. The program lacked effective staffing, supervision, and controls, leading to the sale of sensitive items to buyers unaware of their nature. The DOD program lacked proper training and controls, leading to the sale of military surplus equipment in good condition instead of being destroyed. This included Cobra helicopter parts being sold and two fully functioning Cobra helicopters being built and sold. As a result of hearings, the DOD designated a new staff position for the Trade Security Controls Office. Despite the addition of a new staff position, the demilitarization policy and procedures remain largely unchanged. Many problems identified in congressional hearings in 1972 and 1997 still exist today. Prior to 2006, GAO conducted investigations into the DOD Surplus and Excess Property Program, identifying it as a \"high risk\" program due to potential waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Senate and House committees supported GAO's efforts, leading to investigations into various aspects of surplus property program management. Section 8016 of the FY2007 DOD Appropriations Act prohibits the use of DOD funds for demilitarizing certain firearms and Section 8069 restricts the transfer of specific ammunition types. Bills introduced during the 107th Congress aimed to change DOD demilitarization policy. Bills introduced during the 107th Congress aimed to change DOD demilitarization policy by requiring the demilitarization of surplus firearms and restricting the transfer of certain armor-piercing ammunition. Congress directed DOD to draft proposed legislation clarifying the federal government's authority to recover significant military equipment. The federal government sought to recover military equipment without proper demilitarization. Section 1062 aimed to establish standards for demilitarization, define classes of equipment needing demilitarization, ensure public safety, shift ownership burden, and provide compensation. The Senate Armed Services Committee made changes to the legislative proposal on demilitarization of military equipment. The Defense Science Board Task Force identified sources of leaks and found privately-owned museums as a significant source. No single agency had the lead authority, resulting in overlaps and gaps in control. The Defense Science Board Task Force found overlaps and gaps in control of military equipment, leading to resource-dependent law enforcement efforts. DOD officials and public interest groups have contrasting views on demilitarization policies, with DOD seeking tighter control over military equipment. The DOD Demilitarization Program Manager (DDPM) lacks authority, staff, and resources to implement a full-scale demilitarization program. Three staff members and eleven criminal investigators are responsible for demilitarization and trade security control policy. Investigations into the release of DOD property have been largely unsuccessful due to the sheer volume of materials received. The Department of Defense (DOD) has had difficulties in recovering its property, with unsuccessful attempts to refer cases to the Department of Justice. DOD lacks knowledge of the whereabouts of military equipment loaned to museums, leading to instances where museums have moved, traded, or sold property without permission. DOD maintains ownership of equipment loaned to private museums, with no clear title given to the museums. Issues also arise from different agency authorities for demilitarization policies. The responsibilities for surplus weapons program and demilitarization of military equipment are dispersed among various government agencies, leading to jurisdictional problems. Different agencies such as GSA, Departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice, State, and Treasury have separate rules for disposal of demilitarized property. The State Department handles significant military equipment listed on the USML, while the Department of Commerce deals with items on the CCLI. DOD surplus disposal falls under the DOD Trade Security Controls Office, which has limited authority for demilitarization. The Task Force found that DOD had improved control over surplus and donations, but GSA's management guidelines needed significant enhancement. Some groups, including veterans and military enthusiasts, opposed Section 1062, fearing DOD could confiscate items and reimburse owners for demilitarization costs. The DOD found demilitarization costs prohibitive under Section 1062, which required a new policy and public notification. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association opposed Section 1062 due to concerns about broad definitions of \"significant military equipment\" potentially leading to unnecessary destruction of military aircraft. Mr. Boyer proposed drafting alternative legislation to narrow the scope of Section 1062, emphasizing that some well-maintained aircraft serve useful purposes. AOPA and EAA highlighted the importance of historical aircraft at air shows to inspire youth to pursue aviation careers. EAA expressed concerns about the broad and ambiguous terms related to demilitarization, stating that war birds pose no threat and showcase our history. Several policy options are available to Congress to reexamine the current United States demilitarization policy, including selective exemption, appointing one agency as Executive Program Agent, convening an independent panel, conducting hearings, or taking no action. Congress may introduce revised legislation to exempt certain types of military equipment from the demilitarization process, set a specific time frame for DOD to develop regulatory policy, or give one federal agency statutory authority for demilitarization. Some argue that the Department of Homeland Security should be in charge of demilitarization policies to avoid conflicts among federal agencies. This could help establish a clear federal policy and prevent overlapping with DOD's policies. Congress may need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of federal agencies regarding demilitarization policies. An independent panel could be convened to study the issue and develop future policy. However, the conclusions of such panels may not always have popular support. Congress may want to reexamine the final report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on the Control of Military Excess and Surplus Materiel and hear testimony from panel members and demilitarization experts. Conducting hearings can provide new information and insights on unintended consequences of actions Congress may consider. Taking no action may preserve citizens' rights and avoid conflicts with veterans groups. Taking no action against the use of undemilitarized equipment, formerly owned by DOD, may be challenging to support if it is used offensively against the United States, especially considering the strong political support from veterans groups."
