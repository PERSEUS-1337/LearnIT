The funds will supplement the support or capital outlay budget of the California State University as designated by the trustees.

These funds are appropriated for the operation and development of such projects without regard to fiscal year. The trustees have the authority to establish rules for the California State University Special Projects Fund, including reimbursements to the General Fund for space and services. Expenditures must follow the rules without prior approval, and investments can only be made in eligible securities. The trustees of the California State University have the authority to invest in eligible securities listed in Section 16430 of the Government Code or in mutual funds subject to regulatory authority.

A committee with investment expertise, excluding trustees or university employees, oversees investments not listed in Section 16430. The total amount invested in non-listed securities is capped at specific amounts for each fiscal year. The trustees of the California State University receive quarterly investment performance reports and distribute an annual report to the Legislature and Department of Finance. Reports include investment returns, benchmarks, holdings, market values, and fees. Additional earnings from investments not listed in Section 16430 of the Government Code must be used for capital outlay or maintenance. Trustees cannot request funds to compensate for investment losses in non-listed securities. The trustees of the California State University cannot use investment losses from non-listed securities to justify raising student tuition or fees."
