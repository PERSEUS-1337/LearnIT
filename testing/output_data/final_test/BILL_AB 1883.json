    "title": "AB 1883",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 7 establishes the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program as a pilot program in up to three counties, providing prevention and intervention services through public or private nonprofit programs. Each county selected will receive $50,000 annually from the General Fund for this program. The State Department of Social Services will choose counties based on their notification of participation. The counties selected to participate in the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program will be determined based on specific criteria: significant incidences of child sexual abuse or exploitation, identification of a qualified organization to administer the program, and priority given to counties with school districts utilizing federal grants for training on preventing child sexual abuse. Each participating county is encouraged to prioritize programs serving at-risk children meeting specific criteria and demonstrating effectiveness in child sexual abuse or commercial sexual exploitation prevention. The funds allocated should not replace existing funding but rather supplement expansion of current programs or collaboration between separate programs, or fund new programs if none currently exist to serve children at risk. The county board of supervisors in a participating county allocates pilot program funds according to specific provisions. Public or private nonprofit agencies can receive funding if they provide unique services for at-risk children supported by local public agencies. The administering local agency, in collaboration with the county board of supervisors, integrates the pilot program into county improvement plans and reports annually on public awareness of child sexual abuse prevention techniques. The pilot program integrates child sexual abuse prevention techniques into county improvement plans and reports annually on public awareness. It includes distributing educational materials, tracking reports of abuse, and identifying best practices for replication. The article expires on January 1, 2020, unless extended or deleted by a later statute."
