    "content": "The Act titled \"Freedom to Serve Without Fear Act of 2011\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress recognizes the importance of citizens' right to assemble and petition their government. Fear of gun violence at events with elected representatives hinders meaningful engagement and reduces personal contact with constituents. During the summer of 2009, there were multiple cases of individuals carrying firearms near venues where the President of the United States was present. This included incidents of a man carrying an AR-15 rifle and a sidearm, as well as another man breaching security with an unlicensed loaded handgun. Threats against Members of Congress have also increased threefold in recent months. The number of reported threats against Members of the United States House of Representatives and Members of the United States Senate has increased. Prohibition on knowingly possessing a firearm near a venue where a member of Congress is performing official duties or campaigning for public office. Prohibition on carrying a firearm near a building where a Member of Congress is performing official duties or campaigning for public office. Prohibition on carrying a firearm near a building where a Member of Congress is present for official duties or campaigning, unless authorized by law enforcement or with written permission from a Member of Congress. The subsection outlines where a firearm can be carried, including with permission from a Member of Congress, on carrier's property, at the carrier's workplace with employer authorization, or in a locked container. Federal jurisdiction suspends state or local authority in case of a violation. The subsection specifies where firearms can be carried, with exceptions for certain locations and permissions required. Violations will be investigated by the FBI, with assistance from other agencies if needed. Penalties for knowingly violating the section include fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. SEC. 4. Encouraging states to adopt firearms prohibitions similar to federal law to protect state and local elected and appointed officials. The Act requires states receiving funds for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to have laws prohibiting possession of firearms near officials. States must comply within one year of the Act's enactment. The Attorney General may grant an additional year for states making good faith efforts to comply with the Act's requirements. Non-compliant states will lose 10% of funds allocated for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program after the specified period. Compliance with the Act may be waived if it would be unconstitutional for a state to do so. (c) Reallocation of funds not allocated to a State under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program for non-compliance will be redistributed to States that have complied with the requirements."
