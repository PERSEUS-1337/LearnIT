    "content": "The prevention of suicide can be approached in two ways: the public health approach focuses on populations by distributing educational materials, while the clinical approach targets individuals by prescribing medication. The public health approach is essential to reach all veterans, including those not in contact with the healthcare system. Both the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the VHA's approach are based on a public health framework with components like surveillance and risk assessment. The framework in Figure 1 consists of three components: surveillance, risk and protective factors, and prevention interventions. Suicide surveillance involves collecting data on completed suicides to define the problem scope, identify risk and protective factors. Prevention interventions aim to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors, targeting high-risk groups or individuals. Nationwide surveillance for suicide among all veterans is lacking, essential for defining the problem scope and identifying associated characteristics. The VHA collects detailed information about veteran suicides through the Behavioral Health Autopsy Program (BHAP) in four phases, including standardized chart reviews and interviews with family members. Phases three and four involve interviewing the last clinician and locating public records for stressors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found issues with the Behavioral Health Autopsy Program (BHAP) reports, including inaccuracies and incompleteness. VHA facilities had varying interpretations of BHAP instructions, and no officials were reviewing the reports for accuracy. Resolving these issues would improve suicide information for veterans known to VHA facilities, but not for all veterans. The VA lacks records for all veterans, as not all are enrolled in VHA health care. The VA is working with the DOD to identify suicides among all veterans, including those not enrolled in VHA health care. Death certificates collected by state governments may not provide comparable data on intentional self-harm. The lag in identifying veterans in suicide events delays crucial information availability. Timely reporting of death certificates is crucial for suicide prevention efforts. The VHA conducts veteran-specific research to identify risk and protective factors for suicide prevention. This information helps in designing effective interventions and targeting at-risk groups. The CDC, NIMH, and SAMHSA also disseminate research on suicide risk factors in the general population. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) collects data on suicide attempts and related behavior, noting that risk factors for attempted suicide may differ from completed suicide. Despite numerous identified risk and protective factors, predicting who will attempt or complete suicide remains challenging. A public health approach focusing on population-level interventions is crucial for effective suicide prevention, especially for the veteran population, which differs from the non-veteran population on various characteristics. Research on suicide risk and protective factors in veterans is supported by the Office of Research and Development (ORD), a Center of Excellence (COE) in suicide prevention, and a Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) on suicide prevention within the VHA. The ORD funds intramural research by VHA investigators, focusing on factors related to suicide risk and protective factors. The VHA supports research on suicide risk factors and protective factors among veterans. Studies have been conducted to identify high-risk individuals and develop targeted interventions. The COE at Canandaigua, NY, focuses on evidence-based approaches to prevent veteran suicide and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. The Epidemiology and Interventions Research Core within the COE and the MIRECCs conduct research on suicide risk and protective factors among veterans, aiming to reduce suicidality in the veteran population through various studies, including the relationship between suicidal ideation and thinking under stress. Suicide prevention interventions aim to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors to lower the risk of suicide among veterans. Interventions are developed, tested on a small scale, implemented on a larger scale, and evaluated for effectiveness. The VHA conducts research to evaluate suicide prevention interventions, including testing on small and large scales. Access to care is a protective factor, and recent laws aim to increase veterans' access to VHA care. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 aims to increase access to care by authorizing reimbursement for non-VHA care. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act includes an extension of enhanced enrollment in VHA health care for certain veterans. VHA policy ensures 24-hour availability of emergency mental health care and timely assessments and evaluations for new patients. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policy ensures 24-hour availability of emergency mental health care and timely assessments and evaluations for new patients. Efforts to increase access to mental health care focus on addressing barriers such as lack of awareness, stigma, concerns about VHA care, and scheduling challenges. The VHA provides information to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and correct misconceptions about mental health care services. Some services have been integrated into other treatment settings to increase convenience and reduce stigma. The VHA conducts a pilot program to assist discharged veterans in accessing mental health services, including screenings for risk factors like depression and PTSD. The USPSTF recommends depression screening in primary care settings with proper systems in place for diagnosis and follow-up care. The VHA conducts screenings for risk factors like depression, PTSD, and alcohol abuse, offering further evaluation and treatment for those who screen positive. Clinical interventions such as pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are recommended for individuals with mental illness, with evidence-based treatments outlined in clinical practice guidelines developed by the VA and DOD. Treatment in the VHA is generally better than in other systems but still has room for improvement. The evaluation of the VHA's mental health care system found that evidence-based treatments are not consistently provided, prescriptions are often not filled as recommended, and psychotherapy is not always delivered according to guidelines. Assessment of veterans' symptoms is lacking, and third-party evaluations are now required annually. Each VA Medical Center has a suicide prevention coordinator as per department policy. The VHA has a suicide prevention coordinator responsible for tracking high-risk patients and developing safety plans. This program is recognized as valuable by a DOD task force on suicide prevention. Suicide hotlines are available for crisis situations. The Veterans Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255) is a toll-free hotline available 24/7 for individuals in crisis, including those considering suicide. Callers can remain anonymous or disclose their identities to access VA medical records. The hotline also offers online chat and text messaging support. Since 2007, it has answered nearly 2 million calls and engaged in over 250,000 chats. The Veterans Crisis Line, established in 2007, has responded to over 250,000 chats and 44,000 texts. However, the effectiveness of suicide hotlines in reducing suicide rates is difficult to determine due to confidentiality issues and other interventions in localities. In February 2016, the VA Office of Inspector General conducted an inspection in response to complaints about the Veterans Crisis Line. The VA Office of Inspector General conducted an inspection in response to complaints about the Veterans Crisis Line. Some calls routed to backup crisis centers were answered by voicemail. The routing of calls is handled by a contractor, Link2Health Solutions, Inc. The VHA offers suicide prevention education and outreach to staff, patients, and communities. All VHA health care providers must complete web-based training on suicide risk and intervention. The VHA conducts outreach activities in local communities and sponsors conferences on suicide prevention. Firearms, suffocation, and poisoning are the most common means of suicide. Restricting access to lethal means can help reduce suicide rates. The VHA has a gun safety program and distributes free gun locks to prevent suicide attempts. The VHA conducts research on blister packaging medications to reduce medication overdoses and has received praise and criticism for its suicide prevention efforts and mental health services. Praise includes being a vibrant force in the U.S. suicide prevention movement, while criticism cites barriers to accessing care and lack of evidence-based treatments. The evaluation of VHA mental health services in 2011 found that while VHA care is generally as good as other systems, it often falls short of VA expectations. Recommendations for Congress and outside organizations focus on improving suicide surveillance data timeliness, building evidence, and increasing access to evidence-based care. Challenges include data timeliness, consistent suicide classification, and accuracy, requiring involvement beyond VHA. Recommendations include ensuring CDC's ability to compile death data promptly. The CDC's ability to compile national death data efficiently is crucial for suicide surveillance efforts. Inconsistent reporting and underreporting of suicides limit the effectiveness of surveillance. Determining intent for classifying a death as suicide is challenging, leading to potential underreporting due to stigma. Incentivizing timely data sharing from states may be more effective than imposing requirements. The GAO recommends that the VA improve data reporting in the Behavioral Health Autopsy Program system to accurately identify veteran suicides. Collaboration and information sharing across public health sectors are essential for developing effective interventions. Increased collaboration and dialogue between suicide prevention and other areas of public health can prevent duplication of effort and help build the evidence base more quickly. This will ensure that limited funds are used more effectively to make a sustainable difference in preventing suicide. Recommendations for preventing veteran suicide include sharing research findings among VA, DOD, and HHS, fast-tracking intervention cycles, and initiating discussions between House and Senate Committees. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 aims to improve access to mental health care for veterans. The Veterans Choice Program under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 allows reimbursement for non-VHA care if a veteran cannot schedule an appointment within 30 days. The VA Office of Inspector General identified shortages in medical officer, nurse, physician assistant, physical therapist, and psychologist positions affecting access to mental health care. The OIG report highlights shortages in various healthcare provider positions, including psychologists. The VHA has mechanisms in place to improve recruitment and retention, such as educational debt repayment programs. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act aims to expand access to care through various initiatives, including pilot programs and collaboration with nonprofit mental health organizations. The VHA has made progress in disseminating knowledge about evidence-based treatment, but implementation is not guaranteed. Evaluations of VHA mental health care show room for improvement, with only 13% of mental health providers meeting criteria for high-quality care. Independent evaluations of VHA mental health care and suicide prevention programs are required annually. The VHA has made progress in disseminating knowledge about evidence-based treatment, but implementation is not guaranteed. Providers working within the VHA or a military setting were more likely to meet criteria for veteran-friendly care. Recommendations include better assessments of civilian provider capacity, expanding access to trainings in evidence-based approaches, and facilitating providers' use of these approaches. Five public laws have addressed VHA suicide prevention efforts since Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom began. The Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act required the VA Secretary to develop a comprehensive suicide prevention program. The Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act directed the VA to implement a comprehensive suicide prevention program with little to no cost. National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 required the VA and DOD Secretaries to develop a care and transition policy for servicemembers recovering from military-related injuries. The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 grants the VA Secretary authority to advertise for suicide prevention, including promoting the Veterans Crisis Line through various media channels. The VA Secretary has the authority to advertise for suicide prevention, including promoting the Veterans Crisis Line through various media channels. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 requires a study to determine the total number of veteran suicides between 1999 and 2010, with an ongoing State Mortality Data Project to track this information. An update in 2014 included data on suicides among veterans not using VA health care services in 23 states, but a full nationwide accounting is still pending. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act (P.L. 114-2) was enacted on February 12, 2015. It includes sections such as annual evaluations of VHA mental health care programs, maintaining a website with mental health care information, and a pilot program to repay education loans for psychiatrists in exchange for service. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act (P.L. 114-2) includes provisions such as a three-year pilot program for community outreach, collaboration with mental health organizations, extension of post-discharge enrollment in VHA health care, and a cost estimate of $24 million over six years."
