    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cottonwood Land Exchange Act of 2016\" and includes definitions for key terms. SEC. 2 of the \"Cottonwood Land Exchange Act of 2016\" defines key terms such as County, Federal land, Map, Non-federal land, and Secretary. SEC. 3 of the \"Cottonwood Land Exchange Act of 2016\" outlines the process for a land exchange between the County and the Secretary, with the County offering non-Federal land in exchange for Federal land. The County is responsible for all costs associated with the exchange, including surveys and appraisals. The values of lands exchanged under the Act will be determined by the Secretary through appraisals following specific standards. The Federal and non-Federal land parcels exchanged must have equal values, or a cash equalization payment will be made to achieve equality. The Secretary will receive cash equalization moneys to achieve equal land values, which will be deposited in a fund and used for land acquisition in Region 3 of the Forest Service. If the non-Federal land value exceeds the Federal land value, the United States will receive the surplus. The United States will not make a cash equalization payment to the County if the appraised value of the Federal land is higher, and any surplus value of the non-Federal land will be considered a donation by the County to the United States. SEC. 5. Lands acquired by the Secretary under this Act shall be permanently withdrawn from all forms of appropriation and disposal under public land laws. SEC. 6. Acquired land will become part of Coconino National Forest and managed according to National Forest System laws. SEC. 7. Maps, estimates, and descriptions will be provided. SEC. 7. Maps, estimates, and descriptions can be adjusted for minor errors by mutual agreement. Conflicts between maps, estimates, or descriptions will be resolved with the map controlling unless otherwise agreed. The Secretary will make all maps available for public inspection at the Coconino National Forest headquarters."
