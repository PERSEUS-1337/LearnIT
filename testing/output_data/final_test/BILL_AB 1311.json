    "title": "AB 1311",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 201.3 of the Labor Code is amended to define a \"temporary services employer\" as an entity that contracts with clients to supply workers, negotiates terms of service, assigns workers, sets pay rates, and has the authority to reassign workers. A \"temporary services employer\" sets pay rates, hires and terminates workers, and provides workers to clients through contractual relationships. It excludes nonprofit organizations, farm labor contractors, and garment manufacturing employers. Employees of temporary services employers must be paid weekly for work performed, with wages due no later than the following week's regular payday. Timely payment is considered completed upon the end of an assignment if wages are paid according to this requirement. Employees of temporary services employers in the security services industry, specifically security guards registered under Chapter 11.5 of the Business and Professions Code, must be paid weekly. If assigned on a day-to-day basis, wages are due at the end of each day. Employees of temporary services employers in the security services industry are dispatched to client worksites each day and return to the office upon completion of the assignment. Their work is non-executive, non-administrative, and non-professional. If assigned to work for a client engaged in a trade dispute, wages are due daily. If discharged, wages are due as per Section 201. If an employee of a temporary services employer quits after being assigned to a client, wages are due as per Section 202. If the assignment lasts over 90 days, the employer must pay weekly. Violations result in penalties under Section 203. No limitation on other available rights or remedies under state or federal law. This act creates new crimes or infractions, changes penalties, and is deemed urgent for public safety under the Constitution. To prevent confusion over pay periods for temporary employees providing security services, this act must take effect immediately."
