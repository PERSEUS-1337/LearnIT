    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bolster Our Energy Security for Tomorrow Act\" and includes definitions. The Act, known as the \"Bolster Our Energy Security for Tomorrow Act,\" provides definitions for terms such as Administrator, Applicant, Base closure law, Biomass, and Closed military installation. The \"Bolster Our Energy Security for Tomorrow Act\" defines terms like Closed military installation as a military base closed or approved for closure under base closure laws, and Federal refinery authorization as any required authorization for refinery siting, construction, expansion, or operation under Federal law. The \"Bolster Our Energy Security for Tomorrow Act\" defines a refinery as a facility designed to process crude oil or coal to produce gasoline or diesel through various chemical or physical processes. The \"Bolster Our Energy Security for Tomorrow Act\" defines a refinery as a facility designed to process crude oil or coal to produce gasoline or diesel, or to refine biomass to produce biofuel. The term \"State\" includes states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other US territories. State Assistance can be provided by the Administrator to help States hire personnel with expertise in fields relevant to Federal refinery authorizations. Federal agencies can also offer nonfinancial assistance to States for the consideration of Federal refinery authorizations. Refinery Process Coordination and Procedures are outlined in Section 4 of the Act. The President appoints a Federal coordinator to oversee responsibilities related to Federal refinery authorizations. All Federal and State agencies involved in refinery authorizations must cooperate with the Federal coordinator. Within 30 days of receiving a notification for a Federal refinery authorization, the Federal coordinator must convene a meeting with representatives from relevant agencies. The Federal coordinator appoints agencies for refinery authorizations. State agencies must also identify their roles. Within 90 days of notification, a memorandum of agreement is signed for a coordinated schedule for refinery authorizations. The Federal coordinator appoints agencies for refinery authorizations, and State agencies must identify their roles. A memorandum of agreement is signed within 90 days for a coordinated schedule. If a conflict arises among scheduling requirements, the Environmental Protection Agency's requirements take priority. The Federal coordinator is responsible for publishing the memorandum of agreement in the Federal Register and ensuring all parties work in good faith to implement the schedule established in the agreement. Additionally, a consolidated record of all activities is maintained with the cooperation of Federal and State agencies. The Federal coordinator maintains a consolidated record of decisions and actions taken regarding Federal refinery authorizations for judicial review. If the court finds the record insufficient, it may be remanded for further development. The United States district court has exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions related to the failure of an agency to act on a Federal refinery authorization. If a failure to act jeopardizes the schedule, the applicant or party to the agreement can bring a cause of action in court. If an action is brought under paragraph (2), the court will review whether the parties have acted in good faith, if the applicant has cooperated fully with the agencies responsible for issuing a Federal refinery authorization, and any other relevant materials in the record. If a failure to act described in paragraph (1) has occurred, the court will consider these factors and establish a new schedule. The court may establish a new schedule if a failure to act jeopardizes timely completion of proceedings, with enforcement authority. The Federal coordinator must file the consolidated record with the court in a civil action under this subsection. The court may expedite civil actions related to the siting, construction, or expansion of a refinery in a State that has requested application of this section, or on a closed military installation available for refinery siting. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF CLOSED MILITARY BASES. The President must designate at least 3 closed military installations for potential refinery construction within 90 days of this Act. One site must be suitable for refining biomass for biofuel production. The redevelopment authority for each designated installation must consider the feasibility of siting a refinery. The Secretary of Defense must give deference to recommendations of the redevelopment authority for managing and disposing of real property at closed military installations designated for refinery construction. The base closure law applicable to the installation must be followed for the management and disposal of real property suitable for refinery siting. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS AND ACTIONS. This Act does not affect the application of any environmental or other law, nor does it prevent parties from bringing causes of action under such laws, including citizen suits. SEC. 7. REPEAL OF REFINERY REVITALIZATION AUTHORITY. Subtitle H of title III of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is repealed."
