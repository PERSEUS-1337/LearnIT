    "content": "The \"Puppy Protection Act of 2001\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that puppies in the United States are mass-produced at breeding facilities known as \"puppy mills\" and sold at 8 weeks of age. There are over 3,000 commercial dog breeding operations in the country, with documented problems including overcrowding, lack of protection, infestation, overbreeding, inbreeding, lack of veterinary care, lack of socialization, and killing of unwanted animals. The breeding of female dogs at puppy mills leads to declining health and behavior problems in puppies. The Department of Agriculture inspects these facilities to ensure compliance with regulations under the Animal Welfare Act. Consumers purchase puppies from retail operations that may appear healthy but often suffer from physical and behavioral issues or genetic diseases that may not be evident until later. These facilities continue to operate despite repeated violations of regulations cited by Department of Agriculture inspectors. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. SOCIALIZATION PLAN; BREEDING RESTRICTIONS.\" is about regulations related to socialization plans and breeding restrictions for puppies. The Animal Welfare Act is amended to include regulations for the socialization of dogs and breeding restrictions, such as not breeding female dogs before they reach at least 1 year of age. Breeding restrictions include not breeding female dogs before they are at least 1 year old and not breeding them more than 3 times in a 24-month period. SEC. 4. REVOCATION OF LICENSE. Amendment to Section 19 of the Animal Welfare Act regarding suspension or revocation of license, civil penalties, judicial review, and criminal penalties. The text discusses the suspension or revocation of licenses for violations of rules governing the humane treatment of animals under the Animal Welfare Act. If violations occur, the Secretary can revoke a license after a hearing if the licensee has violated regulations on multiple occasions. The text outlines the process for revoking a license for violations of animal welfare regulations under the Animal Welfare Act, with specific conditions for revocation after multiple violations. The Secretary of Agriculture must create regulations within a year of this Act's enactment to implement the amendments, including developing required standards."
