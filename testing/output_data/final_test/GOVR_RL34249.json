    "content": "Table 1 outlines the key provisions of H.R. 3970, including a one-year \"patch\" for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to prevent it from affecting upper middle class taxpayers. The AMT revisions would result in a revenue loss of $845.2 billion over 10 years, offset by increased taxes on higher-income individuals, generating $831.7 billion. Additionally, there are $86 billion in tax cuts for lower-income individuals, such as an increase in the standard deduction and earned income credit. The proposal includes changes to tax credits, additional taxes on higher-income individuals, base broadening provisions, extensions of expiring tax benefits, and a reduction in the top corporate tax rate. The proposal includes changes to tax credits, additional taxes on higher-income individuals, base broadening provisions, extensions of expiring tax benefits, and a reduction in the top corporate tax rate. The bill has a negligible effect on revenues over a 10-year period, with individual sections being revenue neutral, extenders having a small loss, and corporate revisions showing a small gain. The repeal of the AMT would result in a larger revenue loss if the 2001 tax cuts are extended. The AMT provisions in H.R. 3996 aim to patch the AMT through 2007 with a cost of $50.6 billion, reflecting a larger AMT exemption increase. The individual tax revisions in the bill are roughly revenue neutral but redistribute tax burdens. Eliminating the AMT and covering the revenue cost is a key focus of the bill. The AMT provisions in the bill aim to patch the AMT through 2007 with a cost of $49.6 billion, increasing and indexing the exemption from the AMT. The subsequent repeal of the AMT would cost $797.7 billion, affecting 24 million taxpayers. H.R. 3970 contains provisions targeting lower-income individuals, costing $86 billion overall. It includes an increase in the standard deduction, earned income credit, and refundability of the child credit. The bill would raise the standard deduction by $850 for married couples, $425 for singles, and $625 for heads of households, simplifying tax compliance. The proposal in H.R. 3970 includes increasing the earned income tax credit for single individuals and married couples without children, along with expanding the credit's phase out range. This provision would cost $29.1 billion and has faced resistance from some who view it as a welfare program directed at the more vulnerable population. The proposal in H.R. 3970 aims to increase the earned income tax credit for single individuals and married couples without children, expanding the credit's phase-out range. This provision, costing $29.1 billion, has faced resistance for being seen as a welfare program for the vulnerable population. Additionally, there is a proposal to enhance the refundability of the child tax credit, reducing the threshold to $8,500 and eliminating indexing, costing $9.1 billion. The provisions in H.R. 3970 target high-income individuals to offset losses from the repeal of the AMT. This includes a surtax of 4% on adjusted gross income above a certain threshold, with an additional 0.6% tax on incomes above $500,000. These increased taxes would apply to adjusted, not taxable, income. The proposed provisions in H.R. 3970 target high-income individuals by implementing a surtax on adjusted gross income above a certain threshold, along with additional taxes on incomes over $500,000. These taxes would apply to adjusted income, not taxable income, affecting all income regardless of eligibility for preferences like itemized deductions or lower rates. Additionally, the legislation would restore the phase out of personal exemptions and itemized deductions for high-income individuals, raise the floor for miscellaneous itemized deductions, and increase the capital gains tax rate after 2010. The proposed provisions in H.R. 3970 target high-income individuals by implementing a surtax on adjusted gross income above a certain threshold, along with additional taxes on incomes over $500,000. This deduction raises $7.1 billion and aims to pay for the AMT repeal. Adjusted gross income is used as a base to impose taxes on itemized deductions, preferentially taxed dividends, and capital gains. Capital gains preferences were excluded under the original AMT but were restored and expanded in 1997 and 2003. The proposed provisions in H.R. 3970 target high-income individuals by implementing a surtax on adjusted gross income above a certain threshold, along with additional taxes on incomes over $500,000. Capital gains and dividends are taxed at a lower rate of 15% under the regular tax, rather than the 26% (or 28%) AMT rate. There is resistance to increasing marginal tax rates and taxes on dividends and capital gains. Some economists believe higher capital gains taxes deter realizations and may lose revenue, while others find a negligible response. The bill includes base broadening provisions to raise revenue, with only one provision affecting taxes on tax-exempt organizations losing revenue. The first provision in H.R. 3970 targets high-income individuals with a surtax on adjusted gross income above a certain threshold and additional taxes on incomes over $500,000. It addresses the tax treatment of investment managers, treating investment income as ordinary income instead of capital gains. There are also provisions related to offshore hedge fund investments by tax-exempt investors, with exemptions for domestic investors but a tax on unrelated business income for certain investments. Debt-financed investments are subject to taxes, with flow-through attributes affecting the imposition of taxes. The first provision in H.R. 3970 targets high-income individuals with a surtax on adjusted gross income above a certain threshold and additional taxes on incomes over $500,000. It addresses the tax treatment of investment managers, treating investment income as ordinary income instead of capital gains. Offshore investments by tax-exempt entities would require investment managers with deferred compensation to be taxed currently. This taxation of deferred compensation restores the tax when the effective employer is tax exempt. The bill's provision on tax exempt hedge fund investment aims to eliminate the UBIT for partnerships to remove tax differentials that encourage offshore investment. There is debate on whether to reduce incentives for offshore investments or broaden the scope of UBIT to include debt-financed passive investments. The provision mirrors H.R. 3501 introduced by Congressman Levin. The Senate Finance Committee discussed offshore investments and their impact on educational institution endowments. They considered alternative spending requirements to address the offshore UBIT issue. Provisions in Table 4 address sales of depreciable property between related parties and payroll treatment for Subchapter S service firms. The Senate Finance Committee discussed provisions for Subchapter S service firms, focusing on payroll tax treatment. S Corporations may evade payroll taxes by undervaluing labor services. The proposed tax would apply to all income received as shares related to service income. Additionally, brokers would be required to report the basis of sales of securities to the IRS. The Senate Finance Committee discussed provisions for Subchapter S service firms, focusing on payroll tax treatment. S Corporations may evade payroll taxes by undervaluing labor services. The proposed tax would apply to all income received as shares related to service income. Additionally, brokers would be required to report the basis of sales of securities to the IRS. Basis reporting should help reduce evasion of capital gains taxes because the IRS currently has no third party information on the basis of assets which is necessary to determine capital gain. The package of individual changes in the individual tax portion of the bill would be roughly revenue neutral but would redistribute tax burdens. Table 5 shows the change in tax liability and the percentage change in after tax income reported in a study of the broad based individual provisions by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The distributional effects would change over time, so the initial and final years are shown. The tax burden would be reduced for lower, middle, and upper middle income taxpayers, but increased for very high incomes. Lower incomes benefit from low-income tax provisions, while middle and upper middle classes benefit from the repeal of the AMT. Dollar amounts show even the $200,000 to $500,000 income class receives a tax cut. Extenders are temporary provisions that must be reauthorized to avoid expiration, divided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes extenders into those affecting individuals, businesses, and others like excise taxes. The number of extenders has grown due to budgetary constraints, with 37 extenders costing $21 billion over 10 years. Key provisions include the R&E tax credit, state sales tax deduction, and 15-year depreciation recovery period for leasehold and restaurant improvements. The R&E credit accounts for 40% of the total cost and the three provisions together account for 75%. The major tax reduction is a reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 30.5%, costing $364 billion over 10 years. The 2001 tax cuts focused on individual taxes, with some revisions in the corporate tax in 2004 and a reduction in tax rates on capital gains and dividends in 2003. This proposal is the first since 1986 to include an overall corporate tax rate reduction. The proposal includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate and discussions on broadening the tax base to address corporate issues. Lowering the statutory tax rate and broadening the base can lead to smaller economic distortions, but there is a limit to how much the rate can be lowered without creating tax shelters. The proposal aims to lower the corporate tax rate without creating tax shelters. It includes provisions like increasing the small business expensing deduction to $125,000 and indexing it for inflation. This provision simplifies tax compliance for smaller firms but costs $20.5 billion over 10 years. Other revenue-gaining provisions include repealing the production activities deduction, last-in, last-out (LIFO) inventory accounting, and disallowing expenses of parent corporations related to deferred foreign source income. The production activities deduction, enacted in 2004, allowed a deduction for domestic manufacturing and production activities. Trading off this provision for a rate reduction could be seen as exchanging a more limited provision for a rate reduction affecting all corporations. Three quarters of the benefit would have gone to corporations, with 12 percent going to Subchapter S firms. The production activities deduction, enacted in 2004, allowed a deduction for domestic manufacturing and production activities. It has faced criticism for distorting investment and creating administrative issues. Canada repealed a similar provision due to complications. The current law allows U.S. firms to defer taxation on income from foreign subsidiaries until it is repatriated as dividends. This enables firms to shift profits out of the U.S. by using foreign tax havens. The proposed allocation rule would deny deductions associated with this income until it is repatriated and subject to tax, aiming to prevent profit shifting. Additionally, the allocation provision would revise the foreign tax credit system. The proposed allocation rule aims to prevent profit shifting by denying deductions associated with income from foreign subsidiaries until it is repatriated and subject to tax. It would also revise the foreign tax credit system to limit firms from choosing repatriations to eliminate U.S. tax. The proposed allocation rule aims to prevent profit shifting by denying deductions associated with income from foreign subsidiaries until it is repatriated and subject to tax. An additional allocation provision would repeal a rule that involved worldwide interest for the foreign tax credit, allowing for more foreign tax credits and reducing U.S. tax liability for firms with excess foreign taxes paid. The 2004 provision included interest on foreign borrowing and debt-financed investment in the calculation, resulting in a reduction in interest allocated to domestic source income. The proposed allocation rule aims to prevent profit shifting by denying deductions associated with income from foreign subsidiaries until it is repatriated and subject to tax. Another provision aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners and eliminating the benefit of setting up a subsidiary in a treaty country to avoid withholding tax. Additionally, two provisions relate to inventory accounting, with the most significant being the repeal of a provision related to inventory accounting. The repeal of the LIFO accounting provision in the manufacturing and trade sectors impacts inventory methods, specifically comparing LIFO and FIFO. LIFO may provide a more accurate measure of income by indexing cost and not capturing inflation increases in value. The economic consequences of taxing the return to inventories at a higher or lower rate are likely not significant due to the short holding period for most inventories. Another provision eliminates the option to value inventories at market value rather than cost, which allows for the recognition of losses inconsistent with the general realization principle for gains and losses. Other provisions with significant revenue gains include amortization of intangibles, the economic substance doctrine, and the dividends received deduction. The provision in H.R. 3970 increases the deduction period for acquired intangibles from 15 to 20 years to simplify compliance and end disputes about recovery periods. Arguments were made that most intangibles, like customer lists, were not depreciable as they were self-generating or deductible expenses. Recovery of acquired intangibles is seen as a reduction in capital gains tax rather than depreciation. Acquisition is seen as a reduction in capital gains tax rather than a depreciation issue. Firms entering into tax savings arrangements without economic substance risk having their tax benefits disallowed. Legislative proposals aim to clarify the economic substance doctrine, requiring transactions to meet both objective and subjective tests. Penalties may be imposed for non-compliance. The stricter test for tax savings arrangements aims to reduce tax avoidance and ensure consistent treatment in courts. Some tax attorneys are concerned that specific rules may provide a roadmap for passing the test. The U.S. Treasury disputes revenue gains projected by the Joint Committee on Taxation, with the current administration opposing the change. The third provision addresses inter-corporate dividend deductions to prevent excessive double taxation and discourage chains of partially owned corporations. The bill aims to reduce intercorporate dividend deductions, with a proposed reduction from 80% to 70% for firms with 20% ownership and from 70% to 60% for firms with less than 20% ownership. This would prevent a decrease in the tax burden due to a rate cut, resulting in a slight tax increase. Other provisions include preventing corporations from excluding future uncollectible payments from tax and targeting taxpayers holding options in Subchapter S corporations. The bill aims to reduce intercorporate dividend deductions, with proposed reductions for firms with different ownership percentages. It also includes provisions targeting taxpayers holding options in Subchapter S corporations, tax exempt employee stock ownership plans, and tax free spin-offs of subsidiaries by parents. The CRS Report RL32367 discusses expired temporary tax provisions, including the optional deduction for state and local sales taxes reinstated in 2004. Other significant provisions include the deduction for tuition and contributions to charity from Individual Retirement Accounts. The provision allowing retirement account distributions to be deducted from income was enacted in 2006 as part of President Bush's charity proposals. It benefits older individuals, non-itemizers, those with rising taxable social security benefits, and those subject to charitable contribution limits. Another provision addresses combat pay exclusion for lower-income enlisted soldiers, allowing them to include combat pay in calculating the earned income credit. The curr_chunk discusses various tax provisions, including the tax credit for research and experimentation expenditures and the shortening of the recovery period for real property improvements. These provisions primarily affect businesses and have been extended multiple times. The research credit is criticized for being poorly targeted and subject to abuse. The curr_chunk discusses tax provisions such as the new markets credit, railroad track maintenance credit, investments in Indian reservations, brownfields cleanup deduction, zone academies bond tax credit, and charitable deduction for donated property. These provisions aim to support lower-income areas, economic development, environmental objectives, and special schools. The curr_chunk discusses provisions for charitable deductions in excess of donated property basis, including for computers, food inventory, and books. It also mentions extending the production activities deduction to Puerto Rico and limiting unrelated business income tax to certain types of income. The curr_chunk discusses provisions extending IRS authority for certain activities and increasing payments to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands for excise taxes on distilled spirits."
