The Congress finds that a significant number of murders in the United States are committed using firearms, with a high percentage in New York State. The ability to produce firearm components at home using digital manufacturing technologies is a concern as it could circumvent existing laws. The ability to fabricate firearm components using digital manufacturing technologies poses a concern as they can be made undetectable by traditional metal detectors and x-rays. SEC. 3 amends the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 to increase the minimum metal content in firearms from 25 to 35. SEC. 4 extends the ban on undetectable firearms to include receivers made by individuals. Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code is amended to make it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive any firearm that is not detectable by walk-through metal detectors or any major component of which is not detectable by x-ray machines commonly used. The amendment to Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, possession, or transfer of firearms that are undetectable by walk-through metal detectors or x-ray machines commonly used at airports. This includes receivers for rifles or handguns that are not as detectable as the Receiver Security Exemplar. The amendment to Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code prohibits the manufacture of undetectable firearms, including receivers for rifles or handguns that do not accurately depict their shape when inspected by x-ray machines commonly used at airports. The amendment to Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code prohibits the manufacture of undetectable firearms, including receivers for rifles or handguns that do not accurately depict their shape when inspected by x-ray machines commonly used at airports. The term 'Receiver Security Exemplar' refers to an object made of 3.7 ounces of material type 17-4 PH stainless steel, resembling the lower receiver for a rifle or handgun, suitable for testing metal detectors. The Attorney General will promulgate regulations to allow the manufacture, importation, sale, and possession of detectable receivers for rifles and handguns, previously prohibited under Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code. The receivers must contain 3.7 ounces of material type 17-4 PH stainless steel, resembling the lower receiver for a rifle or handgun, or a lesser detectable amount based on advancements in weapons detection technology. The Undetectable Firearms Modernization Act allows for the manufacture, importation, sale, and possession of detectable receivers for rifles and handguns. This includes inserting \"or receiver\" after \"firearm\" in various paragraphs and specifying regulations for detectable receivers. The Undetectable Firearms Modernization Act extends the ban to undetectable ammunition magazines made by individuals. Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code is amended to include a prohibition on importing, selling, shipping, delivering, possessing, transferring, or receiving undetectable ammunition magazines manufactured by unlicensed individuals. The amendment to Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code prohibits the manufacture of undetectable ammunition magazines by unlicensed individuals. The amendment to Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code prohibits the manufacture of undetectable ammunition magazines by unlicensed individuals. Additionally, the term 'Magazine Security Exemplar' is defined as an object made of 1 ounce of material type 17-4 PH stainless steel, resembling an ammunition magazine, suitable for testing metal detectors. The Attorney General will regulate the production and use of previously prohibited ammunition magazines. The amendment to Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code prohibits the manufacture of undetectable ammunition magazines by unlicensed individuals. The term 'Magazine Security Exemplar' is defined as an object made of 1 ounce of material type 17-4 PH stainless steel, resembling an ammunition magazine, suitable for testing metal detectors.

The amendment prohibits the manufacture of undetectable ammunition magazines by unlicensed individuals. It includes regulations for the production and use of previously prohibited ammunition magazines."
