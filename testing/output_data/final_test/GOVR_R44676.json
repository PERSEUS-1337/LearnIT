    "content": "The report provides a profile of recent U.S. foreign aid education sector activities, emphasizing the importance of education in socio-economic development. Education assistance is seen as crucial for lifting developing countries out of poverty, countering extremism, and promoting global stability. USAID is highlighted as the leading agency in these efforts. The expansion of quality education is seen as foundational to human development and economic growth by USAID. Research shows that education is crucial for improving livelihoods and economic stability in developing countries, with ripple effects on the community. According to the World Bank, education leads to economic growth and stability, as well as better coping mechanisms for economic shocks. Education is crucial for economic growth and stability in developing countries. More educated households can better handle economic shocks and exploit new opportunities. Improved education among women has led to a decrease in infant and child mortality rates. Countries with educated female populations are better equipped to adapt to environmental changes. The international community recognizes the importance of education in development, with goals set by the United Nations for universal primary education and quality education as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations aims to provide inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite progress, around 263 million children and youth are out of school, with sub-Saharan Africa facing the highest out-of-school rates. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest out-of-school rates, with a significant number of children not attending primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary school. Girls are particularly disadvantaged, with 15 million girls of primary school age never attending school compared to 10 million boys. The quality of education is also a concern, as many children leave school without basic reading and math skills. Approximately 130 million children worldwide who complete four years of primary school lack basic literacy and numeracy skills. Congress influences education assistance through policymaking and annual appropriations since 1973. In 1973, the policy objective of foreign assistance was to target aid towards satisfying basic human needs in developing countries, including reducing illiteracy and increasing education and training. Congress mandated a Basic Education Coordinator position in 2008 to oversee all basic education assistance, but the position was only filled for one year. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act shifted education assistance policies. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act shifted education assistance policies to USAID, dividing responsibilities for basic education. Several bills in Congress, including H.R. 4481, focus on achieving sustainable quality universal basic education, especially for girls and marginalized groups. The legislation requires programs to have measurable goals and be monitored rigorously. It calls for a Senior Coordinator on basic education and an annual report on education strategy implementation. Bills were approved to address the threat of Boko Haram and increase girls' access to education in Afghanistan. The increase in girls enrolled in primary education in Afghanistan from 5,000 under the Taliban to over 2,400,000 by 2010 is lauded. Assistance programs supporting Afghan women and girls, especially in education, are a priority for the United States. Congress supports education activities through annual appropriations, with funding directed towards basic and higher education. In FY2016, USAID and Department of State education programs received about $856 million, making up nearly 4% of total economic assistance. Total education funding was approximately $1.2 billion. In FY2014, total education obligations from U.S. agencies, including the Peace Corps and MCC, were around $1.2 billion, accounting for nearly 4% of economic aid. Education funding has increased significantly since FY2001, reaching a peak in FY2009 at $1.2 billion. The FY2017 request is $788 million, the lowest in 10 years, with basic education receiving 75%-80% of total assistance. In FY2014, U.S. agencies allocated around $1.2 billion for education, representing nearly 4% of economic aid. USAID, Peace Corps, and MCC are the main agencies funding education programs, with USAID contributing over two-thirds of education spending. Sub-Saharan Africa received the highest percentage of education funding in FY2015 at 41%, followed by the Near East/North Africa and South and Central Asia at 22% each. USAID's Education Strategy 2011-2015 aimed to improve reading skills for 100 million children, workforce development, and access to education in crisis areas. 155 projects in 45 countries benefited over 41 million children. A new strategy for 2016-2020 will focus on the same goals with added emphasis on workforce development and higher education. The Peace Corps' volunteers focus on education in various sectors, with 37% working on education in 45 countries. They teach subjects like math, science, ICT, English, literacy/numeracy, and gender empowerment in rural communities. Volunteers collaborate with local counterparts and receive technical training funded by USAID through the Global Education Framework. In FY2011, USAID funded technical training for Peace Corps volunteers. MCC funding for education accounted for 10% in FY2014. MCC's education efforts focus on poverty reduction through economic growth in countries like El Salvador, Georgia, and Morocco. El Salvador lacked a skilled labor force for international trade, leading to a $100.7 million investment over five years. The $100.7 million, five-year education project in Georgia aims to improve secondary education quality in 400 schools and strengthen technical and vocational education. The $140 million Georgia compact, initiated in 2014, focuses on public school rehabilitation, educator training, and workforce development. The $220 million Morocco education project also aims to enhance education quality. The $220 million Morocco education project aims to improve employability by introducing a new model of secondary schools and enhancing technical and vocational education. USAID highlights the importance of educating girls, as it not only benefits them but also their families, communities, and countries. For example, an extra year of secondary school for girls can increase future earnings by 18% and decrease the probability of infant mortality for mothers. The Let Girls Learn initiative, launched in March 2015 by the Obama Administration, aims to address challenges girls face in education worldwide. It is a collaboration of USAID, the MCC, the Peace Corps, and the Department of State, with additional support from the Departments of Labor and Agriculture. Foreign governments like the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea have pledged nearly $600 million, and U.S. private sector companies like Proctor and Gamble and J.Crew are also involved in supporting the initiative. The Let Girls Learn initiative, launched in March 2015 by the Obama Administration, aims to address challenges girls face in education worldwide. Various organizations, including J.Crew and the Central Asia Institute, have pledged support for Let Girls Learn. USAID has announced a three-pillar strategy to improve girls' education, focusing on increasing access to quality education and reducing barriers girls face. The Reducing Barriers pillar addresses vulnerabilities girls face daily, including health risks, economic challenges, and security threats. Programs focus on building skills in finance, digital literacy, STEM, and agriculture, while promoting gender parity through community programs. The Peace Corps supports girls' education and empowerment through leadership camps and other initiatives. Let Girls Learn actively promotes and funds such programs. The Peace Corps is actively promoting and funding programs to empower girls' education and women's empowerment through a three-pillar strategy. This includes training leaders to incorporate gender awareness, working with communities to implement gender-related projects, and increasing the number of volunteers focused on girls' education. The agency targets 35 countries for Let Girls Learn programming. The Millennium Challenge Corporation's ability to initiate girls' education efforts is limited. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) includes gender analysis in its projects and promotes girls' education. The Department of State supports girls' empowerment through diplomatic efforts and partnerships, such as implementing Girls STEAM camps in Rwanda. The Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture are contributing funds to support girls' education in various ways. The Department of Labor focuses on addressing child labor through education programs, while the Department of Agriculture is providing $7 million towards this cause. Additionally, a $5 million grant from the Department of Labor aims to increase girls' access to education and training in Zambia. The Department of Agriculture in Zambia is contributing $7 million under the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program to support girls' education in Malawi by providing meals, scholarships, and classroom construction. The U.S. government implements various assistance activities to achieve education development goals, including access and enrollment, education management, teacher training, literacy improvement, and school construction. Examples of education assistance programs from USAID and other agencies in different countries demonstrate a broad regional scope. The examples from different countries show the broad regional scope of education assistance programs. UNESCO reports that 61 million primary school-aged children worldwide do not attend school, with 21.5 million in conflict-affected countries. USAID aims to increase access to education in crisis environments, with programs like Back to Learning supporting this goal. Back to Learning, a USAID and UNICEF partnership in South Sudan, aims to improve school access and enrollment for vulnerable children. The program targets displaced children in Protection of Civilian sites and vulnerable children in other states through community-based education interventions. By 2015, it provided education to nearly 360,000 school-aged children. In Mali, USAID's Out-of-School Youth Project targeted rural youth aged 14-25 to enable their access to education. In Mali, USAID's Out-of-School Youth Project (OSYP) aimed to enable rural youth aged 14-25 to become more educated, economically productive, and civically engaged. The program addressed low youth enrollment and high illiteracy rates by providing basic education and entrepreneurship courses to three youth cohorts. In Mali, USAID's Out-of-School Youth Project (OSYP) provided basic education and entrepreneurship courses to rural youth aged 14-25. The program benefitted 10,951 youths over five years. USAID often assists governments in formulating education policy and building institutional capacity. Recent examples include assistance in Egypt and Indonesia, as well as the Quality Basic Education Reform Support Project in Peru from 2009 to 2014. USAID partnered with FHI 360 to support education decentralization reform in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and regional governments. The program revised national laws, introduced tools for local education management, and provided training to enhance regional government capacity in project design and budgeting. Peru project implementers focused on designing and executing projects to improve education, including expanding schools and enhancing teaching skills. They also advised the Ministry of Education on teacher standards and provided materials for classroom guidance in reading and math. Teacher training is crucial for education quality in developing countries, with USAID and Peace Corps playing a significant role in implementing training programs. Peace Corps volunteers engage in capacity-building for local educators, such as the \"Literacy Bike Trek\" in The Gambia. In FY2015, Peace Corps volunteers conducted workshops in The Gambia to train teachers on reading aloud to students. This resulted in 239 trained teachers participating in World Read Aloud Day. In Nicaragua, volunteers co-taught English in secondary schools, focusing on lesson planning and interactive activities to improve teachers' language skills. Additionally, Peace Corps has a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) program to support teachers in building their English language competence and confidence. USAID collaborated with Kosovo Ministry of Education to improve education institutions through teacher training and curriculum development. The program resulted in 25 Professional Development Centers and provided professional development courses to nearly 26,000 educators. USAID also addressed issues with textbook costs and distribution by establishing a Global Book Alliance with other donors. USAID has collaborated with international donors to establish the Global Book Alliance, aiming to lower book costs through improved procurement processes. They have sponsored an All Children Reading competition to track and trace school materials for better distribution. Additionally, USAID invests in developing context-specific and culturally appropriate textbooks and learning materials. USAID distributes educational materials using new technologies like video, Internet, and mobile devices. They provided 146 million textbooks and learning materials in 37 countries between 2011 and 2015. The Textbooks and Learning Materials Program (TLMP) in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, South Africa, and Tanzania aims to improve education quality through the development and distribution of materials. TLMP started in 2005 as part of the Africa Education Initiative and was extended to include a joint endeavor with five partner universities from 2009 to 2012. In partnership with five universities, USAID developed over 30 million textbooks and learning materials in 13 languages to improve reading skills for 100 million children by 2015. One example is the Literacy, Language, and Learning Initiative (L3) in Rwanda. Under the program, USAID's partner, the Educational Development Center, Inc., worked with the Rwandan Ministry of Education to enhance literacy and numeracy skills for primary students. They established national reading standards, implemented effective teaching strategies, developed local reading materials, and distributed over 1 million books. A midline assessment in October 2015 showed improvement in reading skills for all grades. USAID continues to explore new methods to achieve its development goals, including improving literacy. USAID launched All Children Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development in 2011 as a $25 million partnership with World Vision and the Australian government to improve literacy skills in developing countries through innovative ideas. The initiative includes competitions to fund pilot projects that can be scaled up. The second round (2014-2017) focuses on technology-based innovations in mother tongue instruction and reading materials. The second round of All Children Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development focuses on three specific areas: mother tongue instruction and reading materials, family and community engagement, and children with disabilities. 214 proposals were received, with 14 winners selected so far. Projects include developing strategies for identifying reading problems in early grade children, creating a mobile app for learning in the Marathi language, and designing a literacy game for teacher training and improving reading skills in local languages. SIL International and USAID provide training in local languages to contribute to country development goals. Participant training is a significant part of USAID's development strategy, especially in building capacities of developing country government cadres. In FY2015, participant training in the United States decreased due to high costs, with only 1,011 receiving long-term training and 1,428 receiving short-term training. Overall, there were 365,818 participants in long-term programs and 2,371,482 in short-term programs, focusing on technical training, study visits, and leadership development. The Scholarships for Education and Economic Development (SEED) program in the United States focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean. Launched in 2008, over 1,340 participants were expected to complete their studies by 2015. However, a 2012 evaluation noted high costs compared to other development programs. For example, a one-year scholarship for U.S.-based academic training cost $25,000 per participant, while workforce development programs in Latin America cost $1,000 per participant. The Women's Leadership program in Afghanistan aims to empower Afghan women leaders to contribute to the country's development. It includes programs such as Women in Government, Women's Leadership in the Economy, and Education, providing internships, workforce development, scholarships, and vocational training to equip women with the necessary tools for economic development and poverty reduction. The Department of Labor's E4Y project in Ethiopia aims to address child labor by improving educational attainment and providing safe work opportunities for youth. The program offers vocational training, apprenticeships, and job placement for 12,000 Ethiopian youth aged 14-17, with a focus on females and those with disabilities. USAID also launched a vocational scholarship program in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami to improve livelihoods. After the 2004 tsunami, USAID partnered with Chevron Corporation to provide scholarships for over 300 youth in Aceh province and Nias island for vocational training in various skills. The Department of Defense has been involved in school construction projects in areas affected by natural disasters or conflict, including rebuilding schools in Iraq and Afghanistan. Marines also constructed three elementary schools in Honduras during hurricane relief efforts. The MCC's Burkina Faso Threshold Program aimed to improve girls' education. The MCC's 2005-2007 Burkina Faso Threshold Program focused on improving girls' education by constructing 132 \"girl-friendly\" schools with separate facilities and safe access to water. The American Schools and Hospitals Abroad (ASHA) program, established in the late 1940s, allocates funds for educational and medical facilities worldwide, with $7 million dedicated to 12 construction projects in 2013-2014. ASHA projects cover education from secondary to university levels. ASHA projects in FY2015 include expanding Ashesi University College's engineering program in Ghana, improving facilities at the Abaarso School of Science and Technology in Somalia, enhancing the Hughes Schools in Bolivia, and promoting gender equality at Dar al-Kalima University College of Arts & Culture in the West Bank."
