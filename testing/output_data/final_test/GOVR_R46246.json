    "content": "The 2017 tax revision established a $10,000 limit on annual SALT deduction claims, known as the \"SALT cap.\" This cap affects taxpayers who itemize deductions, increasing their tax liability. Various bills in Congress aim to modify the SALT cap, while federal regulatory efforts are ongoing. The SALT cap limits annual deduction claims to $10,000, impacting taxpayers who itemize deductions. Recent legislation and regulatory actions are being considered to modify the cap, which allows taxpayers to reduce taxable income by claiming certain state and local taxes paid. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) established a temporary SALT cap for tax years 2018 through 2025, limiting the SALT deduction to $10,000 for single taxpayers or married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. This cap decreases tax savings associated with the deduction, increasing federal revenues. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) established a temporary SALT cap for tax years 2018 through 2025, limiting the SALT deduction to $10,000 for single taxpayers or married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. This cap decreases tax savings associated with the deduction, increasing federal revenues. The TCJA also changed various tax code features, doubling the standard deduction and limiting other itemized deductions, indirectly affecting SALT deduction eligibility and reducing the number of taxpayers claiming the deduction. Revenue losses from the SALT deduction in FY2017 ($100.9 billion) nearly equaled the total losses projected from FY2019 through FY2023 ($117.2 billion). The SALT cap established by the TCJA limited the SALT deduction to $10,000 for single taxpayers or married couples filing jointly. This cap reduced tax savings and increased federal revenues. A 2019 report found that the cap would have reduced SALT deduction benefits for 10.9 million taxpayers and deduction amounts by $323 billion. The SALT cap, established by the TCJA, limited the SALT deduction to $10,000 for single taxpayers or married couples filing jointly. Repealing the SALT cap for tax year 2018 would decrease federal revenues by $77.4 billion, affecting taxpayers with itemized deductions and increasing the cost of state and local taxes. The SALT cap, set at $10,000 by the TCJA, would lead to a decline in demand for state and local government activity due to the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. State and local governments may adjust tax and spending practices in response to federal tax changes, with the salience of the SALT cap affecting taxpayer awareness of its impact on tax liability. Taxpayers may have low awareness of the effects of the SALT cap on their tax liability, as it may not be clearly reflected in tax filing software. State and local governments, unlike the federal government, are required to balance their budgets annually or biennially, limiting their ability to respond to changes in demand for government services caused by the SALT cap. The SALT cap may lead to reduced revenue, prompting cuts in services or increased revenue sources. The impact of the SALT cap varies by state, locality, and income level due to differing tax policies. Data on its effects are currently unavailable, but pre-cap data can offer insights into its likely impact. State and local tax rates can impact the number of taxpayers affected by the SALT cap and the amount of their tax burden. Differences in local incomes and price levels also play a role in how the SALT cap affects taxpayers. State and local governments raised $1.30 trillion in taxes in 2017, with state governments collecting $667 billion and local governments collecting $632 billion. There is geographic variation in tax rates and incomes, impacting the SALT cap for taxpayers. In 2017, New York, Washington DC, Hawaii, Maine, and Nebraska had the highest combined effective state and local tax rates, while Delaware, Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, and Tennessee had the lowest rates. States with higher SALT-eligible effective tax rates are likely to be more affected by the SALT cap. The average SALT deduction amount for each 2017 congressional district shows districts with the highest deductions are in states with above-average tax rates like New York, California, Connecticut, and New Jersey. The distribution of SALT deductions across household income is analyzed by plotting average AGI and effective SALT rates in congressional districts. Districts with low effective SALT rates had lower average AGI, while those with high rates had higher average AGI. The distribution of SALT deductions across household income is discussed, showing that higher-income taxpayers benefit more from SALT deductions due to higher incomes and tax rates. JCT projections in 2017 and 2019 reveal that taxpayers with AGI above $100,000 received the majority of SALT benefits. Taxpayers with AGI above $100,000 received the majority of SALT benefits in 2017 and 2019. The SALT cap increased the federal tax burden of high-income taxpayers by reducing the number of claimants and benefit levels for those with over $10,000 in SALT payments. The SALT cap's impact on tax burdens varies across income levels, with over half of the additional tax benefits going to taxpayers earning over $1 million. In 2017, tax returns with AGI above $1 million claimed over 25% of all SALT deduction amounts, while those with AGI below $50,000 claimed less than 10% of the total. The SALT cap's impact on tax burdens varies across income levels, with over half of the additional tax benefits going to taxpayers earning over $1 million. The composition of state and local taxes affects the SALT cap's effect on taxpayers within a jurisdiction. Different tax structures result in varying SALT cap burdens on taxpayers with high incomes or property values. The SALT cap's effect on taxpayer liability varies across municipalities, with some governments taking action to reduce its impact. State and local responses to the SALT cap have been mixed, with certain states enacting legislation or legal action to mitigate the effects. However, recent federal and legal responses suggest these efforts may not be successful. State and local governments with lower SALT cap exposure have taken little to no action. Some states have made changes to their tax codes to potentially lower residents' SALT cap exposure. Some states enacted laws to provide taxpayers a credit for charitable donations to state entities to lower SALT cap exposure. The IRS limited availability of charitable deductions, and a legislative proposal to overturn this was rejected. States also used a \"pass-through work around\" to reduce the impact on taxpayers with pass-through business income. The SALT cap limits deductions for state and local taxes paid by individuals, but not for taxes associated with pass-through businesses. Some states have enacted laws to offset this by taxing the business entity itself, with tax reductions for individual members. Legal challenges have been made against the constitutionality of the SALT cap. Legislation introduced in the 116th Congress aims to modify the SALT cap, including proposals to repeal it entirely, increase its value for taxpayers, make it permanent, and repeal IRS regulations. A federal court ruling in September 2019 upheld the constitutionality of the SALT cap, stating it did not penalize certain jurisdictions."
