    "content": "The Act titled \"Seniors' Health Care Plan Protection Act of 2015\" delays the termination of contracts for Medicare Advantage plans that do not meet minimum quality ratings. Congress intends to study the impact of socioeconomic status and dual-eligible populations on the Medicare Advantage STARS rating system before making any reforms. They also plan to temporarily delay the authority of CMS to terminate Medicare Advantage plan contracts based solely on performance under the STARS rating system. The Security Act is amended to delay contract termination for Medicare Advantage plans failing to achieve minimum quality ratings under the 5-star rating system until the end of plan year 2018. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENTS TO MA RISK ADJUSTMENT SYSTEM. The Social Security Act is amended to include evaluation and revision of the risk adjustment system to consider chronic conditions and improve accuracy, transparency, and regular updates. The Secretary will revise the system based on the number of chronic conditions for 2017 and periodically thereafter. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of including 2 years of data to compare risk adjustment models for determining scores under the system. Additionally, there will be an evaluation of the impact of chronic kidney disease codes. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of removing chronic kidney disease diagnosis codes in the risk adjustment model and analyze best practices of MA plans to slow disease progression. Additionally, there will be an evaluation of including 10 percent of encounter data in computing payment for 2016. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of incorporating encounter data in risk scores, analyzing data accuracy and completeness, issuing recommendations for improvement, and not increasing the percentage of encounter data used without public release and weighting information. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of incorporating encounter data in risk scores, analyzing data accuracy and completeness, issuing recommendations for improvement, and ensuring that the data reflects the degree and cost of care coordination under MA plans. Evaluations and analyses will include an actuarial opinion from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services about the reasonableness of the methods, assumptions, and conclusions. The Secretary shall consult with the Medicare Payment. The Secretary will consult with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and stakeholders, such as managed care organizations and beneficiary groups, for evaluations and analyses. Results will be applied for plan years starting after the second year of enactment. The Secretary will make revisions to the risk adjustment system based on evaluations to better reflect the population served by the plan, starting in 2017 and periodically thereafter. Periodic reporting will also be required. The Secretary will periodically report to Congress on revisions made to the risk adjustment system, including evaluations conducted every third year starting in 2017. Adjustments must align with national health policy goals. The Secretary ensures that changes to health status do not hinder Medicare Advantage organizations from activities aligned with national health policy goals, such as early detection, care coordination, health risk assessments, and chronic disease management. There is an opportunity for public review and comment on adjustment factors for 2017 and beyond. The Secretary must allow at least 60 days for review and 30 days for public comments before implementing proposed changes. Sense of Congress regarding Medicare Advantage star rating system. Congress acknowledges that the star rating system for Medicare Advantage plans lacks proper consideration for the socioeconomic status of enrollees and individuals eligible for medical assistance. Congress will collaborate with stakeholders to ensure the rating system accurately reflects these factors. Congress acknowledges the need to address the socioeconomic status of Medicare Advantage enrollees in the star rating system. Congress emphasizes the importance of monitoring and improving the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model to accurately account for beneficiary risk, especially for those with complex chronic conditions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should ensure that plans enrolling beneficiaries with the greatest healthcare needs receive adequate reimbursement to provide high-quality care and services, making necessary adjustments to the risk adjustment methodology as needed. The Secretary should reconsider changes in the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology finalized for 2016 and use the methodology finalized in 2015 for one additional year. The House of Representatives passed the bill on June 17, 2015. Clerk: KAREN L. HAAS."
