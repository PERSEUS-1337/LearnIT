    "title": "AB 2151",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 11450. Aid is provided for needy families, including eligible siblings and parents, but not unborn children or recipients under Chapter 3. The amount of aid is determined based on the family's income for the prospective semiannual period, with a maximum monthly limit specified in the table. The amount of aid paid for each month is capped at a specified limit, adjusted for cost-of-living increases and special needs. The aid amount for eligible needy persons in the same home is capped at different levels based on the number of individuals, ranging from $326 for one person to $1,403 for 10 or more people. The aid amounts may be adjusted based on changes in contributions from the United States government. The aid amounts for eligible needy persons are capped at different levels based on the number of individuals. The specified sums shall not be adjusted for cost of living for certain fiscal years and no further reduction shall be made. Aid under this chapter can be paid to a pregnant child aged 18 or younger if the family does not include a needy child. Verification of pregnancy is required for eligibility. Aid can be paid to a pregnant woman for the month before the birth and the six months leading up to it if the family does not have a needy child. Verification of pregnancy is necessary for eligibility, and this rule applies only when the Cal-Learn Program is in effect. Pregnant women eligible for aid under the Cal-Learn Program may receive $47 per month to address pregnancy-related needs. This payment does not apply to those considered income under federal law in the first five months of pregnancy, except for the month before birth and the three months leading up to delivery. Recipients are referred to the Women, Infants, and Children program by county welfare departments. Children receiving AFDC-FC are entitled to a monthly aid amount specified in Section 11460, 11461, 11462, 11462.1, or 11463, along with special needs as per regulations. Families can also receive an allowance for recurring special needs not common to most recipients, such as food preparation, transportation, and utilities, capped at $10 per eligible family member. Each recipient is entitled to a special, diet-related food needs allowance of $20 per month or actual verified expenses related to the special dietary needs. The allowance is provided as a supplemental food benefit upon verification by a licensed healthcare provider for a special dietary need caused by a medical condition. After exhausting all liquid resources over $100, families can receive an allowance for nonrecurring special needs, such as clothing, household equipment, and emergency housing, caused by sudden and unusual circumstances. The total allowance for these needs cannot exceed $600 per event. Homeless families eligible for aid under this chapter can receive assistance for temporary shelter if they are apparently eligible. Apparent eligibility is determined based on evidence provided by the applicant or available to the county welfare department. However, certain conditions, such as lack of verification of alien status or pregnancy, may disqualify an applicant from being considered apparently eligible. A family is considered homeless if they lack a fixed nighttime residence, reside in a shelter, or are in a place not meant for sleeping. They are also homeless if facing eviction due to financial hardship beyond their control. A nonrecurring special needs benefit of $65 a day is available to families for temporary shelter costs, with additional members receiving $15 per day up to a maximum of $125. County welfare departments can increase the amount for shelter as needed. The special needs benefit for homeless families is granted or denied immediately upon application, available for up to three days. The county welfare department verifies homelessness within three days and may refer families to the fraud prevention unit for assistance. After verifying homelessness, the three-day limit for special needs benefits is extended up to a total of 16 days in weekly increments. Documentation of a housing search is required for each extension, with good cause defined as making a good faith effort to secure permanent housing while receiving temporary shelter benefits. A nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance is available to pay for last month\u2019s rent, security deposits, or up to two months of rent arrearages, not exceeding 80% of the family\u2019s total monthly household income. This benefit is only provided to families who have found permanent housing costing no more than 80% of their total monthly household income. The county welfare department may waive housing cost sharing requirement if family intends to reside with others. Nonrecurring special needs benefit covers deposits for utilities essential for family's health and safety. The county welfare department must issue payment or denial of permanent housing assistance within one working day of a family providing evidence of availability of housing. If eligibility has not been established, the department must complete the determination within the same timeframe unless all necessary verification has not been provided by the family. Eligibility for temporary shelter and permanent housing assistance is limited to one period of up to 16 consecutive days and one payment. Families with a parent or caretaker who previously received assistance for an eligible child are not eligible for further assistance. Applicants are informed that the temporary shelter benefit is available only once in a lifetime, with exceptions, and a break in use constitutes permanent exhaustion of the benefit. A family that becomes homeless due to a natural disaster is eligible for temporary and permanent homeless assistance. A family may qualify for homeless assistance due to domestic violence, verified medical illness, or uninhabitability of their former residence caused by unforeseen circumstances. Verification is required by a third-party agency, except for domestic violence which can be verified by a sworn statement. Assistance based on these circumstances can only be received once in a 12-month period. The homeless assistance payments are limited to two periods of temporary assistance and two payments of permanent assistance for victims of domestic violence. Recipients may need to participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan for a second time in a 24-month period. The county welfare department must inform victims of domestic violence about counseling services and refer them upon request. If a recipient verifies domestic violence by a sworn statement, they must participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan that includes domestic violence services. The county must review past services and offer additional assistance to help the recipient leave the domestic violence situation. The county welfare department must report necessary data to the department regarding all recipients of aid under this program. The county welfare departments and other entities involved in the CalWORKs program have the right to refunds from payments for permanent housing. Families can use refunds for moving costs in emergencies. Payments for temporary shelter and housing are made on behalf of families. The daily amount for temporary shelter special needs benefit can be increased if authorized by the Budget Act. The department shall establish rules and regulations for uniform statewide application of housing benefits. Recipients can quickly apply for funds through a standardized form. Payments under Section 11453.1 are not part of the payment schedule and do not count as income for aid recipients. Children receiving Kin-GAP aid must be paid a monthly amount to reach the specified rate. Counties must implement semiannual reporting by October 1, 2013, and certify compliance to the director. No appropriation is allowed for implementing this act. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as per the Government Code."
