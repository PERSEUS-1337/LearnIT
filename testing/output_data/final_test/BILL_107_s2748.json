The National Emergency Telemedical Communications Act of 2002 aims to form a task force and testing networks to develop a National Telemedical Network for real-time interaction in telehealth, disaster response, and disease surveillance. It also seeks to utilize existing telehealth infrastructure, enhance disaster readiness, and expand integrated telehealth models for various emergency scenarios. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of telemedicine, helicopter rescue, informatics, and public health in fostering teamwork among defense, emergency management, public health, and law enforcement agencies. Establishment of state and regional telehealth networks. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a pilot program for developing statewide and regional telehealth network testbeds linking existing State and local telehealth initiatives in specific regions of the United States. Contracts will be entered into to carry out this program. The Secretary will enter contracts for a 3-year period to establish statewide telehealth networks linking various medical services and facilities within the State. Statewide telehealth networks will be established to connect various medical services and facilities, including rural health offices, home health care organizations, Indian Health Service clinics, veterinary clinics, agrimedicine centers, and Federal agencies. These networks will test the feasibility of recommendations for rapid emergency response, real-time data collection, and epidemiological surveillance in preparation for biological terrorist attacks and medical disasters. Statewide telehealth networks will be standardized to connect existing telehealth activities within the State and form interoperable regional telehealth networks. States are encouraged to establish local interoperable response grids. Statewide and regional telehealth networks must adopt common approaches to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. They should inventory and report on their technology infrastructure and provide feedback on standard clinical information for national interoperability. The task force established under section 4 will test statewide and regional telehealth networks for their ability to support various emergency response efforts in areas such as prevention, surveillance, early detection, crisis response, and treatment. The Secretary is required to prepare and submit a report within one year of the Act's enactment and annually thereafter. The Secretary will report on the progress of implementing statewide and regional telehealth networks and the impact of recommendations from the task force. The Telehealth Task Force is established. The National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force is established by the Secretary to inventory and improve telehealth networks. The Task Force will conduct an inventory of existing telehealth initiatives, recommend standard clinical information for the National Telemedical Network, and provide recommendations for the Secretary to use. The National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force will make recommendations for establishing regional interoperating information grids, integrating technology and clinical practices, testing regional telehealth networks, studying previous recommendations, and developing guidelines for protecting administrative, physical, and technical aspects. The National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force will provide guidance for forming a National Telemedical Network to respond to threats and disasters, develop policies for network use in emergencies, and make recommendations to the Secretary. The National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force will provide recommendations to the Secretary on technical assistance, program content, training programs for responders, project evaluation framework, patient data security, and compliance with regulations. The National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force, established to provide recommendations on technical assistance, program content, training programs, project evaluation, patient data security, and compliance with regulations, includes representation from relevant Federal, State, and local agencies, professional associations, and private sector organizations. The Task Force will meet as directed by the Secretary and prepare reports within specified timelines. The National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force will annually submit reports to Congress on its activities for 3 years. The initial report will specify information gathered from statewide telehealth networks. The Task Force may collaborate with other entities for implementation and will terminate upon submitting the final report. Authorization of appropriations for the National Emergency Telehealth Network Task Force is set at $275,000,000, with a limit of 5% for administrative expenses."
