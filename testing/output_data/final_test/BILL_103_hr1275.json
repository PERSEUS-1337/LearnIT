The Congress finds that the transformation of the Soviet Union into independent states must result in free market economies and democracies to prevent economic collapse, totalitarian threats, and weapons proliferation. The US national security and economic interests are best served by stable democracies and free markets in Russia and other former Soviet republics, integrating them into world markets. The Congress emphasizes the importance of former Soviet republics taking responsibility for transforming into working democracies with open market economies. The US policy aims to help these countries achieve economic and political stability through democratic states with free market economies integrated into the international community. The President is urged to consult with Congress and prepare for this goal. The Congress urges the President to prepare a comprehensive plan to assist Russia and former Soviet republics with democratically elected governments moving towards free market economies. The plan should include humanitarian assistance, combatting nuclear proliferation, providing economic assistance, and helping draft laws. To assist former Soviet republics, the plan includes drafting laws, establishing political and legal structures, and building institutions for open, democratic, free market societies that protect individual rights. SEC. 2. REPAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE. Reimbursement Arrangements: Assistance to Russia and former Soviet republics must be repaid within seven years from natural resources. Reports to Congress are required at the end of each fiscal year detailing the assistance provided. The President must report to Congress on determinations, ongoing discussions, agreements, and receipts of natural resource compensation related to assistance provided to Russia and other former Soviet republics. The reimbursement for assistance must be made using natural resources.

Assistance from the United States to any government of a former Soviet republic is prohibited if the government is not freely chosen, restricts emigration of Jews or Christians, discriminates based on religion, or provides aid to specific countries or organizations seeking to overthrow democratically elected governments."
