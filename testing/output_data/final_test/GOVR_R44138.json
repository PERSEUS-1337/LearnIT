    "content": "This report provides information on the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees. It includes an overview of the FLSA, regulations on the exemptions, and the 2016 update to the exemptions. The FLSA, established in 1938, sets labor standards for most private and public sector employees. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets labor standards for private and public sector employees, including minimum wage, maximum hours (overtime), and child labor protections. Coverage under the FLSA includes enterprise and individual categories based on annual sales or interstate commerce engagement. Certain exemptions apply to state and local elected officials and specific types of employees. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) covers individuals and enterprises, defining \"covered\" or \"nonexempt\" and \"exempt\" categories. Approximately 83% of wage and salary workers are covered by FLSA regulations, including overtime pay requirements. Nonexempt employees must receive one-and-a-half times their regular pay for overtime work, unless specifically exempted. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) covers \"nonexempt\" employees who must receive one-and-a-half times their regular pay for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Overtime pay is applied on a workweek basis, allowing flexibility in daily work hours. For example, employers can schedule 4 10-hour workdays without paying overtime. The FLSA exempts various groups from overtime coverage, including executive, administrative, and professional employees, commissioned sales employees, farmworkers, and others. These exemptions may have additional requirements for employees to qualify as exempt. The FLSA exempts executive, administrative, and professional employees from minimum wage and overtime provisions. The terms are defined by the Secretary of Labor through regulations. EAP employees' work output was not clearly tied to hours worked, and they were seen to have other compensation benefits. The Secretary of Labor defines exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees under the FLSA. To qualify for exemption from overtime pay, employees must meet salary basis, duties, and salary level tests. In 2004, a \"highly compensated employee\" exemption was also created. The \"highly compensated employee\" (HCE) exemption allows employees earning above the standard EAP salary threshold to be exempt from overtime if they perform EAP duties and are paid on a salary basis. Job titles do not determine exemption status; rather, specific duties outlined by the Secretary of Labor must be met. For executive employees to qualify for exemption, they must meet specific job duties tests related to managing the enterprise. To qualify for the exemption for administrative employees, the employee's primary duty must be office or non-manual work related to management or business operations, and include discretion and independent judgment. For the exemption for professional employees, the primary duty must involve the performance of office or non-manual work related to management or business operations. The exemption for professional employees requires the primary duty to involve work requiring advanced knowledge or creativity. The employee must also earn above a certain salary threshold, currently set at $913 per week ($47,476 annually) as of December 1, 2016. The salary threshold for exemption from overtime pay in the South region is currently $913 per week ($47,476 annually). This threshold has been raised eight times since the enactment of the FLSA in 1938, including the 2016 increase. Prior to 2004, the salary level for exemption varied by employee type and duty test. The 2016 final rule also established the HCE salary threshold. The 2016 final rule established the HCE salary threshold at $134,004, which is the 90th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally. It also adjusted special salary tests for American Samoan employees and the motion picture producing industry. The 2016 final rule increased the salary level test for EAP exemptions to $913 per week ($47,476 annually) and the HCE exemption threshold to $134,004 annually. It also indexed the salary level to the 40th percentile of weekly earnings for automatic updates every three years. Up to 10% of the standard salary level can now be comprised of bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions. The 2016 final rule increased the salary level test for EAP exemptions to $913 per week and implemented automatic updates every three years based on the 40th percentile of weekly earnings. The standard salary level can now include up to 10% of bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions. Starting December 1, 2016, the salary level threshold for EAP exemptions will be based on the 40th percentile of weekly earnings in the lowest wage Census region. The Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) salary level is set at $134,004 per year. In American Samoa, the salary level is $767 per week (84% of the standard level). For the motion picture producing industry, the salary level is $1,397 per week. These levels will be adjusted every three years starting January 1, 2020. Starting January 1, 2020, the motion picture producing industry salary level will be adjusted every three years by the same percentage as the standard salary level. EAP employees making between $455 per week and the new rate of $913 per week in 2016 should become nonexempt and entitled to overtime pay. Independent contractors are not covered by FLSA provisions, and there is no general exemption for nonprofits in the FLSA or the overtime rule. Nonprofit workers are subject to enterprise and individual coverage tests under the FLSA. Charitable activities do not count towards the $500,000 threshold for enterprise coverage. Only commercial activities like gift shops and fee-for-service count. Nonprofit employees may still be covered by the FLSA if they engage in interstate commerce. The FLSA and the 2016 final rule apply to institutes of higher education. Many personnel at IHEs may not be eligible for coverage under the FLSA. Many personnel at institutes of higher education (IHEs) are not eligible for overtime under the FLSA. Bona fide teachers, coaches, graduate and undergraduate students, and academic administrative personnel are exempt. However, postdoctoral researchers, nonacademic administrative employees, and other salaried workers at IHEs may be affected by the 2016 final rule on overtime. Public IHEs have the option of using compensatory time. Public IHEs have the option of using compensatory time (1.5 hours for each hour of overtime) instead of cash payment for overtime compensation, unlike private sector employers. State and local governments are not exempt from FLSA and overtime rule coverage, with employees being affected by the 2016 final rule updating the salary level threshold for EAP exemptions. FLSA provisions apply to state and local governments, affecting the applicability of overtime rules for public sector employees. Overtime rules may apply differently in the public sector, allowing for the use of compensatory time in lieu of cash payment. Public IHEs have the option of using compensatory time (1.5 hours for each hour of overtime) instead of cash payment for overtime compensation. Certain state and local employees, such as elected officials and legislative branch employees not subject to civil service laws, are not covered by the FLSA and will not be affected by the 2016 final rule. Fire protection and law enforcement employees may be exempt from overtime pay requirements if employed by an agency with fewer than five employees in those roles. The 2016 final rule under the FLSA allows overtime for fire protection and law enforcement employees to be calculated on a \"work period\" rather than a \"workweek.\" The rule becomes effective on December 1, 2016, with salary level thresholds for EAP exemptions updated every three years starting from January 1, 2020. DOL issued a \"time-limited non-enforcement\" policy for certain employers until March 17, 2019. The 2016 final rule under the FLSA allows overtime for fire protection and law enforcement employees to be calculated on a \"work period\" rather than a \"workweek.\" Congress can pass legislation to repeal rules or compel new rules for providers of Medicaid-funded services for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities in residential homes and facilities with 15 or fewer beds. The 2016 final rule increases the salary level threshold for the EAP exemption, making more employees eligible for overtime pay. Employers have options to comply with the proposed regulations, such as paying overtime to newly covered EAP employees or increasing the weekly pay for workers near the salary threshold. The 2016 final rule increases the salary threshold for EAP employees to be exempt from overtime pay. Employers have options to adjust, such as reducing work hours, hiring additional workers, or reducing base pay to offset costs. It is uncertain how many employees will no longer be exempt under the new rule. The Department of Labor estimates that approximately 13.1 million workers would be affected by the proposed rule, with 4.2 million EAP employees becoming newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 8.9 million workers receiving strengthened overtime protections. Approximately 3.2 million salaried workers in blue-collar occupations could gain overtime protections with the new salary threshold, reducing misclassification for exemption purposes. This group of workers should already be covered by overtime provisions but may not be due to worker classification. The application of FLSA provisions is determined by the Congressional Accountability Act. The Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) extends FLSA provisions, including overtime rules, to congressional employees. The Office of Compliance enforces the CAA, with regulations needing approval from Congress to take legal effect. Current overtime regulations for congressional staff date back to 1996, based on DOL rules from 1975, as newer regulations have not been approved. The 2016 final rule will not change the current overtime regulations for congressional staff, which have been in place since 1996 and are based on DOL rules from 1975."
