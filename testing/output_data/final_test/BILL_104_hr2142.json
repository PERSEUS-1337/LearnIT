This section defines terms such as \"departmental laboratory,\" \"Federal laboratory,\" \"relevant congressional committees,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Congress recognizes the departmental laboratories' core competencies and contributions to national security through technology development, including nuclear deterrent maintenance. They have helped prevent global conflicts and maintain peace for the United States. The departmental laboratories play a crucial role in achieving national technology goals through collaborative partnerships with other Federal agencies, universities, and private industry. Collaboration is encouraged to maximize the return on investment in research and development. The departmental laboratories play a crucial role in achieving national technology goals through collaborative partnerships with other Federal agencies, universities, and private industry. They need well-defined missions to contribute effectively to the scientific, technological, and national security interests of the United States. The departmental laboratories require well-defined missions to contribute effectively to national technology goals and interests. The Department of Energy maintains laboratories to advance core missions including national security by managing nuclear weapons stockpile, reducing nuclear threats, and countering weapons proliferation. The Department of Energy conducts research on weapons of mass destruction and technologies for arms control agreements, advances science and technology for national security purposes, and works to reduce the nation's reliance on imported energy sources. The Department of Energy conducts research on weapons of mass destruction, advances science and technology for national security, and works to reduce the nation's reliance on imported energy sources through research and development on energy supply and efficiency improvement, emphasizing long-term, high-risk research. The Department of Energy collaborates with other agencies and institutions for research and development, focusing on safe disposal of hazardous wastes and additional missions assigned by the President. SEC. 103 outlines the procedure for proposing laboratory mission assignments and streamlining. The Secretary will publish criteria for mission assignment and streamlining of departmental laboratories within 3 months of the Act's enactment, allowing for public comment for at least 30 days. The criteria will consider unique technical capabilities at each laboratory. The criteria for streamlining departmental laboratories will consider technical capabilities, duplication of effort, cost savings, potential research performance by other entities, and expert advice from outside sources. The Secretary will publish final criteria for mission assignments and streamlining of departmental laboratories within 5 months of the Act's enactment. Within 1 year, the Secretary will propose mission assignments and streamlining based on the final criteria. The Secretary will formulate proposals for departmental laboratories based on final criteria and mission assignments. The process will include soliciting advice from outside experts and providing a summary with justifications for each proposal. The Secretary will make all information available to the Comptroller General, who will report on the proposals within 15 months. The Secretary will formulate proposals for departmental laboratories based on final criteria and mission assignments, seeking advice from outside experts. A report containing a detailed analysis of the Secretary's proposals and procedures will be transmitted to the relevant congressional committees within 15 months of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary is tasked with assigning missions to departmental laboratories as proposed in a report to congressional committees, streamlining identified laboratories, and completing these tasks within a 4-year period. Additionally, reports on the implementation of these assignments are required. SEC. 105. REPORTS ON IMPLEMENTATION.\n\nThe Secretary must provide reports to congressional committees detailing mission assignments, cost savings, and transfers of functions to departmental laboratories as part of the budget request for each fiscal year. The Congress notes an excessive focus on compliance and management issues within the Department of Energy and its laboratories, leading to a negative impact on research performance. There is a growing emphasis on administrative and support organizations, which hinders research operations. Additionally, nonregulatory advisory boards have been given too much influence, resulting in unnecessary expenditures and productivity losses. Enforcement of environmental, safety, and health rules is handled by government agencies other than the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy will not enforce environmental, safety, and health rules at departmental laboratories unless deemed necessary for human health and safety. This provision will be effective starting October 1, 1996."
