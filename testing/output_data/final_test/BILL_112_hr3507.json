The Congress finds that a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, causing over 316,000 deaths, including American citizens and UN personnel. The earthquake had an epicenter near Port-au-Prince and was followed by numerous aftershocks. Approximately 3 million people were directly affected. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti directly affected an estimated 3 million people, displacing over 2.1 million from their homes. The disaster caused extensive casualties, infrastructure damage, and economic losses totaling $7.8 billion, equivalent to 120% of Haiti's GDP in 2009. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, faced a devastating earthquake in 2010. More than 70% of Haitians lived on less than $2 per day before the disaster. House Resolution 1021 expressed condolences and support for Haiti's recovery. The initial emergency response was led by the United States Government. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the United States Government swiftly activated urban search and rescue teams from various locations to assist in the disaster response. A month later, the House of Representatives unanimously passed House Resolution 1059 in support of Haiti's recovery efforts. House Resolution 1059 expressed gratitude to USAR units for their efforts in Haiti, where they rescued over 130 people from the rubble. Various individuals, businesses, and organizations supported Haiti through innovative methods like text messaging fundraising. The Haitian diaspora in the US played a crucial role in emergency relief efforts by providing significant monetary support through remittances. Significant challenges remain in Haiti as it works to recover and rebuild, with approximately 680,000 people still in camps. Reconstruction efforts have been slow, and irregularities in the 2010 elections caused unrest. The elections in Haiti on November 28, 2010, led to violence, while an outbreak of cholera in October was exacerbated by Hurricane Tomas, causing widespread flooding and the spread of the disease. As of March 28, 2011, approximately 4,766 people have died and 270,991 have been infected with cholera. The United States has provided over $62 million in assistance to combat the cholera epidemic in Haiti, reducing the mortality rate from nearly 7 percent to 1.7 percent. The efforts have included stockpiling health commodities, equipping treatment centers, providing public information, and improving water and sanitation systems. Haiti continues to show resilience, dignity, and courage throughout the crises. On March 20, 2011, Haiti held presidential and parliamentary elections without major disruptions. An international donors conference in March 2010 pledged over $5 billion to support Haiti, with $1.9 billion disbursed and $2 billion committed. Haiti will need ongoing international support to address the cholera epidemic and promote reconstruction and development. Beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, no alien may be removed to Haiti until the report described in section 4 is issued. The President, with agency heads, must report to Congress on post-earthquake efforts in Haiti, including cholera prevention and treatment. The report will assess relief, recovery, and reconstruction progress, including US and other projects. The report to Congress on post-earthquake efforts in Haiti must include programs to protect vulnerable populations, improve water, sanitation, and health, and coordinate efforts among US agencies and international partners. The report on post-earthquake efforts in Haiti must address mechanisms for communication, civil society participation, diaspora involvement, and Haiti's capacity to receive deported individuals from the US. Funding for the report will come from existing discretionary funds. Funding for the report on post-earthquake efforts in Haiti must come from existing discretionary funds of specified departments and agencies."
