    "content": "The Director of ONDCP has the authority to designate areas within the United States as HIDTAs, after consulting with relevant authorities. Four main criteria are considered for designation: the area's significance in illegal drug activities, commitment of law enforcement resources, harmful impact of drug-related activities, and increased allocation of resources. The HIDTA program designates counties as critical drug trafficking areas, with 29 designated HIDTAs in the US and its territories. Each HIDTA region has its own Executive Board, while the program is administered nationally by ONDCP. The most recent HIDTA established was the Alaska HIDTA in 2018. Each HIDTA region has its own Executive Board with representatives from federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. The boards are responsible for setting goals, managing funds, selecting directors, and designing initiatives to combat drug trafficking threats in their respective regions. The boards have the discretion to tailor strategies and evaluate ongoing initiatives. The HIDTA Executive Boards meet regularly to evaluate initiatives, ensure compliance with program requirements, and determine funding for task force initiatives in their regions. Funding for the HIDTA program has increased over the past decade, reaching $280.0 million for FY2018. The HIDTA Executive Boards determine funding for task force initiatives in their regions, with base funding ranging from $3.1 million to $14.6 million, except for the Southwest border HIDTA which received over $48.7 million. The remaining appropriation is allocated to specific initiatives nationwide, focusing on enforcement and intelligence sharing activities. The HIDTA program focuses on combating drug-related crimes through intelligence sharing, support activities, prevention efforts, and management coordination. Funding is determined by HIDTA Executive Boards, with a prohibition on using funds for drug treatment programs since 2006. However, the Washington/Baltimore HIDTA continues to support drug courts in its region. The HIDTA program focuses on combating drug-related crimes through intelligence sharing, support activities, and prevention efforts. HIDTAs now prioritize drug prevention initiatives, with initiatives like the Domestic Highway Enforcement strategy and the National Emerging Threats Initiative coordinating efforts to counter drug trafficking and emerging drug threats. The HIDTA program addresses drug-related crimes through intelligence sharing, support activities, and prevention efforts. Policymakers may debate funding and oversight issues, including the effectiveness of the program and its criteria for inclusion. Currently, counties are the unit of inclusion for HIDTAs, with no mechanism for enrolling specific cities or states. The HIDTA program addresses drug-related crimes through intelligence sharing, support activities, and prevention efforts. Currently, counties are the unit of inclusion for HIDTAs, with policymakers questioning if this is the most suitable unit and considering changing it to a different jurisdictional level. Changing the unit of inclusion in the HIDTA program from counties to states or cities raises questions about effectively targeting areas in need of additional law enforcement resources for countering drug trafficking. Including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories may not address the most critical areas, as some states may only have specific regions impacted by drug trafficking. Mechanisms to ensure sufficient resources in HIDTAs would need to be considered if entire states were included. The HIDTA program may need mechanisms to ensure resources reach critical regions and have nimble policies for shifting designations. Policymakers may want to track changes in drug trafficking activity before, during, and after counties are designated as HIDTAs, but national data on this is lacking. National data on drug trafficking at the county level is scarce, with databases reflecting seizures and investigations by federal law enforcement agencies. Policymakers may need to explore changes in drug trafficking activity before and after counties are designated as HIDTAs. The criteria for evaluating counties for HIDTA inclusion are crucial for law enforcement initiatives. Policymakers must ensure that at-risk counties are identified accurately. One key criterion is the extent of illegal drug activity in an area, raising questions about what defines a \"significant center.\" The evaluation criteria for designating counties as part of a HIDTA are crucial for law enforcement initiatives. Policymakers need to understand what constitutes a \"significant center\" of illegal drug activity and whether standardized metrics are used for evaluation. Policymakers may question the metrics ONDCP uses and whether they need to be altered based on trends in drug production. The HIDTA Executive Boards annually evaluate counties for HIDTA designation based on drug trends. If a county no longer meets requirements, the board can petition for its removal. Policymakers question the metrics used for designation and removal. ONDCP evaluates HIDTAs to ensure effectiveness in reducing drug availability and improving initiatives. The Performance Management Process assesses individual HIDTAs and the program as a whole. HIDTAs must provide a threat assessment, strategy, and budget proposal annually. Comparisons between HIDTAs' performance are not allowed. The HIDTA program aims to address drug trafficking threats in critical areas by providing enhanced law enforcement coordination. Policymakers may question the reliability of measuring results and effectiveness, as well as the allocation of discretionary funds based on needs and performance. The HIDTA program focuses on combating drug production and trafficking in high-threat areas, particularly targeting criminal organizations like Mexican drug trafficking groups. Policymakers may question how the program evaluates its indirect impact on combating other crimes. HIDTA funding supports various initiatives such as enforcement, intelligence sharing, prevention, treatment, and coordination, with specific restrictions in place. The HIDTA program focuses on combating drug production and trafficking in high-threat areas, targeting criminal organizations like Mexican drug trafficking groups. HIDTA funding supports initiatives such as enforcement, intelligence sharing, prevention, and coordination. Specific restrictions apply to the use of HIDTA funds for prevention and treatment activities, with limitations on establishing or expanding drug treatment programs. HIDTA Executive Boards are encouraged to develop prevention initiatives to enhance collaboration between law enforcement and the public health community. The HIDTA program focuses on combating drug production and trafficking in high-threat areas, supporting initiatives like enforcement, intelligence sharing, prevention, and coordination. HIDTAs are encouraged to engage community-based coalitions, prevention programs, and public health stakeholders to implement evidence-based prevention activities. The Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) was launched in 2015 to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt trafficking in illicit opioids through partnerships among public safety and public health agencies at all levels. At the end of 2017, 8 HIDTAs across 20 states were participating in the HRS, coordinating teams of drug intelligence officers and public health analysts. The HIDTA program focuses on combating drug production and trafficking in high-threat areas, supporting initiatives like enforcement, intelligence sharing, prevention, and coordination. The Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) provides information on drug use and trafficking, as well as prevention activities. Policymakers may question the constraints on how HIDTA funds are spent on prevention and treatment activities and how this may affect the program's focus. The HIDTA program has been administered by ONDCP, which coordinates federal drug control efforts. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for creating policies and objectives to reduce illicit drug use, crime, and health consequences. The Administration proposes transferring the HIDTA program from ONDCP to the Department of Justice (DOJ), specifically the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). ONDCP currently leads the HIDTA program, which provides resources to law enforcement agencies. The DEA, as part of the DOJ, does not currently manage grant programs. Moving the HIDTA program from ONDCP to the DEA raises questions about the DEA's capacity for grants administration and the program's collaborative nature in supporting law enforcement agencies nationwide in combating drug trafficking."
