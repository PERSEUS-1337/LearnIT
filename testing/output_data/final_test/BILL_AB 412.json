    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 56000.5 of the Education Code is amended to address the specialized needs of pupils with low-incidence disabilities, such as deafness, emphasizing the importance of communication for their well-being and growth. These pupils make up less than 1 percent of statewide enrollment and require highly specialized services and materials. It is crucial for hard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal children to have fully accessible educational opportunities that respect their unique communication mode and provide specialized services from trained professionals. It is essential for hard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal children to have an education that includes proficient special education teachers, language mode peers, parental involvement, and program determination. Hard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal children benefit from exposure to role models and need direct access to all educational components, including vocational support. Hard-of-hearing, deaf, and nonverbal children should have a determination of the least restrictive educational environment and benefit from regional programs for low-incidence disabilities. The Education Code is amended to include English and Mathematics instruction for grades 1 to 6. The curriculum includes Mathematics, Social sciences (anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, sociology), and Science (biological and physical aspects with emphasis on experimental inquiry and human ecology). The curriculum also includes instruction in visual and performing arts, health principles, physical education, and other prescribed studies by the governing board. A complaint can be filed if a school district fails to comply with physical education requirements. The complaint can be filed locally or through Uniform Complaint Procedures. If unsatisfied with the decision, the complainant can appeal to the Superintendent and should receive a written decision within 60 days. If a complaint is found to have merit, the school district must provide a remedy to affected individuals. Legal action cannot be taken against a school district for noncompliance with physical education requirements without following local or Uniform Complaint Procedures. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
