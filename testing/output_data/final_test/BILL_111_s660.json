The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a Conference on Pain with the Institute of Medicine to address the recognition and management of pain as a public health issue in the United States. The Conference aims to evaluate pain assessment, diagnosis, and treatment adequacy, identify barriers to appropriate pain care, and focus on specific demographic groups disproportionately affected by pain inadequacies. Gaps in understanding and education exist among employers, patients, healthcare providers, regulators, and payors.
