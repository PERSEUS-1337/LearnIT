    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $75.1 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2018, proposing significant cuts in funding for competitive grant programs, zeroing out the TIGER infrastructure investment grant program and the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, and reducing spending on public transportation capital grants and Amtrak's long-distance trains. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $77.5 billion for DOT, a 0.5% increase over the FY2017 amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $78.6 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2018, which was 2% higher than the FY2017 amount and 4.7% above the Administration request. Final FY2018 appropriations were delayed until March 2018 due to conflicts over funding levels and spending limits, with an omnibus spending bill eventually providing $86.2 billion for DOT, an increase of 11.8% over the previous year. Division L, the DOT Appropriations Act, provided $86.2 billion for the Department of Transportation in FY2018, which was 11.8% higher than in FY2017. Unlike most federal agencies, DOT receives most of its funding from mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with discretionary appropriations making up a smaller portion. The shift in funding between discretionary and mandatory sources can be seen in Table 1. In FY2018, DOT's funding from trust funds decreased to 83% despite an increase in discretionary budget authority. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration is the largest sub-agency responsible for air traffic control. The Department of Transportation (DOT) primarily funds its operations through trust funds, with most revenue coming from taxes. Reauthorizations of these taxes and budget allocations are crucial for DOT funding. While highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, the federal aviation program's authorization was extended to FY2018. DOT's nonemergency funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal terms. Adjusting for inflation provides a different perspective on funding trends. The Department of Transportation's funding increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018. Adjusting for inflation, funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015, then began rising again in FY2016. In FY2016 and FY2017, real funding was similar to FY2006, while from FY2012-FY2017, inflation-adjusted funding was lower than during FY2007-FY2011. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, funded by the federal motor fuels excise tax. Annual expenditures from the fund have exceeded revenues in recent years. The Highway Trust Fund faces a projected shortfall as revenues and interest are estimated at $41 billion, while outlays are projected at $54 billion. Congress transferred $143 billion from the Treasury's general fund to the trust fund between FY2008-FY2016 to maintain solvency. The fund's shortfall is attributed to the stagnant federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, which collects a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold. Inflation and increased fuel efficiency have eroded the tax's value, impacting revenue generation. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increased fuel efficiency offsetting more miles driven. Highway Trust Fund revenues are projected at $39-41 billion annually, falling short of expenditures. The Administration and House committee did not request funding for TIGER grants in FY2018, while the Senate committee recommended $550 million with a focus on rural areas. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, provides $1.5 billion for projects, with 30% allocated to rural areas. It aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by funding projects with national or regional impacts. The TIGER program provides grants for projects with national, regional, or metropolitan significance in various transportation modes on a competitive basis. Funding has mainly gone towards regional and metropolitan projects due to congressional directives for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes. The TIGER program offers grants for transportation projects with national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with low minimum grant thresholds. Despite being oversubscribed, Congress continues to support the program through annual DOT appropriations. The selection process has raised concerns about the integrity of awarding grants to lower-ranked projects over higher-ranked ones. The TIGER grant program, funded through annual DOT appropriations, aims to support transportation projects of national significance. Critics argue that grants disproportionately favor urban areas, but Congress has directed that a portion of funding should go to rural projects. In recent years, there has been a push to increase the allocation for rural areas, with the FY2018 grants seeing an increase to 30%. The grant appropriation process typically involves the Obama Administration requesting more funding, the House proposing cuts or elimination, the Senate proposing a similar amount to previous years, and Congress ultimately agreeing on a final amount. The FY2018 appropriations process saw changes with the Trump Administration not requesting funding for TIGER grants. The enacted legislation included increased funding for various infrastructure projects beyond authorized levels, funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority. The Essential Air Service program is financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines for international flights passing through U.S. airspace. The Trump Administration did not request discretionary funding for the Essential Air Service program in FY2018, proposing to use only available mandatory funding. The House committee bill recommended a $150 million discretionary appropriation, while the Senate committee bill recommended $155 million. The enacted bill provided $155 million in discretionary funding, identical to the Senate's recommendation. The enacted bill provided $155 million in discretionary funding for the Essential Air Service program, combined with an increase in mandatory funding totaling $286 million, an 8.7% increase over FY2017. The program aims to maintain commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Changes made in 2012 included capping subsidies per passenger and allowing smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. Supporters of the Essential Air Service (EAS) program argue that it is necessary to maintain airline service to small communities as promised during airline deregulation in 1978. They believe that subsidizing air service in rural areas promotes economic development. Critics point out the high cost per passenger, low passenger numbers at EAS airports, and proximity to major airports. In 2008, Congress mandated the installation of positive train control (PTC) on certain rail segments by 2015 to prevent incidents caused by human error. Freight railroads have spent billions to install Positive Train Control (PTC) to prevent incidents caused by human error. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for railroads to extend to 2020. Funding has been provided for PTC implementation, with $250 million allocated in the FY2018 bill. The RRIF loan program provides loans for rail facilities and equipment. It has less than $5 billion outstanding and has made only four loans since 2012. The FY2018 appropriation act provided funding to subsidize the credit risk premium for loan recipients. The RRIF loan program has faced criticism for not repaying credit risk premiums to borrowers who have paid off their loans. Congress has directed the Department of Transportation (DOT) to define a cohort of loans as all loans executed in a particular year and to repay the credit risk premiums when all loans in a cohort have been repaid. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and changed the structure of its federal grants. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and introduced new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The FY2018 budget requested $811 million for intercity passenger rail funding, with varying recommendations from the House and Senate committees for funding allocations. The FY2018 budget provided $1.9 billion for Amtrak, a 30% increase from FY2017, and $863 million for new grant programs for intercity passenger rail services. This funding included $98 million for three new intercity passenger rail grants, marking the first funding for such projects since the 111th Congress. The FY2018 budget allocated $1.9 billion for Amtrak, a 30% increase from FY2017, and $863 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs. Funding for intercity passenger rail development had been lacking from FY2011 to FY2016, with $400 million rescinded in FY2011. The Federal Transit Administration distributes roughly $12 billion to state and local transit agencies, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit projects. The Capital Investment Grants program includes New Starts for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity. There is also an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for projects with no more than a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. Funding for large projects is disbursed over years, with a decrease in funding requested by the Trump Administration for FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program for FY2018 saw a decrease in funding compared to FY2017. The Administration aimed to fund previously approved projects only, with high demand for new transit services. The House Committee recommended $1.8 billion, while the Senate Committee recommended $2.1 billion, both differing from the Administration's request. Funding for new projects was limited, except for the Amtrak's Hudson Tunnel project. The final FY2018 act provided $2.6 billion for the Capital Investment Grants program, exceeding the requested amount by 73% but falling 12% below the FY2017 level. Both the House and Senate committee bills included language directing DOT to carry out the program as described in statute, with an added directive to obligate $2.253 billion by December 31, 2019. The FY2018 act provided $2.6 billion for the Capital Investment Grants program, with a provision limiting the federal share for New Starts projects to 51%, lower than the typical 80% for highway projects. Critics argue this makes highway projects more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates argue that requiring a higher local match for New Starts funding allows the FTA to support more projects and encourages careful cost estimation. Challenges in funding transportation infrastructure include the distribution of federal funding by mode and difficulty in accessing significant amounts for projects involving multiple modes. The Amtrak's Gateway Program aims to improve rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. Funding challenges exist due to the automatic division of federal funding among states for transportation projects. The Northeast Corridor, including the New Jersey to New York route, is deteriorating and was flooded during Hurricane Sandy. The Gateway Program, estimated at $24 billion, includes the new $11.1 billion Hudson Tunnel. Funding challenges exist for intercity rail projects, with limited grants available. The Capital Investment Grants program has more funding at $2.4 billion in FY2017, but competition is intense. The largest grant awarded in the past 10 years was $2.6 billion for the Hudson Tunnel project. In 2016, an agreement was reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the states of New Jersey and New York to share costs. The Trump Administration's stance on funding is unknown, leaving it up to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee did not allocate significant funding for the project in FY2018. Funding sources like the TIGER Grant Program and Capital Investment Grants program are facing cuts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $400 million for new transportation projects meeting specific criteria, but did not allocate funding for the Hudson Tunnel replacement. The committee suggested using funds from the State of Good Repair grant program for projects similar to the Gateway Program. The enacted bill did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project but provided additional funding for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and the State of Good Repair program. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital grants, with Congress providing $150 million annually. WMATA faces maintenance backlog and safety concerns. The safety culture of WMATA has been questioned due to incidents and mismanagement of federal funding. FTA took over safety oversight from the Tri-State Oversight Committee in 2015, conducting inspections and directing funds for safety improvements. In 2017, FTA notified leaders of withholding funds until a new State Safety Oversight Program is created. The jurisdictions passed legislation to establish a new safety oversight agency to replace the Tri-State Oversight Committee. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended oversight of WMATA's rail operations be assigned to FRA instead of FTA. Congress would need to act to give FRA authority over WMATA. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended a $150 million annual grant for WMATA in FY2018. The Senate committee expressed frustration at WMATA's slow progress in providing wireless service as mandated in 2008. The FY2018 grant of $150 million to WMATA is the final installment of the $1.5 billion funding commitment made by Congress in 2008. The enacted bill requires improvements to WMATA's safety management system for the grants to be provided."
