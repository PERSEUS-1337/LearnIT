    "content": "The \"Shareholder Bill of Rights Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that the financial and economic crises in the United States have been caused by a widespread failure of corporate governance. This failure includes executives and boards of directors not enacting compensation policies tied to long-term profitability, neglecting enterprise risk analysis, and not prioritizing the long-term health of their firms and shareholders, resulting in trillions of dollars in shareholder losses. The failure of corporate governance has led to trillions of dollars in shareholder losses. Shareholders should have more accountability and the ability to nominate and elect board members. Congress intended for the Securities and Exchange Commission to have full authority in this matter, balancing shareholder voice with management prerogatives for the benefit of all stakeholders. SEC. 14A requires annual shareholder approval of executive compensation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proxy solicitation rules require shareholder approval of executive compensation disclosed in the proxy materials. The shareholder vote is not binding on the board of directors and does not change their fiduciary duties. The proxy solicitation rules do not create additional fiduciary duties for the board or restrict shareholders from making proposals related to executive compensation. Shareholders must approve golden parachute compensation in proxy materials for certain corporate events. The proxy solicitation material must disclose any agreements with executive officers related to compensation for corporate events, requiring a separate shareholder vote for approval. The Securities and Exchange Commission must establish rules within one year of the enactment of this Act regarding shareholder votes on executive compensation, clarifying that such votes are not binding on the board of directors and do not alter their fiduciary duties. The Securities and Exchange Commission will issue final rules to implement section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within one year of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. SHAREHOLDER INPUT IN BOARD ELECTIONS. Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to confirm the Commission's authority on shareholder access to proxies for board nominations. The Commission shall establish rules for shareholders to use proxy solicitation materials for nominating individuals to the board of directors of an issuer. Shareholders must meet certain requirements for using these materials. Shareholders must have owned at least one percent of voting securities for two years before the annual meeting to access proxies for board nominations. SEC. 5. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS. Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include new corporate governance standards for listing securities. The Commission will direct national securities exchanges to prohibit listing securities of issuers not in compliance with specified requirements within a year of enactment. Procedures will be provided for issuers to rectify non-compliance. The Commission may exempt certain issuers from requirements based on criteria such as size, market capitalization, and number of shareholders. Each issuer must ensure director independence in governing documents or public statements. The chairperson of the board of directors of an issuer must be independent and not have previously served as an executive officer. Each member of the board must be subject to annual election by shareholders as per governing documents. The board of directors of an issuer must be subject to annual election by shareholders. In board elections, directors in uncontested elections are elected by a majority of votes cast, while in contested elections, directors are elected by a plurality of the shares represented at any meeting. Each issuer must have a risk committee established one year after final rules issuance. The committee should be comprised entirely of directors. The risk committee, comprised of independent directors, is responsible for evaluating the issuer's risk management practices. Commission rules for establishing risk committees must be issued within one year of this subsection's enactment."
