    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Clean Diamond Trade Act\" and includes findings related to the diamond trade. The Congress finds that funds from the sale of rough diamonds are fueling conflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, leading to millions of displaced people and millions of deaths. Nearly 70,000,000 people in these countries are affected by the devastating consequences of the diamond trade. The diamond trade has caused conflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, affecting nearly 70,000,000 people. Efforts by human rights advocates, the diamond trade represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United States Government aim to end the trade in conflict diamonds. The United Nations Security Council has taken action to address threats to international peace and security related to conflicts linked to diamonds. The United States implemented sanctions on the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia to prevent trade in conflict diamonds, which could harm the economies of countries involved in the diamond trade. The United States and over 30 other countries are working through the Kimberley Process to address the issue of conflict diamonds. Failure to differentiate between conflict diamonds and legitimate ones could harm the legitimate diamond trade in countries like Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania. The US, as a major consumer of diamonds, has a responsibility to help end the link between diamonds and conflict. Initiatives of the United States aim to resolve regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa related to conflict diamonds. The Interlaken Declaration on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme emphasizes the importance of implementing measures consistent with international trade rules. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, rough diamonds importation or exportation is controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme if it meets specified standards set by the President. The term \"exporting authority\" refers to entities designated by a Participant. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme controls rough diamond importation and exportation by validating certificates. Exporting authority designates entities for export, while importing authority enforces import laws and verifies certificates. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme establishes standards for rough diamond trade, with definitions for terms like \"Kimberley Process Certification Scheme,\" \"Participant,\" and \"Person.\" The term \"person\" refers to an individual or entity. A \"rough diamond\" is an unworked diamond classified under specific subheadings. The term \"United States\" includes states, the District of Columbia, and territories. A \"United States person\" is a citizen, permanent resident, or entity organized under US laws. The term \"person\" refers to an individual or entity, while a \"United States person\" includes citizens, permanent residents, or entities organized under US laws. The curr_chunk specifies that the term \"United States\" encompasses states, the District of Columbia, and territories, as well as any jurisdiction within the United States, including its foreign branches, and any person in the United States. SEC. 4. MEASURES FOR IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION OF ROUGH DIAMONDS: The President must prohibit the importation or exportation of rough diamonds into or from the US unless controlled by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Waivers can be granted for up to 1 year if a country is implementing the scheme effectively or if it is in the US national interest. SEC. 5. REGULATORY AND OTHER AUTHORITY. The President is authorized to issue proclamations, regulations, and conduct investigations to carry out the Act. US persons exporting or importing rough diamonds must keep records and provide information as required. The President shall oversee annual reviews of US entities involved in the diamond trade. The President conducts annual reviews of US entities issuing Kimberley Process Certificates for rough diamond exports to ensure compliance with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. A report on each review is sent to Congress. SEC. 6. IMPORTING AND EXPORTING AUTHORITIES. The United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection is the importing authority, and the Bureau of the Census is the exporting authority. The Secretary of State will publish a list of all Participants' authorities in the Federal Register. SEC. 7. STATEMENT OF POLICY. Congress supports promoting the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme internationally. SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT. (a) In General, civil penalties up to $10,000 can be imposed for violating any license, order, or regulation under this Act. Willful violations can result in fines up to $50,000, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. Officers, directors, or agents of corporations involved in violations may also face penalties. (b) Import Violations are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including seizure and forfeiture, under U.S. customs laws. States that laws applying to goods imported in violation shall also apply to rough diamonds imported in violation of this Act or any related regulations, licenses, or orders. The President may provide technical assistance to countries implementing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Congress acknowledges this as a positive step. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, launched in 2003, is an ongoing process. Congress urges the President to work with Participants to strengthen the scheme by sharing statistics on diamond production and trade, and monitoring its effectiveness. Reliable data on international diamond trade is essential for implementing the scheme effectively. The executive branch should maintain and publish statistics on rough diamond imports and exports, make them available for analysis by interested parties and Participants, and lead negotiations for a standardized reporting methodology among Participants for the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. SEC. 11. REPORTS. The President must submit annual reports to Congress detailing actions taken by countries exporting rough diamonds to the US through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Additionally, countries exporting diamonds not controlled by the scheme must be identified if it increases the likelihood of these diamonds being imported into the US. The President must submit semiannual reports to Congress on actions taken to prevent the importation of diamonds not controlled by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme from identified countries. Reports are required until the country effectively controls the import and export of rough diamonds through the scheme. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within 24 months of the Act's effective date on the effectiveness of preventing prohibited rough diamond importation or exportation. Any necessary modifications to the Act will be recommended in the report. The Act will take effect when the President certifies that a waiver from the World Trade Organization or a decision from the United Nations Security Council is in effect. The Act will remain in effect as long as the waiver or decision is in effect."
