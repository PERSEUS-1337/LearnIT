    "content": "Transportation conformity, mandated by the Clean Air Act, ensures that federal actions and funding for transportation projects do not harm air quality in areas that have not met national standards. Non-conforming projects risk losing federal funds, prompting state and local governments to assess and modify projects to protect air quality. Federal departments and agencies are prohibited from supporting activities that do not conform to state standards. Under the Clean Air Act, states must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). SIPs include measures to reduce emissions and reach attainment by set deadlines. Non-conforming projects risk losing federal funds, prompting modifications to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act requires states to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by set deadlines. Nonattainment areas must show annual emission reductions to reach attainment, while maintenance areas must demonstrate compliance over a 20-year period. Conformity requirements apply to both types of areas, with detailed criteria outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations. Conformity to a State Implementation Plan (SIP) ensures that projects or programs do not worsen air quality violations or delay meeting national standards. Transportation planning, especially highway funding, is heavily impacted as it contributes to four out of six NAAQS pollutants. A regional emissions analysis is required before approval of new transportation plans or projects to demonstrate compliance with emission standards. The transportation system must demonstrate conformity with emissions ceilings set in the SIP. Analysis involves federal, state, regional, and local planners, with determinations made by the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration based on emission estimates. The conformity determinations for transportation plans and programs are based on emissions, population, employment, travel, and traffic congestion data. The MPO or state DOT estimates vehicle miles traveled and emissions using EPA mobile source emissions models. The plans must demonstrate conformity every four years and be re-determined within two years of a new State Implementation Plan or emissions budget approval. The regulations allow for a limited set of exempt projects to proceed in the absence of conformity with the vehicle emissions budget. These exempt projects include highway safety, transit facility rehabilitation, bus and rail car purchases, noise attenuation, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Projects that are \"air quality neutral\" can also continue during a conformity lapse if they were previously approved and funded in the transportation improvement program. Approval is not required for a new phase of the project, which can include activities like determining environmental impacts, acquiring right-of-way, final design, and construction. Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) listed in an approved State Implementation Plan can proceed during a conformity lapse, allowing projects such as public transit improvements, HOV lane construction, traffic flow programs, fringe parking, idling reduction, and pedestrian facilities to continue. The regulations assume that projects needing conformity determination are typically in urban or suburban areas, although some nonattainment areas may not fit this description. In nonattainment areas that are not urban or suburban, conformity only needs to be demonstrated for non-exempt projects requiring federal funding or approval, which is rare. Rural areas with federally funded projects have separate procedures for conformity. EPA's 40 C.F.R. 93.109(f) addresses areas with insignificant motor vehicle emissions, stating that regional emissions analysis is not required if a SIP shows motor vehicle emissions are not a significant contributor to air quality issues. The SIP must demonstrate that motor vehicle emissions growth in nonattainment areas would not lead to NAAQS violations. Factors considered include the percentage of motor vehicle emissions in the SIP inventory, air quality monitoring data, absence of motor vehicle control measures, and historical/future emission trends. Most rural areas are unlikely to need to demonstrate conformity due to lack of monitoring data. EPA requires three years of quality-controlled data from certified monitors for nonattainment designation. In 2013, 814 U.S. counties had ozone monitors reporting data to EPA, while 2330 counties had no monitoring. Majority of counties are termed \"unclassifiable\" by EPA and not subject to conformity. Nonattainment areas have grace period or conformity lapse if not in compliance by deadline. Since 2007, 34 areas in 18 states used the grace period. Areas in six states have shown conformity without lapses, a significant improvement from the past. Between 1997 and 2003, 63 areas in 29 states experienced lapses, mostly medium-sized or suburban cities. Since 2007, only two areas have had lapses exceeding six months. The majority of areas that lapsed returned to conformity quickly, with only a few major urban areas experiencing prolonged non-conformity. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that most areas with conformity lapses did not have pending new projects and were not under time pressures to resolve their lapse. None of the lapsed areas lost transportation funding, but without a conforming TIP, only certain projects could be funded. Each area had its own unique circumstances leading to the conformity lapse, and transportation agencies and EPA responded in various ways. In 2003, GAO found that only five metropolitan areas had to change transportation plans to resolve conformity lapses in the previous six years. Before a 1999 court decision, state and federal transportation agencies had a less strict interpretation of requirements, allowing projects to continue if approved prior to the lapse. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the grandfather clause in 1999, leading to more stringent EPA and DOT regulations. The EPA and DOT have implemented stricter regulations due to a lapse in conformity, with Atlanta being a prime example. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, Atlanta continued to exceed the 1979 ozone standard in the late 1990s. The city's sprawl development contributed to high vehicle emissions, ranking 4th in land area but 56th in population density among urban areas. This led to Atlanta also ranking 4th in the nation in vehicle miles traveled per capita, further exacerbating its ozone nonattainment issues. The Atlanta metropolitan area faced a conformity lapse due to high vehicle emissions contributing to ozone nonattainment. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, the area struggled to meet ozone standards. Legal challenges led to a settlement agreement in June 1999, resulting in the halt of many highway projects and the implementation of a new Interim Transportation Improvement Program (ITIP). The Atlanta settlement led to the development of a new Interim Transportation Improvement Program (ITIP) after conformity lapsed in January 1998. The ITIP included grandfathered projects and was approved by state and federal transportation departments, EPA, and environmental groups. Two additional ITIPs were created following a D.C. Circuit decision, allowing projects exempt under regulations, Transportation Control Measures, and approved projects to proceed during the conformity lapse. In July 2000, ARC received approval for a new Transportation Improvement Program, de-emphasizing new highway capacity. 40% of funds were dedicated to transit, 10% to bicycle and pedestrian facilities, 21% to safety measures, and 26% to highway capacity. The Atlanta conformity lapse led to the development of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, improving coordination among transportation, planning, and environmental officials. The Atlanta conformity lapse led to improved coordination among transportation, planning, and environmental officials. Conformity requirements forced officials to consider environmental impacts during transportation planning and shifted towards a more multi-modal approach. The impact of conformity requirements was expected to grow due to emissions from light trucks and SUVs. The report highlighted challenges in demonstrating conformity due to emissions from SUVs and light trucks, stricter rules from recent court decisions, and new air quality standards. This could lead to temporary funding suspensions in metropolitan areas unless emissions are reduced. Local transportation planners also anticipated difficulties in conformity. In the time period since then, conformity has become routine in most areas due to higher fuel costs, economic recession, and new emission control requirements. Air quality data before and after EPA's 2008 ozone NAAQS show a reduction in ozone-forming compounds. EPA identified 398 counties exceeding the proposed ozone standard in 2007. In 2008, EPA identified 345 counties exceeding the 75 ppb NAAQS, which decreased to 232 by 2012. Air quality has improved nationwide due to pollution reduction efforts. 113 areas did not meet the 1997 ozone standards, while fewer areas failed to meet the 2008 standards. Only three areas in California and Wyoming have never been nonattainment for previous ozone standards. Wyoming is the only state that has not previously had an area designated nonattainment for ozone. EPA is considering a more stringent NAAQS for ozone, with a final decision required by October 1, 2015. Concerns have been raised about the extent of ozone nonattainment and the burden of demonstrating conformity. EPA identified 358 counties exceeding a proposed 70 ppb standard, with the number likely to decline due to air quality improvements before formal nonattainment designations. The EPA is set to designate nonattainment areas for ozone in late 2017, with new Tier 3 standards for motor vehicles reducing NOx emissions. Power plants and the oil and gas industry are also required to reduce ozone-forming emissions, while standards for stationary engines have been implemented to reduce VOCs and NOx emissions. The EPA's new emission standards, implemented in 2013, aim to reduce VOCs and NOx emissions, potentially lowering the number of counties exceeding the proposed ozone standard. The standards will help areas demonstrate conformity and are projected to improve ozone nonattainment areas. EPA's analysis shows that with current controls, only nine counties outside of California are expected to exceed a 70 ppb ozone standard by 2025. Even with a stricter 65 ppb standard, most areas are predicted to reach attainment without additional measures. The EPA's new emission standards aim to reduce VOCs and NOx emissions, potentially lowering the number of counties exceeding the proposed ozone standard. Most areas are predicted to reach attainment without additional controls, implying that EPA expects conformity despite a more stringent standard. Congress may consider legislation to amend transportation conformity requirements through reauthorization legislation for the surface transportation program, which expires in May 2015. As of mid-May, reauthorization legislation had not begun to move, with talk of a temporary funding extension. Bills have been introduced that could indirectly affect conformity determinations for ozone nonattainment areas. H.R. 1044, H.R. 1327 / S. 640, H.R. 1388 / S. 751, and H.R. 2111 propose changes to ozone nonattainment areas, including revising boundaries, delaying NAAQS reviews, and setting stricter standards based on county attainment levels and cost feasibility. EPA can use funds from any act to implement new ozone standards."
