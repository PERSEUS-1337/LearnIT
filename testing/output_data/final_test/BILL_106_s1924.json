    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Financial Information Privacy and Security Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act, titled the \"Financial Information Privacy and Security Act,\" defines a \"covered person\" as individuals subject to Federal banking agencies, brokers, dealers, investment advisors, and investment companies. The term \"Federal financial regulatory authorities\" includes the Federal banking agencies defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC. 3. PRIVACY OF CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER INFORMATION. The Federal financial regulatory authorities must issue final rules within 270 days to protect the privacy of confidential customer information, including personally identifiable data like social security numbers, transactions, balances, and insurance policies. Covered persons are prohibited from disclosing or sharing this information. The final rules require covered persons to not disclose confidential customer information to affiliates or agents if the customer has provided written notice prohibiting such sharing. This applies to new customers at the start of the business relationship and existing customers at a later reasonable time. The final rules mandate that covered persons must not disclose confidential customer information to non-affiliates or agents without the customer's written notice and consent. Additionally, covered persons must provide separate and easily identifiable notices and consent acknowledgments to customers as required by the regulations. The final rules require covered persons to provide customers with access to confidential information for review and correction, and to obtain written consent before using third-party provided customer information. The final rules require covered persons to establish procedures for compliance, examination, and enforcement of financial activities, including safeguards for security and confidentiality of records. The final rules mandate covered persons to establish procedures for safeguarding the security and confidentiality of confidential customer information to prevent unauthorized disclosure. These rules do not restrict the release of such information in specific circumstances, such as processing financial transactions authorized by the customer or for regulatory purposes. The final rules require covered persons to protect confidential customer information from unauthorized disclosure. Information can be shared with consumer reporting agencies for inclusion in reports or if it is not personally identifiable. SEC. 4. CIVIL LIABILITY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. Individuals whose rights under this Act have been violated can bring a civil action to recover preliminary relief, compensatory or liquidated damages of $5,000, and potentially punitive damages for knowing violations. Attorney's fees may also be awarded if the individual substantially prevails in the case. The Act allows individuals to bring a civil action to recover damages, including attorney's fees, for violations. The action must be filed within 3 years of discovering the violation. Principals are liable for their agent's actions, and additional remedies are available in addition to other lawful remedies. The Act does not override state laws unless they conflict with it. State laws providing greater protection than the Act are not considered inconsistent."
