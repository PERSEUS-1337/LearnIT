    "content": "The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447, H.R. 4818) signed into law on December 8, 2004, combines nine annual appropriations bills into one measure. Division A of P.L. 108-447 allocates $85.3 billion in FY2005 funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies, with $16.9 billion in discretionary spending. The USDA, with around 100,000 employees across 30 internal agencies, carries out various responsibilities beyond agriculture. USDA gross outlays for FY2003 were $81.53 billion. In FY2003, USDA spending totaled $81.53 billion, with food and nutrition programs accounting for 50% of the budget. The second largest spending area was for farm and foreign agricultural services, totaling $24.3 billion. Additionally, $7.0 billion was allocated for natural resource and environment programs. In FY2003, USDA spending totaled $81.53 billion, with food and nutrition programs accounting for 50% of the budget. $7.0 billion was allocated for natural resource and environment programs, mainly for the Forest Service and discretionary conservation programs. Other USDA spending areas included rural development, research and education, marketing and regulatory activities, meat and poultry inspection, and departmental administrative offices. The majority of USDA spending is classified as mandatory and occurs outside the control of annual appropriations. The USDA mandatory spending includes farm commodity price and income support programs, food stamp and child nutrition programs, federal crop insurance program, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. These programs receive funds from the annual agriculture appropriations act, with supplemental appropriations made if needed. The Commodity Credit Corporation is reimbursed for losses incurred in financing these programs. The USDA budget is divided into mandatory and discretionary programs. Mandatory spending includes commodity support programs, food stamp programs, and agricultural conservation programs. Discretionary programs are funded through annual appropriations acts and include Forest Service programs, rural development programs, research and education programs, and food aid programs. Funding for USDA discretionary programs is provided by the annual agriculture appropriations act, except for Forest Service programs which are included in the annual Interior appropriations act. The budget appropriations for USDA and related agencies from FY1997 to FY2005 are detailed, including across-the-board rescissions in FY2003 and FY2004. The distinction between mandatory and discretionary spending is highlighted. The budget process involves controlling mandatory and discretionary spending. Mandatory programs have set eligibility rules and benefit formulas, while discretionary programs are funded through annual appropriations acts. The Bush Administration released its budget request for FY2005 on February 2, 2004. The Bush Administration released its budget request on February 2, 2004 for federal departments and agencies, including a $82.9 billion request for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies for FY2005. This was a decrease from the FY2004 level due to reduced need to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation. Around 80% of the requested spending is for mandatory programs administered by USDA. The FY2005 spending request for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies was $16.6 billion for discretionary programs. Congressional action on the appropriations bill was completed in November 2004, with the full House approving the measure in July 2004. The FY2005 appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies (H.R. 4766, S. 2803) went through various stages of approval in July and September 2004. Amendments were made in both the House and Senate versions, including a provision to relax travel restrictions to Cuba for promoting U.S. agricultural products. A conference agreement was reached between the House-passed bill (H.R. 4818) and the Senate-reported measure (S. 2803) in November 2004, which was folded into an FY2005 consolidated appropriations bill. The FY2005 conference agreement for USDA and related agencies was folded into an omnibus bill signed into law in December 2004. Most spending for USDA's mandatory programs is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation, which can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has the legal authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance various programs. It must repay the borrowed funds and replenish losses through congressional appropriations to maintain its borrowing authority. The CCC receives an indefinite appropriation for funding needs, estimated at $16.452 billion for FY2005. This allows the CCC to receive necessary sums for previous and current year losses. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act concurs with this request. The estimated appropriation is not reflective of expected outlays for FY2005, but rather a reimbursement for incurred losses. The FY2005 estimated appropriation for the CCC is $16.452 billion, not reflective of expected outlays but a reimbursement for losses incurred primarily in FY2003. The reduction in appropriation is due to improved farm commodity prices, leading to decreased spending for farm commodity support under the 2002 farm bill. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The annual agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the federal crop insurance program, including premium subsidies and indemnity payments. The FY2005 budget requested $4.095 billion for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, an increase from the previous year. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act approved this request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447, H.R. 4818) aligns with the request for increased federal subsidy of farmer premiums in the crop insurance program. Legislative enhancements in 2000 (P.L.106-224) have contributed to rising program costs due to disasters. The Act provides $72.0 million for RMA salaries and expenses, slightly up from FY2004, but below the Administration's FY2005 request of $91.6 million, with a significant portion earmarked for IT initiatives. The FY2005 budget did not include any legislative proposals to limit federal subsidies for private insurance companies in the crop insurance program. Instead, a new standard reinsurance agreement (SRA) was negotiated by USDA, effective from July 1, 2004. The SRA is expected to reduce program costs by $22 million in 2005 and $36 million in 2006 and beyond through lower subsidies and increased private risk-sharing. The Commodity Credit Corporation funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs, with administration by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA). FSA also manages farm loan programs, conservation programs, and food assistance programs. FSA Salaries and Expenses account covers program administration costs. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $1.305 billion for all FSA salaries and expenses, including funds from various sources like CCC export credit guarantees and farm loan programs. This amount is higher than the FY2004 appropriation, but below the House-passed bill and Administration request. The House floor amendment transferred $53 million to FSA salaries and expenses from USDA's Common Computing Environment account, which was not approved in the final appropriations law. FSA funding levels were previously supported by carryover funds from supplemental acts, but now regular appropriations are needed to maintain county office staff levels. The FY2004 House appropriations bill instructed USDA not to shut down or consolidate local FSA offices without cost-effective analysis. FSA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers through farm loan programs. The USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers, providing direct farm loans and loan guarantees. These loans help finance farm real estate purchases, cover operating expenses, and assist farmers in recovering from natural disasters. FSA receives an annual appropriation to cover the federal cost of making these loans, including interest rate subsidies and projected loan losses. The loan authority is significantly larger than the amount of loans made, with an appropriation of $157.8 million in P.L. 108-447 to subsidize $3.747 billion in direct and guaranteed loans. The enacted FY2004 loan subsidy was $195.5 million to support FSA loans totaling $3.246 billion. P.L. 108-447 provides a loan subsidy that is 19% below the FY2004 level, but loan authority is increased in FY2005 by 15%. The Administration had requested an FY2005 loan subsidy of $161 million to cover $3.8 billion in loans, but P.L. 108-447 did not fund this request. P.L. 108-447 does not fund the Administration's request for emergency loan authority. It maintains boll weevil eradication loan authority at $100 million and increases overall farm ownership loan authority by 50%. Direct farm ownership loans increase by 63% to $210 million, and guaranteed farm ownership loans increase by 48% to $1.4 billion. Guaranteed loans with no interest subsidy require a smaller appropriation. With the adjustments in loan repayment ratios, the increase in guaranteed farm ownership loans costs only $2.3 million in additional loan subsidy. The decrease in loan subsidy in P.L. 108-447 is mainly in direct lending programs, with a 60% decrease in loan subsidy for direct farm ownership loans and a 25% decrease for direct operating loans. Funds are effectively transferred from the unsubsidized guaranteed operating loan program to the subsidized guaranteed operating loan program. The subsidized guaranteed operating loan program has been oversubscribed among FSA loans. Agricultural conservation spending includes discretionary and mandatory programs administered by USDA. Discretionary conservation spending exceeds $1 billion annually, while mandatory conservation spending funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation is over $3 billion in FY2004. For more information on agricultural credit, refer to CRS Report RS21977, Agricultural Credit: Institutions and Issues. In FY2004, mandatory conservation spending funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation exceeded $3 billion. Discretionary NRCS programs received $999.9 million in funding in FY2005, a decrease from the previous year. Conservation Operations (CO) account funding for public and local government assistance was $837 million in P.L. 108-447. In FY2005, P.L. 108-447 rejected funding for technical assistance (TA) for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). USDA is borrowing funds from other programs to cover TA costs exceeding the cap set in the 1996 farm bill, upsetting constituents of those programs. The bill prohibits the use of funds in discretionary accounts for any mandatory farm bill conservation program TA. The House adopted a floor amendment to fix the issue of borrowing funds for technical assistance (TA) in conservation programs, but it was dropped in conference. Congress passed a bill that limits fund transfers between conservation programs for TA and requires each program to pay for its own TA. This measure will restrict CCC funding for TA to specific programs and lift the 1996 TA funding cap. CRP and WRP TA costs are expected to rise when 22 million CRP acres expire in 2007. P.L. 108-447 allocates $75.6 million for watershed and flood prevention operations, $27.5 million for watershed rehabilitation, $7 million for watershed surveys and planning, and $51.6 million for resource conservation and development. Mandatory conservation programs are funded through laws like the 2002 farm bill, with annual appropriations bills often imposing spending limits. Mandatory conservation programs are often subject to spending limits in annual appropriations bills. Cuts to these programs totaled $545 million in P.L. 108-447, affecting programs like EQIP, CSP, WHIP, WRP, and FPP. These programs provide financial assistance for conservation efforts such as developing wildlife habitats and protecting wetlands. The Farmland Protection Program (FPP), Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program (GSWC), Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, and other programs were fully funded at authorized levels under P.L. 108-447. This excluded programs like the Conservation Reserve Program, Klamath Basin program, Grasslands Reserve Program, and Agricultural Management Assistance program, which were not addressed in the legislation. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) provides funding for USDA's international activities, including the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program. The total amount allocated is $1.533 billion, $29.8 million more than in FY2004, with a $12.3 million increase from the President's request. USDA's international activities include discretionary programs like P.L. 480 foreign food aid and mandatory programs funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The total budget for FY2005 is estimated to be $6.6 billion, with an increase from the previous year. Discretionary programs involve commodity sales and humanitarian donations under P.L. 480 and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program. The FY2005 appropriation for P.L. 480 is $1.303 billion, slightly lower than FY2004. The reduction is mainly due to lower loan subsidies and ocean freight grants. The total appropriation includes $1.182 billion for humanitarian commodity donations under P.L. 480 Title II. The conference committee expects the Administration to follow the statutory set-aside for non-emergency food aid programs. The FY2005 appropriation for P.L. 480 is $1.303 billion, slightly lower than FY2004. The statutory set-aside for non-emergency assistance was increased to 1,875,000 metric tons. Additional emergency assistance can be provided through the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. Funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program was increased to $87.5 million in P.L. 108-447. The increased funding for FFE was offset by reductions in the Title I loan account. Conferees rescinded $191.1 million in P.L. 480 funds carried forward to FY2005. In FY2005, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) received $137.8 million in appropriations, an increase of $6.4 million from FY2004. The funding covers administrative costs for CCC export credit guarantees, supporting $4.5 billion of U.S. agricultural exports. Additionally, $2.5 million was allocated for Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Hunger Fellowships, financing hunger-related activities domestically and abroad. The Congressional Hunger Center provides finance training for hunger-related activities domestically and abroad. Mandatory food aid programs include Food for Progress, the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, and Section 416(b) commodity donations. The President's budget allocates $149 million for Food for Progress. The Bill Emerson Trust serves as a commodity reserve for unanticipated food aid needs. No commodities were released from the Trust in FY2004, but $212 million worth were provided in FY2003. The President's budget does not estimate releases from the Trust in FY2005. The President's budget notes that 500,000 tons of emergency food assistance are available from the Trust in FY2005. Currently, there are 1.6 million metric tons of wheat and $109 million in cash in the Trust. The budget projects a program level of $147 million for Section 416(b) commodity donations. P.L. 108-447 includes a provision for $25 million of commodities to assist in mitigating the effects of HIV/AIDS. Only nonfat dry milk will be available for distribution under Section 416 in FY2005. The USDA's export-related programs, including EEP and DEIP, provide cash bonus payments to exporters of U.S. agricultural commodities to stay competitive. EEP had minimal use in recent years, with no bonuses in FY2004. The budget for FY2005 allocates $28 million for EEP and $53 million for DEIP. This allows USDA flexibility to increase EEP subsidies due to mandatory authorization. The budget for FY2005 includes $125 million for the Market Access Program (MAP) and $34 million for the Foreign Market Development Program. Efforts to reduce MAP spending have been unsuccessful, with a Chabot amendment to prohibit MAP spending in FY2005 being defeated. P.L. 108-447 did not relax the licensing requirement for Cuba travel as proposed in the Senate-passed version of the FY2005 agriculture appropriations bill. The FY2005 agriculture appropriations bill proposed relaxing licensing requirements for U.S. exporters traveling to Cuba. Amendment supporters argued that the Administration used rules to delay or refuse travel licenses for those selling agricultural and medical products to Cuba. However, including provisions to weaken sanctions against Cuba would result in a presidential veto. Identical language in the FY2004 bill was also deleted in conference. The USDA's research, education, and economics function is carried out by four agencies. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) conducts research to support USDA's regulatory agencies. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) sends federal funds to land grant Colleges of Agriculture. The Economic Research Service (ERS provides economic analysis of agriculture issues. The USDA's research budget has remained flat for almost 30 years. Since 1998, legislation has tapped into various funding sources to boost competitive grants in agricultural research programs. Financial difficulties at the state level are causing some states to reduce funding for USDA formula funds, leading to program cuts felt at the county level. Additionally, supplemental funds have supported anti-terrorism activities since September 11, 2001. In FY1999 and FY2001 through FY2005, agriculture appropriations acts have restricted the use of mandatory funds for intended purposes. Despite increased funding for ongoing REE programs in some years, adjusted for inflation, there is not significant growth in agricultural research spending. Concerns are raised by agricultural scientists, stakeholders, and partners about long-term funding due to high budget deficits and lower tax revenues. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $1.299 billion for ARS activities, up $153 million from FY2004. The conferees compromised on the split between research funding and laboratory construction funding, allocating $187.8 million for construction and leaving $1.1 billion available for research projects. P.L. 108-447 reflects the Senate provision on ARS construction funding, with $122 million going towards completing the modernization of the National Centers for Animal Health in Ames, Iowa. Another $65.8 million is distributed among 22 additional locations. The House bill directed $178 million for ARS facility construction to the Ames project as part of the Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative. The lab is operated jointly with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and a master plan for aging infrastructure is urged. The conference report mandates the continuation of individual earmarked ARS research. The report accompanying P.L. 108-447 mandates the continuation of individual earmarked ARS research projects added by Members in past years. The Administration proposes terminating some projects to redirect savings to high priority research, but Congress generally does not agree. The conferees criticize USDA for not addressing issues at the U.S. National Arboretum under ARS's jurisdiction since 1994. The Secretary is required to report on budgeting, security, public access, and discussions with the Arboretum's nonprofit association within one month of the appropriations bill passage. P.L. 108-447 provides $1.171 billion for CSREES, with $660.8 million supporting state agricultural research and academic programs. This includes formula-allocated payments, competitive grants, and education programs. Specific spending levels include $180.1 million for the Hatch Act formula. The FY2004 funding levels for various agricultural programs include $180.1 million for Hatch Act formula funds, $22.4 million for cooperative forestry research, $37 million for historically black land grant colleges, $181 million for NRI competitive grants, and $136.6 million for special research grants. The total allocated for state extension education programs is $449.2 million, with specific allocations for Smith-Lever formula funds and competitively awarded extension grants. In FY2004, funding levels for agricultural programs included $180.1 million for Hatch Act formula funds, $22.4 million for cooperative forestry research, $37 million for historically black land grant colleges, $181 million for NRI competitive grants, and $136.6 million for special research grants. In FY2005, P.L. 108-447 allocated $58.9 million for the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program, $33.1 million for extension programs at 1890 colleges, $17 million for 1890 facilities grants, $22 million for earmarked extension grants, and $55.1 million for integrated activities. The outreach program for disadvantaged farmers received level funding at $5.9 million. Additionally, $3 million in interest income from the Native American Endowment Fund was made available to distribute to tribally controlled colleges to support the development of their agricultural curricula. In FY2004, funding levels for agricultural programs included $180.1 million for Hatch Act formula funds, $22.4 million for cooperative forestry research, $37 million for historically black land grant colleges, $181 million for NRI competitive grants, and $136.6 million for special research grants. In FY2005, P.L. 108-447 allocated $58.9 million for the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program, $33.1 million for extension programs at 1890 colleges, $17 million for 1890 facilities grants, $22 million for earmarked extension grants, and $55.1 million for integrated activities. The outreach program for disadvantaged farmers received level funding at $5.9 million. Additionally, $3 million in interest income from the Native American Endowment Fund was made available to distribute to tribally controlled colleges to support the development of their agricultural curricula. CSREES administers competitive grant programs for tribal schools and research, with the largest program being the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems (IFAFS) authorized to receive $160 million in FY2005. However, appropriators have prohibited CSREES from operating the IFAFS program, allowing the Secretary to award up to 20% of the appropriation for the National Research Initiative (NRI) competitive grants program using IFAFS program criteria. The 2002 farm bill authorizes $3 million annually for organic agriculture programs through FY2007. P.L. 108-447 allocates $74.8 million for the Economic Research Service in FY2005, with $3.5 million designated for a Consumer Data and Information System. Additionally, $129.5 million is allocated for the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates $823.8 million for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, a $43.9 million increase from FY2004. The bill also directs NASS to spend up to $22.4 million on the most recent Census of Agriculture and provides a $2.7 million increase for modernization of the NASS agricultural estimates program. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates $823.8 million for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The Administration requested $838.7 million for FSIS, but Congress rejected a proposal for new inspection user fees. Previous administrations have proposed funding the inspection program through user fees, but Congress believes food safety is a federal government responsibility. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates $823.8 million for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. P.L. 108-447 includes funding for various aspects of food safety enforcement, such as positions for Humane Methods of Slaughter Act enforcement, funding for Humane Animal Tracking system, frontline inspectors, regulatory training, BSE-related rules oversight, and food defense activities. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates $1.5 million for the network's data systems support and $2.7 million for Codex Alimentarius activities. The conference report commends FSIS for including photographs of recalled products in recall notices and urges manufacturers to provide information on retail locations of recalled products. The largest appropriation for USDA marketing and regulatory programs goes to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, responding to health problems, and facilitating agricultural trade. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447, H.R. 4766) provides a total APHIS appropriation of $819.6 million, up $98.3 million (14%) from FY2004. The Senate-reported agriculture appropriations bill (S. 2803) did not increase the appropriation as much as the Administration requested, while the House-passed agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 4766) provided more than the Administration requested. The final level includes significant new funding for avian flu and BSE activities. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447, H.R. 4766) provides a total APHIS appropriation of $819.6 million, up $98.3 million (14%) from FY2004. Specifically, $10.9 million of user fees for animal welfare inspection are directed to APHIS accounts. For pest and disease exclusion, $152.3 million is allocated, while $196.6 million is provided for plant and animal health monitoring. Additionally, $80.6 million is allocated for scientific and technical services, and $17.1 million for animal care. Pest and disease management receives the largest appropriation of $363.9 million, an increase of 10% from the previous year. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) provides $363.9 million for pest and disease management, a 10% increase from FY2004. The bill also allocates $23 million for avian influenza, $47.5 million for bollweevil, and $18.7 million for Johne's disease. Other programs like brucellosis and noxious weeds receive small increases, while Chronic wasting disease, scrapie, and tuberculosis receive smaller increases than requested. Emerging plant pests receive $101.6 million, a 9% increase from the previous year. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) provides $101.6 million for pest and disease management, with increased funding for citrus canker, Pierce's disease, emerald ash borer, and sudden oak death. The law allows the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation for grower compensation programs. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) provides funding for pest and disease management, including citrus canker, emerald ash borer, and sudden oak death. The Secretary of Agriculture can transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation for grower compensation programs. The USDA requested $511 million for homeland security activities in FY2005, with a focus on the \"Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative\" to enhance surveillance, laboratory capacity, networking, state cooperative agreements, and vaccine banks. APHIS requested $94.4 million under this initiative to address agroterrorism threats. Threats and Preparedness. Funding for agroterrorism-related items in P.L. 108-447 includes $2.0 million for bio-surveillance, $3 million for vaccine banks, and $4.0 million for emergency coordinators. State cooperative agreements increase by $3.6 million, select agents by $2.5 million, and the national animal laboratory network by $2.9 million. Concerns were raised about agricultural border inspections and research at Plum Island. A report from the Government Accountability Office on coordination between USDA and DHS is requested by March 1, 2005. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is requested to report on coordination between USDA and DHS by March 1, 2005. APHIS is leading efforts to control avian influenza with a funding of $23 million provided in P.L. 108-447, exceeding the Administration's request. Cases of low and highly pathogenic avian flu were discovered in 2004, with a focus on controlling the spread in live bird markets. $13.7 million of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds were released by USDA for a larger program. In May 2004, USDA released $13.7 million of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds for a national avian flu program and to assist Texas with its outbreak. The funding for FY2005 enables APHIS to establish new elements in its avian influenza program, including indemnities for farmers, cooperative agreements with states, increased monitoring, a bird identification system, laboratory support, and vaccine development. APHIS also leads USDA's surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease). For more information on avian flu, refer to CRS Report RS21747, Avian Influenza: Multiple Strains Cause Different Effects Worldwide. The Administration's budget proposal includes $60 million for addressing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in FY2005, with $33 million allocated to APHIS for developing a national animal identification system. An additional $17 million is requested for testing 40,000 cattle for BSE. The Administration transferred $69.9 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation to fund an expanded BSE surveillance program, intending to test 268,000 animals starting June 1, 2004. The funding also includes $8.6 million for APHIS BSE activities and $33.2 million for the national animal ID system development. The House committee report requests quarterly reports on BSE surveillance program, national animal ID implementation, and BSE response plan. Concerns raised about USDA allowing importation of beef from Canada. USDA's Office of Inspector General to provide reports on BSE testing controversy and USDA's actions. The House committee expressed concerns about USDA's failure to perform BSE testing on a suspicious Texas cow and FDA's delay in tightening BSE safeguards. Representative Tiahrt's amendment to prohibit USDA travel funds until implementing a program for beef testing was rejected. The USDA denied a request by Creekstone Farms Premium Beef to conduct 100% testing for the Japanese market, citing lack of scientific basis. The Senate committee urged USDA to test a significant sample of older cattle for BSE prevalence. The Senate report states that BSE-related funding in the bill includes allocations for FSIS ($3 million) and the Food and Drug Administration (nearly $30 million). The Agricultural Marketing Service is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural products in domestic and international markets, with a budget of $95.3 million in FY2005. Conferees provide $3.8 million for state marketing activities, compared to an Administration request of $1.3 million. The Senate-proposed specialty markets grant to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture is $2.5 million, while the Administration requested a $10 million increase in funds for improved information technology systems for USDA commodity purchasing. The AMS budget authority level includes appropriations for marketing services and payments to states and territories, with $16 million transferred from the permanent Section 32 account. Additional Section 32 monies are used by AMS for government purchases of surplus farm commodities. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Section 32 funds to purchase surplus farm commodities and support various agency activities. It also mentions the requirement to use a minimum of $200 million each year for purchasing fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops. Additionally, there is a mention of using Section 32 to stabilize the purchase of surplus domestic salmon. The report urges the Department to use Section 32 funds to stabilize the domestic salmon industry and allocate $2 million to AMS for organic standards activities. It also recommends finalizing the hiring of a director for the National Organic Standards Board and improving technical support. Additionally, a House floor amendment to transfer $6 million to the Farmers Market Promotion Program was defeated. The 2002 farm bill mandated country-of-origin labeling for certain products, but implementation was delayed by the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-199) delayed mandatory COOL implementation by AMS for two years, Senate Committee defeated amendment for mandatory COOL to start in 2005, House approved voluntary COOL bill (H.R. 4576) in 2004. GIPSA ensures fair trading practices for grain and commodities. GIPSA works to improve oversight of livestock markets, addressing concerns about concentration and business relationships. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $37.3 million for GIPSA in FY2005, below the Administration's request of $44.2 million. The committee expects an update on the study regarding a ban on packer ownership by January 1, 2005. The Administration requested $37.5 million for GIPSA in FY2005, with proposed increases for IT upgrades, monitoring livestock technologies, rapid response teams for livestock markets, and resolving international grain trade issues. The Senate committee and conference reports included $1 million for budget increases, IT security, and BSE-related activities. In FY2004, Congress allocated $35.7 million for GIPSA salaries and expenses, with anticipated user fees bringing the total program level to nearly $78 million. The Administration's proposed increases would have raised the FY2005 program level to $86 million. The Administration proposed increases for USDA's rural development mission area in FY2005, including new user fees of $29.4 million. Three agencies are responsible for this area: the Rural Housing Service, the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and the Rural Utilities Service. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided a total appropriation of $2.43 billion for USDA rural development. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 4818) allocates $2.43 billion for USDA rural development, supporting a $10.39 billion loan authorization level for rural economic and community development programs. This is $14.7 million less than FY2004.
