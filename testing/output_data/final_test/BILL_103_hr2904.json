    "content": "The Act titled \"Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1993\" provides consumer protections for high-cost mortgages. The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1993 defines a high-cost mortgage as a consumer credit transaction secured by a consumer's dwelling with an annual percentage rate exceeding the yield on Treasury securities by more than 10 percentage points. The annual percentage rate is calculated considering subsequent rates. If the consumer's total monthly debt payments will exceed 60 percent of their monthly gross income after the loan is finalized, a different debt to income ratio may be established. All points and fees payable at or before closing should not exceed 8 percent of the total loan amount. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include disclosures for high cost mortgages and clarify the definition of a creditor. Additionally, new disclosures are required and certain terms are prohibited under the Act. \"Requirements for high cost mortgages are outlined in SEC. 129, including new disclosures and prohibited terms.\" For high cost mortgages, creditors must provide specific written disclosures, including a statement about the risk of losing the home, the initial annual percentage rate, the consumer's income and monthly payment details, and information on remaining funds for other obligations. The disclosures for variable rate loans include information on potential rate and payment increases, initial rate period, and consumer's non-obligation to complete the transaction. Disclosure must be provided at least 3 business days before the transaction. A creditor must provide disclosures for variable rate loans at least 3 business days before the transaction. Terms of a high cost mortgage cannot be changed after disclosures are given. No prepayment penalty is allowed for high cost mortgages, and any less advantageous method of computing rebates is considered a penalty. Refinancing a high cost mortgage by the same creditor is prohibited. Refinancing a high cost mortgage by the same creditor or affiliate may not require the consumer to pay certain fees. A high cost mortgage may include a penalty of up to 1 month's interest if the full principal is prepaid within 90 days. Balloon payments and negative amortization are not allowed in high cost mortgages. A high cost mortgage cannot have negative amortization or prepaid payments exceeding 2 periodic payments. Additionally, refinancing by the same creditor may waive certain fees. Disclosure requirements for high cost mortgages include civil liability under SEC. 3. Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act include expanding damages for non-compliance with section 129 to include all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer. State Attorney Generals can now enforce violations of section 129 in court within 5 years of the violation occurring. Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act now hold assignees liable for non-compliance with section 129 regarding high cost mortgages. Assignees can be subject to consumer claims and defenses, with recovery limited to the total amount paid by the consumer. The Act will take effect 60 days after regulations are issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
