    "title": "AB 775",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that all California women, regardless of income, should have access to reproductive health services, with insurance coverage provided for eligible, low-income women. Programs have been expanded due to the federal Affordable Care Act. Millions of California women need publicly funded family planning services, contraception, abortion, and prenatal care. In 2012, over 2.6 million women required these services, with 700,000 becoming pregnant annually, half of which are unintended. In 2010, 64.3% of unplanned births in California were publicly funded. Despite this, many women are unaware of available programs for contraception, health education, family planning, and prenatal care. California must supplement its efforts to advise women of its reproductive health programs due to the time-sensitive nature of pregnancy decisions. Low-income women in California can access free or low-cost family planning services and pregnancy-related care through Medi-Cal and Family PACT programs. Only Medi-Cal providers enrolled in Family PACT can immediately enroll patients at their health centers. To ensure timely access to reproductive information and services, licensed health care facilities in California must inform patients of available family planning resources. Unlicensed facilities offering pregnancy testing must disclose their lack of medical care licensing to clients seeking care. The Reproductive FACT Act in California aims to ensure residents are informed about their reproductive health care rights and available services. It defines licensed covered facilities as those providing family planning or pregnancy-related services under specific criteria. The Reproductive FACT Act in California defines unlicensed covered facilities as those offering pregnancy-related services without a licensed medical provider on staff, including obstetric ultrasounds, contraception counseling, pregnancy testing, and abortion services. The Reproductive FACT Act in California applies to facilities offering pregnancy-related services without a licensed medical provider on staff, including obstetric ultrasounds, pregnancy testing, and counseling. The Act does not apply to clinics directly operated by the United States or licensed primary care clinics enrolled in specific programs. A licensed covered facility must provide a notice in English and primary threshold languages for Medi-Cal beneficiaries as determined by the State Department of Health Care Services. The notice should be disseminated on-site to clients and include specific information as required by the Reproductive FACT Act in California. California offers public programs for eligible women that provide free or low-cost access to family planning services, prenatal care, and abortion. Contact the county social services office to determine eligibility. The information regarding disclosure requirements for facilities providing services to clients must be posted in a conspicuous place or distributed in printed or digital format to all clients. The notice must be easily readable and may be combined with other mandated disclosures. An unlicensed covered facility must provide a notice to clients in English and primary threshold languages for Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The notice states that the facility is not licensed as a medical facility and does not have licensed medical providers. The onsite notice must be at least 8.5 inches by 11 inches, written in 48-point type, and posted conspicuously at the entrance and another area where clients wait for services. Covered facilities failing to comply with advertising notice requirements may face civil penalties of $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for subsequent offenses. The penalty can be imposed after providing the facility with a 30-day notice of noncompliance. The civil penalty for violations not corrected within 30 days is deposited into the General Fund if brought by the Attorney General, or to the city or county treasurer if brought by a city attorney or county counsel. The provisions of the act are severable, with invalidity of one part not affecting the rest."
