    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Act\". It establishes the District of Columbia National Guard Educational Assistance Program. The District of Columbia National Guard is unique as it is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States and has a special mission due to the presence of the Federal Government in the District. The District of Columbia National Guard, under the President's jurisdiction, is specifically trained for unique emergencies in the District. Most members live in Maryland or Virginia, leading to a decline in force compared to neighboring National Guards. Maryland and Virginia offer additional incentives for recruiting and retention. The District of Columbia National Guard faces challenges in recruiting and retaining members, with neighboring National Guards offering more incentives. Providing educational benefits could help prevent loss of members and maintain readiness for responding to emergencies, including terrorist attacks in the capital. The District of Columbia National Guard may provide financial assistance to members who complete required active duty service and agree to serve for at least six years. This assistance helps cover expenses for higher education degrees or certifications. Members must maintain eligibility to continue receiving aid. Members of the Columbia National Guard must be actively serving and enrolled in an approved institution of higher education to receive financial assistance. The aid can cover tuition, fees, books, and laboratory expenses. Financial assistance provided to members of the District of Columbia National Guard can be up to $400 per credit hour, not exceeding $5,500 per year. The commanding general may adjust the amount based on available funds. Members can receive this assistance in addition to other aid, except for ROTC scholarships. The commanding general, in consultation with approved institutions of higher education, develops policies for administering financial assistance for members of the District of Columbia National Guard. Repayment provisions apply if a member fails to serve as required or comply with eligibility conditions. No institution is required to alter admissions policies for Guard members. The commanding general can receive funding from various sources, including appropriations, transfers from federal agencies, and donations, to provide financial assistance to the District of Columbia National Guard. The funds remain available until expended, and no institution is obligated to change admissions policies for Guard members. The commanding general can accept donations for providing assistance to the District of Columbia National Guard. An approved institution of higher education must meet certain criteria to receive funds under this section. Financial assistance may be provided to eligible members of the District of Columbia National Guard for periods of instruction starting from January 1, 2007."
