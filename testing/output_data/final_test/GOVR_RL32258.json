    "content": "During the 108th Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate Finance Committee approved different versions of a bill reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant and making changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. H.R. 4 was passed by the House in February 2003, but the Senate did not vote on it in April 2004. The CSE program, Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, was enacted in January 1975. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in January 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is funded by general revenues and operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Families receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Other families must apply and states can charge an application fee up to $25. Child support collected for nonwelfare families goes directly to the family. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), collects child support payments for families. Between FY1978 and FY2003, payments increased significantly. However, the program only collects 18% of obligations and 50% of its caseload. In FY2003, paternity was established for 77% of children without legally identified fathers. Total expenditures for the program in FY2003 were $5.213 billion. The CSE program handles 50% of child support cases, providing services like parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment, modification, and collection methods. It also enforces medical support and uses various collection methods like income withholding and intercept of tax refunds. Jurisdictions have civil and criminal contempt procedures. Legislation like P.L. 102-521 and P.L. 105-187 support these efforts. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-187) established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States were required to implement procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and withholding licenses. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-187) established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. It required states to secure assets for child support arrearages and withhold licenses. P.L. 104-193 authorized actions like denying passports and conducting data matches with financial institutions to seize resources of debtor parents. It also mandated states to enact UIFSA and clarify jurisdiction in child support cases. The federal government reimburses states for CSE program costs and paternity establishment. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a cost-neutral incentive payment system for states in the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The program aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents, promote self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. The CSE program has evolved into a multifaceted program with a statutory limit of $454 million for incentive payments in FY2004. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to strengthen families by securing financial support for children from noncustodial parents and promoting self-sufficiency. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, constituting about 17% of family income on average and 30% for poor families. H.R. 4 sought to improve the CSE program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide a stable income source for all single-parent families. The CSE program aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents. H.R. 4 revised CSE enforcement tools and added provisions, with the Senate version including more than the House version. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign child support rights to the state, determining who receives the payments. Child support accrued before or during TANF benefits is assigned to the state for reimbursement. Non-TANF families keep all child support collected. Assignments made before September 30, 1997, permanently assign arrearages to the state, while those after October 1, 1997, only assign arrearages during assistance. Pre-assistance arrearages are temporarily assigned. The child support assignment rules under H.R. 4 differ between the House and Senate versions. The House version does not change the current rules, while the Senate version only assigns child support accrued during TANF benefits. This means pre-assistance arrearages would not have to be assigned to the state, and any collections for these arrearages would go to the family. Distribution rules determine how child support collections are paid based on the assignment rules. The distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, with past-due child support being of great importance. TANF families may have current support and assigned arrearages collected by the state up to the amount of TANF benefits received. States have the discretion to decide how much of the state share of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family and whether to treat child support payments as income. As of August 2004, 21 states continued the $50 pass-through and disregard policy for child support collections, with both versions of H.R. 4 aiming to incentivize states to direct more support to TANF families rather than reimbursing welfare benefits. The House-passed bill under H.R. 4 aimed to increase the amount of child support passed through to TANF families without requiring states to pay the federal government the federal share of the increased payments. The bill would have limited the new payments to the greater of $100 per month. The House-passed bill aimed to increase child support payments to TANF families without requiring states to pay the federal government. The Senate Finance Committee's bill would have allowed states to pay up to $400 per month in child support to families. The 1996 welfare reform law required states to distribute child support collections to former TANF families before being reimbursed by the federal government. This policy includes current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and pre-TANF arrearages. Child support arrearages that accrue during TANF belong to the state and federal government. The 1996 welfare reform law aimed to prioritize distributing child support to families after leaving TANF. Child support before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. This extra income helps families exit TANF and reduces reliance on public assistance. H.R. 4 proposed giving states the option to distribute full child support amounts, including arrearages, to former TANF families. The House-passed bill and the Senate Finance Committee version of H.R. 4 proposed giving states the option to distribute full child support amounts, including arrearages, to former TANF families. The federal government would share costs with states for paying child support arrearages accrued during TANF and simplify the distribution process. The federal government would share costs with states for paying child support arrearages and facilitate the collection of child support from various sources. Additional provisions in the Senate Finance Committee-approved version of H.R. 4 aimed to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments. The Senate Finance Committee-approved version of H.R. 4 includes provisions authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents who owe child support, compare information with insurers and gambling establishments to pursue arrearages, and require states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years. The House-passed version of H.R. 4 included provisions for a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services, while the Senate Finance Committee-approved version increased funding for CSE access and visitation programs and allowed Indian tribes access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. States were also required to adopt a later version for child support orders of TANF families every three years. The House-passed version of H.R. 4 included provisions for a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services, while the Senate Finance Committee-approved version increased funding for CSE access and visitation programs and allowed Indian tribes access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. States were also required to adopt a later version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) for child support orders of TANF families every three years. There is concern that the CSE provisions in H.R. 4 were not debated separately, but it is likely that the 109th Congress will consider these changes as part of any new TANF reauthorization bill.
