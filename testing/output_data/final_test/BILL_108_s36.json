    "content": "The Medicare Equity Act of 2003, also known as the \"Medicare Equity Act,\" eliminates the geographic physician work adjustment factor from the physician fee schedule payments. Congress finds that geographic physician work adjustment factors in the Medicare physician fee schedule create payment inequities between localities, resulting in beneficiaries in high adjustment factor areas having better access to services. Studies show that the healthcare professional market has become nationalized, leading to the disappearance of historically low labor costs in rural and small urban areas. Eliminating these adjustment factors would equalize reimbursement rates for services under the fee schedule. The Medicare physician fee schedule is being amended to ensure budget neutrality by eliminating geographic physician work adjustment factors. This change aims to equalize reimbursement rates for services provided before January 1, 2003. The Medicare physician fee schedule is being amended to ensure budget neutrality by eliminating geographic physician work adjustment factors. This adjustment aims to equalize reimbursement rates for services provided before January 1, 2003. The Secretary will make necessary adjustments to the conversion factor to ensure payments under this part are equal to what would have been made without the amendments from the Medicare Equity Act of 2003.

The use of skilled nursing facility wage data under the prospective payment system for skilled nursing facility services is outlined in Section 4. Congress finds that skilled nursing facilities employ a different group of healthcare professionals compared to hospitals, leading to wage variation differences. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are collecting wage data for skilled nursing facilities but have not set a date for implementing an area wage index based on this data. The Social Security Act is amended to base the area wage adjustment for skilled nursing facilities on the wages of individuals employed at these facilities starting from October 1, 2003."
