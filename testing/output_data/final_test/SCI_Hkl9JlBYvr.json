    "content": "VariBAD is introduced as a method for meta-learning to perform approximate inference in unknown environments and incorporate task uncertainty during action selection. It demonstrates structured online exploration based on task uncertainty in a grid-world domain and outperforms existing methods in MuJoCo domains used in meta-RL. The text discusses the challenge of finding an optimal policy in a Markov decision process with unknown reward and transition functions. It highlights the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation to maximize expected return, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare and education. A Bayes-optimal policy, which considers the agent's uncertainty about the MDP, can be computed using Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes. The text discusses Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes (BAMDPs), where the agent maintains a belief distribution over environments to maximize expected return. Planning in a BAMDP is challenging and often relies on posterior sampling instead of computing a Bayes-optimal policy. Posterior sampling involves periodically sampling a hypothesis MDP and following the optimal policy for that sampled MDP. While planning is easier on a regular MDP, exploration can be inefficient. For example, in a gridworld scenario, a Bayes-optimal strategy strategically searches possible goal positions, while posterior sampling randomly samples a goal position and navigates there. Posterior sampling involves sampling a hypothesis MDP and following the optimal policy for that sampled MDP. In contrast, Bayes-optimal strategies strategically search possible goal positions for efficient exploration. VariBAD approximates Bayes-optimal behavior, showing that Bayes-optimal policies can explore more efficiently than posterior sampling. The challenge is to learn approximately Bayes-optimal policies while maintaining tractability. VariBAD is a method that combines Bayesian reinforcement learning, approximate variational inference, and meta-learning to enable an agent to explore new environments efficiently. It involves meta-learning to perform approximate inference on new tasks and incorporates task uncertainty during action selection. VariBAD combines Bayesian reinforcement learning, approximate variational inference, and meta-learning to efficiently explore new environments. It involves meta-learning for approximate inference on new tasks and considers task uncertainty during action selection, offering a flexible approach for learning Bayesadaptive policies tailored to the task distribution seen during training. VariBAD combines Bayesian reinforcement learning, approximate variational inference, and meta-learning to efficiently explore new environments by learning Bayesadaptive policies tailored to the task distribution seen during training. It exhibits superior exploratory behavior compared to existing meta-learning methods, achieving higher returns during learning. In a multi-task meta-learning setting, a policy is optimized to maximize the expected return by sampling MDPs from a distribution p(M). The reward and transition functions vary across tasks but share some structure. The agent is unaware of the distribution over MDPs but can sample single MDPs for training. Limited environment interactions are provided at each iteration for learning how to maximize performance within the initially unknown MDP. At meta-test time, the agent is evaluated based on the average return achieved during learning from tasks drawn from a distribution. Incorporating prior knowledge from related tasks and reasoning about task uncertainty are essential for successful performance. Combining ideas from meta-learning and Bayesian RL helps address these challenges by taking a Bayesian approach to reinforcement learning when the MDP is unknown. This involves trading off exploration and exploitation when selecting actions based on a prior distribution of transition and reward functions. The agent maintains a belief over the MDP using a posterior belief that is updated based on experience. This belief is augmented to the state space to incorporate task uncertainty into decision-making. States in the augmented space, called hyper-states, transition based on the current posterior distribution of the transition function, with rewards defined on these hyper-states. The Bayes-Adaptive Markov decision process (BAMDP) is a special case of a belief MDP where the belief is over transition and reward functions. The agent's objective is to maximize expected return in an initially unknown environment while learning within a horizon. The BAMDP framework provides a principled way to formulate Bayes-optimal behavior, balancing exploration and exploitation within a given horizon. However, solving the BAMDP is often intractable due to challenges such as limited access to the prior distribution. In the context of the BAMDP framework, the proposed method uses meta-learning for Bayesian reinforcement learning, involving meta-learning a prior over tasks and inferring reward and transition functions using deep learning. The Bayes-adaptive policy is learned end-to-end with the inference framework, eliminating the need for planning at test time and making minimal assumptions. VariBAD is a flexible and scalable approach to Bayes-adaptive Deep RL. It involves representing reward and transition functions, meta-learning for approximate variational inference, and forming a training objective without requiring task ID or description. The method uses a learned stochastic latent variable to represent task information, allowing for shared structure across multiple MDPs. The method involves inferring a stochastic latent variable to represent task information in MDPs. By learning a distribution over MDPs and computing optimal actions based on posterior knowledge, it simplifies reasoning to focus on the embedding m rather than reward and transition dynamics. This approach is beneficial for deep learning strategies, where the embedding can be a small vector compared to the millions of parameters in reward and transition functions. An RNN processes online trajectories to produce a posterior over task embeddings. The method involves using an RNN to produce a posterior over task embeddings, which is then used by a decoder to predict future states and rewards. The policy is trained using reinforcement learning and conditions on the posterior for action selection. Learning a model of the environment and an inference network allows for fast inference at runtime. The environmental model generates trajectories conditioned on actions drawn from the current policy. The method utilizes an RNN to create a posterior over task embeddings, which is then used by a decoder to forecast future states and rewards. The policy is trained through reinforcement learning and relies on the posterior for action selection. Learning an environmental model and an inference network enables quick inference during runtime. The environmental model produces trajectories based on actions from the current policy. VariBAD utilizes expressive decoders to choose the prior based on the previous posterior. The agent encodes the past trajectory to get the current posterior for inference about the current task. It decodes the entire trajectory including the future, allowing it to perform inference about unseen states given the past. This approach differs from conventional VAE setups as it decodes both past and future trajectories. VariBAD utilizes expressive decoders to choose the prior based on the previous posterior.

It decodes the entire trajectory including the future, allowing it to perform inference about unseen states given the past. This approach differs from conventional VAE setups as it decodes both past and future trajectories. The training objective involves learning the approximate posterior distribution over task embeddings, policy, and reward and transition functions using deep neural networks. The encoder, transition function, reward function, and policy are all parameterized accordingly. VariBAD utilizes expressive decoders to choose the prior based on the previous posterior. The agent encodes past trajectories using a recurrent network or an encoder to compute an encoding per (s, a, s', r)-tuple. The objective is to maximize expectations using Monte Carlo samples and optimize the ELBO with the reparameterization trick. The posterior is represented by distribution parameters, and for t = 0, the prior is set as q\u03c6(m) = N(0, I). This approach simplifies learning by using a unifying distribution over MDP embeddings, allowing for shared reward and transition functions across tasks. VariBAD utilizes expressive decoders to choose the prior based on the previous posterior. The network architecture is shown in Figure 2. The ELBO appears for all possible context lengths t, allowing variBAD to learn how to perform inference online and decrease uncertainty over time. Equation (10) is trained end-to-end, with \u03bb weighting the supervised model learning objective against the RL loss. Backpropagating the RL loss through the encoder is not necessary in practice, speeding up training considerably. In experiments, the policy and VAE are optimized using different optimizers and learning rates. The RL agent is trained with recent data, while the VAE uses a larger buffer of trajectories to compute the ELBO. During meta-test, the policy is evaluated on randomly sampled tasks without using the decoder or gradient adaptation. Meta Reinforcement Learning involves utilizing recurrent networks for fast adaptation. VariBAD is a meta-learning approach that utilizes a stochastic latent variable and a decoder to reconstruct transitions/rewards, enabling online learning within a task. It incorporates memory-based meta-learning within a Bayesian framework and aims to achieve good performance with minimal gradient steps at test time. Methods like MAML and ProMP are lightweight with a feedforward policy, while RL2 and variBAD use recurrent modules for online adaptation. Other methods involve meta-learning a loss function or a meta-critic for policy training at test time, separating exploration and exploitation. At test time, meta/transfer reinforcement learning involves learning task or skill embeddings to balance exploration and exploitation efficiently. Various approaches use variational inference to create embedding spaces for skills, such as interpolating between learned skills or conditioning the policy on optimal Q-functions. Hierarchical RL methods learn latent spaces of low-level skills controlled by higher-level policies, utilizing VAEs for encoding and decoding state trajectories. RL. Various approaches use variational inference to create embedding spaces for skills, such as interpolating between learned skills or conditioning the policy on optimal Q-functions. Different methods learn task embeddings with optimization procedures similar to MAML, updating the encoder at test time while keeping the policy fixed. In imitation learning, expert demonstrations are embedded to represent the task. VariBAD is a method in the field of imitation learning that represents task uncertainty through embedding expert demonstrations. Unlike other methods, VariBAD conditions the policy on the posterior distribution over MDPs to reason about task uncertainty and balance exploration and exploitation. It optimizes for Bayes-optimal behavior and does not use the model at test time, but model-based planning is a potential future extension. VariBAD can be applied without privileged information like task ID or expert policy. VariBAD is a method in imitation learning that leverages meta-learning and variational inference to enable tractable approximate Bayes-optimal exploration for deep RL. It optimizes for Bayes-optimal behavior by balancing exploration and exploitation, without requiring privileged information like task ID or expert policy. VariBAD leverages meta-learning and approximate variational inference for Bayes-optimal exploration in deep RL. It avoids the need for defining prior beliefs on reward functions and uses deep neural networks. Posterior sampling estimates a distribution over MDPs and samples a hypothesis MDP for policy optimization. This method is less efficient than Bayes-optimal behavior but typically has lower expected costs. The approach discussed in the curr_chunk is less efficient than Bayes-optimal behavior and has lower expected return during learning. Various methods, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and stochastic latent variables, are proposed for structured exploration and Bayesian planning in decision making. Some methods use posterior sampling for exploration, while others rely on reward bonuses and optimism in the face of uncertainty. The curr_chunk discusses reward bonuses and exploration methods in reinforcement learning, including non-Bayesian methods and variational inference. It also highlights the meta-learning approach of variBAD and mentions related work in the field. VariBAD focuses on learning Bayes-optimal policies for a given distribution over MDPs, specifically BAMDPs where the transition and reward functions constitute the hidden state. This approach differs from deep learning methods for reinforcement learning and model learning in POMDPs, as it utilizes approximate variational inference methods tailored to the fixed underlying task in BAMDPs. VariBAD focuses on learning Bayes-optimal policies for BAMDPs by utilizing fixed embeddings over time, unlike other methods that track changing hidden states. It employs deep approximate variational inference for scalable exploration and adaptation to tasks in meta-learning settings. Details and hyperparameters are available in the appendix. VariBAD provides an open-source reference implementation for learning Bayes-optimal policies in BAMDPs. It uses deep approximate variational inference for scalable exploration in meta-learning. In a gridworld environment, the agent's task is to reach a randomly selected goal in a 5x5 grid. The agent receives sparse rewards and is trained to maximize performance over 3 MDP episodes. VariBAD uses a latent dimensionality of 5 and learns the correct prior to adjust its belief over time. It predicts no reward for visited cells and explores until finding the goal. The agent's belief about the environment can be analyzed by examining the decoder predictions and how the latent space changes during interaction. VariBAD uses a 5-dimensional latent space to adjust its belief over time, predicting no reward for visited cells until finding the goal. The posterior concentrates once the goal is found, matching the Bayes-optimal policy. This approach effectively approximates Bayes-optimal control in unknown environments.

The posterior concentrates once the goal is found, matching the Bayes-optimal policy. This approach effectively approximates Bayes-optimal control in unknown environments. The embedding size is 64 with no decoder, performing worse compared to variBAD. VariBAD is capable of scaling to more complex meta learning settings by employing it on MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Performance at test time is shown compared to existing methods for HalfCheetahDir and HalfCheetahVel environments with a horizon of 200. Multiple rollouts are shown for completeness, but only the first rollout is directly relevant to maximizing performance. VariBAD and RL 2 are the only methods able to adapt to a new task within a single episode. RL 2 performs worse than variBAD on HalfCheetahDir, with slower and less stable learning. Other methods like PEARL require more environment interactions to achieve good performance, with PEARL only excelling after the third episode. E-MAML and ProMP use multiple rollouts for learning. VariBAD and RL 2 can adapt to new tasks within a single episode, with variBAD outperforming RL 2 on HalfCheetahDir. PEARL requires more interactions to excel, while E-MAML and ProMP use multiple rollouts for learning. VariBAD is more sample efficient at meta-test time, while PEARL is better during meta-training due to being an off-policy method. Overall, variBAD is a novel deep RL method that can scale up to current benchmarks and maximize expected reward within a single episode. It approximates Bayes-optimal behavior using meta-learning and performs approximate inference in unknown environments. In gridworld tasks, it closely matches Bayes-optimal behavior, and in more challenging tasks, it outperforms existing methods in terms of achieved reward. VariBAD opens a path to tractable approximate Bayes-optimal exploration for deep reinforcement learning, with potential for future work in off-policy methods and other directions. Future work based on variBAD includes using the decoder for model-predictive planning or to assess prediction accuracy. Generalizing to out-of-distribution tasks poses challenges such as incorrect inference procedures and policy interpretation, requiring further training and updates. The full ELBO derivation equation can be derived as shown in Figure 3c, illustrating the changes in the latent space during agent-environment interaction. The latent dimensions' values initially start at mean 1 and variance 0, chosen as the prior for the episode's beginning. VariBAD's extension involves learning the prior to better match the task. PyTorch framework was used for experiments, with hyperparameters listed below. Figure 5 compares variBAD's behavior with a recurrent policy, showing the recurrent policy revisiting states inefficiently. VariBAD utilizes stochastic latent embedding for task uncertainty expression and benefits from auxiliary loss in learning. Learning curves in Figure 6 demonstrate variBAD closely approximating Bayes-optimal behavior and outperforming RL2. Figure 7 displays learning curves for MuJoCo environments across all approaches, with hyperparameters tuned using the oracle policy for PPO. VariBAD, RL2, PEARL, E-MAML, and ProMP were trained using reference implementations provided by the authors. PEARL is more sample efficient due to being an off-policy method. Extending variBAD to off-policy methods is a potential future direction. PEARL uses a different encoder for posterior sampling with off-policy methods. The average run-times for different algorithms in the HalfCheetah-Dir environment are as follows: ProMP, E-MAML: 5-8 hours; variBAD: 48 hours; RL2: 60 hours; PEARL: 24 hours. E-MAML and ProMP are advantageous for not having a recurrent part like variBAD or RL2, which can slow down training. VariBAD is faster when training the policy with PPO due to not backpropagating the RL-loss through the recurrent part. The latent space for HalfCheetahDir tasks \"go right\" and \"go left\" shows rapid adaptation of latent mean and log-variance within a few environment steps. The agent also quickly adapts to the current task, with values of latent dimensions swapping signs between tasks. Variance slightly increases over time, possibly due to the rapid changes in latent mean/logvariance. The VAE might overfit to the agent in MuJoCo tasks due to continuous states and actions. Training a model to predict task description could provide insight into the agent's certainty about the task without using privileged information for meta-training. RL2 and variBAD are compared in terms of performance stability over multiple rollouts in HalfCheetah environments. RL2 shows instability, hypothesized to be due to the state providing task information once the agent has adapted. This is observed in HalfCheetahDir where the x-position influences the agent's initial direction. VariBAD addresses the issue of hidden state being ignored in recurrent networks by training the latent embedding to represent the task only. This eliminates the need for the agent to redo the inference procedure when reset to the starting position, as it can rely on the latent task description provided by the approximate posterior. The experiments were conducted using the PyTorch framework."
