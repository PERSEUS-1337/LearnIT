The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States is rapidly increasing, with a 32-fold increase in reported cases since 1982. In 1996, 16,455 cases were reported. There is no reliable diagnostic test for Lyme disease, leading to underreporting and misdiagnosis. The disease costs the nation at least $60 million a year in direct medical costs for early cases, with even higher costs for chronic cases and lost productivity. Many health care providers lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to accurately diagnose Lyme disease, leading to prolonged pain, unnecessary tests, and costly treatments. SEC. 3. PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS; FIVE-YEAR PLAN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Defense collaborate to establish goals and carry out activities to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease through grants or contracts to public or nonprofit entities. Priority is given to achieving the goals outlined in the subsections. The Secretaries prioritize achieving goals under subsections (c) to (f) in a five-year plan for activities towards reducing Lyme disease incidence. Coordination of federal programs is included. The Federal Government aims to develop accurate tests for detecting Lyme disease in individuals bitten by ticks and for determining if patients have been cured. Additionally, there is a goal to review and improve the surveillance and reporting system for Lyme disease in the United States. The Secretaries are tasked with consulting various stakeholders to improve the surveillance and reporting system for Lyme disease, including considering uniform reporting formats and analyzing data on health conditions that may not meet CDC criteria for Lyme disease cases. The Secretaries are analyzing the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease. One goal is to determine the average number of physician visits before a Lyme disease diagnosis. Another goal is to increase physician knowledge about Lyme disease. The Secretaries are analyzing Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment to determine the average number of physician visits before diagnosis and increase physician knowledge about the disease. They aim to develop an objective method to assess physicians' knowledge of Lyme disease. SEC. 4. LYME DISEASE TASK FORCE. The Lyme Disease Task Force, established within 120 days of the Act, advises the Secretaries on achieving goals related to Lyme disease. Composed of 9 members with expertise in the field, appointed by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services in consultation with relevant agencies. The Lyme Disease Task Force consists of 9 members appointed by various officials, with a designated chair. Meetings are held as needed, and members serve for the duration of the Task Force. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Lyme Disease Task Force members do not receive compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide necessary staff and support. The Task Force will terminate 90 days after the fifth fiscal year from the enactment of the Act. The Secretaries must submit periodic reports to Congress on activities and progress towards goals set by the Act. The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Defense. Authorization of appropriations is also included in the Act. The Act authorizes appropriations for the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Department of Defense for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. For the Department of Defense, $3,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. The Congress urges the FDA to quickly review new drug applications for Lyme disease immunization, ensuring labels specify strains, duration of immunization, and reliability rate."
