    "content": "The motion to recommit in the House is the last chance to affect a measure, allowing for amendatory language or sending the bill back to committee. The Speaker gives priority to those opposed to the measure, particularly minority party members, with only one proper motion allowed. If a motion is ruled out of order, a second proper motion can be offered. A motion to recommit in the House is the final opportunity to make changes to a bill before passage. It can include amendments and sending the bill back to committee. The Speaker prioritizes those opposed to the measure, especially minority party members, allowing only one proper motion. If a motion is deemed out of order, a second proper motion can be presented. House rules ensure that the motion to recommit can include instructions for an amendment if proposed by the Minority Leader or designee. During the House consideration of a bill, motions to recommit can be of two types. The first type is a \"straight\" motion with no instructions, which sends the bill back to committee if adopted. The second type includes instructions and must be offered \"forthwith,\" allowing for immediate consideration of any amendments. The House votes on any amendments before final passage of the bill. When a motion to recommit with instructions is offered during House consideration of a bill, the clerk will report it in a specific form. Both types of motions to recommit are debatable for 10 minutes, with the option to extend debate time to one hour. The motion to recommit with instructions during House consideration of a bill allows for debate time to be extended to one hour. Instructions in the motion must adhere to specific rules and cannot propose amendments that are not allowed under House rules. The motion to recommit has historical roots in the British Parliament and has evolved since the First Congress. The motion to recommit historically allowed for corrections to be made to a bill, with the Speaker ruling in 1891 that a bill could be recommitted \"forthwith.\" Formerly, the motion was not reserved for members opposed to the measure, and the majority floor manager would sometimes make a motion expecting it to be defeated. This provided a final opportunity to correct errors within the measure. The motion to recommit underwent significant changes in 1909, allowing priority in recognition to offer the motion to a Member opposed to the bill. This change aimed to give the minority a vote on important public issues. The Fitzgerald amendment in 1932 solidified the motion to recommit as a \"minority right\" in the House rules, allowing ten minutes of debate on the motion. This change raised questions about the necessity of the motion to recommit, especially with the introduction of recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole. The motion to recommit in the House rules had been questioned for its necessity due to the introduction of recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole. Despite the expanded rules on voting, the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit remained intact. The House recognized that ten minutes of debate might not always be sufficient for motions that could add substantial portions of legislation, leading to a review of the language in clause 2(c) at the start of the 99th Congress. During the 99th Congress, a rule was added allowing the majority floor manager to extend debate time on a motion to one hour. In the 110th Congress, there was an increase in motions to recommit offered, specifically with instructions. The Rules Committee was prohibited from reporting a special rule that would prevent offering a motion to recommit with instructions. During the 99th Congress, a rule was added allowing the majority floor manager to extend debate time on a motion to one hour. In the 110th Congress, there was an increase in motions to recommit offered, specifically with instructions. Some Members argued that motions to recommit with \"non-forthwith\" instructions were designed to trap majority party members reluctant to vote against the motion's amendment, forcing them into a \"lose-lose\" situation. The House amended its rules during the 111th Congress to require instructions for motions to recommit to be in the form of a direction to report amendments back \"forthwith.\" Additionally, \"straight\" motions to recommit became debatable, a change that remains in effect today. This procedural tool allows the minority to offer and vote on policy language of their choice. The motion to recommit allows the minority to offer and vote on policy language of their choice, granting them the last opportunity to amend legislation before final passage. It can send the bill back to the committee for further work if approved. The motion to recommit allows the minority to offer policy amendments before final passage, potentially sending the bill to a different committee. An ad hoc committee may be created for this purpose, as seen in the example provided. In 1975, a \"straight\" motion to recommit attempted to send a bill reported by the Committee on Ways and Means to another committee, potentially achieving the legislation's goal under different jurisdiction. This type of motion could effectively dispose of the bill as the committee is not obligated to take further action once recommitted. Debate on such a motion may provide non-binding suggestions for improving the measure. The motion to recommit underwent changes in 1909 to give the minority a vote on important issues. The decision to act on a recommitted measure can be influenced by House and committee rules. The Speaker pro tempore cannot determine if committee rules constrain timing or if points of order could prevent further proceedings. This implies that the motion has both procedural and political effects, allowing Members to take a stance on specific policies. Members can use a motion to recommit to show support or opposition to a policy, create a public record of their views, and express discontent with the legislative process. This motion can delay or \"kill\" a measure by sending it back to committee without instructions for further action. In the 110th and 111th Congress, there was an increase in motions to recommit, especially those with \"non-forthwith\" instructions. The success of motions to recommit \"forthwith\" also increased during this time. In the 110th and 111th Congress, there was a notable increase in motions to recommit, particularly those with \"non-forthwith\" instructions. The total number of motions to recommit offered in the 110th Congress was 120, more than double the 54 offered in the 109th Congress. This increase was not solely due to an increase in opportunities for the minority to offer the motion. In the 110th and 111th Congress, the minority offered motions to recommit on a higher percentage of occasions compared to previous Congresses. In the 110th Congress, there were 120 motions to recommit, with a mix of \"forthwith\" and \"non-forthwith\" instructions. The number of \"straight\" motions remained consistent across the examined period. During the 110th and 111th Congress, motions to recommit with \"forthwith\" instructions increased significantly, with 72 and 69 motions respectively. The 110th Congress also saw a sharp rise in motions with \"non-forthwith\" instructions, totaling 47, which was over 500% higher than the average from 1989 to 2006. The increased use of motions to recommit with \"non-forthwith\" instructions led to a rules change in the 111th Congress, prohibiting its further use. The composition of motions to recommit varied by type in each Congress, with a shift towards more \"straight\" motions after the prohibition of \"non-forthwith\" instructions. During the past eleven congresses, motions to recommit with \"forthwith\" instructions saw varying success rates. The average adoption rate was 6.5 motions per Congress, but there was a notable increase in the 110th and 111th Congresses, with adoption rates of 33% and 28% respectively. This marked a significant difference from the 109th Congress, where the adoption rate was 0%. The success rate of motions to recommit with \"forthwith\" instructions varied during the past eleven congresses, with an average rate of 6.5 motions per Congress. The adoption rate increased significantly in the 110th and 111th Congresses to 33% and 28% respectively, compared to 0% in the 109th Congress."
