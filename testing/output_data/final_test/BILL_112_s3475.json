    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and Minorities in STEM Booster Act of 2012\" aims to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through a grant program. The National Science Foundation aims to excel in STEM education. STEM education is crucial for the US to lead in the global economy. The US must embrace the innovative capacity of all individuals, as highlighted in a report on women in STEM. The Department of Commerce found that women make up 24% of STEM workers despite comprising 48% of the U.S. workforce. Between 2000 and 2009, women's share of the STEM workforce remained constant at 24%, while their share of all college-educated workers increased from 46% to 49%. Additionally, women account for nearly half of employed college graduates but only about 25% of employed STEM degree holders and just about 20% of STEM degree holders working in STEM jobs. In 2007, underrepresented minority groups made up 33.2% of the college-age population but only 17.7% of STEM undergraduate degree earners. Freshmen from these groups show interest in STEM degrees at the same rate as others, but only 22.1% of Latino students, 18.4% of African-American students, and 18.8% of Native American students complete their STEM degree within 5 years, compared to higher rates for White and Asian students. The National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering emphasizes the need to increase underrepresented minorities in engineering to remain competitive. The National Science Foundation will award grants to promote the participation of women and minorities in STEM fields. The National Science Foundation will award grants to promote the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through eligible entities like departments of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics at higher education institutions, consortia of these departments, partnerships with education departments, colleges, or schools, and nonprofit organizations including scientific or professional societies. The National Science Foundation will award grants to eligible entities to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through activities like online workshops. Eligible entities include departments of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics at higher education institutions, consortia of these departments, partnerships with education departments, colleges, or schools, and nonprofit organizations focused on advancing underrepresented populations in science and engineering. Applicants must submit an application to the NSF Director to receive a grant. The National Science Foundation will award grants to increase participation of women and minorities in STEM fields through various programs like online workshops, mentoring, internships, and outreach programs for students. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2015."
