    "content": "For over 20 years, economic and trade relations between the United States and Vietnam were frozen due to the Vietnam War. President Ford extended the trade embargo to cover the reunified nation in 1975. Relations began to improve during the Clinton Administration, with efforts to recover the remains of missing U.S. military personnel and Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia. President Clinton lifted the trade embargo. President Bill Clinton ended the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994 and appointed the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam since the Vietnam War. Bilateral relations improved due to Vietnam's shift to market socialism in 1986, leading to over 20 years of rapid economic growth. Vietnam's real GDP growth averaged over 7% per year since 1995, driven by foreign investments in manufacturing, especially the clothing industry. The United States and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement in 2000, extending most favored nation trade status to Vietnam. The United States granted Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status in 2006 as part of Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization. Both nations established a ministerial-level Trade and Investment Agreement (TIFA) Council to discuss trade and investment policies. Official U.S. and Vietnamese trade data closely reflect bilateral trade growth. Following the granting of conditional NTR in December 2001, trade between the United States and Vietnam grew quickly. Bilateral trade nearly doubled between 2001 and 2002, and jumped again in 2007 after the United States granted PNTR status to Vietnam. Total trade declined slightly in 2009 due to the economic recession, but U.S. exports to Vietnam increased by 11.4%. Both nations are negotiating membership in the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPP). Vietnam seeks closer trade relations with the US through GSP program and BIT negotiations. Trade growth led to monitoring programs for clothing exports and tensions over catfish exports. Other issues include poor working conditions, non-market economy designation, inadequate IPR protection, and exchange rate policy. This report will analyze these trade issues and their implications for Congress. The Bush Administration notified Congress of its intention to enter into negotiations with the members of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPP) on September 22, 2008. The TPP is a multilateral free trade agreement between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore that came into force in 2006. The U.S. interest in joining the TPP was followed by Australia, Peru, and Vietnam expressing similar interest. The Obama Administration stated that U.S. participation in the TPP would strengthen U.S. trade and investment ties in the Asia-Pacific region. Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Gai Khiem listed negotiations to join the TPP as a top trade priority in 2009. The first meeting of interested parties was held in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2010, with the next round scheduled for June in the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk stated the negotiations had a strong start and further input would be sought. Vietnam's participation in the TPP negotiations could complicate U.S. intentions as it has made less progress in trade and investment liberalization compared to other parties involved. This could constrain U.S. efforts to expand the scope and depth of the TPP. Backers argue that Vietnam's involvement could accelerate economic reforms and open its economy to more foreign investment and trade. Vietnam's membership in ASEAN and support for a pan-Asian trade association could exclude the United States. ASEAN has organized meetings with various Asian nations to discuss forming a free trade area. Vietnamese trade officials expressed interest in the United States playing a more active role in a possible ASEAN + 8 trade association. Vietnam, as the ASEAN chair for 2010, welcomes the United States joining the East Asia Summit. A bill in Congress could impact TPP negotiations by requiring core labor rights and intellectual property protection. Vietnam has requested inclusion in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program. Vietnam has requested inclusion in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, but there has been no formal announcement regarding the status of their application. The GSP program allows duty-free treatment for eligible products from beneficiary countries, with specific criteria set by Congress. Vietnam sees inclusion in the U.S. GSP program as a high trade priority, having already been accepted into similar programs by Canada, the EU, and Japan. Vietnam has requested inclusion in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, with their application discussed during a meeting in Washington, DC. The Vietnamese government views acceptance into the GSP program as a step towards normalizing bilateral relations. However, the U.S. has concerns about Vietnam's eligibility due to questions about its classification as a \"Communist\" country according to U.S. law. Under the Trade Act of 1974, a \"Communist\" country is ineligible for the GSP program unless certain conditions are met. Vietnam's eligibility for the GSP program is also questioned regarding worker rights and IPR protection. The President can waive compliance with worker rights and IPR protection criteria but not the \"Communist\" country criterion. The GSP program excludes \"Communist\" countries unless specific conditions are met. Vietnam's eligibility for the GSP program is questioned due to its status as a \"Communist\" country. Observers debate whether Vietnam's economic system still qualifies as \"Communist\" after reforms. The country must also meet criteria related to worker rights, which has been a challenge. The GSP program excludes \"Communist\" countries unless specific conditions are met. Despite efforts by the Vietnamese government to improve workers' rights, critics argue that working conditions still fall below international standards, particularly due to the lack of independent labor unions and respect for workers' rights. Vietnam has faced criticism for its failure to allow independent labor unions and respect workers' rights. The country has been on the U.S. Special 301 Watch List for online piracy. Despite improvements in IPR protection, enforcement efforts have not kept pace with increasing levels of infringement and piracy. Administrative actions and penalties have not been effective deterrents, leading to revisions in IPR laws and criminal penalties for commercial-scale infringement in 2009. Vietnam has faced criticism for its failure to allow independent labor unions and respect workers' rights. The country has been on the U.S. Special 301 Watch List for online piracy. Despite improvements in IPR protection, enforcement efforts have not kept pace with increasing levels of infringement and piracy. Administrative actions and penalties have not been effective deterrents, leading to revisions in IPR laws and criminal penalties for commercial-scale infringement in 2009. The NTE indicated that Vietnamese agencies took initial steps to enforce IP protections on the Internet, impacting Vietnam's GSP application decision. Congress has no direct role in determining Vietnam's acceptance into the U.S. GSP program; this decision lies with the President. Congress could indicate its preferences on Vietnam's acceptance into the U.S. GSP program through various methods, such as authorizing or instructing the President, passing legislation with additional eligibility criteria, or enacting the Vietnam Human Rights Act to ensure workers' rights criteria are met. During a meeting in June 2008, President Bush and Prime Minister Dung announced talks to establish a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) aimed at improving the climate for foreign investors. The first round of BIT negotiations took place in Washington, DC in December 2008, with Vietnam having signed over 50 BITs. The United States has signed 47 BITs, with 40 currently in force. The Vietnamese government and the U.S. delegation have been engaged in multiple rounds of talks to establish a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The negotiations aim to improve the climate for foreign investors and potentially lead to a free trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries. The U.S. government's interest in the BIT negotiations is focused on providing better protection and access for U.S. investors in Vietnam. The U.S. government is focused on providing better protection and access for U.S. investors in Vietnam through bilateral investment treaty (BIT) negotiations. The negotiations are based on a model BIT and aim to reduce barriers to investment while ensuring equal rights for foreign and domestic investors. The Obama administration is reviewing the current model BIT for better investment protections for U.S. investors in Vietnam. The existing 2001 Bilateral Trade Agreement includes provisions for investment, dispute settlement, and transparency in investment laws. Article 11 and 13 of the Bilateral Trade Agreement between the United States and Vietnam focus on compliance with WTO TRIMs and negotiating a bilateral investment treaty. Vietnam's clothing exports to the U.S. benefited from conditional NTR status granted in 2001. Senate ratification may be required for the BIT, potentially leading to changes in U.S. law. The U.S. granted Vietnam conditional NTR status in 2001, leading to a significant increase in U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam. Clothing imports peaked in 2003 at 51.4% of total imports, with continued growth until 2009. Efforts to restrict clothing trade with Vietnam were made, including a bilateral textile agreement and a monitoring program that expired in 2009. Vietnam complied with U.S. policies despite initial protests. During the congressional debate over the bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, Members of Congress expressed concerns about a surge in Vietnamese clothing exports to the United States. They urged President Bush to negotiate a separate bilateral textile agreement with Vietnam due to the absence of quotas on Vietnam's clothing exports to the U.S. Members believed it was crucial to address the impact on U.S. clothing and textile companies and workers. The United States and Vietnam agreed to a bilateral textile agreement with quantity quotas on clothing imports from Vietnam from 2003 to 2006, with annual quantity increases. Vietnam also lowered tariffs on U.S. clothing and textiles exports. Congressional interest in U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam resurfaced during negotiations for Vietnam's WTO accession. During negotiations for Vietnam's WTO accession, U.S. textiles and clothing manufacturers sought import quota extensions or safeguard measures similar to China's agreement, but these were not included. A monitoring program was implemented by the Bush Administration from January 2007 to January 2009, officially ending on January 19, 2009. Concerns arose in Congress about a surge in clothing imports from China and Vietnam after the program ended. The House Committee on Appropriations requested apparel import monitoring on prices from China and Vietnam to prevent illegal pricing and dumping in the U.S. market. Concerns remain about the rapid rise in Vietnamese clothing imports, with the need for specific congressional action for monitoring to occur. The House Committee on Appropriations requested monitoring of Vietnamese clothing imports to prevent illegal pricing and dumping in the U.S. market. Charles Rangel requested an investigation to monitor U.S. clothing and textile imports from China. Catfish trade friction between the U.S. and Vietnam has been ongoing due to Vietnamese exports of basa and tra frozen fish fillets. In 2009, Vietnam exported 47,000 tons of basa and tra, worth $134 million to the United States, despite U.S. objections and actions. The U.S. imposed antidumping duties on Vietnamese fish fillets in 2003, but exports continued to rise. Vietnam sees U.S. measures as trade protectionism, while U.S. supporters argue they are necessary. Supporters of U.S. trade policies against Vietnam's basa and tra exports claim they protect consumers and businesses from unsafe products and unfair practices. Tensions escalated due to the 2008 Farm Bill and the ITC's decision to maintain antidumping duties on Vietnamese fish fillets. The legal status of Vietnam's exports was questioned by the 2008 Farm Act, which established a grading program for catfish. The 2008 Farm Act transferred regulation of imported catfish from the FDA to the USDA, leading to objections from Vietnam's catfish industry. Ambassador Le Cong Phung raised concerns about the reclassification of basa and tra under stricter USDA inspection standards. The USDA proposed reclassifying basa and tra as catfish, sparking concerns about WTO commitments and job losses for Vietnamese farmers. The 2008 Farm Act aimed to protect U.S. consumers, with draft regulations for catfish safety inspections under review by the OMB. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack discussed the criteria for new safety inspections, including consumer safety, scientific evidence, and trade relations. Senators and Representatives raised concerns about proposed cuts to the USDA Catfish Inspection Program. Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development prepared for potential increased U.S. inspection requirements. Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has tightened export hygiene standards for basa and tra fish, requiring certificates for hygiene and food safety. The Ministry has also enlisted U.S.-based Mazzetta Company to train Vietnamese fish breeders to comply with U.S. standards. The International Trade Commission (ITC) extended antidumping duties on certain frozen fish fillets from Vietnam, a decision opposed by the Vietnamese government and the Vietnam Fishery Association. The Fishery Association opposes the ITC's decision on import restrictions for basa and tra fish from Vietnam. The 110th Congress passed legislation to protect the U.S. catfish industry, and the 111th Congress may continue this trend by regulating catfish imports. Congress may focus on defining catfish, inspection requirements, and reclaiming authority over the issue. The 111th Congress may address issues related to imported catfish and fish products, including workers' rights, Vietnam's designation as a non-market economy, IPR protection, and exchange rate policy. Concerns have been raised by the U.S. government and NGOs about Vietnam's enforcement of labor laws despite improvements. The State Department's 2009 human rights report on Vietnam highlighted issues with labor unions, child labor, and safety conditions in small- and medium-sized enterprises. Workers in Vietnam have the right to collective bargaining, but unionization rates vary among different types of enterprises. Human Rights Watch has also expressed concerns about Vietnamese workers' rights. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about Vietnamese workers' ability to strike at state-owned enterprises, with government suppression hindering efforts to organize independent unions. Despite restrictions, progress has been made in worker rights since the launch of doi moi. Unofficial \"labor associations\" have emerged without significant repression, and the VGCL has become a more aggressive advocate for workers. Vietnamese workers have gone on strike due to feeling unrepresented by the official union, indicating tacit acknowledgment by the government of enforcement issues with labor laws. The Vietnamese government acknowledges issues with labor law enforcement and is working with international organizations to improve regulations. Various reports have highlighted problems with worker rights protection and efforts to enhance working conditions in Vietnam. The VGCL has been criticized for its flaws, but there are initiatives to address these issues. The Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) is collaborating with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to finalize new labor laws and a Trade Union Law for submission to Vietnam's National Assembly in October 2010. Additionally, efforts are underway with Spain's Agency for International Development Cooperation to eliminate child labor in Vietnam. The United Nations is providing $2 million to help the VGCL improve grassroots relations as Vietnam transitions to a market economy through equitization of state-owned enterprises. The Vietnamese government is transitioning to a market economy through equitization of state-owned enterprises, with some shares sold to the public on the stock exchange. Despite deregulation, the government still retains control over the economy. Vietnam seeks recognition as a market economy from major trading partners, with some already designating it as such. The US considers Vietnam a non-market economy for up to 12 years post WTO accession or until it meets specific criteria. The Vietnamese government is seeking market economy designation from major trading partners, including the US. This designation is important for Vietnam's trade relations normalization with the US and affects the outcome of antidumping and countervailing duty cases. The US government remains critical of Vietnam's record on intellectual property rights protection, as Vietnam continues to face issues with IPR piracy and trademark infringement. Vietnam was included in the \"Watch List\" in the U.S. Trade Representative's 2010 Special 301 Report for these reasons. The United States is encouraged by recent steps taken by Vietnam to improve IPR protection and enforcement. The US government criticizes Vietnam's inadequate enforcement efforts against piracy and counterfeiting, despite funding IPR enforcement training in 2009. Legislation like the TRADE Act of 2009 aims to ensure future trade agreements promote effective protection of intellectual property rights, potentially impacting ongoing BIT negotiations. Enactment of H.R. 3012 or S. 2821 could impact BIT negotiations. Legislation like H.R. 2410 and H.R. 2475 would establish intellectual property attaches in U.S. embassies. Vietnam's exchange rate policy remains government-managed. Since March 2009, the State Bank of Vietnam has widened the band for the Vietnamese dong's fluctuation against the U.S. dollar to \u00b15% from the official exchange rate, devaluing the dong three times. The last devaluation occurred on February 10, 2010, lowering the official interbank exchange rate to 18,544 dong = $1. Vietnam's exchange rate policy may subject it to proposed economic sanctions and contribute to its designation as a non-market economy by U.S. government agencies. The final section of the report analyzes potential sources of future trade friction between the United States and Vietnam by examining trends in bilateral trade figures, focusing on merchandise trade, trade in services, and foreign direct investment. Key U.S. imports from Vietnam in 2009, besides clothing and fish, were furniture, bedding, footwear, and electrical goods. In 2009, top U.S. exports to Vietnam included non-railway vehicles, machinery, iron and steel, meat, cotton, plastic articles, food waste, electrical machinery, optical equipment, and wood products. Vietnam has become the fourth-largest source of furniture and bedding imports for the United States, surpassing Italy, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Furniture and bedding accounted for over 11% of total U.S. imports from Vietnam in 2009. In 2009, U.S. imports from Vietnam saw significant growth, with footwear imports accounting for over 10% of total imports. Vietnam was the second-largest source of footwear imports for the United States, surpassing Italy, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Electrical machinery exports from Vietnam to the U.S. increased over 1,000-fold in the last decade, reaching over $630 million in 2009. There is great potential for growth in this sector due to Vietnam's skilled and inexpensive workforce. Vietnam also imports substantial amounts of cotton from the U.S. for manufacturing. Vietnam imports cotton from the United States for clothing manufacturing and wood for furniture exports to the U.S. There is significant cross-trade in electrical machinery between the two countries. Efforts to limit Vietnam's top exports to the U.S. could lead to a decline in U.S. exports to Vietnam and potential job losses. The U.S. sees a trade advantage in services, particularly financial services, under the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) with Vietnam. Vietnam has committed to liberalizing various services sectors under the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), including financial services, telecommunications, express delivery, distribution services, and certain professions. The country received $60 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI) in 2008, with Malaysia being the leading source. The United States is the seventh-largest source of FDI in Vietnam over the last 10 years. Matthew Daley, former president of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, predicts that the United States will become the largest foreign direct investor in Vietnam in the next two to three years. During the first quarter of 2009, nearly two-thirds of the FDI registered in Vietnam was from the United States. Growing U.S. interest in investment opportunities in Vietnam could impact BIT negotiations and the 111th Congress. More U.S. companies investing in Vietnam may lead to business disagreements and pressure on Congress to address issues with Vietnam's treatment of foreign-owned enterprises."
