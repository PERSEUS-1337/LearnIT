    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Steel and Metal Consumers Radioactivity Protection Act\". The metals industry in the United States is a $100 billion plus industry that employs millions of Americans. Most metals can be recycled multiple times, conserving natural resources and promoting a healthy environment. However, radioactive contamination in steel scrap and other metals from nuclear fuel production poses a risk to public safety, threatens recycling efforts, and can cause significant damage to facilities. The metals industry in the United States aims to prevent radioactive contamination from nuclear fuel production from entering its facilities and products. There are currently no approved standards for releasing metals with radioactive contamination in the US, and the public has rejected previous attempts to set such standards. Consumers are expected to reject products with unknown levels of radioactive contamination from Department of Energy facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering setting a specified level of radioactive material in metals for unrestricted use. There is currently a lack of accountability and standards for radioactive content in metals imported into the United States, as the Commission lacks authority to regulate them upon importation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering setting a specified level of radioactive material in metals for unrestricted use, as there is currently a lack of accountability and standards for radioactive content in imported metals. The Commission lacks authority to regulate them upon importation. SEC. 3. DUTIES OF FEDERAL AGENCIES. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will establish a standard for controlling the release of radioactively contaminated scrap metal to protect consumers' health and safety. Until the standard is set, no actions will be taken to facilitate the release of such materials. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will establish a standard for controlling the release of radioactively contaminated scrap metal to protect consumers' health and safety. All radioactively contaminated equipment, devices, commodities, and materials approved for release will be governed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and its regulations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is prohibited from setting different release regulations for contaminated materials from those with byproduct and source material. Departments of Defense, Energy, EPA, and other agencies must adopt stringent standards for radioactively contaminated metals. The United States Customs Service will monitor and enforce standards for radioactively contaminated metals at the borders within 12 months of their establishment. The Secretary of State will collaborate with international bodies to adopt consistent standards once the initial standard is set. Before the standard established under subsection (a) takes effect, all scrap metal imported into the United States must be accompanied by documentation stating the amount of radioactive contamination certified by the exporting country's government and validating the absence of any nuclear materials. This requirement will be enforced 90 days after the enactment of the Act, with the Secretary of Commerce tasked to implement the rule. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE DOCUMENTATION.\n\nAny person who knowingly falsifies required documentation shall face a civil penalty of up to $250,000 per violation.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce must submit an annual report to Congress listing violations of standards under section 3, including the volume of contaminated metals involved, country of origin, and metal type.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines terms related to nuclear regulation, including \"agreement state\" and \"nuclear fuel production facility.\" The curr_chunk discusses facilities and equipment used for processing irradiated materials containing special nuclear material or byproduct material, with exceptions for laboratory scale facilities and those operating under specific regulations. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for processing irradiated special nuclear material, limiting batch sizes and defining radioactively contaminated materials. The curr_chunk defines scrap metal as metal items no longer used for their original purpose, destined for processing to produce new metal materials and products."
