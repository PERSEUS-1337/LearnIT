Invariant Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks (IVE-GANs) address this by introducing a mapping from data to the latent space, encouraging the generator to cover all modes. This approach has shown effectiveness in generative performance and learning rich representations on various datasets. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful framework for training generative models. GANs consist of two competing networks: a generative model that captures the distribution of a dataset and a discriminative model that distinguishes between real and synthetic data. Through iterative training, the discriminator learns features from real data that the generator does not synthesize, resulting in rich representations in the latent space. The limitations of GANs include the inability to encode individual data points in the latent space and the tendency to generate only a few major modes of the true data distribution, leading to poor representation of the data. Despite promising results in tasks like image and 3D object generation, training a GAN is challenging and sensitive to hyper-parameter selection. The proposed IVE-GAN framework extends the classical GAN architecture by adding an encoding unit E to map true data samples to the latent space. The discriminator distinguishes between different transformations of input samples and generated samples, while the encoder is forced to encode necessary information in the latent space for the generator to produce similar samples. The IVE-GAN framework adds an encoding unit to the classical GAN architecture, allowing the encoder to create an invariant representation of the data by ignoring variations. This helps the generator cover all modes of the data distribution and generate novel samples. The GAN framework encourages the generator to cover all data distribution modes by feeding it with a latent representation. It aims to learn rich and transformation invariant data representations in the latent space, avoiding mode collapsing issues and producing realistic samples. The GAN framework uses a generator distribution to match the true data distribution, competing against a discriminator network. Mode collapsing is a common issue in GAN training, addressed by conditioning the generator with additional information. Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets utilize additional information like class-labels to direct data generation. The framework adds regularizers to the classical GAN, training an encoder in addition to the generator to force generated modes closer to true data modes. Distance measures like pixel-wise L2 distance are used to encourage the generator to target minor modes. The objective of GANs is extended by a mode regulizer to target minor modes near major modes. Unrolled GANs update the generator by backpropagating through discriminator gradients to reduce mode collapsing. Coulomb GAN models the learning problem as a potential field to avoid mode collapse. Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) and Adversarially Learning Inference are frameworks that extend the GAN framework by adding an encoder E to train the discriminator on distinguishing joint samples (x, E(x)) from (G(z), z) in both data and latent spaces. The encoder learns to invert the generator almost everywhere to fool the discriminator, but visual inspection of results shows vague similarity between original data x and reconstructions G(E(x)), especially with complex data like CelebA. The encoder in G(E(x) focuses on prominent features like gender, age, and hair color but misses subtle traits. By using a set S invariant under a transformation T, a discriminator can learn underlying concepts. Training a generator on producing samples from S, such as high-level facial features, can be achieved through an adversarial procedure. This approach is particularly useful for datasets like natural images of faces. We propose a method to learn a mapping from data to a latent space using invariant features. The approach involves discriminating generated samples conditioned on encoded original samples and transformations of an original sample. The encoder extracts features to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to discriminate variations from original and generated samples. The IVE-GAN method involves using invariant features to learn a mapping from data to a latent space. The encoder extracts individual features from original samples to fool the discriminator, while the generator produces variants of the original. By introducing invariance in the discriminator with respect to transformations, the generator aims to match the distribution of transformed true data. Careful selection of transformations is crucial in this min-max game. The IVE-GAN method uses invariant features to map data to a latent space. Experiments are conducted on three datasets to evaluate the quality of generated samples and learned representations. A synthetic dataset is used to test for mode collapsing, with small shifts in dimensions as invariant transformations. The IVE-GAN model uses invariant features to generate samples that converge to all modes of the true data distribution. It is evaluated on the MNIST dataset with small random shifts and rotations as invariant transformations. Novel samples are generated by randomly sampling the latent representation. The IVE-GAN model with a 16-dimensional and 3-dimensional latent space can reproduce digit classes accurately. It learns a rich representation of the MNIST dataset in 3 dimensions using class-invariant transformations. Distinct clusters for different digit classes are observed. The model is also evaluated on the CelebA dataset with small random shifts as invariant transformations. In the case of MNIST, invariant transformations are defined as small random shifts, rotations, flips, and variations in brightness, contrast, and hue. Reconstructed images show similarity to original images in both prominent features and subtle traits. Novel samples generated from the IVE-GAN on the CelebA dataset demonstrate the influence of noise components on image generation. The trained IVE-GAN encodes samples from the CelebA dataset into a 1024-dimensional latent space and projects it into two dimensions using t-SNE. The representation is evaluated based on its ability to cluster images with similar features and perform smooth interpolation in the feature space. The IVE-GAN can map images from the dataset into a latent space and interpolate between them, generating visually appealing images with smooth transformations. The model includes an encoding unit that maps data to a latent representation, allowing it to generate new realistic images. The IVE-GAN framework was evaluated on three datasets, showing its ability to generate high variance and visually appealing images. The IVE-GAN can generate visually appealing images of high variance while learning a rich representation of the dataset and covering subtle features."
