    "content": "Health insurance exchanges, established by states, the federal government, or a combination of both, offer private health plans to individuals and small businesses. These exchanges provide comprehensive health services and comply with ACA insurance market reforms. Exchange plans are categorized based on actuarial value (AV) with bronze (60%), silver (70%), gold (80%), and platinum (90%) levels. The ACA requires exchanges to offer insurance options to individuals and small businesses, with separate exchanges for each. States have the option to provide one exchange for both. Individual exchange enrollees may be eligible for federal tax credits, not available through SHOP exchanges. Premium credits are advanceable and refundable tax credits. The ACA allows individuals to receive tax credits to lower insurance costs, even if they have little to no federal income tax liability. The Treasury Department and IRS have issued regulations and guidance on eligibility and requirements for these premium credits. These credits are available to applicable taxpayers in coverage months. An applicable taxpayer is an individual enrolled in a plan through an individual exchange with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. Premium assistance in the form of tax credits is provided, administered through the tax system. Qualifying individuals must file federal tax returns to claim the credit, even if their incomes do not normally require filing. Married couples must file joint tax returns to claim the credit. The final regulation includes special rules for calculating and allocating credit amounts due to changes in filing status during a tax year. It acknowledges challenges to filing jointly, such as domestic abuse, and proposes additional rules to address these circumstances. Premium credits are only available to individuals and families enrolled in plans through individual exchanges, not through small business exchanges. Individuals must meet certain criteria to enroll in a state exchange. The final regulation clarifies that only lawful residents can obtain exchange coverage under the ACA. Undocumented individuals are prohibited from purchasing coverage through an exchange. Family members of incarcerated individuals may receive premium credits if they meet all eligibility criteria. Individuals must meet household income guidelines based on the federal poverty level (FPL) to qualify for premium credits under the ACA. Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is used to determine eligibility, with those at or above 100% FPL up to 400% FPL potentially eligible. Certain types of coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may disqualify individuals from receiving premium credits. The ACA provides exceptions for eligibility for minimum essential coverage and receipt of premium credits, including coverage through individual health insurance market, employer-sponsored plans, and other recognized coverage by the HHS Secretary. An individual may be eligible for premium credits if their employer's coverage is unaffordable or does not provide minimum value. Those eligible for limited benefits under Medicaid may also qualify for premium credits. Small employers may offer coverage through SHOP exchanges. Enrollees in employer-sponsored coverage through an exchange are not eligible for premium credits. The ACA's Medicaid expansion can impact eligibility for premium credits. Medicaid expansion under the ACA can affect eligibility for premium credits for low to middle-income individuals seeking health insurance through exchanges. States have the option to expand Medicaid to include certain individuals with income up to 138% FPL, receiving federal subsidies. If a person eligible for premium credits is determined to be eligible for Medicaid, they must be enrolled in Medicaid. Premium credit eligibility begins at 100% FPL in states that have expanded Medicaid. Premium credit eligibility begins where Medicaid eligibility ends, with exceptions for those with limited benefits under Medicaid. The amount of the premium tax credit varies based on household income, the exchange plan premium, and other factors. In some cases, the credit may cover the entire premium cost. The premium credit amount is determined based on comparing the premium for the exchange plan with a reference plan in the local area. The tax filer may pay part or all of the premium, with the credit covering the lesser amount. The premium credit a tax filer receives is capped as a percentage of household income, with lower incomes having a lower applicable percentage. For income between 100%-133% FPL, the contribution is capped at 2.01%, and for 300%-400% FPL, it is capped at 9.56%. The IRS specifies applicable percentages for incomes in between. The line graph in Figure 1 illustrates the applicable percentage used to calculate the tax filer's required premium contribution based on income levels relative to the federal poverty level. The applicable percentage increases incrementally as income rises from 133% to 300% FPL. For example, at 150% FPL, the maximum premium contribution is 4.02% of household income, increasing to 4.07% at 151% FPL. There is a gradual change in premium contribution between 133% and 300% FPL, but a \"cliff\" exists beyond 300% FPL. The premium contribution for incomes between 133% and 300% FPL increases incrementally, but there is a significant jump for individuals/families below 133% FPL due to statutory requirements. In some cases, a person's required premium contribution could equal or exceed the premium of the second-lowest-cost silver plan, resulting in zero premium credit. Despite being based on the reference plan, individuals/families can still enroll in any metal-tier plan and remain eligible for credits. For 2015, Table 2 and Table 3 show income levels used to calculate premium credits and maximum monthly premium contributions for individuals/families. The cliff effect at 133% FPL ensures affordable premiums based on income levels. Individuals below 133% FPL pay 2.01% of income for the second-lowest-cost silver plan, while those at 133% FPL may pay 3.02% of income. In 2015, individuals at 133% FPL may pay $26 in monthly premiums for the second-lowest-cost plan, increasing to $39 with just one additional dollar of income. This could result in an additional $156 in premium contributions. Prior to the ACA, there were no federal subsidies for individuals at this income level, but more people may now be eligible for subsidized coverage under the law. The curr_chunk provides exchange information on premiums, enrollee contributions, and estimated premium credit amounts for hypothetical individuals and families in zip code 60647. Premiums vary based on age due to age rating requirements in health insurance policies. Premiums for metal-tier plans in a specific geographic area vary by a 3:1 ratio for adults aged 21 to 64+. Premium credit amounts are higher for lower-income individuals compared to higher-income individuals of the same age. For example, in zip code 60647, monthly premiums for self-only coverage in the second-lowest-cost silver plan are $168 for a 21-year-old and $506 for a 64-year-old, reflecting the 3:1 age-rating ratio. The pre-credit premium for older adults (persons B and D) is three times greater than for younger adults (persons A and C). Age does not determine the premium contribution amount for credit recipients, as it is based on income. Therefore, individuals with the same income level may pay the same amount towards exchange premiums, regardless of age. Persons C and D have the same income level, but person C pays a lower premium than expected due to income limits. Family coverage follows similar rules as self-only coverage. Older adults pay higher pre-credit premiums than younger adults, but premium contributions are based on income, not age. Under the ACA, premium credits are based on prior year's income tax returns and reconciled when filing tax returns for the actual year. Any additional credit due to income decrease will be included in the tax refund, while excess premium credits must be repaid to the federal government with limits imposed. Older adults pay higher pre-credit premiums than younger adults, but premium contributions are based on income, not age. The ACA imposes limits on excess amounts to be repaid for tax credits, with specific limits for different income levels. These limits have been amended twice since the ACA's enactment. Repayment limits vary by income band, with lower-income families having lower repayment requirements. For example, families with income below 200% FPL may only have to repay up to $600 for tax credit overpayments. The IRS limits repayment for tax credit overpayments to $600 for families with income below 200% FPL. Limited tax relief was announced for premium credit recipients for the 2014 tax year, relieving penalties for late or underpayment of taxes, but not negating the obligation to repay excess premium credit amounts. The IRS announced limited tax relief for premium credit recipients for the 2014 tax year, relieving penalties for late or underpayment of taxes. Taxpayers must meet specific criteria to qualify for penalty relief. On March 10, 2015, HHS reported that nearly 11.7 million individuals selected a metal plan through the individual exchanges. HHS reported that 11.7 million people selected a metal plan through the individual exchanges, with 86% eligible for premium tax credits. A special enrollment period was provided for uninsured individuals subject to the penalty for noncompliance with the individual mandate. The Congressional Budget Office projects modest exchange enrollment in the first few years, followed by a significant increase. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a modest exchange enrollment in the first few years, followed by a significant increase. By 2025, CBO estimates 25 million individuals will be enrolled in exchange coverage, with federal outlays for premium credits totaling $599 billion from FY2016 through FY2025. Premium credits are also applicable to cost-sharing expenses for qualifying individuals. Cost-sharing assistance is available for individuals enrolled in a silver plan through an exchange, based on income. There are two forms of assistance, both tied to income. The ACA sets annual cost-sharing limits for each metal tier plan, with separate limits for self-only and family coverage. For 2015, the limits are $6,450 for self-only and $12,900 for family coverage. Cost-sharing assistance reduces annual limits for eligible individuals with income between 100% and 250% FPL, targeting those with high healthcare expenses. It also reduces cost-sharing requirements in plans to cover a certain percentage of allowed expenses, increasing the actuarial value. Cost-sharing assistance increases the actuarial value of the exchange plan, lowering cost-sharing requirements for enrollees. To be eligible, individuals must be enrolled in a silver plan with an AV of 70%. The ACA does not specify how plans reduce cost-sharing to increase AV, but HHS regulations require it. HHS regulations require insurance companies to offer silver plan variations with higher actuarial values (73%, 87%, and 94%) for cost-sharing subsidies. Eligible individuals are automatically enrolled in the corresponding plan based on income. The HHS Secretary reimburses exchange plans for providing cost-sharing subsidies, and plans must submit estimates of assistance provided annually. The HHS regulations require insurance companies to offer silver plan variations with higher actuarial values for cost-sharing subsidies. Plans must submit estimates of assistance provided annually to receive advance payments. CBO estimates federal outlays for cost-sharing subsidies to total $136 billion from FY2016 through FY2025."
