    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act of 2005\" or as the \"TRADE Act of 2005\". Key findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that promoting stable and sustainable economic growth in least-developed countries through trade and investment can reduce poverty, raise living standards, and create employment opportunities. This is crucial as a significant portion of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, with high unemployment rates in these countries. Trade and investment play a vital role in addressing these challenges. Least-developed countries face challenges in meeting economic requirements and competitiveness in global markets. The US has enacted trade benefits for these countries, but the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005 poses additional challenges. Countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal are particularly vulnerable. Enhanced trade preferences for least-developed countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh will boost economic growth and investment, aligning with US objectives of promoting private sector development and economic empowerment. Reciprocal reduction of trade barriers will further enhance trade benefits globally. The devastating effects of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004, caused significant destruction in Sri Lanka, resulting in the loss of an estimated 30,000 lives and extensive physical damage equivalent to 6.5 percent of the country's annual economy. The tsunami damage in Sri Lanka will lead to a drop in economic growth. Senate Resolution 4, 109th Congress, expressed support for US financial aid to the impacted region. Duty preferences in the US market can help Sri Lanka rebuild after the tsunami. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO DESIGNATE; ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.
