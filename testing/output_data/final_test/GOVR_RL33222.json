    "content": "The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historical ties. U.S. aid has played a significant role in strengthening these ties, despite occasional disapproval of Israeli policies. Critics argue that U.S. assistance to Israel lacks scrutiny of controversial Israeli military actions. American public attitudes towards Israel are becoming more polarized, with 46% sympathizing more with Israelis and 16% with Palestinians. A partisan divide is evident, with 79% of Republicans supporting Israel compared to 27% of Democrats. The majority of U.S. aid to Israel is military in nature. Almost all U.S. aid to Israel is military assistance, helping Israel develop advanced armed forces to maintain a qualitative military edge over neighboring countries. This aid has also boosted Israel's defense industry, making it a top global arms supplier. Congress has passed legislation to clarify and strengthen U.S. commitment to preserving Israel's qualitative military edge. In 2008, Congress passed legislation defining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) as the ability to counter any military threat with minimal damage using superior military means. The President was required to assess Israel's QME regularly. The 2008 law amended the Arms Export Control Act to ensure that proposed arms sales to countries in the Middle East do not adversely affect Israel's qualitative military edge. Additional legislation, such as the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act, reaffirms the U.S. commitment to helping Israel maintain its military superiority. In 2014, Congress passed The U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act (P.L. 113-296) amending the Arms Export Control Act to evaluate the impact of major U.S. defense equipment sales to Middle Eastern states on Israel's capabilities and strategic balance in the region. This includes identifying any new capacity or training Israel may need and providing additional security assurances to Israel. P.L. 113-296 amends the Arms Export Control Act to evaluate the impact of U.S. defense equipment sales on Israel's capabilities. Israeli officials are concerned about U.S. sales of sophisticated weaponry to Arab Gulf countries. U.S. policymakers aim to balance defense commitments while maintaining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME). Despite the united front against Iran, U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia raise Israeli concerns about maintaining their Qualitative Military Edge (QME). In 2017, the Trump Administration announced defense sales worth over $110 billion to Saudi Arabia, prompting worries among Israeli officials. They fear that these sales could undermine Israel's QME, as Saudi Arabia remains a hostile country with uncertain future relations. Israeli Minister Yuval Steinitz emphasized the need to safeguard Israel's edge amidst the proposed arms deals. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) raised concerns about U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia potentially impacting Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME). The sale of the THAAD system could enhance Saudi Arabia's capabilities and pose a threat to Israeli fighters. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates' interest in acquiring the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter also raises QME concerns for Israel. The Trump Administration is considering preliminary talks with the UAE for the procurement of the F-35. The United States may require the UAE to improve data security before selling the F-35. No decision has been made on starting talks. U.S. aid to Israel is outlined in 10-year MOUs, influencing aid levels. The United States and Israel signed a new 10-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on military aid, pledging $38 billion in military aid to Israel. Both countries commit to respecting the agreed funding levels without seeking changes for the duration of the understanding. The new 10-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the United States and Israel pledges $38 billion in military aid. The MOU includes terms for phasing out Off-Shore Procurement (OSP) by FY2028 and requires Israel to provide detailed programmatic information on U.S. funding usage. Israeli defense contractors may seek mergers with U.S. companies to maintain eligibility for defense contracts. The Administration commits to requesting $500 million annually for missile defense funding. The new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the United States and Israel pledges $38 billion in military aid, including $500 million annually for missile defense programs like Iron Dome, Arrow II, Arrow III, and David's Sling. The MOU prohibits Israel from using a portion of its Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to purchase fuel from the U.S., a practice that was allowed under the previous MOU. In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Prime Minister Netanyahu pledged to reimburse the U.S. government if Israel receives more congressional assistance than specified in the current MOU. Some lawmakers criticized this addendum, stating that appropriations are the prerogative of the legislative branch. Senator Lindsey Graham emphasized that the MOU is not a treaty and that they are not a party to it. $75 million in FMF-Overseas Contingency Operations was provided for FY2017 in addition to the $3.1 billion in regular FMF. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. Foreign Military Financing, with the President's FY2019 request encompassing 61% of total FMF funding worldwide. Annual FMF grants to Israel make up 19% of its defense budget, with a high defense expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to finance defense articles and services for friendly foreign countries. Successive Administrations have used the authority to permit Israel to finance multiyear purchases through installment payments, known as \"cash flow financing.\" Since FY1991, Congress has mandated that Israel receive its FMF aid in a lump sum during the first month of the fiscal year. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act states that funds for Israel shall be disbursed within 30 days of enactment. Once disbursed, Israel's military aid is transferred to an interest-bearing account. Israel's military aid is transferred to an interest-bearing account with the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. The interest collected is used to pay down bilateral debt to U.S. government agencies. Israel has purchased 50 F-35s using FMF grants and is the first international operator of this advanced fighter jet. Israel has purchased 50 F-35s using FMF grants and is the first international operator of this advanced fighter jet. Israel is to install Israeli-made C4 systems in the F-35s it receives, and call these customized F-35s \"Adirs.\" The United States agreed to make reciprocal purchases of equipment from Israeli defense companies as part of the F-35 deal. Israeli firms have received over one billion dollars' worth of business from Lockheed Martin for building F-35 components. The Excess Defense Articles program allows the US to assist friendly nations by providing excess equipment. The United States provides friendly countries with necessary supplies through the Excess Defense Articles program. Israel, as a major non-NATO ally, has received $374.399 million in EDA deliveries from 2007 to 2017. Congress supports joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense projects to counter various threats, including short-range missiles from nonstate actors like Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as mid- and longer-range ballistic missiles from Syria and Iran. Regular U.S. funding is provided for Israeli and U.S.-Israeli missile defense programs. Israel and the United States collaborate on defense programs, including a four-layered active defense network consisting of Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow II, and Arrow III. Iron Dome, developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is a short-range antirocket system designed to protect strategically important sites and population centers. Israel can relocate Iron Dome batteries as threats change. Israel developed a naval version of Iron Dome to protect off-shore gas facilities. Iron Dome became operational in 2011 and was tested during conflicts with Gaza-based militants. Upgrades were made between 2012 and 2014, increasing the number of batteries deployed. During the 2014 conflict, Iron Dome had a successful interception rate close to 90%. In 2017, Gaza-based terrorist groups fired 35 projectiles into Israel. In 2017, Gaza-based terrorist groups fired 35 projectiles into Israel, with most landing in open territory and some hitting residential areas or being intercepted by Iron Dome. The United States has provided $1.397 billion for Iron Dome, with a partnership in coproduction dating back to the development of other missile defense systems. In 2014, a coproduction agreement was signed between the United States and Israel for Iron Dome. In March 2014, the US and Israel signed a coproduction agreement for Iron Dome technology, allowing US manufacturing and access to the system. Raytheon is Rafael's US partner. Raytheon received a $149 million contract for Tamir interceptor parts in 2014. Iron Dome funding was exempted from coproduction requirements during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict. The NDAA for FY 2018 authorizes $92 million for Israel to procure Tamir interceptors for Iron Dome. The United States authorized $92 million for Israel to procure Tamir interceptors for Iron Dome. A project agreement was signed in August 2008 for the development of David's Sling system, designed to counter long-range rockets and cruise missiles. David's Sling is being jointly developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Raytheon, using Raytheon's Stunner missile for interception. The United States and Israel are negotiating a coproduction agreement for the Stunner missile interceptor used in David's Sling system. The United States has contributed over $1.39 billion to the development of David's Sling, with a total of $183.848 million authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This includes $120 million in procurement funds, contingent on a certification regarding coproduction of components. The act requires certification for coproduction of components for the Arrow Anti-Missile System developed jointly by Israel and the United States. The Under Secretary of Defense must certify Israel's production readiness before funds transfer. Israel and the US share costs for the Arrow II program, designed to counter longer-range ballistic missiles. One Arrow II battery protects large areas of Israeli territory. In March 2017, media reported the first known use of the system. The Arrow II anti-ballistic missile system, developed jointly by the United States and Israel, successfully intercepted a Syrian surface-to-air missile in March 2017. The system, operational since 2000, has received over $2.9 billion in U.S. financial contributions. Israel and the U.S. conduct joint exercises to integrate their weapons systems, citing a potential nuclear threat from Iran. Israel seeks a missile interceptor with higher altitude and greater range capabilities. The United States and Israel agreed to evaluate Israel's proposed \"Arrow III,\" an advanced upper-tier missile defense system designed to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles. Despite initial suggestions to purchase the THAAD system, Israel began developing the Arrow III with co-funding from the U.S. The Arrow III, operational since January 2017, is a more advanced version of the Arrow II interceptor, offering increased speed, range, and altitude capabilities. In 2010, a bilateral agreement was signed to extend cooperation in developing and producing the Arrow III. The United States and Israel agreed to develop the Arrow III missile defense system, with funding from both countries. Congress has allocated $743.7 million for the project since 2008. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 authorizes $253.139 million for Arrow III, with requirements for coproduction certification. Israel plans to conduct Arrow III interception tests from Alaska in 2018. The certification for the Arrow 3 Upper Tier Development Program requires successful completion of knowledge points, technical milestones, and production readiness reviews. It also stipulates that missile defense funds for Israel must be matched by Israel or in another agreed-upon amount. Congressional concern exists regarding the determination of Israeli contributions compared to U.S. contributions in funding missile defense systems. The FY2018 NDAA includes a waiver for the certification requirement if sufficient data from Israel is provided to demonstrate U.S. contributions solely for funding the procurement of long-lead items. The U.S. provides contributions to Israel for the Arrow 3 Upper Tier Interceptor Program, with a provision in the FY2018 NDAA for further testing due to differences in testing approaches between the two countries. In the early 1980s, Israeli leaders sought to expand their strategic collaboration with the U.S. military by inviting the United States to stockpile arms and equipment at Israeli bases for wartime use. In 1989, the U.S. agreed to establish munitions stockpiles in Israel for emergency situations, managed by the United States European Command (EUCOM) under the War Reserves Stock Allies-Israel (WRSA-I) program. The U.S. stores missiles, armored vehicles, and artillery ammunition in Israel for potential use by Israel with U.S. permission. The US military equipment is stored in Israel under the WRSA-I program. Israel can request permission to use this equipment in case of conflict without the need for congressional notification. The authorization for WRSA-I was extended through FY2017. Congress has also allowed EUCOM to increase the value of materiel stored in Israel. EUCOM has been authorized to increase the value of materiel stored in Israel, with a current noninflation adjusted value of $2.2 billion. Legislation in various fiscal years allowed for additions to defense articles in Israel, with authorized values ranging from $100 million to $200 million. In various fiscal years, legislation authorized additions to defense articles in Israel, with values ranging from $100 million to $200 million. In FY2016-FY2017, legislation authorized up to $200 million for defense articles in Israel. Collaboration between Israeli and U.S. governments led to the development of technology to detect underground smuggling tunnels, primarily used by Hamas. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act established a U.S.-Israeli anti-tunnel cooperation program. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act established a U.S.-Israeli anti-tunnel cooperation program, with up to $200 million authorized for defense articles in Israel. Section 1278 of P.L.115-91 extended the program through December 31, 2020, requiring at least 50% of U.S. contributions for research and development activities in the United States. U.S. aid and arms sales to Israel are subject to U.S. law, with calls for conditioning military assistance to Israel periodically raised in Congress. The U.S. military assistance to Israel is conditioned on compliance with U.S. laws and international humanitarian law. The Arms Export Control Act limits Israel's use of U.S. military equipment to defensive purposes. Recipients must obtain prior presidential consent for any other use. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 also applies to U.S. aid and arms sales to Israel. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act regulate Israel's use of U.S. military equipment. Concerns have been raised about Israel's compliance with these laws, particularly regarding the use of cluster munitions in civilian areas. Section 620M of the FAA prohibits assistance to foreign security forces with credible human rights violations. The State Department and U.S. embassies implement Leahy vetting to determine eligibility for U.S. assistance. Senator Leahy and other Members of Congress questioned potential human rights violations by Israeli military and police. State Department confirmed no Israeli individuals or units involved in alleged incidents received U.S. assistance. U.S. aid to Israel may be restricted to areas under Israeli administration before June 1967. Migration and Refugee (MRA) assistance is limited to specific areas within Israel's pre-June 1967 control. Programs funded by U.S.-Israeli binational foundations must also adhere to these restrictions. Israel has been receiving grants since 1973 from the State Department's MRA account to aid in migrant resettlement. Between 1973 and 1991, the United States provided around $460 million for resettling Jewish refugees in Israel through the United Israel Appeal. Congress has adjusted the earmark language over the years to include refugees from various regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. Annual funding amounts have ranged from $12 million to $80 million, depending on the number of Jewish migrants. Since 1972, the United States has provided loan guarantees to Israel for housing shortages, immigrant absorption, and economic recovery. These guarantees allow Israel to borrow at lower rates, with subsidies set aside in case of default. This assistance is indirect and supports Israel's integration of immigrants, including those from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. Israel has received loan guarantees from the U.S. and Israeli government since 1972 for various purposes. In 2003, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon requested $8 billion in loan guarantees and $4 billion in military grants to boost the economy and prepare for potential attacks. The FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act authorized $9 billion in loan guarantees and $1 billion in military grants for Israel's economic recovery and defense. In 2003, the U.S. reduced Israel's $3 billion loan guarantees by $289.5 million due to continued settlement building and construction of a security barrier. In FY2005, an additional $795.8 million was cut from Israel's borrowing amount. Israel has not borrowed any funds since then. The U.S. Treasury states that Israel must use guaranteed loan proceeds for refinancing government debt and not for military purposes. Israel has refinanced government debt with U.S.-backed bonds, with restrictions on use for military purposes or settlements. U.S. officials are concerned that this frees up Israeli funds for other purposes. Israel has issued $4.1 billion in U.S.-backed bonds, with potential for an additional $3.814 billion. Loan guarantees may be reduced based on expenditures for settlements in occupied territories. Since 2003, Congress has extended the U.S. loan guarantee program for Israel four times, currently authorized through FY2019. Israel sees the guarantees as a backup for emergencies like war or economic crises, maintaining fiscal standing with international creditors. Despite not using the guarantees in 13 years, Israel believes the program boosts its economic stability. In FY2015, ASHA program funded institutions in Israel like Shaare Zedek Medical Center, St. John Eye Hospital Group, Nazareth Hospital, and Hadassah Medical Organization, receiving the most program funding in the Middle East region. Israeli academics and businessmen sought to expand investment in Israel's technology sector, which later became a key driver of the country's economy. The United States and Israel collaborated on programs to boost Israeli industrial and scientific research, with funds allocated to organizations like the BIRD Foundation for joint industrial R&D projects between Israeli and American companies in high-tech industries. The BIRD Foundation supports joint industrial R&D projects between Israeli and American companies in various high-tech industries, with grants totaling $339 million awarded to nearly a thousand projects. Awards typically range from $700,000 to $900,000, with recipients required to provide at least 50% of the total project budget. While military projects are not supported, some completed ventures have produced products with potential military applications, such as the Aircraft Enhanced Vision System (EVS) camera. The BSF Foundation supports scientific and technological research, while the BARD Foundation promotes cooperation in agricultural research. The USISTF funds projects to foster scientific, technological, and economic cooperation between the United States and Israel. In 2005, Congress considered legislation to expand U.S.-Israeli scientific cooperation in renewable energy. The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act aimed to establish a joint grant program for research in solar, biomass, and wind energy. Section 917 of P.L. 110-140, the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, included provisions for a grant program to support research and development in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act established a grant program for renewable energy research. Congress authorized the program for seven years in 2007, and it was reauthorized for an additional 10 years in 2014. $15.7 million has been provided for the grant program, known as BIRD Energy, with a total investment of $30 million in approved projects. Israel has expanded cooperation with U.S. states in water reuse technology. The U.S. has supported cooperation with Israel through legislation like the WIIN Act and the United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act. Congress has also passed bills like the United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act to enhance collaboration in areas such as desalination technology and cybersecurity. The United States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017 aims to establish a grant program for cybersecurity research and development in line with existing bilateral agreements between the two countries."
