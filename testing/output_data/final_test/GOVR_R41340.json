    "content": "On April 14, 2011, H.R. 1473, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011, was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by the President the next day. The House and Senate FSGG Subcommittees considered their own appropriations bills before H.R. 1473 was enacted. The reorganization of subcommittee structures in early 2007 led to the creation of new FSGG Subcommittees in each chamber. The FSGG Subcommittee in the House and Senate underwent reorganization in early 2007, with various agencies being reassigned to different subcommittees. The District of Columbia and four independent agencies were placed under the purview of the FSGG Subcommittee, along with agencies previously under different subcommittees. President Obama's FY2011 FSGG budget request included $48.219 billion, an increase of $1.785 billion over FY2010 appropriations. Senator Durbin introduced S. 3677, which would provide $48.296 billion for FY2011, $77 million above the President's request. Representative Harold Rogers introduced H.R. 1, which would have provided FSGG agencies with $43.298 billion for FY2011, $4.921 billion below the President's request. In FY2011, the government operated on funds appropriated through a series of CRs, with subsequent reductions below FY2010 levels. President Obama signed H.R. 1473 into law, providing enacted amounts for FY2010 and FY2011. Funding increases or decreases were identified for selected accounts under Titles I through V of H.R. 1473. The enacted funding for FY2010 and FY2011 under Titles I through V of H.R. 1473 has been updated in the report. Most accounts are funded at or above FY2010 levels, with some exceptions like department-wide systems and capital investments, CDFI, FMS, and ATTB receiving less funding. The difference in appropriations is mainly due to a $310 million increase in FY2011 for a rescission of unobligated funds in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Section 1501 of the act specifies the allocation of funds for departmental offices, including $100 million for terrorism and financial intelligence activities. Section 1509 prohibits the transfer of funding for IRS operations to the agency's enforcement account. Section 1510 states that the requirement from FY2010 IRS appropriations for tax law enforcement does not apply to FY2011 appropriations. The White House Office is allocated $58.6 million, which is $1.3 million less than the FY2011 request. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is allocated $27.1 million, $0.9 million more than the FY2011 request. Other Federal Drug Control Programs receive $140.9 million, which is $24.4 million less than the FY2011 request. The FY2011 request includes funding allocations for various programs, with reductions compared to previous years. Section 2262 of H.R. 1473 prohibits the use of funds for specific positions in the White House. President Barack Obama's statement on H.R. 1473 emphasizes his authority to supervise. Barack Obama emphasized his authority to supervise the executive branch and obtain advice to carry out his constitutional responsibilities. Legislative efforts that impede the President's supervisory authority violate the separation of powers. The executive branch will not interpret section 2262 to undermine Presidential prerogatives. The Supreme Court of the United States has a budget of $8.16 million for building and grounds, which is significantly less than previous years. Salaries and expenses for Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services are at $5,004.22 million, higher than before but less than the requested amount. Defender Services have a budget of $1,025.69 million, also higher than before but less than the requested amount. Fees of Jurors and Commissioners are at $52.31 million, lower than previous years. Court Security has a budget of $466.67 million, higher than before. The FY2011 budget for Court Security is $466.67 million, which is $14.07 million more than FY2010 enacted amount but $28.37 million less than the FY2011 request. Other budget allocations include $4.78 million for Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust, $11.5 million for Water and Sewer Authority, $243.4 million for District of Columbia Courts, $77.7 million for School Improvement, and $98.0 million for Office of Personnel Management.

General Services Administration: $82 million for new construction, a decrease of $812 million from the FY2010 enacted amount. Small Business Administration: $731 million in total funding, a decrease of $93 million from the FY2010 enacted amount. United States Postal Service: $87 million payment to the Postal Service Fund, a decrease of $31 million from the FY2010 enacted amount. This section examines FY2011 appropriations for the Treasury Department and its operating bureaus, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Treasury Department in H.R. 1473 performs critical governmental functions such as protecting the financial system, collecting tax revenue, enforcing tax laws, managing federal debt, regulating financial institutions, and producing currency. It consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with bureaus accounting for over 95% of funding and workforce. The Treasury Department's bureaus and offices are divided into financial management and regulation, and law enforcement. Key entities like the Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing handle financial responsibilities, while agencies like the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau focus on law enforcement. The Department's involvement in law enforcement has decreased with the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The Treasury Department's involvement in law enforcement has decreased, except for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which handles tax collection and enforcement. Most Treasury bureaus receive funding from annual appropriations, while others like the U.S. Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing generate revenue from fees for services and products. Appropriations for the Treasury Department are distributed among 11 accounts in the current fiscal year. In the current fiscal year, appropriations for the Treasury Department are distributed among 11 accounts, each briefly described. Departmental Offices cover salaries and expenses for formulating policies in finance, terrorism, taxation, trade, and the economy. Department-wide Systems and Capital Investments cover expenses for new systems to improve efficiency. Office of Inspector General covers expenses for audits and investigations. The Office of Inspector General covers expenses related to audits and investigations conducted by OIG staff to promote efficiency, prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in departmental operations. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration focuses on audits and investigations to improve tax law administration and prevent fraud in IRS programs. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program covers expenses related to audits and investigations into the management and effectiveness of TARP. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) conducts audits and investigations into the management and effectiveness of TARP. SIGTARP was established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is responsible for protecting the financial system from illicit uses like money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Management Service (FMS) develops payment policies for federal agencies and collects debts. The Financial Management Service (FMS) develops payment policies for federal agencies, collects debts owed to those agencies, and provides financial accounting, reporting, and financing services for the federal government and its agents. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau enforces laws regarding the sale and production of alcohol and tobacco products to ensure compliance with consumer safety laws. The Bureau of the Public Debt manages public debt operations and promotes U.S. bonds. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund provides funding for investments in community development. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) makes investments in community development financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, and venture capital funds, to provide financing for affordable housing, small businesses, and community projects. CDFI also administers the Black Enterprise Award program and the New Markets tax credit. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) covers expenses related to administering federal tax laws, offering services to taxpayers, and enforcing compliance. Some funds are used to upgrade business operations and information systems. In FY2010, Treasury received $13.465 billion in appropriated funds, with the majority allocated to finance the operations of the IRS. Funding for most bureaus comes from direct appropriations, while some agencies generate operating funds from fees for services and products provided. In FY2010, Treasury received $13.465 billion in appropriated funds, with the vast majority used to finance the operations of the IRS. The remaining funds were allocated to other Treasury appropriations accounts, with the Obama Administration requesting $13.970 billion for Treasury in FY2011, a 3.7% increase from FY2010. The IRS would receive $12.633 billion, or 91% of the total appropriations. The remaining $1.137 billion in Treasury's FY2011 budget would be divided among 10 other appropriations accounts, with varying amounts allocated to each account. The proposed increase in funding for the IRS is significantly higher than for other Treasury Department accounts. Fiscal services operations would see a 3.6% decrease in funding from FY2010. Treasury's budget proposal aims to achieve three \"high priority performance\" objectives. The proposed budget for FY2011 aims to achieve three high priority performance objectives: repairing and reforming the U.S. financial system, increasing voluntary tax compliance, and significantly increasing paperless transactions with the public. The budget would address these objectives by affecting Treasury's management of programs like TARP to stabilize financial markets and promote recovery in housing sales and prices. The budget proposal for FY2011 aims to repair and reform the financial system by increasing funding for departmental offices, including the Office of Domestic Finance, Office of Tax Policy, and Office of Domestic Economic Policy. Additionally, the budget request includes doubling funding for the Special Inspector General for TARP to strengthen oversight of the program. The budget proposal for FY2011 includes funding for the Special Inspector General for TARP to conduct audits and investigations related to the use of TARP funds. It also proposes increasing funding for the CDFI Fund to expand affordable credit and financial services in distressed communities. The FY2011 budget proposal includes funding for the Special Inspector General for TARP and the CDFI Fund to support economically distressed communities. It introduces new CDFI programs and drops existing ones to defray costs. The Obama Administration seeks $5 billion for the New Markets tax credit to stimulate private investment in low-income areas. Taxpayer compliance is a priority due to the federal tax gap. The FY2011 budget proposal aims to address the federal tax gap of $345 billion by improving voluntary tax compliance through legislative proposals and IRS operations. The proposed measures include expanding penalties, strengthening tax administration, improving business compliance, and expanding information reporting. These proposals could potentially increase tax collection by $26 billion over the next 10 years. The requested increase in appropriations for the IRS in FY2011 would be used to improve tax compliance. $487 million would be allocated to enforcement activities, business systems modernization, taxpayer services, operations support, and administration of the health coverage tax credit. The funds for enforcement aim to reduce offshore tax evasion, underreporting of income, and tax evasion by corporations and upper-income individuals. Treasury budget documents suggest that hiring additional enforcement officers could generate an extra $2 billion in revenue annually by FY2013. Proposed funding for the BSM program in FY2011 would allow the IRS to complete CADE 2 for the 2012 filing season and expand electronic filing systems. The increase in funding for taxpayer services would upgrade the toll-free telephone service to improve taxpayer compliance. The IRS aims to raise the answer rate of incoming calls from 71% in FY2010 to 75% in FY2011 with a $21 million budget. This funding includes additional appropriated funds and a transfer of funds from various programs. The increase in funding for operations support will be used to enhance the IRS.gov website infrastructure and meet the growing demand for electronic tax services. Treasury budget documents suggest cost savings through increased electronic filing and website usage. The budget request includes measures to advance paperless processing in the Treasury Department by increasing electronic transactions in FY2011. This includes funding for the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) program and the Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (OFIT) to modernize document-based processes and coordinate financial solutions department-wide. The Treasury Department's budget proposal for FY2011 aims to develop shared government-wide solutions for financial management issues. The requested funding will help Treasury bureaus meet their statutory responsibilities despite federal budget deficits. The budget request includes measures to achieve savings through reduced operating costs and expanded operations. The Treasury Department's budget proposal for FY2011 includes cuts to funding for FinCEN, FMS, and BPD, with savings coming from reduced operating costs and improved efficiencies. FinCEN would receive less funding due to new sources covering costs and operating efficiencies, FMS funding is lower due to increased employee compensation offset by efficiencies, and BPD funding is also reduced due to proposed operating efficiencies. Additionally, funding for Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) would increase by 59%. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) funding would increase by 59% from $65 million in FY2010 to $103 million in FY2011. TFI focuses on countering terrorist financing, money laundering, and imposing financial sanctions on designated countries. The budget increase would also support the Office of Intelligence Analysis to enhance intelligence collection for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing efforts. Additionally, there is a proposed shift in funding responsibility for regulating alcohol and tobacco products from taxpayers to private companies. The budget request for FY2011 includes a shift in funding responsibility for regulating alcohol and tobacco products from taxpayers to private companies. Funding for the Alcohol and Tobacco Bureau (ATB) would come from annual licensing and registration fees, totaling $106 million. Additionally, there is a proposal to withdraw $62 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) to cover expenses related to criminal investigations and law enforcement activities. The TFF may be used to pay for law enforcement activities with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury. GAO criticized the IRS budget justification for lacking cost information on proposed initiatives. $247 million of the $487 million increase in appropriations would go towards enforcement efforts to reduce the tax gap by $2 billion. The GAO highlighted concerns about the IRS budget request, including a 47% increase in funding for the BSM. This increase would support a new CADE and the Modernized Electronic Filing project. GAO also raised issues regarding information security controls and suggested 36 steps for the IRS to achieve $3.9 billion in cost savings or revenue gains. The GAO recommended that the IRS provide more information in budget justifications to improve transparency and effectiveness, including details on program activities, costs of legislative proposals, and cost savings for new initiatives. The IRS Oversight Board has the authority to review and approve IRS strategic plans and budgets to ensure they support short-term goals. The IRS Oversight Board reviews and approves IRS strategic plans and budgets to ensure they support short-term and long-term goals. For the FY2011 budget proposal, the board recommended a budget of $12.914 billion, $768 million more than FY2010, and $281 million above the Administration's request. Both budgets allocated $5.8 billion for enforcement initiatives and $387 million for the BSM program in FY2011. The board supported a $247 million increase in enforcement funding to accommodate new staff. The IRS Oversight Board recommended a $122 million increase in BSM funding to upgrade information systems and handle growing demands. They also argued for more funds for taxpayer services to meet strategic goals in the five-year plan. The IRS Oversight Board recommended increasing funding for taxpayer services and operations support, exceeding the Administration's request. They suggested spending more on improving service levels, rescinding proposed funding cuts, and allocating funds for new initiatives. Additionally, a significant portion of the operations support budget is used for maintaining IT systems. The IRS Oversight Board endorsed a larger budget for operations support to upgrade the aging IT infrastructure for more efficient management and record-keeping.

H.R. 1 includes provisions to restrict the use of appropriated funds for certain positions related to energy, climate change, and health care reform. Additionally, Section 4009 of H.R. 1 prohibits the use of funds for various positions within the White House. The President's FY2011 budget proposed continuation of the provision that authorizes the transfer of up to 10% of appropriated funds among accounts for the White House, Vice President, and Official Residence of the Vice President. The OMB Director may transfer funds with approval, and 15 days notice to House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The judiciary's budget is presented to the President and then to Congress unaltered. Appropriations for the judiciary are divided into budget groups and accounts, with two accounts funding the Supreme Court. Transfers of funds up to 10% are allowed between appropriations, not exceeding a 50% increase. The Supreme Court's budget, which includes salaries, expenses, and building care, makes up about 1% of the total judiciary budget. The rest of the budget funds the lower federal courts and related judicial services, with the largest account covering salaries for various judicial positions. The federal judiciary budget covers necessary expenses of the courts, disbursing 26% among various accounts including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Special courts like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and U.S. Tax Court are funded separately. Federal courthouse construction is funded under the General Services account. The judiciary uses non-appropriated funds, mainly from court filing fees, to offset expenses within the Salaries and Expenses account. These funds can be \"unencumbered\" or \"encumbered\" depending on whether they result from savings or have specific purposes. The judiciary uses \"encumbered\" funds for specific purposes, such as costs associated with space delivery and technology projects. Judge Julia S. Gibbons stated in her testimony that the FY2011 budget request reflected the lowest percentage increase in over 20 years, acknowledging the country's financial difficulties. She noted that the President's requested increases in other agencies could impact the judiciary's workload. Judge Gibbons highlighted the impact of the deteriorating economy on the judiciary's workload, particularly the rise in bankruptcy filings. The judiciary has implemented cost-saving measures since 2004, reducing expenses in various areas. Steps like sharing courtrooms among senior district judges have been taken to control court space costs. The judiciary is implementing cost-saving measures, including sharing courtrooms among senior district judges in new courthouses. They are also exploring a courtroom-sharing policy for magistrate judges and studying the feasibility of courtroom-sharing for district judges in large courthouses and bankruptcy courts. Efforts to limit rent costs through a memorandum of agreement with the General Services Administration have resulted in a projected FY2011 rent of approximately $1.0 billion, 23% less than an earlier estimate. Other initiatives include using information technology to increase efficiency. The judiciary is implementing cost-saving measures by consolidating computer servers, improving automation of case filing systems, and reducing personnel costs. Efforts to enhance judicial security were spurred by past incidents, leading to the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 aimed to enhance judicial security, including providing intrusion detection systems for judges in their homes. Despite these efforts, threats against judges and courts have continued to rise, with a significant increase in threats and inappropriate communications reported by the U.S. Marshals Service protectees from FY2003 to FY2009. The FY2011 budget request includes reauthorizing a pilot program to address these security concerns. The FY2011 budget request includes reauthorizing a pilot program for the US Marshals Service to assume responsibility for perimeter security at selected courthouses previously under the Federal Protective Service. The pilot program began in FY2009 and FY2010, with USMS taking over security functions at seven courthouses. Evaluation and improvements are ongoing, with the judiciary reimbursing USMS for these services. Increased court security enhancements may be needed for terrorism-related trials in federal courts. Judge Gibbons testified that federal courts, not military tribunals, handle cases brought before them. She highlighted the increasing workload of the federal judiciary, with a significant rise in bankruptcy filings. The judiciary's budget and staffing request for FY2011 were based on projected caseload increases in various categories. In 2010, there was an increase in caseloads for criminal (+3%), probation (+3%), pretrial services (+2%), and civil (+6%) categories.

Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill near the end of the first session of the 111th Congress to address the issue. Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced S. 2725, the Federal Judicial Fairness Act of 2009, to repeal existing law requiring specific authorization for salary increases for federal judges and Supreme Court Justices. The bill aimed to apply automatic annual cost-of-living adjustments to judicial salaries. Despite recommendations for a 2010 salary adjustment, the enacted FY2010 legislation did not provide for it.

Its mandate is to provide rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communications services. The FCC's functions include spectrum allocation, promoting fair competition, authorizing services, enhancing public safety, and enforcing regulations. The FCC primarily relies on funding from various sources. The FCC's funding is mainly obtained through regulatory fees, with a budget request of $352.5 million for FY2011. The requested budget includes funding for cyber-security, implementing the National Broadband Plan, overhauling data systems, and modernizing the FCC.

The President proposed increased funding for GSA's real property activities in FY2011, with the Senate Appropriations Committee approving a similar amount. However, H.R. 1 would allocate less funding for GSA compared to FY2010 and the President's proposal. Additionally, there are discrepancies in the proposed funding for GSA's operating accounts between the President's request, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and H.R. 1. Under H.R. 1, GSA would receive $226 million for its operating accounts, $37 million less than FY2010 enacted levels, $91 million below the amount requested by the President, and $59 million below the amount approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Electronic Government Fund (E-Government Fund) has been a contentious matter between the President and Congress, with funding cuts from the initial $20 million request for FY2002 to $3 million for FY2004 and beyond. In FY2009, President George W. Bush requested $5 million for the E-Government Fund, but Congress did not provide any appropriation. President Obama requested $33 million for FY2010, which was $28 million more than Bush's FY2009 request.

S. 3677 recommended similar funding to the President's request, with some adjustments for OIG salaries and expenses. The bill includes a directive on the inappropriate use of temporary hiring authority by executive agencies. The report language in H.R. 1 requires OPM to address inequities in temporary hiring authority within federal agencies. It includes options to provide competitive status to employees in temporary positions and actions to ensure appropriate hiring practices in the future. The bill also allocates $101.3 million for OPM salaries and expenses, slightly higher than S. 3677's proposal. The FY2011 appropriation for OIG salaries and expenses is $2.1 million, which is significantly less than the proposed amount in S. 3677 and the FY2010 enacted amount.

This reduction followed GAO reports highlighting weaknesses in NARA's oversight of ERA implementation. NARA has made improvements to address these issues. The National Archives has made improvements in management and oversight of the ERA system, with plans to complete development earlier and at a lower cost. A GAO report raised concerns about the lack of a reliable expenditure plan and management for ERA acquisition, questioning NARA's ability to deliver additional system capabilities by the end of fiscal year 2011. NARA's FY2012 budget justification indicated that ERA's development was ending, moving into an operations and maintenance phase with no separate appropriation needed after FY2012. The NCUA, funded by credit unions, manages the CDRLF and CLF. The CDRLF provides low-interest loans and grants, with $1.25 million allocated in FY2010 and $2 million proposed for FY2011. The CLF offers liquidity support. The Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) provides seasonal and emergency liquidity for credit unions with a borrowing limit set each fiscal year.

It reviews and analyzes the implementation of related laws and advises the President and executive branch on these issues. The board provides annual reports to Congress and testifies before congressional committees. The PCLOB activities and budget for FY2011 are under scrutiny by Senate appropriators. President Obama has not nominated anyone to sit on the board since it ceased operations in January 2008. Senate appropriators urge the Administration to nominate members promptly and provide a detailed budget justification.

The Administration has requested $1.258 billion for FY2011, with the Senate recommending $1.300 billion and H.R. 1 proposing $1.070 billion. Fees collected during the fiscal year would cover the entire amount, eliminating the need for an appropriation from the general fund. P.L. 111-117 provided $1.111 billion for the SEC in FY2010, with $16 million from prior-year unobligated balances and the rest from offsetting collections.

Additionally, funding is allocated for the SBA's Office of Inspector General, surety bond guarantees, business loan programs, and entrepreneurship initiatives. The Senate bill proposes $60.6 million for small business development and entrepreneurship initiatives, along with up to $28 billion in loan guarantees for various SBA programs. President Obama requested $994.1 million for the SBA in FY2011, including $446.0 million for salaries and expenses. The Administration requested $18.0 million for the SBA's Office of Inspector General, $1.0 million for the SBA's surety bond guarantees revolving loan fund, $326.1 million for the SBA's business loan programs, and $203.0 million for the SBA's disaster loan program. The budget request is expected to support up to $28 billion in loan guarantees for various SBA programs. The U.S. Postal Service generates funding through mail users, with Congress providing appropriations for specific purposes such as free mailing privileges. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 authorized appropriations for these purposes, including a $29 million annual reimbursement until 2035. Funds are deposited in the Postal Service Fund at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 impacted the postal appropriations process starting in FY2009. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, enacted on December 20, 2006, affected the postal appropriations process starting in FY2009. Under this act, the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (USPSOIG) and the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) must submit their budget requests to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. The USPSOIG's budget is treated as part of USPS's total budget, while the PRC's budget is treated separately. For FY2011, the USPS requested a $102.2 million appropriation to the Postal Service Fund, with $73.2 million for revenue forgone and $29 million for annual RFRA reimbursement. The USPSOIG requested a $244.4 million appropriation, and the PRC requested $14.5 million. The President's FY2011 budget proposes $103.9 million for the USPS, $244.4 million for the USPSOIG, and $14.5 million for the PRC. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the same appropriations. The committee expressed concerns about the Postal Service's fiscal health and the sustainability of its facility network. The Committee directs the Postal Regulatory Commission to assess the economic impacts of removing restrictions on the consolidation or closure of small post offices. They also want an evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of potential closures on access to services, the postal workforce, affected communities, and the Postal Service's fiscal health. Additionally, the committee urged the USPS to coordinate with other agencies to enhance customer access and improve revenue. The Postal Service is working with various agencies to determine a fair method for calculating its contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System pension fund. Recent reports suggest that the Postal Service may have overpaid its share of the fund due to a flawed methodology. Despite previous assessments supporting the methodology, questions have been raised about its accuracy. In a recent appropriations subcommittee hearing, OPM expressed willingness to revisit the methodology for calculating Postal Service contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System. H.R. 1 proposes $103.9 million for the USPS, $244.4 million for the USPSOIG, and $14.5 million for the PRC. The USTC, an independent judicial body, is seeking $52.2 million for FY2011, a $3 million increase from FY2010. The Senate Committee on Appropriations has recommended $54.6 million for FY2011, a $5 million increase over FY2010 enacted amounts and $2 million more than the President has requested. H.R. 1 would provide $52 million for FY2011. The Financial Services and General Government appropriations language includes general provisions which apply either government-wide or to specific agencies or programs. The FY2011 budget proposed discontinuing some government-wide general provisions included in P.L. 111-117. The general provisions included in P.L. 111-117 for FY2010 are proposed to be discontinued in S. 3677. These provisions cover communication with Congress, employee training, and restrictions on publicity or propaganda by executive agency personnel. Section 720 of S. 3677 prohibits funds for unauthorized propaganda and publicity. Section 719 of S. 3677 restricts the release of non-public information. Section 732 of S. 3677 addresses E-Government initiatives. Section 733 of S. 3677 provides funds for the Midway Atoll Airfield. Section 736 of S. 3677 prohibits the use of funds in violation of the Privacy Act. Section 739 of P.L. 111-117 requires OMB to submit a report on budget information relating to Great Lakes restoration activities. Pay for Top Officials would prohibit pay adjustments in calendar year 2011 for certain high-ranking government officials. Administrative Expenses Related to Retirement is addressed for employees retiring during FY2011. For employees retiring in FY2011, agencies must remit an amount to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund equal to OPM's average cost of processing retirement claims. These funds are available for OPM's administrative expenses. Overpayments recovered through audits will be credited back to the agency appropriations. Section 736 states that overpayments recovered through audits will be credited back to agency appropriations for the same purpose and time period originally appropriated. A public database of federal real property would be established, along with a pilot program to expedite surplus property disposal. Agencies would be allowed to retain proceeds from surplus property sales. Section 742 authorizes a 1.4% pay adjustment for federal civilian white-collar employees. Section 517 clarifies the authorized purposes of the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund to include fostering workforce development. Section 517 expands the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund's purposes to include developing the federal government's acquisition workforce and conducting workforce data analysis. It also prohibits the use of funds for public-private competitions involving the conversion of functions performed by federal employees to contractor performance. Section 734 of S. 3677 prohibits public-private competitions involving the conversion of functions performed by federal employees to contractor performance. It is similar to Section 735 of P.L. 111-117 and may contain technical modifications to Section 743 regarding service contract inventories. Section 741 of S. 3677 expands inventory contents for service contracts, specifies employee work locations, and requires agencies to exclude functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions. It also mandates a new report submission to OMB before announcing public-private competitions for converting government functions to contractor performance. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards communist Cuba has focused on isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions administered by the Treasury Department. Despite these sanctions, some U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed since 2001 under certain conditions. The TSRA of 2000 allows for some U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, but with restrictions on financing. The Bush Administration tightened sanctions in 2005, requiring cash payment in advance for agricultural sales to Cuba. This caused objections from exporters and some Members of Congress. Since 2002, the United States has been a major supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba, with over $3.5 billion in purchases since late 2001. U.S. exports to Cuba increased significantly from $7 million in 2001 to $712 million in 2008, driven by higher food prices and Cuba's increased food needs after hurricanes and tropical storms. Some Members of Congress objected to a clarification by OFAC Director Robert Werner, arguing it violated the intent of the TSRA and could impact U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. In 2009, U.S. exports to Cuba declined to $533 million, 25% lower than the previous year, due to Cuba's shortage of hard currency. In 2010, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba fell to $370 million, a 30% drop from 2009, again attributed to Cuba's shortage of hard currency. Congress took action in 2009 to define \"payment of cash in advance\" for exports to Cuba, overturning a previous clarification by OFAC. The provision in a must-pass spending bill regarding U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba was implemented in early March 2010. Regulations defined \"payment of cash in advance\" for items delivered by September 30, 2010, or under contracts entered into by that date. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2011 bill included a provision to continue this definition. The FY2011 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill included a provision for payment of cash in advance for agricultural goods sold to Cuba under TSRA. The bill was not officially introduced, but a similar provision was included in the Senate bill. The provision was continued through FY2011 under the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011. Several legislative initiatives in the 111th Congress aimed to change the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" for export sales to Cuba under TSRA. H.R. 4645 proposed permanent changes, including allowing direct transfers between U.S. and Cuban financial institutions for payments and lifting travel restrictions to Cuba. However, no action was taken on these measures after the House Committee on Foreign Affairs postponed its consideration in September 2010."
