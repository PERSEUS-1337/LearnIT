    "content": "Omnibus appropriations acts have become a significant feature of the legislative process in recent years as Congress and the President use them to close the regular appropriations cycle. The number of regular appropriations bills was reduced to 11 starting with the FY2006 cycle, but increased to 12 at the beginning of the 110th Congress. The number of regular appropriations bills was increased to 12 at the beginning of the 110th Congress. If all bills are not completed by the end of a session, they may be combined into an omnibus measure. Budget resolution policies are enforced by points of order during the legislative process. Budget resolution policies are enforced by points of order during House and Senate consideration of spending, revenue, and debt limit legislation. Congressional leaders and the President may modify budget policies through agreements, accommodated by waivers of points of order and other budgetary devices. Discretionary spending has statutory limits enforced by the Budget Enforcement Act, with separate limits for budget authority and outlays. Sequestration involves automatic reductions in discretionary spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed statutory spending limits on discretionary budget authority for FY2012-FY2021. In an effort to improve legislative efficiency, the House and Senate considered all regular appropriations acts for FY1951 in a single bill in 1950. Despite this one-time experiment, they returned to considering the acts individually in subsequent years. During FY1986-FY2016, 22 omnibus appropriations acts were enacted for 19 fiscal years, with some years having multiple acts. These acts combined multiple regular appropriations bills into consolidated measures, sometimes by cross-reference. The report focuses on omnibus acts that incorporate full-year funding from regular appropriations acts. During FY1986-FY2016, 22 omnibus appropriations acts were enacted, covering a total of 170 regular appropriations acts. Each omnibus act funded between two and 13 regular appropriations acts, with an average of almost eight. Out of the 390 regular appropriations acts enacted during this period, 191 were standalone measures. During FY1986-FY2016, 191 out of 390 regular appropriations acts were enacted as standalone measures, with 48.9% as standalone measures, 43.6% in omnibus measures, and 6.9% in other forms. On average, about 2 regular appropriations bills per year were enacted before the start of the fiscal year. Ten omnibus appropriations acts originated in the House as regular appropriations bills and were expanded in coverage. During FY1986-FY2016, 10 omnibus appropriations acts originated in the House as regular appropriations bills and were expanded in coverage during the conference proceedings. These included appropriations acts for Defense, Transportation, District of Columbia, Labor-HHS-Education, Agriculture, Foreign Operations, State-Foreign Operations, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Military Construction-VA. The transformation of regular appropriations bills into consolidated appropriations measures occurred during conference proceedings between the House and Senate. This process varied in different fiscal years, with some acts originating as omnibus measures and others being enacted through cross-references. In FY2003, the omnibus measure originated in the House as a simple continuing resolution but was expanded in coverage and redesignated during Senate floor action. The FY2014 and FY2015 omnibus acts were originally non-appropriations measures that were amended to include omnibus appropriations. Issues surrounding omnibus appropriations include the lack of debate and amendment opportunities for Members. During FY1986-FY2016, the House passed 116 out of 170 regular appropriations bills, while the Senate passed 72. Majority of appropriations acts included in omnibus measures were previously passed by both chambers each fiscal year, but between FY2003 and FY2016, one or both chambers passed fewer than half of the regular appropriations bills enacted in omnibus form. Between FY2003 and FY2016, one or both chambers passed fewer than half of the regular appropriations bills enacted in omnibus form. Government-wide across-the-board rescissions in discretionary budget authority were incorporated into annual appropriations acts to adhere to budget restraints. These rescissions ranged from 0.032% to 0.80% of covered appropriations. Between FY2003 and FY2016, omnibus appropriations acts included rescissions ranging from 0.032% to 0.80% of covered appropriations. These rescissions applied to various fiscal years and included across-the-board cuts for both security and nonsecurity budget authority. Additionally, some acts included specific spending cuts for individual programs, such as in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations division and administrative expenses for certain departments. Between FY2003 and FY2016, omnibus appropriations acts included rescissions ranging from 0.032% to 0.80% of covered appropriations, with across-the-board cuts for security and nonsecurity budget authority. Specific spending cuts were also implemented for individual programs in various divisions. More recent acts, such as P.L. 108-447 and P.L. 113-6, included additional across-the-board rescissions targeting specific divisions of the act. Between FY2003 and FY2016, omnibus appropriations acts included rescissions ranging from 0.032% to 0.80% of covered appropriations, with across-the-board cuts for security and nonsecurity budget authority. The FY2000 and FY2013 rescissions helped avoid a sequester, while the FY2001 rescission kept discretionary spending below limits. The FY2003 rescission was used to adhere to informal limits and avoid a veto. Similarly, the FY2004, FY2005, and FY2008 rescissions aimed to control costs. The FY2004, FY2005, and FY2008 rescissions were utilized to maintain costs within acceptable limits for the President. House and Senate rules have traditionally emphasized separate consideration of legislation and appropriations, but this distinction has not always been strictly followed. Some legislative provisions included in annual appropriations acts, particularly omnibus appropriations acts, have blurred the line between legislation and appropriations, violating rules in both chambers. House and Senate rules prohibit legislative provisions in appropriations bills, but exceptions exist. Continuing resolutions are not subject to these restrictions. Omnibus appropriations acts have been used to address legislative concerns, despite rules against including legislation in appropriations. Omnibus appropriations acts have incorporated significant legislative provisions over the past two decades. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 included amendments to various acts and provisions related to legislative matters. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 included amendments to different acts and provisions on various topics. The most recent Consolidated Appropriations Act in 2016 contained significant legislative provisions and reauthorizations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act in 2016 (114-113) included key legislative provisions such as the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, and the James Zadroga 9/11 Victim Compensation Reauthorization."
