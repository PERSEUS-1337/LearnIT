    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Fisheries Act of 1998\" and includes definitions for various terms. The term \"Subject Fishing Vessel\" refers to any vessel engaged in fishing activities, not a US vessel before 1997, meeting specific criteria, and built in the US. Law 100-239 states that a vessel must meet specific criteria to be considered a \"Subject Fishing Vessel,\" including being built in the US and meeting certain purchase or rebuilding requirements before specific dates. Ownership by the same entity during these events is also restricted. The ownership of a Subject Fishing Vessel can be transferred to different entities. Fishing history refers to past fishing activity of a vessel relevant to fishery management plans. Fishing privilege is the authorization needed for a vessel to participate in US fisheries. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce or his designee. SEC. 3. PHASEOUT OF SUBJECT FISHING VESSELS. The text chunk discusses the revocation of fishery licenses, permits, or fishing privileges for Subject Fishing Vessels, except for those operating in the Bering Sea pollock fishery and the Pacific whiting fishery until December 31, 2001. These privileges cannot be transferred or reissued to other entities. All fishery licenses, permits, and fishing privileges for Subject Fishing Vessels will be revoked on December 31, 2001, with no new licenses or permits allowed for operation in any US fishery after that date. SEC. 4 of the Act defines a \"vessel of the United States\" as one owned by a majority of U.S. citizens. Fishing vessels have 18 months to comply with this requirement, or their fishing privileges will be revoked. SEC. 5 imposes a moratorium on large fishing vessels. SEC. 5 imposes a moratorium on large fishing vessels in the United States exclusive economic zone until a fishery management plan authorizes their harvesting. The section imposes a moratorium on large fishing vessels in the US exclusive economic zone based on specific criteria such as size, tonnage, and engine power. It exempts vessels with prior fishing history and endorsements, unless excluded by approved fishery management plans. Additionally, it addresses the replacement of lost fishing vessels. The section addresses the replacement of lost fishing vessels for those with a valid fishery license, permit, or fishing privilege, under specific conditions such as the cause of loss, prior fishing activity, and vessel specifications. The section outlines conditions for replacing lost fishing vessels with a valid fishery license, permit, or fishing privilege, including the cause of loss, vessel specifications, and timing of issuance. This provision does not apply to fishing vessels operating primarily outside the US exclusive economic zone."
