    "content": "The Act titled \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Health Data Act of 2009\" amends the Public Health Service Act to include a section on collecting health data for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. The section defines key terms related to Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) health data collection, including community group, nonprofit organization, designated organization, and government representatives. The curr_chunk defines representatives from various Pacific Island regions as well as the term 'Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders' or 'NHOPI'. It also explains the term 'insular area' including specific regions like Guam and American Samoa. The Secretary will develop a national strategy for assessing the health needs of NHOPI populations in various regions including Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. The Secretary will consult with community groups and government representatives of NHOPI populations to develop a national strategy. Additionally, a preliminary health survey will be conducted to identify major health areas in the US, Hawai`i, and other regions. The health survey for NHOPI populations in various regions will include health data and other relevant information to determine health status and healthcare needs. Methodology for the survey will be developed in consultation with community groups and organizations. The Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Health Data Act of 2009 mandates a survey to be completed within 18 months to assess the health needs of NHOPI populations. A progress report must be submitted to Congress within 2 years, including a national strategy. Additionally, the Secretary will collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on health data and needs in insular areas. The Secretary will collaborate with stakeholders in insular areas to evaluate health care standards, system performance, donor aid effectiveness, and progress on implementing recommendations from the Committee on Health Care Services in the United States-Associated Pacific Basin. The 1998 report, 'Pacific Partnerships for Health: Charting a New Course for the 21st Century', requires the Institute of Medicine to submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within 2 years of the enactment of the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Health Data Act of 2009. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2010 through 2015."
