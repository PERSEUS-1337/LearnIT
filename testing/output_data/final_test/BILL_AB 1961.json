    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 69432 of the Education Code is amended to specify different types of Cal Grant Program awards and their maximum amounts. Starting from the 2013-14 award year, maximum tuition award amounts for Cal Grant A and B awards at private for-profit and nonprofit institutions are outlined. For new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions, the award amount is $4,000. For private nonprofit institutions, the award amount is $9,084 for 2015-16 and 2016-17, increasing to at least $10,000 for 2017-18 and beyond. Renewal award amounts are calculated based on specified maximums. For new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the maximum tuition award amount is $8,056 for the 2017-18 award year and beyond. Private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions receiving Cal Grant funding must submit performance metrics to the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities. The association will collaborate with public higher education segments to determine the metrics' form and content, ensuring consistent data collection and reporting. A cumulative report will be provided to the Legislature, Governor, Department of Finance, and Legislative Analyst's Office annually by March 15, starting in 2017. Private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions must provide data for each participating institution. Private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions are required to provide data on various aspects including the number of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled, percentage of California residents, transfer students from California Community Colleges, Pell Grant and Cal Grant recipients, their ethnic composition, and institutional aid provided. The institution must provide data on the percentage of Cal Grant recipients among undergraduate students, graduation rates for freshman entrants and transfer students disaggregated by Pell Grant and Cal Grant recipients, number of degrees awarded annually in various categories including health-related fields and STEM. The data collection for the report must ensure integrity, security, and compliance with student information confidentiality laws."
