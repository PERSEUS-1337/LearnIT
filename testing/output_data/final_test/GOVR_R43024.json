    "content": "President Obama announced major developments in U.S.-Cuban relations on December 17, 2014. The Cuban government released Alan Gross and an important U.S. intelligence asset in exchange for three Cuban intelligence agents. This led to a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards engagement and normalization. Key steps included reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing funding for Cuba democracy projects and broadcasting. The law allowed for Economic Support Funds to be used for programs in Cuba, without specifying an amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 provided funding for Cuba democracy projects and broadcasting. The explanatory statement allocated $27.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, with the possibility of transferring funds to the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Three individuals, including a Ladies in White member, were released from prison in Cuba but placed under house arrest, raising concerns about a fair trial. Amnesty International expressed worry about their treatment. The independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights reported a high number of short-term detentions for political reasons in 2014, along with 102 political prisoners in the country. Congressional concerns about political and economic developments in Cuba and U.S. policy have been ongoing, with Congress actively shaping U.S. policy towards Cuba since the end of the Cold War. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 shaped U.S. policy towards Cuba by strengthening economic sanctions. Congress later modified sanctions with the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, allowing U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. Debate in Congress has focused on U.S. sanctions, particularly travel restrictions to Cuba. The George W. Bush Administration initially eased U.S. family travel to Cuba in 2003 but tightened restrictions in 2004 due to Cuba's crackdown on dissidents. In 2009, Congress passed a measure to ease restrictions on family travel and agricultural exports to Cuba. The Obama Administration further lifted restrictions on family travel, cash remittances, and migration talks in 2009. In 2011, restrictions on educational and religious travel to Cuba were eased, along with non-family remittances. In December 2014, President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, focusing on engagement and normalization of relations. The initiative includes increasing travel, commerce, and information flow to Cuba. The report analyzes Cuba's political and economic situation, U.S. policy towards Cuba, and selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. It covers historical background, current political conditions under Ra\u00fal Castro, economic changes, and policy shifts. The report provides an overview of Cuba's political and economic situation under Ra\u00fal Castro, as well as U.S. policy towards Cuba. It discusses key issues in U.S.-Cuban relations and legislative initiatives in the 113th Congress. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902 after being a Spanish colony until the Spanish-American War in 1898. The United States ruled Cuba for four years before granting independence, retaining the right to intervene to preserve stability. After gaining independence in 1902, Cuba's political system was often dominated by authoritarian figures. Gerardo Machado became increasingly dictatorial during his two terms as President, leading to his ousting by the military. Fulgencio Batista, a military leader, controlled the government behind the scenes until he was elected President in 1940. Batista's rule turned into a brutal dictatorship after a bloodless coup in 1952, sparking popular unrest and paving the way for Fidel Castro's rise to power. Fidel Castro rose to power after leading a failed attack on military barracks in Cuba in 1953. He formed the 26th of July Movement in Mexico and returned to Cuba in 1956 to overthrow the Batista dictatorship. Batista fled the country on January 1, 1959, leading to Castro's rule for over 45 years. Despite initially promising democratic rule, Castro instead consolidated power, repressed dissent, and imprisoned or executed opponents. After overthrowing the Batista dictatorship in 1959, Fidel Castro established a socialist government in Cuba, aligning closely with the Soviet Union and expropriating U.S. properties. By 1961, Castro declared the revolution to be socialist and proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist. Cuba remained a Soviet ally until the USSR's dissolution in 1991. Castro ruled by decree until 1976 when a new Constitution established the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in government, with power centralized in a Political Bureau led by Castro. Cuba's Constitution established governmental structures with legislative authority vested in the National Assembly of People's Power. The president of the Council of State serves as the head of state and government, with executive power held by the Council of Ministers. Fidel Castro held these positions until February 2008, despite temporarily stepping down in 2006 due to poor health. National Assembly elections were held in January 2008. Fidel Castro was elected to the National Assembly in January 2008 but announced on February 19, 2008, that he would not accept the position as president of the Council of State, confirming his departure from leading the Cuban government. After Fidel Castro stepped down from power, Ra\u00fal Castro officially became Cuba's President on February 24, 2008. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura was selected as the Council of State's first Vice President, surprising observers. Born in 1930, Machado was a close friend and confidant of Ra\u00fal Castro, known for his hard-line communist party ideology. The first vice president of the Council of State is a significant position in Cuba as the official successor to the president. Ra\u00fal Castro implemented economic reforms in 2008 but maintained tight government control, supported by a strong security apparatus. The Cuban military, led by Ra\u00fal, has increased its role in government. The Cuban Communist Party made economic and some political changes during its sixth congress in April 2011. At the April 2011 party congress, changes occurred in the Cuban Communist Party leadership. Fidel Castro was officially replaced by Ra\u00fal as first secretary of the PCC, and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado became the party's second secretary. The party's Political Bureau was reduced from 23 to 15 members, with 3 new members added. The Central Committee was also reduced in size, with about 80 new members added. Ra\u00fal Castro proposed term limits for top positions in the party and government to promote rejuvenation, a change confirmed in a January 2012 national PCC conference. Critics have noted the need for leadership succession to a younger generation. At the January 2012 PCC conference, leadership changes were expected but did not occur. However, a resolution was approved allowing the Central Committee to replace up to 20% of its members. In February 2013, Cuba held elections for the National Assembly and provincial government representatives, mostly PCC members. Critics claim the elections are controlled by the PCC. Ra\u00fal Castro was re-elected as president for a second five-year term. Ra\u00fal Castro was selected for a second five-year term as president until February 2018, when he will be 86 years old. This will be his last term in accordance with the new two-term limit for top officials. First Vice President Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado, 82 years old, was replaced by 52-year-old Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, signaling a move towards generational change in Cuba's political system. D\u00edaz-Canel, a member of the Politburo since 2003, has held various top positions and is described as an experienced manager with good relations with the military. In February 2013, Esteban Lazo Hern\u00e1ndez became the new president of Cuba's National Assembly, replacing Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n. Lazo, the highest-ranking Afro-Cuban official, has held top party positions and served as a vice president of the Council of State. This change reflects a shift towards generational change in Cuba's political system, as mentioned by President Castro on the 60th anniversary of the Cuban revolution in July 2013. The transfer of power in Cuba has begun, with a focus on leadership transition to new generations. Observers predict a smooth transition in 2018, but anticipate potential factionalism without Ra\u00fal Castro. The Conference of Catholic Bishops in Cuba called for political updates alongside economic changes, emphasizing diversity, dialogue, and building an open society. The Cuban government's human rights record is criticized. The Cuban government has a poor record on human rights, restricting freedoms since the early years of the revolution. Members of the Ladies in White human rights group have been harassed, and two political prisoners died after hunger strikes to protest prison conditions. Amnesty International reported in March 2012 that the Cuban government continues to harass political opponents and detain them briefly to suppress demands for civil and political rights. Despite the release of political prisoners in 2011, AI stated that there was no change in human rights policy, with many prisoners being forced into exile. The authorities in Cuba are using new tactics such as intimidation, surveillance, and acts of repudiation to control dissidents and critics. AI highlighted several prisoners of conscience, including Iv\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez Depestre, who was convicted of \"dangerousness.\" In early August 2013, a person was convicted of \"dangerousness\" after participating in a peaceful protest and sentenced to three years in prison. Brothers Alexeis, Django, and Vianco Vargas Mart\u00edn, members of UNPACU, were detained in late 2012 and convicted in June 2014 for \"public disorder.\" AI believed their arrest was to intimidate government critics. Other cases of arbitrary detention by the Cuban government were reported, including the continued detention of Sonia Garro Alfonso, her husband, and a neighbor since March 2012. Sonia Garro Alfonso, her husband Ram\u00f3n Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez, and a neighbor, Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez, were released from prison on December 9, 2014, and placed under house arrest while awaiting trial. Concerns were raised by AI about the fairness of their trial and the increasing number of political prisoners in Cuba. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN) estimated that Cuba had over 100 political prisoners in June 2014, with a significant increase in short-term detentions for political reasons in recent years. In December 2014, Cuba agreed to release 53 political prisoners as part of a deal to restore bilateral relations with the United States. The number of short-term detentions for political reasons in Cuba significantly increased in recent years, with at least 8,410 detentions from January to November 2014. Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, known for founding the Varela Project, was killed in a car accident in July 2012, along with another activist. The incident also involved two Europeans, one of whom was convicted in October 2012. In October 2012, Carromero of Popular Party's youth organization was convicted of vehicular manslaughter for speeding. He was released in December 2012 to serve his term in Spain after diplomatic efforts. Carromero claimed in March 2013 that the car he was driving was struck from behind before the accident and that he was heavily drugged. Pay\u00e1's daughter called for a UN investigation into the crash. Modig, the other European involved, stated he was asleep at the time and does not remember details. The US Senate approved a resolution in July 2012 for a third-party investigation. The US Department of State called for an independent international investigation in March 2013. In March 2013, there was a call for an independent international investigation into the deaths of Pay\u00e1 and Cepero. Cuban blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez gained international attention for her critical website, Generaci\u00f3n Y. She later launched an independent digital newspaper in Cuba. In the 113th Congress, H.Res. 121 would honor Yoani S\u00e1nchez for her efforts to challenge repression in Cuba. Despite poor human rights conditions, Cuba has made some advances, including lifting a ban on Cubans staying in hotels restricted to foreign tourists. The government has been more open to economic debate and the Catholic Church has played a role in broadening social and economic discussions. In June 2014, editors of Espacio Laical resigned due to pressure from within the Church against political involvement. They announced the launch of a new online forum called Cuba Posible. Cuba eliminated exit permits in January 2013, allowing dissidents to travel abroad. However, those with legal restrictions, including political prisoners on parole, are still unable to travel. Dissident economist Oscar Espinosa Chepe passed away in Spain in September 2013. Oscar Espinosa Chepe, a dissident economist, died in Spain in September 2013 after battling chronic liver disease and cancer. He was imprisoned in 2003 as one of the \"group of 75\" dissidents but was released on medical parole in 2004. The Department of State praised him as a champion for economic policy and human rights in Cuba. He traveled to Madrid for medical treatment in March 2013 and is survived by Miriam Leiva, a human rights activist. Cuba remained on the Tier 3 list for combatting trafficking in the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report. Cuba's economy is state-controlled, with key sectors including professional services export, tourism, nickel mining, and biotechnology. The government is taking steps to combat sex trafficking, aiming to amend its criminal code to comply with international standards. Cuba's economy relies on joint investment projects, a biotechnology sector, and remittances from the US. The sugar industry has declined, and Cuba depends on Venezuela for oil. Cuba's goal of becoming a net oil exporter was setback in 2012. Cuba's offshore oil development faced setbacks in 2012, leading to concerns about reliance on Venezuelan oil. The country aims to diversify trading partners and energy suppliers. Cuba boasts high human development indicators, with a focus on health and education achievements. The World Bank estimates Cuba's per capita income was in the upper middle income range in 2012. The country experienced severe economic decline from 1989 to 1993 but has since shown improvement, with economic growth averaging 3.7% annually from 1994 to 2000. Strong growth was seen in the tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, supported by Venezuela and China. Cuba's economy was impacted by hurricanes and global financial crises in 2008 and 2009, leading to austerity measures and slowed growth. Despite modest improvements in growth from 2010 to 2013, forecasts for 2014 were downgraded due to challenges in transitioning to a decentralized economy. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects stronger growth rates for 2015-2019, but warns that withdrawal of support from Venezuela could jeopardize these forecasts. Cuba needs a growth rate of at least 5% according to some economists. The government of Ra\u00fal Castro has implemented economic policy changes to increase growth rates, allowing more private sector activities and self-employment. The number of self-employed individuals has risen significantly, with the establishment of non-agricultural cooperatives and conversion of state-run restaurants. The government announced the conversion of state-run restaurants to cooperatives in a pilot project to support the private sector. Analysts suggest more support is needed, including expanding authorized activities and providing credit for small businesses. Lack of money circulation is a challenge, with private sector activities for tourists doing better than those for the Cuban market. Government crackdowns on certain private businesses raised concerns about its commitment to development. In late December 2013, Ra\u00fal Castro warned against unauthorized economic activities, emphasizing the need to follow state regulations. The Cuban Communist Party approved economic guidelines in April 2011, including reforms like liquidating state enterprises with losses and creating special zones for foreign investment. However, some analysts felt these changes were insufficient to address Cuba's economic challenges, such as low wages and the need for a more comprehensive tax system. Cuba faces economic challenges like low wages and the dual-currency system. The government plans to unify the currencies to address these issues. The unification of Cuba's dual-currency system is expected to bring productivity gains and improve the business climate, although the actual date and exchange rate system for the reform remain uncertain. Efforts under Ra\u00fal Castro have focused on the agricultural sector to boost food production, including giving farmers more control over their land and supplies. Despite these efforts, overall food production has fallen below targets, with challenges like Hurricane Sandy impacting the coffee sector in 2012. In November 2013, the Cuban government introduced a new pilot program in select provinces to end the monopoly on food distribution. In March 2014, a new foreign investment law was approved to attract foreign capital by cutting taxes and streamlining approval processes. The law aims to improve transparency and efficiency in the investment process. The Cuban government introduced a new foreign investment law in March 2014 to attract foreign capital by cutting taxes and streamlining approval processes. Investors are cautious and want evidence that the government is willing to allow them to make a profit in Cuba. In October 2014, the government listed 246 projects seeking $8.7 billion in investment in various sectors. In April 2014, restrictions were loosened for state-run companies to keep 50% of their profits, design their own wage systems, and have more flexibility in production. Cuba's economists are pushing for more reforms and competition in the economy, criticizing the government's reliance on central planning and monopoly in foreign trade. With the end of the Cold War and loss of Soviet support, Cuba had to abandon its revolutionary activities abroad and open up its economy. Cuba opened up its economy after losing Soviet support, establishing trade relations with Canada, Spain, Europe, and China. Venezuela provided significant support with oil and investment under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, but concerns arose after his death and Venezuela's economic challenges. Cuba's main trading partners in 2012 were Venezuela and the Netherlands. In 2012, Cuba's top trading partners for exports were Venezuela, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, while for imports were Venezuela, China, Spain, Brazil, and the United States. Relations with Russia have improved in recent years, with high-level visits between leaders. Putin visited Cuba in 2014, forgiving a large portion of Cuba's Soviet-era debt in exchange for investment projects. After Putin's visit, reports claimed Russia might reopen its signals intelligence facility in Cuba, but Putin denied this. Russian energy companies were involved in oil exploration in Cuba, with Gazprom and Zarubezhneft facing challenges in drilling. In 2014, Rosneft and Zarubezhneft signed an agreement with Cuba's state oil company during Putin's visit. Russian energy companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft signed an agreement with Cuba's state oil company Cupet for offshore exploration and to optimize production at mature fields. Some analysts doubt the success of the offshore project due to past failures. Relations with China have improved in recent years, with increased trade and investment. Chinese leaders have visited Cuba multiple times, signaling closer ties. In 2011 and 2014, Ra\u00fal Castro and Xi Jinping visited Cuba, signing trade agreements. The EU and Cuba made progress in cooperation talks in 2014, aiming for political and trade agreements. Cuba has restored diplomatic relations with all Latin American nations and has strengthened ties with Venezuela through the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2013, Cuba began sending doctors to Brazil, earning $225 million annually. Brazil has also invested in the development of the port of Mariel in Cuba. Cuba became a member of the Rio Group and CELAC to boost regional cooperation. In 2014, Cuba hosted the second CELAC summit in Havana, where human rights issues were raised by the U.N. Secretary General. Dozens of dissidents were arrested during the event. At the 2012 Summit of the Americas, Cuba was not invited to attend due to opposition from the United States and Canada. Several Latin American nations threatened to boycott the next summit in Panama in 2015 unless Cuba was allowed to participate. Cuba's participation in the 2015 Summit of the Americas was a challenge for the Obama Administration, but President Obama announced a new policy approach towards Cuba in December 2014, allowing Cuba to join the summit. Despite being excluded from the OAS in 1962, the organization overturned the resolution in 2009, potentially paving the way for Cuba's reentry. Cuba welcomed the OAS vote but stated it would not return to the organization. Cuba is active in international forums like the United Nations. Cuba is actively involved in international forums like the United Nations and the United Nations Human Rights Council. The U.N. General Assembly has annually criticized the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba since 1991. Cuba has received support from organizations like the UNDP and UNESCO, with the U.N. providing relief after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In cooperation with the Cuban government, a $30.6 million Plan of Action was launched by the U.N. to address urgent needs in various sectors. Cuba, a founding member of the World Trade Organization, hosted the 14th summit of the Non-aligned Movement in 2006. In 2013, a North Korean freighter with suspected illicit narcotics was detained in Panama after making stops in Cuba. The North Korean crew tried to prevent a search of the ship, with the captain attempting suicide. Panama found hidden weapons along with sugar. Cuba acknowledged the ship was carrying 10,000 tons of sugar and \"obsolete defensive weapons\" including anti-aircraft missiles and MiG-21 Bis aircraft parts. Cuba's effort to repair \"obsolete defensive equipment\" raised questions, with reports suggesting North Korea may have been upgrading the missile systems. Analysts speculate that the sugar found on the ship could have been payment for the repair/upgrade. The inclusion of MiGs in the shipment also raised doubts about whether they would be returned to Cuba. In 2011, North Korea tried to acquire MiG-21 parts from Mongolia. The Chong Chon Gang shipment from Cuba to North Korea included MiG-21 jets and various weapons and military equipment, some of which were in mint condition and not intended to be returned to Cuba. The discovery raised questions about previous shipments and the potential upgrade of North Korea's missile systems. The Chong Chon Gang shipment of weapons from Cuba to North Korea raises questions about previous shipments and the nature of Cuban-North Korean relations. North Korean ships have made multiple trips to Cuba since 2009, including visits to Havana and Puerto Padre. This suggests a potentially significant relationship between the two countries, despite traditionally not being thought of as significant. During the Cold War, North Korea and Cuba were ideological partners aligned with the Soviet Union. North Korea provided 100,000 Kalashnikov assault weapons to Cuba in the 1980s. A high-level North Korean military delegation visited Cuba in July 2013, indicating a potential military relationship between the two countries. Ra\u00fal Castro emphasized historic ties and efforts to boost relations with Panama. The U.N. Security Council investigated a shipment to North Korea from Cuba, concluding it violated sanctions. The Panel of Experts found the hidden cargo included missile systems, confirming sanctions violations. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on the operator of the Chong Chon Gang for concealing arms and related material in a shipment to North Korea from Cuba. The company, Ocean Maritime Management Company, Ltd, is now under an international asset freeze. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power described the incident as a clear intention to circumvent resolutions. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations condemned the North Korean ship incident as an illegal attempt to bypass UN sanctions by Cuba and North Korea. The history of strained U.S.-Cuban relations includes events like the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, and the Mariel boatlift in 1980. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo imposed by President Kennedy in 1962. Key events in the strained U.S.-Cuban relations include the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and the 1996 shootdown of U.S. civilian planes by Cuban fighter jets. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in 1962, which was later expanded in 1962 under the Trading with the Enemy Act. In 1963, the Cuban Import Regulations were replaced by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, which prohibit most financial and trade transactions with Cuba. These regulations are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 under the Trading with the Enemy Act, expanded in 1963 with the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The CACR prohibit financial and trade transactions with Cuba, requiring exports to be licensed by the Department of Commerce. Stronger sanctions were imposed with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 (Helms/Burton legislation), which prohibits U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry of vessels involved in Cuban trade. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 codified the Cuban embargo and imposed sanctions on those trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. The law restricts the executive branch from lifting the embargo without congressional approval until certain democratic conditions are met. The Cuban embargo, codified by the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, imposes sanctions on those involved in trafficking U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama have suspended the implementation of Title III in U.S. federal court. U.S. policy includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and broadcasting to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for agricultural exports to Cuba, making the U.S. one of Cuba's largest suppliers of agricultural products. The Clinton Administration implemented changes to U.S. policy after Pope John Paul II's 1998 visit to Cuba, including the resumption of direct flights, cash remittances, and streamlined procedures for medical supplies. President Clinton later expanded cash remittances to all U.S. residents and increased direct passenger charter flights to Cuba. The George W. Bush Administration continued the two-track U.S. policy towards Cuba, maintaining economic sanctions while supporting the Cuban people through various measures. They expanded direct passenger charter flights to Cuba from additional U.S. cities, loosened restrictions on travel for certain categories of travelers, and established an interagency Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba in 2003. The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba in late 2003 recommended tightening restrictions on travel and humanitarian assistance to Cuba. The Bush Administration followed these recommendations by implementing stricter regulations on family visits, remittances, gift parcels, and payment terms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. Additionally, the commission's final report in July 2006 led to increased U.S. funding to support democracy and human rights efforts in Cuba. The Bush Administration continued to emphasize sanctions on Cuba, urging for democratic change and human rights improvements. President Bush stated that Cuba needed to release political prisoners, respect human rights, and hold free elections. The Obama Administration maintained a dual-track policy approach towards Cuba. The Obama Administration continued the dual-track policy approach towards Cuba, maintaining economic sanctions while also reaching out to the Cuban people through easing travel and remittance restrictions. Efforts to improve relations were hindered by Cuba's imprisonment of USAID subcontractor Alan Gross in 2009. President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba, including a restoration of diplomatic relations and new efforts towards engagement. The administration lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances in April 2009, and further eased travel restrictions and allowed all Americans to send remittances to Cuba in January 2011. The Obama Administration implemented measures to ease travel restrictions and allow all Americans to send remittances to Cuba, including increasing purposeful travel related to religious, educational, and journalistic activities. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson emphasized the importance of building connections between the Cuban and American people to empower Cubans to determine their own future independently of their government. The Obama Administration's policies aimed to empower Cubans by providing alternative sources of information, opportunities for self-employment, and strengthening civil society. President Obama sought to improve relations with Cuba, acknowledging the need to overcome mistrust and engage on various issues such as drugs, migration, and human rights. The President aimed to improve U.S.-Cuban relations by addressing issues like drugs, migration, and human rights. Talks were restarted on migration and mail service, but relations soured in 2009 when an American subcontractor was arrested in Cuba. In 2011, a U.S. contractor funded by USAID was arrested in Cuba for providing Internet equipment to the Jewish community, leading to strained relations between the two countries. Despite continued cooperation on antidrug efforts and oil spill prevention, relations were hindered by the contractor's case. Talks for direct mail service between the U.S. and Cuba resumed in 2013. In 2013, talks were held between the United States and Cuba regarding direct mail service and migration issues. The State Department described the talks as \"fruitful\" with the goal of establishing a pilot program for mail transportation. The Obama Administration resumed migration talks in July 2013, with positive statements issued after each round. In September 2013, the two countries agreed on a preliminary procedure for air and maritime search and rescue cooperation. In January and July 2014, migration talks between the U.S. and Cuba emphasized cooperation to save lives in danger, including discussions on aviation safety and search and rescue protocols. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry addressed U.S. policy towards Cuba in November 2013, highlighting the need for creative and updated policies. In a November 18, 2013 address, Secretary of State Kerry discussed U.S.-Latin American relations and cooperation with Cuba. He acknowledged positive changes in Cuba allowing more freedom but warned against overlooking the authoritarian reality faced by ordinary Cubans. The handshake between President Obama and President Castro at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in 2013 sparked international press attention. Some saw it as a potential sign of thawing relations, while others criticized Obama for shaking hands with a leader with a poor human rights record. Human rights violations in Cuba remained a concern under the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration expressed concern over human rights violations in Cuba, including the death of hunger strikers and repression against dissidents. Despite the release of political prisoners, the government's poor human rights record persisted with continued short-term detentions. U.S. officials met with Cuban dissidents like Berta Soler and Guillermo Fari\u00f1as to address suppression of peaceful activities by civil society groups. President Obama's meeting with Cuban dissidents in Miami and Secretary of State Kerry's remarks at the OAS reiterated concerns about human rights and freedom of expression in Cuba. In 2013 and 2014, the State Department expressed concerns about human rights violations in Cuba, condemning the government's harsh tactics against civil society and peaceful advocates. This included arbitrary detentions, physical violence, and assaults on activists and journalists. The State Department condemned the Cuban government's use of violence and arbitrary detention. They also highlighted the detention of members of the Ladies in White commemorating the 20-year anniversary of a tragic event. The release of Alan Gross from prison in Cuba was a top priority for the U.S., with efforts made through various channels including the Vatican. President Obama announced significant developments in U.S.-Cuban relations on December 17, 2014, including the release of Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds after five years. The government released USAID subcontractor Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds after five years of imprisonment, which was seen as a key step towards improving U.S.-Cuban relations. Additionally, the Cuban government released a U.S. intelligence asset in exchange for three Cuban intelligence agents who had been imprisoned in the United States since 1998. The U.S. intelligence asset was identified as Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a cryptographer in Cuba's Directorate of Intelligence who provided valuable information to the FBI. After securing the release of Alan Gross and a U.S. intelligence asset, President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards engagement instead of sanctions. He outlined steps to normalize relations, including reestablishing diplomatic relations and reviewing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The White House announced policy changes to implement steps towards normalizing relations with Cuba, including expanding travel, commerce, and information flow, increasing remittances, allowing commercial sales/exports of certain goods, and authorizing licensed travelers to import goods worth $400 from Cuba. The White House announced policy changes to normalize relations with Cuba, including expanding travel, commerce, and information flow, allowing imports of goods worth $400, and permitting the commercial sale of communication devices and services in Cuba. The White House announced policy changes to normalize relations with Cuba, including expanding travel, commerce, and information flow, allowing imports of goods worth $400, and permitting the commercial sale of communication devices and services in Cuba. These actions will require changes to U.S. embargo regulations administered by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Commerce. The changes are expected within the next several weeks and are within the scope of the President's discretionary licensing authority. President Obama and his predecessors made policy changes to ease or strengthen the embargo restrictions on Cuba. The President acknowledged that he does not have the authority to lift the embargo as it was codified into legislation. He expressed interest in engaging Congress in a debate about lifting the embargo, which is tied to conditions in Cuba including the presence of a democratically elected government. The President acknowledged the need to amend or repeal laws like the Cuban Democracy Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform Act that hinder economic relations with Cuba. He also mentioned the possibility of Cuba joining the Summit of the Americas in 2015, emphasizing human rights and democracy as key themes. Cuba's participation in the summit was a challenge for the Administration, as some Latin American nations threatened to boycott if Cuba was not invited. In the 2015 Summit of the Americas, there was debate over Cuba's participation. Various approaches have been proposed for U.S. policy towards Cuba, including maintaining pressure for reforms, engaging in constructive dialogue, or swiftly normalizing relations by lifting the embargo. Legislative initiatives have reflected these differing views over the past decade. In the past decade, there have been efforts in Congress to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba, with some amendments being approved but later stripped out of final measures. In 2009, Congress eased some travel restrictions to Cuba for the first time since 2000. With Fidel Castro's departure and economic changes by Ra\u00fal Castro, there have been calls to reexamine U.S. policy towards Cuba, leading to two broad policy approaches being proposed. Advocates for easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to peaceful reform on the island. They emphasize the importance of avoiding violent change and mass exodus to the United States. With Fidel Castro no longer in power, a more pragmatic approach is suggested to bring about change in Cuba. Supporters of changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue for lifting the embargo, citing international support, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. They advocate for consistency in policies towards communist governments like China and Vietnam. Opponents maintain that isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best approach for political change, referencing the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 as a roadmap for normalization. Opponents of softening U.S. policy towards Cuba argue that maintaining sanctions is crucial for promoting democracy and human rights, attributing Cuba's economic struggles to its own policies rather than the U.S. embargo. Public opinion polls show majority support for normalizing relations with Cuba, with a split among Cuban Americans in Florida. FIU's 2014 poll in Miami-Dade County showed a majority of Cuban Americans opposed the embargo, with 69% supporting the lifting of travel restrictions to Cuba. Some Members of Congress praised President Obama's new Cuba policy, while others criticized him for not securing human rights concessions from Cuba. The 114th Congress is likely to debate U.S.-Cuban relations, with Congress actively involved in policy through various initiatives. Key issues include travel restrictions, agricultural exports, democracy projects, Alan Gross's imprisonment, broadcasting to Cuba, terrorism, migration, anti-drug cooperation, and offshore oil development. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a key component of U.S. efforts to isolate the communist government of Fidel Castro for over 50 years. Changes to these restrictions have occurred over time, with increased enforcement under the George W. Bush Administration. In 2003, travel for people-to-people educational exchanges was eliminated, and further restrictions were imposed in 2004. Under the Obama Administration, restrictions on travel to Cuba were eased, including family travel, cash remittances, and gift parcels. Changes were made in March 2009 and further in January 2011, allowing for increased purposeful travel related to religious, educational, and journalistic activities. Under the Obama Administration, restrictions on travel to Cuba were eased, allowing purposeful travel for religious, educational, and journalistic activities. The new measures also permitted remittances to non-family members and expanded services for licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. These policies were similar to those implemented by the Clinton Administration in 1999 but were later restricted by the Bush Administration. The Treasury Department updated guidelines for people-to-people travel to Cuba in April 2011, with the first trips starting in August 2011. In May 2012, restrictions were tightened, requiring organizations to show how the travel would benefit the Cuban people. Reports in September 2012 mentioned delays in approval processes. In 2012, there were delays in Treasury Department approval for people-to-people travel licenses, causing trip cancellations and layoffs. By October 2012, companies reported receiving approvals again. In April 2013, Congress criticized Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z for their Cuba trip, questioning its legality and lack of meetings with oppressed individuals. The Treasury Department confirmed that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's trip to Cuba was authorized under a people-to-people exchange program licensed by OFAC, with no apparent violations of U.S. sanctions. A report by the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General supported OFAC's findings. In April 2013, 59 House Democrats praised President Obama for easing travel restrictions to Cuba and called for further expansion of permissible travel categories. President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba on December 17, 2014, allowing for general licenses for 12 categories of travel and increasing remittances to Cuba. This would provide more opportunities for engagement and help Cubans create jobs and expand independence from the Cuban government. Regulations implementing these changes are expected to be issued soon. Major arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include abridging the rights of Americans to travel, influencing conditions in Cuba, and Americans traveling to other countries with authoritarian governments. Arguments against lifting the ban include supporting Castro's rule financially, legal provisions for humanitarian travel to Cuba, and the President's ability to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. Legislative activity in the 113th Congress included discussions on the FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure. The FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure, H.R. 2786 and S. 1371, had provisions regarding travel restrictions to Cuba. The House version would have prohibited people-to-people travel to Cuba, while the Senate version would have expanded the general license for professional research and meetings in Cuba. However, these provisions were not included in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure, H.R. 3547. The House version of the FY2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act includes provisions to restrict travel to Cuba, preventing people-to-people travel and requiring a joint report on travelers visiting close relatives in Cuba. The House version of the FY2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act includes provisions to restrict travel to Cuba, preventing people-to-people travel and requiring a joint report on travelers visiting close relatives in Cuba. Congress did not complete action on H.R. 5016, which would have lifted travel restrictions to Cuba. Several legislative initiatives were introduced in the 113th Congress to lift travel restrictions and the overall embargo on Cuba. U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed for more than a decade. U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed for more than a decade under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Export licenses are granted for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, but without access to U.S. government assistance or financing. Cuba has purchased about $5 billion in U.S. products since 2001, with exports rising significantly over the years. In 2008, U.S. exports to Cuba reached $712 million, driven by higher food prices and Cuba's increased food needs after hurricanes. The U.S. was the largest supplier of food to Cuba from 2002 to 2010, but Brazil briefly took over in 2011. However, U.S. exports rose to $464 million in 2012 due to increased import needs after Hurricane Sandy. Export declined to $359 million in 2013. In recent years, U.S. exports to Cuba have declined by about 23%, totaling $359 million in 2013. The leading products exported include poultry, soybean oilcake, corn, and soybeans. Reasons for the decline include Cuba's shortage of hard currency, credits offered by other governments, and ineffective efforts to change U.S. sanctions policy. The study estimated that lifting U.S. financing and travel restrictions would increase U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, particularly in fresh fruits, vegetables, milk powder, processed foods, wheat, and dry beans. The influx of U.S. tourists would boost demand for imported agricultural products, especially high-end products for the tourist sector. The USITC issued a working paper in 2009 updating a study on U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. If U.S. restrictions on financing and travel were lifted in 2008, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba could have increased by $216 million to $478 million. Wheat, rice, beef, pork, processed foods, and fish products would have benefited the most. Some groups support further easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, believing it would help U.S. farmers capitalize on the market. President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba on December 17, 2014, including measures to expand commercial sales and exports to boost Cuba's private sector. This included allowing U.S. institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions and revising the definition of \"cash in advance\" for authorized transactions. Legislative efforts have been made to ease restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, with temporary provisions in FY2010 and FY2011 overturning OFAC's clarification on \"cash in advance.\" Regulations will be revised to specify that it means \"cash before transfer of title.\" The 2005 OFAC action was seen as a new sanction that violated TSRA, impacting agricultural sales. Legislative provisions redefined \"payment of cash in advance\" for FY2010 and FY2011 to mean payment before transfer of title to Cuban purchaser. However, FY2012 did not include a similar provision. The Senate bill had a provision to continue the definition but was not included in the final legislation. The Senate bill in the 113th Congress included provisions to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba. However, these provisions were not included in the final omnibus appropriations legislation. Additionally, other bills introduced aimed to lift restrictions and licensing requirements on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The FY2015 Financial Services appropriations measure would have directed the Treasury Department to review the impact of the prohibition on U.S. private financing for sales of U.S. agricultural commodities on small exporters and farmers. A trademark sanction related to Cuba has been in place for 15 years, preventing the U.S. from accepting payment for trademark registrations from Cuban nationals unless the original owner consents. This provision prohibits U.S. courts from recognizing such trademarks without the original owner's consent. The U.S. law prohibits recognition of trademarks without the original owner's consent, leading to a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi over the Havana Club trademark. Pernod Ricard wants to protect its future distribution rights for Havana Club rum in case the trade embargo is lifted. The European Union initiated WTO dispute settlement proceedings in 2000, arguing that the U.S. law violates intellectual property agreements. The U.S. law prohibiting recognition of trademarks without owner consent led to a WTO dispute with the EU over the Havana Club trademark. The WTO found the trademark sanction violated TRIPS Agreement provisions, and the U.S. agreed to comply by January 3, 2003. Despite deadline extensions, no legislative action was taken. In a 2005 EU-U.S. agreement, the EU postponed retaliation but reserved the right. In 2013, EU officials raised compliance concerns at a WTO meeting. On August 3, 2006, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cancelled Cuba's Havana Club trademark registration. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision in March 2011, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in May 2012. Bacardi started marketing Havana Club rum in the U.S. in 2006, leading to a lawsuit by Pernod Ricard over the origin representation. In April 2010, a U.S. District Court ruled on the matter. In April 2010, a U.S. District Court ruled in Bacardi's favor that the labeling of the rum was not misleading. Legislative activity in Congress has focused on bringing Section 211 into compliance with the WTO ruling, with debates on amending the section to apply to all persons claiming rights in trademarks confiscated by Cuba or repealing it altogether. The Judiciary held a hearing on the trademark implications of HAVANA CLUB and Section 211 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. Several legislative initiatives were introduced in Congress to address compliance with the WTO ruling, including bills applying a narrow fix or lifting U.S. sanctions on Cuba. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 also played a role in the discussions. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement reduced pressure on Congress to comply with the WTO ruling. The United States has provided assistance to Cuba for democracy efforts, with funding totaling $264 million from FY1996 to FY2014. The Administration's FY2015 request is for $20 million. The Administration's FY2015 request for Cuba assistance is $20 million, with funding totaling $264 million from FY1996 to FY2014. The State Department has been allocated slightly more funding than USAID in recent years, with Congress stipulating how the funds should be distributed. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote a peaceful transition to democracy. USAID partners with organizations to promote democracy in Cuba, with funding allocated to various NGOs. The Administration requested $20 million for FY2012 to support democratic principles. The Administration's budget request for FY2012 included $20 million to support democratic principles in Cuba. The assistance aimed to strengthen various elements of Cuban civil society, including marginalized groups, youth, legal associations, and women's networks. Programs would focus on increasing community involvement, networking among groups, documenting human rights violations, providing humanitarian aid to political prisoners, and developing leadership skills in civil society leaders. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2012 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill, S. 1601 ( S.Rept. 112-85 ), would have provided $15 million in ESF for Cuba, including humanitarian and democracy assistance, support for economic reform, private sector initiatives, and human rights. The committee expected funds to be used transparently and directed the USAID Administrator to provide updates on the assistance provided to Cubans. The House Appropriations Committee bill recommended $20 million in ESF for Cuba for democracy-building purposes only, excluding business promotion and economic reform. USAID and the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor would administer the funds for FY2012 projects in Cuba. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $20 million in ESF for Cuba for democracy-building purposes only, excluding business promotion and economic reform. The funds will be administered by USAID and the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. For FY2013, $9.85 million will be administered by these departments, with $4 million transferred to NED. The types of programs funded include support for human rights initiatives, civil society and media programs, and program support. The Administration requested $15 million for human rights and democracy programs for Cuba in FY2013, focusing on promoting basic freedoms and providing humanitarian assistance to prisoners of conscience. The Senate and House versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations act differed in funding for Cuba. The Senate proposed $15 million for humanitarian assistance, economic reform, and democracy, while the House recommended $20 million for democracy-building, excluding business promotion. The House suggested merging the aid with funds for the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy and civil society in Cuba. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (P.L. 104-114) authorizes funding for Cuba democracy programs. Congress approved a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 117, P.L. 112-175) in September 2012, continuing FY2013 funding through March 27, 2013. Full-year FY2013 appropriations were completed with the approval of H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6) on March 21, 2013, which included funding for Cuba democracy programs affected by budget sequestration cutbacks. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, allocated $19.283 million for FY2013 Cuba democracy funding. The State Department will administer $17.783 million, with funds allocated for rule of law, civil society programs, and program management. Additionally, the Broadcasting Board of Governors will administer $1.5 million. In FY2014, the Administration requested $15 million for Cuba democracy programs. The Administration requested $15 million in FY2014 for Cuba human rights and democracy projects to strengthen civil society, promote democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression. Programs also include humanitarian assistance for victims of political repression and promoting uncensored information flow in Cuba. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees had different versions on how the ESF assistance for Cuba should be used. The Committee version of the bill, H.R. 2855, proposed transferring $20 million in ESF assistance to the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy and civil society in Cuba. The final FY2014 appropriations law, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, allocated up to $17.5 million for programs in Cuba, specifying that the funds should not be used for business promotion or other unauthorized purposes. The FY2014 appropriations law allocated up to $17.5 million for programs in Cuba, with $7.5 million going directly to NED and the rest administered by the State Department. The Administration provided $20 million for FY2014 Cuba democracy programs, $5 million more than requested. For FY2015, the Administration requested $20 million for Cuba democracy programs. The request for FY2014 appropriations in Cuba includes support for civil society initiatives promoting democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression. Programs aim to provide humanitarian assistance, strengthen independent civil society, and promote uncensored information flow on the island. Key aspects of the program involve working with civil society to increase community involvement, facilitate information sharing, and support Cuban-led efforts to document human rights violations. The House Appropriations Committee-reported FY2015 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill allocated $20 million in ESF to promote democracy and civil society in Cuba. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version included $10 million for programs in Cuba and an additional $5 million for USAID programs to support private businesses. Congress finalized FY2015 appropriations with an omnibus measure. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 113-235) allocated ESF assistance for Cuba without specifying an amount. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) receives funding from Congress and the State Department for its Cuba program. NED's democratization assistance for Cuba is now funded through the State Department appropriations measure. Congress mandated $7.5 million for democracy assistance in Cuba to be provided to NED in FY2014. In FY2013, NED provided $3.4 million for its Cuba projects, funding various organizations such as Afro-Cuban Alliance, Inc., Asociaci\u00f3n de Iberoamericanos por la Libertad, and Cubanet News Inc. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued reports since 2006 examining USAID and State Department democracy programs for Cuba, highlighting significant problems and the need for better management and oversight. The GAO reports highlighted issues with the oversight of Cuba program grants, including high shipping costs and lax oversight. USAID took steps to address these problems, such as awarding grants competitively, hiring more staff, and improving oversight through pre-award and follow-up reviews. The 2008 GAO report recommended that USAID strengthen program oversight for Cuba grants by ensuring adequate staffing levels and assessing overall efforts to reduce grantee risks. In January 2013, GAO reported improvements in USAID's monitoring of program funds but highlighted the need for continued vigilance. In early April 2014, an Associated Press report alleged that USAID had established a \"Cuban Twitter\" called ZunZuneo to undermine Cuba's government. The project was financed through foreign banks and used by thousands of people. The ZunZuneo project, funded by USAID, was used by thousands of Cubans for over two years until 2012. USAID defended the program, stating it was not covert but maintained a discreet profile to minimize risks. Some Members of Congress criticized USAID for lack of transparency, while others defended the agency. In 2014, another U.S.-funded democracy program sent youth from Latin American countries to Cuba for civic programs. In 2010 and 2011, youth from Latin American countries were sent to Cuba for civic programs, including an HIV-prevention workshop, with the alleged goal of recruiting young Cubans for anti-government activism. USAID defended the program, stating it supported civil society programs. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor, was imprisoned in Cuba from 2009 to 2014 for his work on a Cuba democracy project. Alan Gross has been imprisoned in Cuba since 2009 despite calls for his release on humanitarian grounds. His imprisonment has hindered U.S.-Cuban relations. Cuba linked his release to that of the \"Cuban five\", but the U.S. rejected this. Gross was working as a USAID subcontractor to install Internet connections for Jewish communities in Cuba. Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba in 2009 while working as a USAID subcontractor to improve communication for a civic group. He was charged with actions against the state, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in prison after a two-day trial in 2011. Despite calls for his release on humanitarian grounds, Gross remained imprisoned. Alan Gross's health deteriorated as his mother and daughter battled cancer. Cuba's Supreme Court rejected his appeal in August 2011. Despite hopes for a humanitarian visit to his sick mother in the US, it did not happen. In contrast, a Cuban Five member was granted a visit to his dying brother. Judy Gross expressed concerns about her husband's health and survival in prison. In November 2012, Alan Gross's health was a concern as his wife feared he had cancer. A lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government and his employer, DAI, for not disclosing risks. A settlement was reached with DAI in May 2013, and a judge dismissed the lawsuit against the U.S. government in May 2013. Gross's lawyers planned to appeal the dismissal. USAID agreed to pay $3.2 million to DAI in December 2014 to resolve pending claims. In late November 2012, Judy Gross urged President Obama to prioritize her husband's release from imprisonment in Cuba. The State Department called for his release on the third anniversary of his detention, and the Senate approved a resolution in support of his case. The resolution with 31 cosponsors called for the immediate release of Alan Gross from detention in Cuba. The State Department continued to prioritize his release, using diplomatic channels publicly and privately. National Security Adviser Susan Rice also urged for Gross's immediate release. In January 2014, Secretary of State Kerry sought Vatican's help to secure Alan Gross's release from Cuba. The State Department expressed concern for Gross's well-being on his birthday in May 2014. President Obama asked Uruguayan President to raise the issue with Ra\u00fal Castro in June 2014. Gross went on a hunger strike in April 2014 to protest his treatment by both governments. Alan Gross went on a hunger strike in April 2014 to protest his treatment by the Cuban and U.S. governments. His lawyer stated that Gross planned to return to his family within the year, and his health had deteriorated during his imprisonment in Cuba. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez expressed interest in resolving the issue with the U.S. without preconditions. In June 2014, Alan Gross's mother passed away from lung cancer, prompting calls for his release from Cuban imprisonment. Concerns were raised about Gross's mental state, with fears he might attempt suicide. Eventually, Cuba released Gross on humanitarian grounds in December 2014. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasts to Cuba, have been in operation since 1985 and 1990 respectively. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasts to Cuba, began in 1985 and 1990. The Broadcasting Board of Governors uses various media to reach audiences in Cuba. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting manages Radio and TV Marti from Miami, FL. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) manages Radio and TV Marti from Miami, FL. Legislation in the 104th Congress required OCB to relocate from Washington, DC to South Florida, which was completed in 1998. TV Mart\u00ed programming is broadcast 24/7 via the Internet and satellite television. In Cudjoe Key, FL, TV Mart\u00ed programming was transmitted via various platforms, including an aerostat destroyed by Hurricane Dennis. From 2004 to 2006, Commando Solo, a C-130 aircraft, was used. In 2006, contracted private aircraft and AeroMart\u00ed were utilized for broadcasts. AeroMart\u00ed transmitted live broadcasts for five days weekly until 2013 budget cuts led to its elimination in 2014. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) utilizes various web domains and anti-censorship tools to reach Internet users in Cuba. They have used SMS messaging since 2011 to push information to mobile phone users in Cuba. The OCB's website, martinoticias.com, streams Radio and TV Mart\u00ed programming 24/7 since 2013. Congress has appropriated about $770 million for broadcasting to Cuba from FY1984 to FY2014, with recent funding amounts of $27.977 million in FY2012, $26.293 million in FY2013, and an estimated $27.043 million in FY2014. The FY2015 request was for $23.130 million, with Congress ultimately appropriating $27.130 million. In FY2012, Congress appropriated $27.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, with the Administration requesting $28.475 million. The Senate recommended $28.181 million, while the House proposed $30.175 million. (Source: http://appropriations.house.gov/UploadedFiles/FY12-SFOPSCombinedReport-CSBA.pdf) In FY2012, Congress approved full funding of the Administration's $28.475 million request for broadcasting to Cuba. The BBG's actual spending was $27.977 million. For FY2013, the Administration requested $23.594 million for Cuba broadcasting, with program reductions possible due to planned streamlining and reliance on technical support from the BBG. The BBG proposed eliminating the AeroMart\u00ed platform for a savings of $2 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act would have provided $23.4 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill, S. 3241, supported reducing TV Mart\u00ed operating costs and terminating the Aeromart\u00ed contract. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill, H.R. 5857, provided $28.062 million for FY2013, $4.468 million more than the Administration's request. Congress approved a continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) in September 2012, continuing funding through March 27, 2013. In FY2013, Congress approved H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6) for FY2013 appropriations, but funding reductions due to sequestration continued. The BBG requested $23.804 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2014, a decrease from FY2013. The OCB's actual spending in FY2013 was $26.293 million, with AeroMart\u00ed flights curtailed due to sequestration. The BBG proposed program reductions for Cuba broadcasting, including eliminating AeroMart\u00ed due to cost effectiveness and Cuban government jamming. They also planned to eliminate shortwave frequencies at night, cut OCB positions, and reduce contractors. The agency will seek inter-agency agreements to utilize existing resources. The U.S. Agency for International Development and the BBG planned to use unobligated resources for Cuba democracy programs. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $28.266 million for Cuba broadcasting, while the Senate allocated $23.804 million. Ultimately, Congress approved $27.043 million for Cuba broadcasting in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure. In FY2014, the omnibus appropriations measure H.R. 3547 (P.L. 113-76) was signed into law, providing about $3.24 million above the Administration's request. For FY2015, the Administration requested $23.130 million for the OCB, anticipating a possible $5 million transfer from the ESF foreign aid spending account for Cuba democracy programs. The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2015 Department of State Appropriations Act would have allocated $28.266 million for the OCB, $5.1 million more than the request. In FY2015, Congress appropriated $27.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, which was more than the Administration's request of $23.130 million. Funds may be transferred from ESF to restore OCB program reductions. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies regarding broadcast standards. Controversies have surrounded Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, with questions about adherence to broadcast standards and funding cuts. Various government studies and audits have been conducted, showing that the audience for TV Mart\u00ed is small, with less than 2% tuning in according to telephone surveys since 2003. According to reports, less than 1% of respondents watched TV Mart\u00ed in the past week based on IBB surveys since 2003. The GAO report highlighted concerns about adherence to laws and standards, including inappropriate advertisements during OCB programming and interference with Cuban broadcasts. GAO testified on these issues in a hearing by the House Subcommittee on International Organizations in June 2009. The report criticized Radio and TV Mart\u00ed for their ineffective influence on Cuban society and politics, citing issues with broadcast standards, audience size, and Cuban government jamming. Recommendations included moving the Office of Cuba Broadcasting back to Washington and integrating it fully into the Voice of America. The GAO also examined the BBG's strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba, emphasizing the need for an analysis of the current situation in Cuba and allocation of resources based on broadcasting priorities. The GAO criticized the BBG's strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba, noting that it lacked key information and only partially addressed the required elements. This included obstacles to increasing audience size, but fell short in addressing other factors such as audience sizes, cost effectiveness of transmission methods, and alternative options for disseminating news to Cuba. The GAO report criticized the BBG's strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba, noting it lacked key information and only partially addressed required elements. In May 2012, a controversy arose over an editorial by OCB Director Carlos Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez criticizing Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega, leading to questions about OCB's editorial policy and adherence to broadcast standards. Cuba was added to the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism in 1982 due to alleged ties to terrorism and support for terrorist groups in Latin America. This designation restricts trade benefits, foreign aid, and other benefits to countries named as state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba was added to the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism in 1982. Validated licenses are required for exports to countries on the terrorism list under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act. Cuba's support for insurgents abroad ended in 1992 due to the breakup of the Soviet Union, leading to economic decline. Critics argue that retaining Cuba on the terrorism list is a Cold War holdover diverting U.S. attention from other issues. Cuba's presence on the terrorism list diverts U.S. attention from serious terrorist threats. Supporters argue there is evidence of Cuba supporting terrorism through history of backing terrorist acts and hosting members of foreign terrorist organizations. The State Department's 2013 report noted Cuba's ties to ETA and FARC, with some ETA members relocated with Spanish government cooperation. The 2013 terrorism report highlighted Cuba's support for peace negotiations between the FARC and the Colombian government, without providing weapons or training to terrorist groups. Cuba was also noted for harboring U.S. fugitives, offering housing, food, and medical care to convicted murderers and hijackers. Joanne Chesimard, aka Assata Shakur, was added to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list in May. Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, was added to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list in 2013 for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Police officer. She was part of the Black Liberation Army and escaped from prison in 1979, living underground before fleeing to Cuba in 1984. In addition to Chesimard, other U.S. fugitives wanted for fraud have reportedly fled to Cuba. William Potts, who hijacked a plane to Havana in 1984, returned to the U.S. in 2013 to face air-piracy charges after serving time in a Cuban jail. Calls for the immediate extradition of convicted felon William Morales and other fugitives from justice in Cuba to escape prosecution in the US. Cuba has returned wanted fugitives on a case by case basis, but has refused to render fugitives judged as \"political.\" Cuba has responded to US extradition requests by stating approval would be contingent upon the US. Cuba responded to U.S. extradition requests by linking approval to the return of wanted Cuban criminals, including Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch. In 2012, Cuba joined the Financial Action Task Force of South America, committing to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Cuba is set to undergo a GAFISUD mutual evaluation in 2014 to assess its compliance with FATF recommendations. The President can remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list by certifying a change in leadership and policies or by providing assurances of no support for international terrorism. Cuba can be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list by the President certifying a change in leadership and policies or providing assurances of no support for international terrorism. Other provisions of law also authorize the designation of a foreign government as a state sponsor of terrorism. The Arms Export Control Act allows Congress to block the removal of a country from the list. Another option was presented in H.R. 1917 in the 113th Congress. Section 10 of the bill aimed to revoke the Secretary of State's determination that Cuba supports international terrorism. President Obama ordered a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, emphasizing the need to focus on current threats like al Qaeda and ISIL. The Secretary of State was tasked with providing a report on Cuba's support for terrorism within six months. President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy in response to escalating numbers of fleeing Cubans, announcing that Cubans rescued at sea would be taken to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay. Despite the change, Cubans continued to flee in large numbers. In September 1994, Cuba and the United States reached a bilateral agreement to control the flow of Cuban migrants to the U.S. by boat. The agreement ensured safe and orderly migration, with the U.S. committing to a minimum of 20,000 legal Cuban migrants annually. In May 1995, another accord was reached to parole over 30,000 Cubans from Guantanamo to the U.S. while intercepting future sea migrants and returning them to Cuba. Both countries cooperated in this effort. Since the 1995 migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to Cuba. Most interdictions result in a return to Cuba, while those who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status in the U.S. under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. This \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized by some. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy for Cuban migrants in the United States has faced criticism for encouraging risky journeys and alien smuggling. The number of Cubans intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard fluctuated over the years, with various factors influencing the trends. The number of Cuban migrants intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard increased from 985 in FY2011 to 2,059 in FY2014. Factors contributing to this rise included Cuba's economic and political situation, more efficient interdiction methods by the Coast Guard, and improved communication with the Cuban Border Guard. Despite these efforts, unauthorized Cubans continue to reach the United States each year. In FY2009-FY2012, Border Patrol apprehensions of unauthorized Cubans decreased significantly compared to FY2005-FY2008. Cubans prefer land-based entry at U.S. ports of entry, especially from Mexico. The number of Cubans presenting themselves at land border ports of entry increased from 11,383 in FY2012 to 14,251 in FY2013, with a further increase in FY2014. Semi-annual U.S.-Cuban talks on implementation were held. Talks between Cuba and the United States on migration accords were suspended in 2004 but resumed in 2009 under the Obama Administration. Four rounds of talks took place until January 2011, addressing migration issues and other concerns such as the imprisonment of Alan Gross. After an 18-month break, another round of talks was held in July 2013, focusing on areas of successful cooperation in migration, aviation safety, and visa processing. The State Department emphasized the importance of meeting the goals of the accord, especially in safeguarding the lives of intending immigrants. The Cuban delegation reiterated the call for the immediate release of Alan Gross and discussed joint actions to deter illegal migration and alien smuggling. They highlighted Cuba's ratification of protocols against smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons. The delegation criticized U.S. policies like the \"wet foot/dry foot policy\" and the Cuban Adjustment Act for encouraging illegal immigration. Additional rounds of migration talks were held in January 2014 and July 2014. During talks in January and July 2014, the US and Cuba discussed cooperation on aviation security, consular document fraud, and visa processing. Cuba expressed concern about difficulties with its consular services in the US due to banking issues. Both governments agreed to enforce technical operation procedures for search and rescue operations. Cuba had suspended consular services in the US since late 2013 due to banking challenges. Cuba's diplomatic missions in the United States faced banking challenges when M&T Bank decided to stop offering services. The State Department worked with Cuba to resolve the issue, leading to two suspensions of services. Despite not finding a replacement bank, Cuba resumed consular services by mid-May 2014. In October 2012, Cuba updated its migration policy, allowing Cubans to travel abroad without an exit permit and letter of invitation. Cubans can now travel abroad with an updated passport and a visa from the destination country, without needing an exit permit. The new policy allows for up to two years of travel without losing Cuban citizenship rights. The government aims to prevent brain drain but exceptions are made for certain professionals. The policy, effective since January 14, 2013, also includes health care professionals like doctors. Thousands of Cubans lined up for updated passports under the new policy. Cuba's new travel policy allows citizens to travel abroad with an updated passport and visas without needing an exit permit. The U.S. State Department supports the change, citing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Some prominent dissidents and activists have already taken advantage of the new policy. Analysts question if the U.S. should review its policy towards Cuban migrants in light of these changes. Effective August 1, 2013, the State Department extended the validity of non-immigrant B-2 visas for Cubans to five years with multiple entries, aiming to strengthen people-to-people ties and ease travel burdens. Cuba's susceptibility to drug smuggling is mainly due to its extensive shoreline and geographic location. Cuba faces challenges with drug smuggling through high-speed boats and small aircraft, prompting concerns from Cuban officials. The government has implemented measures such as stricter penalties for traffickers, increased training for counternarcotics personnel, and cooperation with other countries on anti-drug efforts. Cuba has numerous anti-drug agreements in place, including bilateral agreements for counterdrug cooperation and policing cooperation agreements. Operation Hatchet, initiated in 1999, focuses on maritime and air interdiction to combat drug trafficking. Operation Hatchet focuses on maritime and air interdiction and recovering narcotics washed up on Cuban shores. Cuba reported interdicting 3.05 metric tons of illegal narcotics in 2012, mainly wash ups. Since 2003, Cuba has aggressively pursued an internal enforcement program against its drug market with a nationwide prevention campaign. U.S.-Cuban cooperation on anti-drug efforts has varied over the years, with increased cooperation since 1999. In 1996, Cuban authorities cooperated with the U.S. in seizing 6.6 tons of cocaine aboard a ship bound for Miami. Cuba turned over the cocaine and cooperated in the investigation and prosecution of two defendants in the U.S. Cooperation between the United States and Cuba on anti-drug efforts has increased since 1999. This includes an upgraded communications link between the Cuban Border Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the stationing of a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana. The Coast Guard shares tactical information on narcotics trafficking and responds to Cuban information on suspected smuggling vessels. Law enforcement communication has improved, especially in targeting drug trafficking at sea. Professional exchanges between experts have also taken place. Cuba and the United States have been increasing cooperation on anti-drug efforts since 1999. This includes professional exchanges between experts on maritime drug interdiction. Cuba has expressed interest in a bilateral anti-drug cooperation agreement with the United States, presenting a draft accord for review. The State Department acknowledges that such an accord could enhance counternarcotics efforts for both countries. Cooperation in real-time tactical information-sharing and improved tactics is emphasized. Increased cooperation between Cuba and the United States on anti-drug efforts, including real-time tactical information-sharing and improved tactics, could lead to more interdictions and disruptions of illegal trafficking. Positive U.S. statements regarding potential bilateral anti-drug cooperation and multilateral cooperation with Cuba were reiterated in the 2012, 2013, and 2014 INCSR reports. Senator Dianne Feinstein highlighted the usefulness of limited cooperation between the Coast Guard and Cuban authorities and recommended steps to increase counternarcotics collaboration with Cuba. The Obama Administration proposed four steps to enhance U.S. collaboration with Cuba on counternarcotics, including increasing Coast Guard presence in Havana and negotiating a bilateral agreement. Cuba faced challenges in offshore oil exploration in 2012, but potential reserves in the North Cuba Basin could be significant. Cuba has potential offshore oil reserves in the North Cuba Basin, with ongoing exploration projects involving foreign companies. If oil is found, production could begin in three to five years, potentially reducing Cuba's dependence on Venezuela for oil supplies. Cuba produced 51,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012 but consumed 171,000 barrels per day. Several foreign oil companies, including Repsol, Petronas, Gazprom, PdVSA, and Petrobras, conducted exploratory drilling off the coast of western Cuba. However, all wells were found to be not commercially viable due to geological challenges. This exploration was part of Cuba's efforts to reduce its dependence on Venezuela for oil supplies. Several foreign oil companies, including PetroVietnam, Sonangol, ONGC, Rosneft, and Zarubezhneft, had exploration agreements for offshore blocks in Cuba. After three unsuccessful wells in 2012, the Scarabeo-9 oil rig left Cuba, hindering the government's efforts to develop deepwater offshore hydrocarbon resources. Despite agreements signed in 2014, there is skepticism about the prospects for future drilling in Cuba's offshore deepwaters. In December 2012, Zarubezhneft began drilling an exploratory oil well in a north coastal block east of Havana off Cayo Coco. Due to technical problems with the rig and difficult geology, the project was halted in April 2013. Concerns were raised about Cuba's development of deepwater petroleum reserves post-2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Cuba faces challenges in disaster preparedness and coordination with the United States in case of an oil spill. Poor relations between the two countries complicate the situation. If an oil spill occurs northwest of Cuba, it could reach U.S. waters and coastal areas in Florida. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill recommended negotiating with Mexico and Cuba on drilling standards in the Gulf of Mexico. Negotiations are ongoing between the United States and Cuba, along with other countries, to establish common standards and protocols for oil spill prevention and response. Both countries are part of multilateral agreements to cooperate on potential oil spills, with regular meetings held since 2011 under the International Maritime Organization. In March 2014, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Jamaica finalized the Wider Caribbean Region Multilateral Technical Operating Procedures for Offshore Oil Pollution Response (MTOP). U.S. oil spill mitigation companies can be licensed to provide support in case of a spill. The U.S. Coast Guard is prepared for immediate response in the event of a catastrophic oil spill. Some analysts suggest easing regulatory restrictions for transferring equipment and personnel to Cuba for oil spill prevention. Interest in Cuba's offshore oil development was strong in the 112th Congress, with concerns about potential oil spills leading to various legislative initiatives, none of which were enacted. Approaches included sanctioning foreign companies involved in Cuba's oil sector, recommending a joint contingency plan with Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas, and authorizing U.S. companies to engage in oil spill prevention and clean-up activities in Cuba. Since 2000, 15 individuals, including two U.S. government officials, have been convicted in the United States. In June 2009, retired State Department employee Walter Kendall Myers and his wife Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers were arrested for spying for Cuba for three decades. They passed classified information to the Cuban government and pled guilty to the charges in November 2009. Kendall Myers received a life sentence, while Gwendolyn Myers was sentenced to 81 months. In 2006, Florida International University professor Carlos Alvarez and his wife Elsa Prieto Alvarez were convicted for spying on the Cuban exile community. Carlos Alvarez received a five-year sentence, and Elsa Prieto Alvarez received three years. In May 2003, the Bush Administration expelled 14 Cuban diplomats for monitoring and surveillance activities, including stealing information on U.S. invasion preparations for Iraq. Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Ana Montes was arrested in 2001 for spying for Cuba, supplying classified information for 16 years. She divulged names of U.S. intelligence agents and sensitive operations details. Ana Montes, a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October 2002 for spying for Cuba. In April 2013, a former USAID official, Marta Rita Velazquez, was charged with espionage for introducing Montes to the Cuban Intelligence Service in 1984. Velazquez helped Montes gain employment at the DIA. In June 2001, five members of the \"Wasp Network\" were convicted on espionage charges in Miami. The Cuban five, Cuban intelligence agents, were sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for infiltrating Cuban exile groups and trying to infiltrate U.S. military bases. Five Cuban intelligence agents were convicted on espionage charges in Miami for acting as unregistered Cuban agents and conspiracy to gather national defense information. Gerardo Hern\u00e1ndez received two life sentences for his alleged role in the deaths of four pilots of the Brothers to the Rescue group. The Cuban government vowed to work for the return of the \"Cuban five.\" In December 2008, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro offered to exchange imprisoned Cuban political dissidents for the \"Cuban five,\" but the offer was rejected by the State Department. In June 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal for a new trial for the \"Cuban five.\" Later in 2009, sentences for three of the five were reduced, but Gerardo Hern\u00e1ndez's two life terms were not reduced. The \"Cuban five\" were released from prison after serving their sentences, with time off for good behavior. Ren\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez was released in October 2011 and faced probation in the US. He was allowed to visit Cuba for family emergencies but had to renounce his US citizenship to stay in Cuba. Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of the \"Cuban five,\" was released in 2014 and returned to Cuba where he was welcomed as a hero. The remaining members, Antonio Guerrero and Ram\u00f3n Laba\u00f1ino, had potential release dates in 2017 and 2024. President Obama announced the release of the three Cuban spies in exchange for Cuba releasing an important US intelligence asset, Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, who had been imprisoned in Cuba for nearly two decades. Sarraff Trujillo had helped the FBI dismantle Cuban spy networks in the US. In 2012, Cuba linked the release of the \"Cuban five\" to Alan Gross, a U.S. government subcontractor detained in 2009. The U.S. rejected the linkage, calling for Gross's release on humanitarian grounds. On December 17, 2014, the remaining Cuban spies were released in exchange for a U.S. intelligence asset. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) provides funding for Cuba democracy and human rights projects and broadcasting for FY2014.
