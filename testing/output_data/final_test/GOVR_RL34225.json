Corruption within Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), enables this illicit trade, providing immunity from law enforcement. Smugglers exploit synergistic links between different forms of trafficking, using corrupt routes with minimal resistance. The presence of transnational crime in Burma's border regions is facilitated by corruption and lax law enforcement. These areas share similarities with \"ungoverned spaces\" due to difficult terrain, poorly patrolled borders, and ethnic tensions hindering government control. Cease-fire agreements have not significantly improved the situation in these regions. Cease-fires in Burma's border regions have given transnational crime groups near autonomy, evading Burmese law. Congress is active in U.S. policy towards Burma due to issues of transnational crime, drug production, and human trafficking. The 110th Congress aimed to strengthen sanctions against Burma in response to the government's crackdown on protests in 2007. In response to Burma's crackdown on protests in 2007 and the humanitarian response to tropical cyclone Nargis in 2008, Congress passed the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, imposing sanctions on SPDC officials and prohibiting the indirect import of Burmese gems. The 111th Congress continued oversight of U.S. policy towards Burma, focusing on criminal activities such as drug trade and human trafficking. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton initiated a review of U.S.-Burma relations in 2009, with the conclusions highlighting the need for policy adjustments. In September 2009, a policy review highlighted direct dialogue with Burmese authorities on international crime issues, including compliance with U.N. arms sanctions and counternarcotics. Various armed groups in Burma have criminal networks spanning from India to Malaysia and China, linked to ethnic insurgencies. These criminal elements pose a transnational security threat for Burma and the region. The UWSA is the largest criminal group in the region, operating along the China and Thailand borders with a militia of 16,000 to 20,000 members. Other criminal groups like the 14K Triad also operate in the country. These organizations are nearly immune from interference due to collusion with military and political officials. This collusion is part of SPDC efforts to coopt ethnic groups and avoid hostilities, leading to the influence of organized crime in Burma and the region being difficult to reduce. The U.S. State Department and observers note widespread corruption among Burmese officials, especially in border areas, involving smuggling, money laundering, and cronyism. Burma lacks specific anti-corruption laws and ranks as the third-most corrupt country globally. Weak implementation of anti-money laundering controls is a root issue. Burma's weak implementation of anti-money laundering controls allows narcotics traffickers and criminals to use Burmese financial institutions. High-level officials and military officers have financially benefitted from transnational crime organizations, with reports suggesting military involvement in opium poppy cultivation in Shan state. Some local Tatmadaw units in Shan state reportedly work in poppy fields, collect high taxes from traffickers, and receive fees for military protection. Burma has not indicted any military official above the rank of colonel for drug-related corruption. The SPDC allows traffickers to invest in domestic businesses, depositing earnings into military-controlled banks. Military officers also deposit crime-related money in foreign bank accounts. Burmese financial institutions are used for money laundering by organized drug groups. The Secretary of the Treasury reported that Burmese government officials were suspected of involvement in counterfeiting U.S. currency and possible links between drug trafficking and official corruption. Steven Law, under U.S. financial sanctions since 2008, allegedly supports the Burmese junta, facilitates drug trafficking, and launders drug profits through Asia World Company Ltd. Steven Law, under U.S. financial sanctions since 2008, supports the Burmese junta, facilitates drug trafficking, and launders drug profits through Asia World Company Ltd. Burmese contraband, including opium, methamphetamine, illegal timber, endangered wildlife, and trafficked humans, is mainly trafficked to China and Thailand, with other destinations including India, Laos, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, South Korea, and Cambodia. The United States is also a destination for Burmese-trafficked methamphetamine pills, and there are reports of the U.S. being among the world's largest importers of illegal wildlife. Organized crime recruits can be found in urban ghettos and impoverished rural areas. According to the Asian Development Bank, 27% of Burma's population live below the poverty line, with peasant farmers, rural hunters, and other poor serving at the base of Burma's international crime network by growing opium poppy crops, poaching endangered species, and being trafficked for various illegal activities. Many victims of transnational crime in Burma are the poor, becoming commodities themselves as they are trafficked for purposes such as child soldiers or sexual exploitation. Burma is party to all three major United Nations international drug control treaties. Burma, located in the \"Golden Triangle\" of narcotics trafficking, aims to end all production and trafficking of illegal drugs by 2014. Despite this goal, analysts doubt the country will become drug-free by 2015. Burma is a top producer of opium, heroin, and methamphetamine, generating $1-2 billion annually in exports. Drug trafficking in Burma is linked to the spread of HIV and AIDS in the region. The drug trade in Burma's border areas poses a risk of clashes between the government, rebel groups, and neighboring countries. Cease-fire groups may break agreements with the government to protect their drug territories. Ethnic rebels are reportedly using drug proceeds to fund their paramilitary forces, leading to a military campaign by the Burmese Army against minority groups. Thai officials report a spike in heroin and methamphetamine sales in the region. The drug trade in Burma's border areas poses a risk of clashes between the government, rebel groups, and neighboring countries. Ethnic rebels are selling drugs to expand their weapons arsenals and prepare for conflict. Tension between Burma and Thailand due to illicit drug flow. Thailand's renewed war on drugs raises concerns among human rights activists. Burma is a major producer of illicit opium and heroin, accounting for 80% of Southeast Asia's heroin production. Burma is a major producer of illicit opium and heroin, supplying 80% of Southeast Asia's heroin. Poppy cultivation has decreased, leading to higher prices. The opiate market's future in Burma may depend on developments in other opium-producing regions like Afghanistan. The UWSA's 2005 commitment to halt opium and heroin activities under international pressure has been questioned, with warnings that alternative livelihood sources are needed to sustain the ban. Opium production in Burma is a key source of income for small-scale farmers facing food security shortages. A UNODC study found that households involved in poppy cultivation earned around $700 annually, compared to $750 for non-poppy growing households. In Shan State, 28% of poppy-growing households reported food insecurity due to rice shortages in 2009. Opium production in Burma is shifting to areas controlled by different ethnic groups and the Tatmadaw. The UWSA may be organizing Wa poppy farmers to migrate to provinces where cultivation is allowed. Burma is a major producer of methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs, mainly in insurgent-controlled border areas. This rise in synthetic drug trade is partly due to the UWSA's ban on opium. The UWSA's ban on opium cultivation in Burma has led to a rise in methamphetamine production and trafficking. This has caused Burma to become one of the world's largest producers of synthetic drugs. There are concerns that international aid for relief efforts may have been used as a cover for smuggling illegal drugs into the country. Burma has been designated as a \"Tier 3\" state in every Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, indicating non-compliance with minimum standards for combating human trafficking. Laws exist to prohibit sex and labor trafficking, but enforcement is arbitrary. The State Department reports that laws against human trafficking in Burma are arbitrarily enforced by the SPDC, with high-level officials often not fully investigated. Victims, including women and girls from ethnic minority groups, are trafficked internally and regionally for sexual exploitation. Junta officials are directly involved in trafficking for forced labor and child soldiers. Incidents like the discovery of 54 dead Burmese migrants in a seafood truck headed to Thailand highlight the risks of migrant smuggling. In September 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a report on goods produced by child labor or forced labor, including Burma among 58 countries implicated in 14 production sectors. Burma's natural resources, such as forests and minerals, are illegally trafficked to destination states. Global Witness estimates that 98% of Burma's timber exports to China from 2001 to 2004 were illegally logged, totaling around $200 million annually. The illegal timber trade in the region involves complex patronage and corruption systems, with exotic wildlife like tigers being sold for high prices in countries like China and Thailand. The illegal trade of valuable wildlife and gems, including rubies, sapphires, and jade, is used as currency for drugs and laundering contraband proceeds. Burmese gems are a significant foreign currency earner, with the junta heavily involved in both legal and illegal trade. The regime controls mining operations and sales through official auctions and private sales by military officers, evading U.S. sanctions by concealing gem origins. The illegal trade of Burmese gemstones involves concealing their origin to buyers. Only 3% of rubies entering the US are claimed to be from Burma, despite 90% originating there. Small arms like AK-47s are smuggled into Burma, with reports linking them to Karen guerrillas and the Shan State Army. The government is implicated in distributing weapons to child soldiers. Other contraband markets include trafficking in cigarettes, cars, CDs, pornography, antiques, religious items, fertilizer, and counterfeit documents. In April 2008, Japan's NHK reported that Burma has been importing multiple-launch rockets from North Korea, raising international concerns about potential complicity of Burmese government officials. Observers speculate that Burma seeks to upgrade its artillery for protection against external threats, violating U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea. Western intelligence officials have suspected the regime's interest in conventional weapons trade since the resumption of diplomatic relations between North Korea and Burma in 2007. Intelligence officials suspect Burma of aiming to achieve military autarky by developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, following North Korea's model. In 2008, the State Department flagged Burma as a money laundering risk due to its underdeveloped financial sector. FATF designated Burma as a Non-Cooperative Country for deficient anti-money laundering provisions in 2001. U.S. Treasury's FinCEN advised enhanced scrutiny on financial transactions related to Burma in 2002. Myanmar Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank were implicated in money laundering of illicit narcotics in 2003. Burma was flagged as a major money laundering concern by the Secretary of the Treasury in 2003, leading to additional countermeasures in 2004. Two banks, Myanmar Mayflower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank, were implicated in laundering illicit narcotics proceeds. The U.S. government and international bodies continue to monitor informal money transfer networks like \"hundi\" or \"hawala,\" which are used for legitimate remittances but lack transparency and regulation. Hawala-like techniques have been used globally for money laundering in criminal activities. Burma faces sanctions due to its involvement in narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and other criminal activities. The country is listed as a major drug-producing state and has been indicted for drug trafficking and money laundering. The U.S. has taken actions against Burma under various legislative authorities to address issues such as democracy, human rights, and international crime. Burma, designated as a Tier 3 state for severe trafficking in persons, faces sanctions including restrictions on U.S. assistance and financial support due to its involvement in narcotics trafficking and money laundering. Special measures are in place to regulate and monitor financial flows in the country. The United States has implemented special measures to regulate financial flows in Burma, including Treasury advisories and specific measures listed under 31 U.S.C. 5318A. While there are no sanctions specifically targeting Burma's involvement in wildlife trade, the Block Burmese JADE Act of 2007 aims to restrict imports of gems and hardwoods from the country. Despite over a decade of sanctions, analysts believe they have had limited impact due to factors such as uneven application of sanctions by other countries and Burma's thriving natural gas industry. The European Union and Japan, booming natural gas industry revenue for SPDC, ASEAN's reluctance for sanctions, Burma's historical isolation, China's support, sanctions contributing to black markets and trafficking, US assisting neighboring countries in combating trafficking. The United States is working to combat transnational crime in Burma by training law enforcement and border control officials in neighboring countries. Funding for anti-crime assistance programs in the region has been declining, with no allocation for combating organized and gang-related crime. Despite Burma's progress in reducing opium poppy cultivation, U.S. policies have not been effective in combating transnational crime originating from Burma. In light of recent junta violence in Burma, there is growing interest in re-evaluating U.S. policy towards the country. Policy makers are considering increasing humanitarian aid, utilizing ASEAN for political pressure, involving India to prevent regional instability, and collaborating with China and Thailand to address transnational crime along Burma's borders."
