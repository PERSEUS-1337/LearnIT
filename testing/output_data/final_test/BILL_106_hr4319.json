    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of 2000\". It includes findings related to the situation in East Timor. The Congress finds that around 100,000 East Timorese refugees are still in West Timor, unable to return to East Timor due to militia forces supported by the Indonesian army. Many refugees have died from preventable illnesses, while others live in constant danger and face the threat of forced resettlement. Elements of the Indonesian army have attempted to infiltrate armed militia members into East Timor, planning a militia invasion. Border attacks by militia groups pose a threat to peace and stability in the region. Much of East Timor's infrastructure was destroyed in the violence of 1999. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 East Timorese perished from Indonesia's occupation and violence in 1999. Thousands were killed by Indonesian army elements and militia. Justice for the victims remains uncertain. The prospects for justice for the victims of the violence in East Timor in 1999 are unclear. 80% of the population is unemployed, and efforts are being made to rebuild the country with the help of United States funds and international peacekeeping forces. The Indonesian government has committed to ending military support for militias and establishing a fair mechanism. Efforts to bring justice for human rights violations in East Timor have been resisted by elements in the military and bureaucracy, despite Indonesia's commitment to ending support for militias. The Congress urges the US Government to use diplomatic and economic means to support the safe return of East Timorese from West Timor, end border incidents and violence by militias and Indonesian armed forces, seek justice for 1999 violence victims, promote rapid reconstruction using local personnel, and increase employment opportunities for East Timorese in reconstruction efforts. SEC. 4. Prohibition on military relations and assistance to the armed forces of Indonesia until the Government of Indonesia ensures the territorial integrity of East Timor, the security of refugees, and brings perpetrators of crimes against humanity to justice. SEC. 5. Recognition of US armed forces assisting in the international peacekeeping operation in East Timor. The Congress recognizes and salutes US Armed Forces members who assisted in the international peacekeeping operation in East Timor."
