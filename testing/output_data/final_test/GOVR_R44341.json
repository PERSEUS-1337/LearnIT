    "content": "EPA issued emissions guidelines to limit CO2 emissions from existing power plants under the CAA, following a Supreme Court ruling that GHGs are considered air pollutants endangering public health. This was part of a settlement agreement to regulate GHG emissions from electric generating units. EPA also finalized standards for GHG emissions from new fossil-fuel-fired EGUs alongside the CPP. President Obama pledged to reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, with a further goal of a 26% to 28% reduction by 2025 as the U.S. national contribution to global GHG reductions under the 2015 Paris Agreement. The agreement requires countries to submit GHG emission reduction pledges, with 165 pledges submitted as of April 27, 2017. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, with the United States as a Party. The Paris Agreement (PA) entered into force on November 4, 2016, with the United States as a Party. The U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is registered in the interim Registry of NDCs. Fossil-fueled EGUs contribute to 29% of U.S. GHG emissions, making it challenging to reduce emissions without addressing these sources. Figure 1 shows U.S. GHG emissions from 1990 to 2015, with emissions increasing until 2007, decreasing in 2008 and 2009 due to various factors, and fluctuating since 2010 without surpassing 2009 levels. The figure also compares recent U.S. GHG emissions to 2020 and 2025 goals. The United States is making progress towards the 2020 and 2025 emission goals, with GHG levels in 2015 already 11% below 2005 levels. The electricity generation sector contributed 29% of all U.S. GHG emissions in 2015, with CO2 emissions accounting for 99% of that total. CO2 emissions from electricity generation have generally decreased since 2007. EPA had already taken steps before the promulgation of this rule. Prior to the promulgation of this rule, EPA had already set GHG emission standards for light-duty and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles under Section 202 of the CAA. On-road motor vehicles accounted for 23% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2015. GHG standards for light-duty vehicles started in MY2012, with emissions gradually decreasing each year through MY2025. Heavier-duty vehicles began emission reductions in MY2014, ranging from 6% to 23% depending on the engine and vehicle type. The new emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, implemented in MY2018, require reductions of 6% to 23%. The standards cover model years 2018-2027 for certain trailers and model years 2021-2027 for semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses, and work trucks. These standards are expected to lower CO2 emissions by approximately 1.1 billion metric tons over the life of the vehicles. Additionally, the promulgation of standards for motor vehicles triggered Clean Air Act requirements for new major stationary sources of emissions to obtain permits for their GHG emissions and install Best Available Control Technology. The Supreme Court upheld GHG permitting requirements for stationary sources in June 2014, limiting them to \"major\" facilities based on emissions of conventional pollutants. EPA also established GHG emission standards for new oil and gas sources and municipal solid waste landfills in 2016. President Trump's Executive Order 13783 requires EPA to review methane emission standards for oil and gas sources, which are being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals. EPA announced a reconsideration of fugitive emissions monitoring and other requirements for oil and gas methane standards, proposing a two-year compliance date stay. EPA cited Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act for authority to promulgate the Clean Power Plan, requiring states to submit plans for existing stationary sources to impose \"standards of performance\" for air pollutants meeting specific criteria. The Clean Air Act Section 111(d) prohibits EPA from regulating an air pollutant if it is already regulated under NAAQS or as a hazardous air pollutant. CO2 is not regulated under these provisions. Controversy exists over EPA's authority regarding Section 112 criterion due to differing House and Senate versions in the 1990 CAA amendments. The House amendment to the Clean Air Act is ambiguous regarding EPA's authority to regulate power plants under Section 111(d) for CO2, despite regulation under Section 112 for hazardous air pollutants. EPA clarified that the exclusion under Section 112 does not prevent regulation under Section 111(d) for non-HAP emissions. The House amendment to the Clean Air Act is ambiguous regarding EPA's authority to regulate power plants under Section 111(d) for CO2, despite regulation under Section 112 for hazardous air pollutants. EPA clarified that the exclusion under Section 112 does not prevent regulation under Section 111(d) for non-HAP emissions. EPA's interpretation concluded that source categories 'regulated under section 112' are not regulated by CAA section 112 with respect to all pollutants, but only with respect to HAP. The Senate's amendment excludes air pollutants regulated under Section 112 from Section 111(d) regulation, which is consistent with EPA regulating power plants for CO2 under Section 111(d). The EPA has used its Section 111(d) authority to regulate emissions of methane and plants for CO2. In 2005, the Clean Air Mercury Rule established a cap-and-trade system for mercury under Section 111(d), but it was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2008. EPA was found to be obligated to promulgate standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Section 112. In 1996, EPA used Section 111(d) to regulate emissions from large landfills, setting emission limits and control equipment requirements. EPA also revised guidelines for existing landfills in 2016. Additionally, EPA used Section 111(d) for emission guidelines for municipal waste combustors, which were later superseded by a rule to comply with Section 129 of the Clean Air Act. EPA adopted emission guidelines for acid mist from sulfuric acid production units, fluoride emissions from phosphate fertilizer plants, total reduced sulfur emissions from kraft pulp mills, and fluoride emissions from primary aluminum plants under Section 111(d). Additionally, six rules were promulgated to implement Section 111(d) in conjunction with the requirements of CAA Section 129. EPA also finalized standards for new fossil-fuel-fired power plants under Section 111(b) on the same day as the CPP rule. EPA's adoption of NSPSs for new fossil-fueled power plants for CO2 triggered Section 111(d)'s applicability for existing fossil-fueled power plants for CO2. EPA has no authority to set Section 111(d) performance standards for existing sources if there are no NSPSs for new sources in the same category. The CPP rule for existing power plants relies on the NSPS rule, and a court decision against the NSPS rule could undermine the legal basis of the CPP rule. EPA is currently reviewing the NSPS rule under Executive Order 13783. The EPA is reviewing the NSPS rule, and it is unclear what actions they will take. The term \"standards of performance\" is defined in CAA Section 111 as emission limits achievable through the best system of emission reduction. EPA must determine the best system of emission reduction that is adequately demonstrated before setting standards. In the CPP rule, EPA determined the BSER for existing power plants based on efficiency improvements, generation shifts, and renewable generating capacity to set CO2 emission performance rates. Different approach used for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants. Courts have expanded on CAA Section 111 definition of \"standards of performance\" and EPA's interpretation. EPA's final rule for existing electricity generators under CAA Section 111 establishes national CO2 emission performance rates, guided by Chevron deference. The rule does not set a future level of CO2 emissions but focuses on uniform CO2 emission rates per megawatt-hour. The final rule for existing electricity generators under CAA Section 111 establishes national CO2 emission performance rates, measured in pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour of electricity generation. States have the flexibility to choose how to comply with the rule, and the actual emissions will depend on their actions and electricity generation levels. EPA's projections of CO2 emissions resulting from the final rule are compared with historical emissions from 1990-2015. The final rule under CAA Section 111 establishes CO2 emission performance rates for existing electricity generators. States have flexibility in compliance, with projected reductions of 32% in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The Energy Information Administration also estimated a 36% decrease in CO2 emissions by 2030 with the CPP in place. CO2 emissions in the electricity sector are projected to decrease by 22% in 2030 compared to 2005 levels due to market forces, state and federal regulations, technological innovation, and federal tax incentives. The electric power industry is rapidly changing with the retirement of coal-fired power plants, replaced by natural gas-fired and renewable generation, leading to a decline in greenhouse gas emissions. Market forces such as the abundance of low-priced natural gas and advancements in renewable power have played a significant role in this transition. The electric power industry has seen a significant decline in CO2 emissions from 2005 to 2016, with a 25% reduction. This decrease is attributed to state and federal regulations, technological innovations like high efficiency gas turbines, and federal tax incentives for wind and solar generation. The reduction in emissions represents 77% of the expected reduction by 2030 under the CPP. Governors are directed to submit state-specific plans to further reduce emissions. The final rule under the CPP requires governors to submit state-specific plans to EPA outlining how they will meet compliance obligations for CO2 emissions at affected electric generating units. Approximately 3,000 EGUs at 1,100 facilities are affected by the rule, with varying numbers per state. Vermont and the District of Columbia were not assigned emission rate goals as they did not have affected EGUs. In the final rule of the Clean Power Plan, states were required to submit plans to EPA outlining how they would meet CO2 emission goals. Vermont and the District of Columbia were exempt from emission rate goals as they did not have affected EGUs. Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico were also exempt from submitting state plans due to lack of information. States had to submit initial or final plans by September 6, 2016, with the option to request an extension until September 6, 2018. EPA would address requirements for these jurisdictions at a later time. States have key decisions to make when crafting their state plans for the Clean Power Plan, including choosing between emission rate or mass-based targets. Trading systems must use the same metric, and there are two types of state plans: \"emission standards\" and \"state measures.\" The deadlines for plan submission are currently stayed due to litigation. The Clean Power Plan offers states two approaches for their plans: an \"emission standards\" approach or a \"state measures\" approach. States can also submit multi-state plans with the same deadlines. The final rule establishes national CO2 emission performance rates for affected EGUs. The Clean Power Plan establishes national CO2 emission performance rates for affected EGUs, including fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units and stationary combustion turbines. EPA compiled 2012 CO2 emissions and electricity generation data from each affected EGU in each state, divided the states into three regions, and applied three \"building blocks\" to the aggregated regional data. EPA applied three \"building blocks\" to aggregated regional data: heat rate improvements for coal-fired EGUs, increased NGCC generation displacing coal generation, and projected annual increases in renewable energy generation. This resulted in annual CO2 emission performance rates for steam and NGCC units in each region. EPA compared the rates and selected the least impactful option. EPA used national CO2 emission performance rates to calculate state-specific emission rate targets based on each state's baseline fossil fuel generation mix. The 2030 emission rate targets for each state were determined by multiplying the percentage of steam and NGCC generation by the corresponding national CO2 emission performance rates. Table 2 shows the 2030 targets, 2012 baselines, and required percentage reductions for each state. The EPA used different formulas to calculate the 2012 baselines in the proposed and final rules for state-specific emission rate targets. The final rule baseline included CO2 emissions from affected EGUs divided by electricity generated, while the proposed rule baseline also included \"at-risk\" nuclear power and renewable energy generation. This often resulted in lower baselines in the proposed rule compared to the final rule, making it problematic to compare percentage rate reductions between the two. In the final rule, Washington's 2012 baseline increased by 107% to 1,556 lbs. CO2/MWh. EPA converted emission rate targets to mass-based targets by multiplying the emission rate target by the state's 2012 CO2 generation baseline. Excess renewable energy generation was determined to achieve emission rate targets. EPA selected the least stringent regional CO2 performance rate as the national standard. The EPA calculated excess CO2 emissions from lower-emitting generation opportunities not needed for compliance, allocating them to states based on their 2012 generation. This increased some states' 2030 targets above their 2012 baselines. Renewable energy allocation was based on each state's 2012 share of affected EGU generation. For example, Florida received 8% of the excess renewable energy due to its 8% share of affected EGU generation in 2012. The final rule established emission rate and emission targets for three areas of Indian country: the Navajo Nation, the Ute Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, and the Fort Mojave tribe. The targets are based on specific facilities in each area. The EPA finalized emission rate targets for three areas of Indian country: the Navajo Nation, the Ute Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, and the Fort Mojave tribe. Tribes have the option to submit their own plan to meet the targets, or EPA will establish a plan if necessary. Additionally, EPA proposed a federal plan to regulate affected EGUs in Indian country areas that do not submit satisfactory state implementation plans. The EPA finalized emission rate targets for Indian lands, with the option for tribes to submit their own plans or EPA will establish one. President Trump's Executive Order 13783 led to the withdrawal of the proposed federal plan for EGUs in Indian lands. If the final rule is upheld, a new federal plan may be developed if tribes do not submit their own plans. States would not receive credit for emission reduction measures already taken, with decisions on credits for power companies left to states developing implementation plans. The final rule on CO2 emissions allows states to develop their own implementation plans. EPA used 2012 data to set emission targets. States that took action before 2012 may have an advantage in meeting goals. Some stakeholders argue the 2012 demarcation is unfair to states with prior investments in low-carbon technology. Several U.S. states have implemented greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction measures, with the most aggressive actions taken by a coalition of states in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic regions, and California. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and California's cap-and-trade program are key examples. California's cap covers multiple GHGs from various sectors, while RGGI applies to CO2 emissions from power plants. States have flexibility in meeting emission targets, with EPA allowing for individual state plans. States can establish new programs or collaborate with others to meet emission targets. California extended its cap-and-trade program through 2030 with AB 398, while RGGI states agreed to extend their program with additional emission reductions. Virginia has also taken recent actions in this regard. Virginia has released a draft proposal of emission reduction regulations to potentially join the regional partnership. The controversy surrounding the CPP involves the roles of individual power plants and other actors in emission reductions. \"Outside-the-fence\" actions are crucial in establishing national CO2 emission performance rates and state-specific targets. The final rule on emission reduction regulations emphasizes the increase in renewable energy generation and decrease in fossil-fuel-fired electricity generation. Building block 4, focusing on energy efficiency improvements, was omitted from the proposed rule. New EGUs are treated differently under rate-based and mass-based plans, with states having the option to include new fossil-fuel-fired sources in their emission reduction plans. The degree of outside-the-fence emission reductions used will depend on state policies and requirements implemented through their plans. EPA's final rule on emission reduction regulations allows for mass-based emission targets with new source projections for emissions trading. New NGCC units cannot directly adjust state emission rates but can decrease rates if replacing coal-fired EGUs. EPA modified treatment of nuclear power in the final rule, excluding \"at risk\" nuclear power from state emission rate calculations. The final rule on emission reduction regulations by EPA excludes \"at-risk\" nuclear power from state emission rate calculations, as well as under-construction nuclear power capacity. This decision could impact emission rate targets in certain states like Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The EPA's final rule on emission reduction regulations excludes demand-side energy efficiency improvements from national CO2 emission performance rate calculations. States can still choose to use EE improvement activities to meet their targets, including a voluntary program for investments in EE programs in low-income communities. In the final rule, EPA allows states to use \"qualified biomass\" to meet reduction requirements, defined as a method to control CO2 levels. Additional accounting and reporting are required if states opt for this approach. The Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) is a voluntary program that complements the CPP, encouraging states to support energy efficiency and renewable energy projects before CPP compliance obligations in 2022. States participating in the CEIP need to include specific design elements in their final plans. EPA established the CEIP framework in the CPP final rule in 2015 and issued a proposed rule in 2016 with additional details and altered eligibility requirements in response to Executive Order 13783. EPA withdrew the CPP for review and potential revision. The CEIP, established in the CPP 2015 final rule, awards credits to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in low-income communities. Credits can be emission rate credits or allowances, sold or used by emission sources to comply with state-specific requirements. Renewable energy projects receive credits for every two MWh generated, while EE projects in low-income communities receive double credits. EPA withdrew the CEIP 2016 proposed rule on April 3, 2017. The CEIP, established in the CPP 2015 final rule, awards credits to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in low-income communities. EE projects in low-income communities would receive double credits for every two MWh of avoided electricity generation. EPA would match up to 300 million short tons in credits during the CEIP program life, with states borrowing from their compliance targets to generate credits. EPA's 2015 final rule differed from the 2014 proposed rule, with a key change being the establishment of national CO2 credits. EPA's 2014 proposed rule established national CO2 emission performance rates for fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units and stationary combustion turbines. The final rule differed by using regional-level data to create regional CO2 emission performance rates, leading to state-specific targets. EPA modified its target creation methodology in the final rule, including changes to building blocks. The final rule for CO2 emissions established state-specific targets using regional-level data and modified the target creation methodology. States have flexibility in meeting their targets through various mechanisms, with compliance starting in 2022. EPA cannot enforce the rule due to a Supreme Court stay, and additional compliance options are available through state plans. The final rule for CO2 emissions set a deadline of September 6, 2016, for states to submit a State Implementation Plan to EPA. States could request up to two additional years for submission by addressing three components: plan approach, need for more time, and public engagement. The final rule for CO2 emissions set a deadline of September 6, 2016, for states to submit a State Implementation Plan to EPA, with the possibility of requesting up to two additional years for submission. In light of a stay, near-term deadlines lack legal effect, and if the rule is upheld or remanded back to EPA, initial compliance deadlines would likely be extended. The interim compliance period for the rule begins in 2022 and runs through 2029, with three separate steps and interim goals for affected EGUs to meet CO2 emission performance rates or follow an EPA-approved emissions reduction trajectory. EPA would review final plans to determine their approvability. The final rule for CO2 emissions sets a deadline for states to submit a State Implementation Plan to EPA by September 6, 2016, with the possibility of extension. Compliance with the state's final goal is required by 2030, with incremental emission reduction measures recognized in state plans. Measures installed after 2012 can be eligible under the final rule, with incentives for emission reductions in 2020 and 2021 under the CEIP. EPA would provide credits against CPP requirements for these measures. The EPA would provide credits against CPP requirements for wind and solar projects that generate electricity in 2020 and 2021. Double credits would be given for energy efficiency measures that reduce electricity consumption in low-income communities. If a state fails to submit a satisfactory plan by the deadline, EPA has the authority to prescribe a federal implementation plan. The EPA withdrew the CPP on October 23, 2015, as directed by Executive Order 13783. If upheld in court, EPA would need to re-propose a FIP for states that fail to submit an approvable plan. FIPs would require compliance by individual EGUs in the affected state, setting emission rates or limits. The federal plan's stringency would match the national CO2 emission performance rates in the CPP, with a trading program for affected EGUs to meet limits. Allowances would be allocated based on historical emissions for a mass-based program. The EPA intends to allocate allowances to individual EGUs based on their historical emissions during 2010-2012 for a federal trading program. They are leaning towards a mass-based approach for FIPs, as it is easier to implement for industry and the agency. This decision aims to enhance consistency, achieve economies of scale, ensure efficient administration, and simplify compliance planning. The EPA has extensive experience with mass-based trading programs, including the Acid Rain Program and the Nitrogen Oxides Budget Trading Program. States with FIPs could still participate in the program by submitting their own plans for approval. States could also take delegation of administrative aspects of the federal plan or submit partial state plans. States could become primary implementers by submitting partial state plans to take over the implementation of a portion of a federal plan, such as replacing allowance-distribution provisions. States under a federal plan can adopt complementary measures to facilitate compliance and lower costs for power generators and consumers. The deadline for states to submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA for the Clean Power Plan was September 6, 2016, but enforcement was stayed due to litigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed to hold the case in abeyance while the EPA conducts further review. The EPA agreed to hold the case in abeyance while conducting a review required by Executive Order 13783. On October 10, 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan, citing a change in legal interpretation of Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Public hearings on the proposal were held in November 2017. The court extended the abeyance of the litigation while the EPA proceeds with the repeal. The proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan argues against using outside-the-fence-line measures to reduce CO2 emissions, stating that only measures applied directly to individual sources of pollution are authorized by Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. After the public comment period, a repeal of the CPP could be promulgated, requiring a statement of basis and purpose, and an explanation of any major changes from the proposal. The promulgated repeal of the Clean Power Plan must include a response to significant comments, criticisms, and new data submitted during the comment period. The repeal cannot be based on information not in the docket at the time of promulgation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit may reverse any action found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with law. The agency did not propose to repeal the GHG \"endangerment finding.\" The EPA did not propose to repeal the GHG \"endangerment finding\" in relation to the Clean Power Plan. They issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to gather information on potentially replacing the CPP. The agency must consider cost in developing emission guidelines for existing sources of pollution. Public comments on the notice will be accepted for 60 days. The EPA must consider cost in developing emission guidelines for existing sources of pollution. Regulations permit states to consider the remaining useful life of existing sources. The CPP and its repeal are economically significant rules subject to E.O. 12866, which requires a cost-benefit analysis. EPA prepared a new Regulatory Impact Analysis for the CPP, an economically significant rule subject to E.O. 12866. The cost of the rule depends on states' approach to compliance, with mass-based costs generally lower than rate-based costs. EPA estimated annual compliance costs for the mass-based approach to be $1.4 billion in 2020, $3.0 billion in 2025, and $5.1 billion in 2030, while rate-based costs were $2.5 billion in 2020, $1.0 billion in 2025, and $8.4 billion in 2030. States have flexibility in compliance methods beyond these illustrative cost estimates. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan, with mass-based costs lower than rate-based costs. Compliance may involve capital investments, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and other actions. Studies by industry groups projected significant cost increases and electricity price hikes in multiple states. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan, with mass-based costs lower than rate-based costs. Studies projected significant cost increases and electricity price hikes in multiple states. The National Mining Association projected sharp increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas due to the rule, with a cumulative increase in wholesale electricity costs of $214 billion between 2022 and 2030. Others argue that it is too early to arrive at cost estimates, as much would depend on state decisions and projections of energy costs. EPA revised its estimates of the costs and benefits of the rule in the proposed repeal, citing monetized climate benefits of $20 billion in 2030 and air pollution health co-benefits of $12 billion to $34 billion. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan, with mass-based costs lower than rate-based costs. Studies projected significant cost increases and electricity price hikes in multiple states. The National Mining Association projected sharp increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas due to the rule, with a cumulative increase in wholesale electricity costs of $214 billion between 2022 and 2030. EPA revised its estimates of the costs and benefits of the rule in the proposed repeal, citing monetized climate benefits of $20 billion in 2030 and air pollution health co-benefits of $12 billion to $34 billion. The agency used global estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) to estimate the value of climate benefits expected under the CPP. The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from CO2 emission changes, including net changes in agricultural productivity and human health, property damage from increased flood risk, and changes in energy system costs. EPA has developed a set of new SCC values that resulted in notably different estimates of the monetary value of changes in CO2 emissions. The air pollution health co-benefits of the CPP reflect reduced exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and ozone. The health co-benefit estimate for the Clean Power Plan included reductions in premature fatalities and monetized estimates for the contiguous United States. The estimated compliance costs were expected to yield net benefits of $24 billion to $49 billion in 2030. Other co-benefits such as reduced morbidity from exposure to nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide were not monetized in the 2015 RIA. EPA did not quantify pollution effects on ecosystems or visibility. The EPA defined the benefits of repealing a rule as avoiding costs and compliance costs, while the costs include forgone reductions in emissions and climate benefits. The benefits and costs of the repeal were estimated based on power sector modeling conducted in 2015 with methodological changes applied. The EPA reported benefits and costs of the proposed repeal in 2030, with benefits ranging from $25 billion to $33 billion and costs ranging from $19 billion to $56 billion. Qualitatively different conclusions were drawn from the analysis, showing net benefits in two-thirds of comparisons. The EPA reported benefits and costs of the proposed repeal in 2030, with benefits ranging from $25 billion to $33 billion and costs ranging from $19 billion to $56 billion. Roughly one-third of comparisons in the primary analysis showed net costs of the repeal. Changes in the power sector since 2015 may impact the projected emissions baseline and therefore the benefits and costs of the CPP. EPA will update power sector modeling and publish updated estimates before finalizing the repeal. EPA also estimated benefits and costs using more recent power sector projections in the Annual Energy Outlook. The EPA proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan (CPP) using more recent power sector projections from the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). The AEO 2017 projections showed lower CO2 emissions without the CPP, resulting in lower estimated compliance costs and benefits. However, EPA noted that the estimates using AEO 2017 are not directly comparable to the 2015 estimates due to differences in accounting treatments. The EPA's 2015 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) showed positive net benefits, with billions of dollars in benefits outweighing costs. Comparisons of repealing the CPP had mixed results, with some showing net benefits and others showing net costs. Different tallies were used to compare the monetized benefits and costs of the repeal, with varying conclusions based on the level of forgone health co-benefits considered. The EPA's analysis of the Clean Power Plan compared avoided compliance costs to forgone domestic climate benefits, energy efficiency savings, and health co-benefits. Different tallies applied thresholds to health co-benefits, counting only those exceeding defined levels. The EPA's analysis of the Clean Power Plan compared health co-benefits to compliance costs, with different tallies applying thresholds to the benefits. The analysis showed varying benefit-cost comparisons for the proposed repeal, with some scenarios showing net costs. EPA's 2017 analysis presented different conclusions compared to its 2015 analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan differed from its 2015 analysis in qualitative conclusions due to the exclusion of health co-benefits in some benefit-cost comparisons. EPA applied thresholds to health co-benefits, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient particulate matter concentration. The EPA's estimates of forgone climate benefits under the proposed repeal were lower than in the 2015 CPP analysis due to changes made to the social cost of carbon (SCC), which is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from CO2 emission changes. The SCC estimates used to estimate global climate benefits have been withdrawn, and new SCC values were developed under E.O. 13783. EPA's new SCC estimates are domestic measures of the social cost of carbon, discounted at rates of 3% and 7%. The use of a 7% rate contributed to lower estimates compared to 2015. These estimates are interim values for regulatory analyses until a better estimate can be developed. Sensitivity analyses using global measures and alternative discount rates were also presented. EPA's 2015 analysis treated energy efficiency savings as a negative cost, while the 2017 analysis considered them a positive benefit. This adjustment did not change the comparison of benefits and costs in the repeal proposal. EPA estimated a less than 1% increase in national average retail electricity prices in the contiguous United States in the 2015 RIA. The EPA's analysis indicated that retail electricity prices in the contiguous United States would increase by less than 1% in both 2025 and 2030 compared to the baseline scenario. Price changes varied by region, with a 5.9% increase in the Wisconsin/Michigan region and a 9% decrease in the Long Island region in 2030. The average monthly residential electricity bill was estimated to decline by 7.0%-7.7% in 2030 due to efficiency measures. Energy efficiency was a significant factor in EPA's 2015 analysis, although it was not included in the state target calculations for the final rule. The proposed CPP rule raised concerns about the reliability of electric power supply. The EPA's final CPP rule included a provision for a reliability \"safety valve\" to address potential effects on electric power supply. This safety valve would allow for a 90-day reprieve from CO2 emissions limits in emergency situations, such as extreme weather events. EPA emphasized that the safety valve could only be triggered in critical situations to ensure electric system reliability. EPA implemented a joint understanding with DOE and FERC to coordinate efforts for state compliance plans under the CPP. States may need to modify infrastructure to meet emission targets, such as upgrading transmission facilities for increased NGCC capacity or new natural gas infrastructure for renewable generation. Projected increases in renewable generation may require new transmission lines, which can take 3 to 10 years to get permits. Planning for additional transmission capacity needs to start soon for the early 2020s. E.O. 13783, signed by President Trump, reviews agency actions that could impact energy resources like oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy. This includes addressing specific CAA regulations such as the CPP for existing fossil-fueled electric generating units and related proposed rules. The E.O. 13783, signed by President Trump, directed EPA to review and potentially suspend, revise, or rescind rules controlling GHG emissions from energy-producing sectors like the Oil and Natural Gas Sector. The review includes the CPP and NSPSs for new and modified EGUs, with a focus on promoting clean and safe energy development while ensuring affordability, reliability, and environmental compliance. EPA proposed to repeal certain regulations on October 10, 2017. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP and NSPSs for new and modified EGUs on October 10, 2017. Public hearings on the proposal were held on November 28 and 29, 2017, in Charleston, WV. Implementation of the CPP is currently suspended due to judicial challenges, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit yet to issue an opinion on the matter. EPA requested a 60-day abeyance of the legal challenge in April 2017. The court extended the abeyance of litigation after EPA proposed to repeal the CPP. Repealing the CPP requires the agency to follow the same steps as the original rulemaking process under Section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act. The repeal must be proposed in the Federal Register with a statement of basis and purpose, including factual data, methodology, legal interpretations, and policy considerations. The EPA's proposed repeal of the CPP must include a statement of basis and purpose, findings from advisory committees, and responses to public comments. The promulgated repeal must explain any major changes from the proposal and address significant comments and new data submitted during the comment period. The repeal cannot be based on information not in the official docket. The D.C. Circuit may reverse the Administrator's action if found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with law. The CPP was a key part of President Obama's Climate Action Plan to address climate change globally. The goal was to halt the increase of GHG concentrations to limit global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. The United States, historically a leading GHG emitter, pledged to reduce emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. President Trump announced withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2017, with unclear details on the process. The United States can withdraw from the Paris Agreement three years after it entered into force for the country, with withdrawal taking effect one year later. The US remains a Party to the Agreement until withdrawal is complete. Over 165 countries have submitted greenhouse gas pledges, with 148 Parties to the Agreement out of 195 Signatories. The U.S. submission to the Paris Agreement is recorded as the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), with a non-legally binding GHG target. President Obama's CAP was expected to achieve most GHG reductions needed, but further policy actions may be necessary. EPA estimated a 28% decrease in CO2 emissions from the electricity sector by 2025 under the CPP, contributing to 36-37% of projected CO2 reductions. Under the CPP scenario, the electricity sector would contribute 36-37% of the necessary CO2 reductions to achieve a 26% decrease below 2005 levels. Various organizations used models to compare different CPP scenarios, showing a significant impact on future CO2 emissions from electricity generation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended and modified renewable energy tax credits. The production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) were affected, with the PTC available for projects starting construction before December 31, 2019. The ITC for solar will decrease from 30% to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021 before settling at a permanent rate of 10% after 2021. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) aims to reduce CO2 emissions beyond the U.S. target for 2025, aligning with the Paris Agreement goals for 2030. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) aims to reduce CO2 emissions beyond the U.S. target for 2025, aligning with the Paris Agreement goals for 2030. Factors influencing the CPP's effect in 2025 include federal tax incentives for renewable energy investments. Uncertainties in emissions projections stem from various economic and policy factors. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) contributes to reducing U.S. GHG emissions but falls short of meeting the NDC target. The U.S. provided an account of its actions, including the CPP, which could reduce emissions by 12-16% below 2005 levels by 2025, below the NDC target of 26-28%. The Trump Administration's actions, including Executive Order 13783, aimed to suspend or rescind the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and other rules to reduce GHG emissions. This could hinder the U.S. from meeting its NDC target of 26-28% below 2005 levels. The EPA proposed rescinding the CPP, which could impact the US's ability to meet its GHG emission targets. Meeting these targets is not a legal obligation, and future emissions projections depend on various factors. State, local, and private sector efforts, along with federal policies promoting renewable energy and natural gas, could help reduce emissions. Global trends towards non-emitting electricity production may also play a role. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) may not be able to be rescinded through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) due to the expiration of the expedited procedures. The EPA's final CPP rule was received in Congress in 2015, and efforts from market, state, and local programs could still help achieve emission reduction targets. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) final rule was received by Congress in 2015. Three CRA resolutions of disapproval were introduced, with the Senate passing the resolution on November 17, 2015, and the House passing it on December 1, 2015. President Obama vetoed the resolution on December 18, 2015, and Congress did not override the veto. In the 114th Congress, Congress considered legislation to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce GHG emissions, including delaying CPP implementation, allowing states to opt out, and prohibiting EPA regulation. In the 114th Congress, legislation was considered to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce GHG emissions, including delaying CPP implementation, allowing states to opt out, and prohibiting EPA regulation. Congress also considered placing a rider on EPA's appropriation bill to prevent funds from implementing the rule, but none were enacted. Appropriations measures could play a role in the debate over the CPP. Parties challenged the CPP rule in court, with 26 states filing petitions within 60 days of the rule's publication. West Virginia and Texas led a coalition of 23 state petitioners, while Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Mississippi filed their own petitions. EPA would need resources for rulemaking if the CPP were to be revoked. Several states, labor unions, electric cooperatives, industry groups, and fossil-fuel-related companies have filed petitions challenging the CPP rule. Over a hundred parties have filed more than three dozen petitions, which have been consolidated into one case. Various amici curiae have also filed briefs in support of the petitions, including the state of Nevada and a group of Senators and Representatives. Parties supporting the CPP in the case include a coalition of states, cities, utilities, nonprofits, and energy industry associations. Former EPA Administrators Ruckelshaus and Reilly are also backing the CPP. Additionally, a coalition of cities and localities is supporting the CPP as well. The CPP is supported by various entities, including amici curiae, former Senators and Representatives. Five states are not part of the litigation. The Supreme Court stayed the rule in 2016, pausing its legal effect. The D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments in West Virginia v. EPA, focusing on statutory issues related to state authority and electricity generation shifts. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA's request to pause the CPP litigation for 60 days. The court later ordered the case to remain in abeyance for an additional 60 days, with EPA required to submit status reports every 30 days. The Supreme Court had previously stayed the CPP pending litigation resolution. The D.C. Circuit may continue to hold the litigation in abeyance during EPA's review, keeping the CPP's implementation stayed. The litigation could resume later depending on EPA's actions. Petitioners argue EPA lacks authority to regulate CO2 from power plants under CAA Section 111(d). EPA interprets Section 111(d) as requiring regulation of CO2 from existing power plants. EPA interprets Section 111(d) as requiring regulation of CO2 from existing power plants. Petitioners challenge EPA's design of the CPP as exceeding its authority under Section 111(d), arguing it only allows measures within the source's \"fence line.\" EPA argues the phrase \"system of emission reduction\" is broad enough to include actions beyond individual sources. Various petitioners have challenged different technical or programmatic aspects of the rule designed to reduce emissions from affected sources, including off-site actions and third-party involvement. EPA responded to comments and debates on the interpretation and implementation of CAA Section 111, with parties discussing the standards for court evaluation under Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. In the 2014 Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA decision, the Supreme Court stated that a court should demand \"clear congressional authorization\" if an EPA interpretation of a statute would greatly expand its regulatory authority. Some petitioners argue for a narrow interpretation of CAA Section 111(d) to avoid constitutional issues related to the Clean Power Plan (CPP). States and other petitioners claim that the CPP infringes on state powers over the electrical grid and state legislatures. EPA has addressed these arguments in its Response to Comments and other documents. The EPA defends the Clean Power Plan as an example of cooperative federalism, stating that states can choose not to act without facing new regulatory obligations. Challengers question procedural aspects of the rule's issuance, while supporters argue it follows proper procedures. The D.C. Circuit temporarily paused litigation on the CPP to allow the EPA to reconsider it.

Challengers question procedural aspects of the rule's issuance, while supporters argue it follows proper procedures. The D.C. Circuit temporarily paused litigation on the CPP to allow the EPA to reconsider it. The repeal of the CPP has not been finalized, making it uncertain what the next steps for the litigation will be. EPA recently filed a litigation report on the status of its reconsideration of the CPP, suggesting the court should continue to hold the case in abeyance until the repeal is finalized. EPA could also seek to dismiss the case as moot once the repeal is final. Several states, nonprofit organizations, and industry groups intervened in support of the NSPS challenge, which could impact the EPA's basis for the Clean Power Plan. The D.C. Circuit granted EPA's request to pause the litigation on the NSPS rule, extending the abeyance until further order of the court. EPA is required to file status reports at 90-day intervals."
