    "content": "The \"Family Asthma Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section highlights key information related to asthma. The number of people diagnosed with asthma increased by 50% between 1998 and 2012, with over 25.5 million Americans diagnosed in 2012. In 2010, over 3,400 Americans died from asthma, with higher mortality rates among African Americans and women. Asthma led to 480,000 hospitalizations and 2.1 million emergency department visits in 2009, costing the US annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma costs the United States approximately $56 billion annually, with $5.9 billion in lost productivity. Asthma triggers include outdoor and indoor air pollution, cigarette smoke, and allergens like animal dander and pollen. Public health interventions and medical care following guidelines are effective in managing asthma and reducing emergency department visits. Studies have shown that better asthma management can reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations. More education is needed on avoiding asthma triggers and proper treatment methods. Increasing awareness of asthma as a chronic illness is crucial due to its rising prevalence and impact on school attendance and productivity. The Federal Government and its partners aim to reduce asthma attacks, financial burden, and health disparities associated with the disease. Adherence to National Asthma Education and Prevention Guidelines is crucial to improve patient management practices and decrease asthma-related morbidity and mortality. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's asthma-related activities are outlined in Section 317I of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary collaborates with State and local health departments to provide information and education to the public on asthma, including deterring harmful consequences and disseminating prevention strategies. They also work on developing State asthma plans to reduce the burden of asthma, especially for disproportionately affected populations. The Secretary, in collaboration with State and local health officials, conducts asthma surveillance activities to collect data on asthma prevalence, severity, public health interventions, and management quality. This includes household data collection, surveillance of healthcare facilities, and compiling and publishing annual data reports. The Secretary collaborates with State and local health officials to collect data on childhood and adult asthma prevalence, mortality rates, hospital admissions, and emergency visits nationally and at various levels by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with State and local health departments, coordinate data collection activities to ensure comparability of results. They are encouraged to collaborate with nonprofit organizations to provide asthma information and education, with a focus on expanding activities with non-Federal partners. $65,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 to carry out these efforts. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, detailing asthma prevention, management, and surveillance activities by the Federal Government and other entities participating in the program under this initiative. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, detailing asthma prevention, management, and surveillance activities by the Federal Government and other entities participating in the program under this section, including nonprofit organizations, patient advocacy groups, and medical societies. The report also makes recommendations for the future direction of asthma activities, in consultation with researchers from the National Institutes of Health and other member bodies of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. The report to Congress must include ways to enhance private-public partnerships for asthma, address barriers, reduce morbidity, mortality, and financial burden of asthma, especially in underserved populations. The report to Congress will include recommendations for future research and interventions, updates on programs and policies for asthma management, and ways to expand these initiatives to benefit larger populations. The Secretary will provide updates and revisions of the report to Congress upon request. After 5 years, the Secretary will evaluate the report's analyses and recommendations to determine if a new report is needed, making appropriate recommendations to Congress."
