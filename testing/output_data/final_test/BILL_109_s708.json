    "content": "The Act titled \"Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2005\" allows for Medicare payment adjustments for skilled nursing facilities based on quality data. The Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2005 allows for Medicare payment adjustments for skilled nursing facilities based on establishing quality measures within 6 months of enactment. The Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2005 requires consultation with various stakeholders in establishing quality measures for skilled nursing facilities. Staffing and mix of licensed staff are also included in the quality measures. The quality measures for skilled nursing facilities include staffing levels, mix of licensed staff, and risk adjustment methodology to account for differences in resident populations. The risk adjustment methodology for skilled nursing facilities may exclude certain residents, stratify them into high-risk and low-risk groups, or use statistical adjustments like regression analysis. Special provisions are made for small facilities. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant individuals and groups, establishes criteria for determining quality measures that do not apply to small skilled nursing facilities. Additionally, there is an annual review and revision of quality measures as deemed appropriate by the Secretary and the mentioned parties. Reporting on quality measures is also required. Each skilled nursing facility seeking a payment adjustment must submit data as required by the Secretary for quality measures. The Secretary will publish quality ratings on the CMS website at least annually. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will publish quality ratings for skilled nursing facilities based on data submitted, with additional payment adjustments for facilities meeting requirements. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will publish quality ratings for skilled nursing facilities based on data submitted, with full market basket updates and payment adjustments for facilities meeting requirements. Based on quality measures, top 10% nursing facilities get a 2% payment increase, while others remain unchanged. For skilled nursing facilities below the top 10% but within the top 20%, payment amounts will be increased by 1% starting from fiscal year 2008 based on quality measures. The payment amounts for skilled nursing facilities in the bottom 20% based on quality measures will be decreased by 1% under certain provisions. The Secretary cannot deny a full market basket update or adjustments for small skilled nursing facilities. The Secretary must ensure budget neutrality when implementing provisions related to skilled nursing facilities and quality measures. This includes limiting expenditures to avoid exceeding what would have been spent without these provisions. The Secretary will assume a current services budget baseline for skilled nursing facility services, evaluating the implementation of the amendment and the submission of data by facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2008, on the evaluation of the Security Act and provide recommendations for legislation and administrative actions."
