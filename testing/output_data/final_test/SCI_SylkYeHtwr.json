    "content": "Latent variable models often produce biased estimates, but a new unbiased estimator for the log marginal likelihood and its gradients has been introduced. This estimator, based on randomized truncation of infinite series, allows for better test-set likelihoods and optimization of encoder parameters. It also enables the use of latent variable models for tasks where unbiased estimators are preferred, such as minimizing reverse KL divergences and estimating score functions. Latent variable models, such as mixture models and hidden Markov models, are powerful tools for understanding high-dimensional data distributions. Recent advancements include incorporating deep neural networks for flexible nonlinear likelihoods. These models combine structured probabilistic priors with the empirical success of deep learning, leading to interpretable representations. Latent variable models, like mixture models and hidden Markov models, offer interpretable representations. Fitting flexible latent variable models can be challenging due to the need to integrate out latent variables for likelihood maximization. Variational inference provides a tractable approximation to the posterior over latent variables, forming a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. This lower bound maximization is often more straightforward than maximizing the true log marginal likelihood. The lower bound estimation of the log marginal likelihood is simpler with automatic differentiation and Monte Carlo sampling. However, it may not be suitable for tasks like posterior inference and entropy maximization objectives, such as in entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. Estimating the logarithm of the marginal likelihood in Bayesian statistics is crucial for high-dimensional data, as it is more stable and has numerically sensible gradients. The log transformation introduces challenges for Monte Carlo estimation techniques. The log transformation poses challenges for Monte Carlo estimation techniques in computing the log marginal likelihood. Various estimators have been developed to balance bias and computational cost, with some able to achieve unbiased estimates. A new unbiased estimator of the log marginal likelihood has been constructed, showing promising results in training latent variable models for higher test log-likelihood. The unbiased estimator allows for applying latent variable models in situations where lower bound estimators were problematic. Latent variable models describe data distribution through unobserved quantities, with p \u03b8 (x) representing probability density functions indexed by parameters \u03b8. Latent variable models define data distribution using unobserved quantities and parameterized probability density functions. The model includes a space of latent variables, mixing measures, and conditional distributions. The complexity can be incorporated into latent variables, conditional likelihood, or both. However, computing the integral for the marginal likelihood can be challenging. Various Monte Carlo techniques have been developed to estimate the marginal likelihood or evidence in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Unbiased estimation of log p \u03b8 (x) has not been previously studied. Fitting a parametric distribution to observed data involves minimizing the forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model distribution and the empirical distribution. Stochastic optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent, can be applied by estimating expectations in an unbiased manner using Monte Carlo procedures. Stochastic gradient descent is commonly used for optimizing parameters in nonlinear models, but unbiased estimates of \u2207 \u03b8 log p \u03b8 (x) are not available for latent variable models. Instead, a stochastic lower bound of log p \u03b8 (x) is often used, such as the importance-weighted evidence lower bound. This lower bound involves introducing a proposal distribution q(z; x) to form an importance sampling estimate of the marginal likelihood. The biased \"importance-weighted autoencoder\" estimator IWAE K (x) of log p \u03b8 (x) is derived from this approach. The special case of K = 1 provides an unbiased estimate of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) used in variational inference. The IWAE lower bound can replace log p \u03b8 (x) in maximum likelihood training but may not be suitable for objectives involving entropy maximization. Properties of IWAE allow modification for an unbiased estimator using the Russian roulette estimator to create an unbiased estimator of the log probability function. The Russian roulette estimator is used to estimate the sum of infinite series by randomly truncating and upweighting terms. By flipping a coin to decide whether to compute remaining terms, an unbiased estimator is obtained. This method can be applied to create an unbiased estimator of the log probability function. The \"Russian roulette\" estimator is obtained by randomly truncating and upweighting terms in an infinite series. The estimator depends on a random variable K with a probability mass function p(K). The estimator converges to the value of the infinite series with the law of large numbers, but its variance can be large or infinite. The Russian roulette randomization method can convert an absolutely convergent series into a telescoping series to create an unbiased stochastic estimator. The IWAE bound is focused on, and the SUMO estimator is derived using equation 7. This estimator is unbiased for the log marginal likelihood, regardless of the distribution p(K). The optimization of a limit requires choosing an estimator that minimizes the product of second moment of gradient estimates and expected compute cost per evaluation. The choice of p(K) affects the variance and computation cost of the estimator. The Russian roulette estimator is optimal if the \u2206 g k are statistically independent. While our sampling procedure may not strictly ensure independence, we justify our choice by showing faster convergence to zero for E\u2206 i \u2206 j. We assume independence of \u2206 g k and choose p(K) to minimize the compute-variance product. The choice of p(K) impacts the variance and computation cost of the estimator. Empirical findings show that gradient descent converges even when minimizing log probability. The variance in practice is better than the theoretical bound, but an estimator with infinite expected computation cost remains a concern. The tail of the sampling distribution is modified to ensure finite expected computation cost. Choosing \u03b1 = 80 results in approximately 5 terms for computation. Constructing the RR estimator with a minimum number of terms (m) can lower variance and provide a trade-off between estimator quality and computational cost. This approach involves computing the sum up to m terms (effectively IWAE m) and estimating the remaining difference with Russian roulette. The parameter m is set to achieve a specific expected computation cost per estimator. The SUMO estimator optimizes the encoder q \u03c6 (z; x) to reduce variance. Gradients with respect to \u03c6 are zero due to SUMO's unbiased nature. The choice of q \u03c6 (z; x) impacts estimator variance, so it is optimized. Unbiased gradients are obtained using a specific method. In practice, gradient clipping is applied to stabilize training progress in the encoder, introducing bias but still aiding optimization. Unbiased log probability is valuable in various applications, especially when replacing lower bound estimates with SUMO in latent variable models for high-dimensional data sampling. The \"reverse KL\" objective is useful for training models in high-dimensional data sampling applications. It minimizes log p \u03b8 (x) and is connected to entropy-regularized objectives in decision-making problems. It has been used for distilling autoregressive models and encouraging exploration in decision-making processes. The score function \u2207 \u03b8 log p \u03b8 (x) is crucial for exploration and preventing settling into local minimums. It is used for estimating the Fisher information matrix and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. The REINFORCE gradient estimator is applicable for optimizing objectives and can be replaced with the gradient of SUMO for reward maximization in reinforcement learning. Estimators like these are commonly used in Bayesian statistics for marginal likelihood estimation and model selection. Various estimators for marginal likelihood estimation in model selection are discussed, including the harmonic mean estimator, Chib estimator, Laplace approximation, nested sampling, and annealed importance sampling. Bias removal schemes like jackknife variational inference and hierarchical IWAE are also mentioned. These estimators aim to provide consistent estimates, particularly when estimating the log marginal probability. The use of Russian roulette for unbiased estimation has a long history and has been applied in various fields such as statistical physics, graphics rendering, and statistics. It has also been independently rediscovered multiple times. The use of Russian roulette estimation in deep learning and generative modeling applications has been gaining traction in recent years, offering unbiased estimates of log probability. Normalizing flows provide exact log probability and are proven to be universal density estimators, but they often require restrictive architectural choices and more parameters than alternative generative models. SUMO is compared to IWAE on density modeling tasks using MNIST and OMNIGLOT datasets with a 50-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution for the prior and independent Bernoulli conditional distributions. The neural network architecture is similar to IWAE, with a 50-dimensional Gaussian distribution for the approximate posterior. The study compared SUMO to IWAE on density modeling tasks using MNIST and OMNIGLOT datasets. A 50-dimensional Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance was used, parameterized by two hidden layers with 200 tanh units. Gradient clipping was found to improve performance by reducing variance and achieving faster convergence. Test log-likelihoods and standard deviations were averaged over 3 runs and summarized in Table 1. The study compared SUMO to IWAE on density modeling tasks using MNIST and OMNIGLOT datasets. Test log-likelihoods and standard deviations over 3 runs are summarized in Table 1. SUMO achieves slightly better performance than IWAE with the same expected cost. Results that are statistically insignificant are bolded. Increasing k shows diminishing returns, suggesting variance impacts performance more than IWAE bias. The reverse KL objective is useful when no efficient sampling algorithm is available. The presence of an entropy maximization term in IWAE can lead to optimizing for bias instead of the true objective, causing instability in the model. Modifying IWAE involves interpreting the bias as the KL between the encoder-defined approximate posterior and the true posterior. In practice, the encoder optimization proceeds faster than the decoder optimization in matching q IW (z; x) to p(z|x). To reduce bias, a minimax training objective is used, resulting in a stronger baseline than optimizing q(z; x) in the same direction as p(x, z). This approach works well when k is set sufficiently high, using a \"funnel\" target distribution similar to a benchmark for inference. We use neural networks with one hidden layer of 200 units and tanh activations for both encoder and decoder networks, with 20 Gaussian distributed latent variables. IWAE may optimize bias instead of the objective if k is not set high, while SUMO optimizes the objective effectively. SUMO with entropy regularization outperforms IWAE, which becomes unstable with small expected cost. Increasing expected cost for SUMO reduces variance. When the expected cost k is increased for SUMO, variance decreases. SUMO can optimize the true objective better than IWAE for the same expected cost. IWAE can work with a sufficiently large k when trained using the minimax objective, but it requires more compute and may not scale well compared to SUMO. Visualizations of the resulting models are shown. Variational optimization can be used to find the maximum of a non-differentiable function in reinforcement learning. Entropy regularized reinforcement learning encourages exploration by maximizing the reward function R(x) + \u03bbH(p \u03b8 ), where p \u03b8 (x) is the policy distribution entropy. This approach is related to minimizing a reverse KL objective with an exponentiated reward target. The focus is on quadratic pseudo-Boolean optimization (QPBO), a challenging NPhard problem with complex dependencies between binary variables. Efficient sampling from the policy distribution p \u03b8 (x) is crucial, motivating the use of a model that is both expressive and allows for efficient sampling. Latent variable models with independent conditional distributions trained using the SUMO objective are proposed for efficient sampling. Baselines include an autoregressive policy capturing dependencies but requiring sequential sampling, and an independent policy easy to sample from but lacking dependencies. Problem instances for d \u2208 {100, 500} were constructed with randomly sampled weights. Performance comparison of each policy model showed the independent policy quickly converging to a local minima and lacking exploration capabilities. The independent policy converges quickly to a local minima but lacks exploration, while more complex models better understand reward distributions. The autoregressive model performs well but trains slower due to sequential sampling. Estimating the REINFORCE gradient with IWAE shows decent performance without entropy regularization. SUMO, a new unbiased estimator, works with REINFORCE and entropy regularization but converges slower due to variance. The curr_chunk discusses an unbiased estimator for latent variable models that outperforms standard lower bounds in entropy maximization tasks. Future plans include exploring new optimizers for heavy-tailed stochastic gradients and using variance reduction methods for stability in training. The chunk also references a PhD thesis on modeling adaptive behavior with maximum causal entropy. The chunk discusses the convergence of the series in the context of an unbiased estimator for latent variable models. It references the properties of IWAE and the construction of the estimator, highlighting the conditions for convergence and the asymptotic results. The analysis relies on the delta method for moments and the sample mean, emphasizing the importance of a specific condition for the power series to converge.

It references the properties of IWAE and the construction of the estimator, highlighting the conditions for convergence and the asymptotic results. The analysis relies on the delta method for moments and the sample mean, emphasizing the importance of a specific condition for the power series to converge. In (Nowozin, 2018), it is noted that the moments of w i must exist for the condition to hold for sufficiently large k. Chebyshev's inequality or the Central Limit Theorem can be used to bound the probability ||Y k \u2212\u00b5|| \u2265 1. The central moments are used, and various relations and bounds are derived for different terms in the analysis. The IWAE log likelihood estimate relies on boundedness and appropriate sampling probabilities for convergence. The gradient with respect to \u03bb is calculated using likelihood ratios, treating w i and \u03bd i as i.i.d. random variables. The analysis considers the behavior of w i when the importance sampling distribution is mismatched from the true posterior. The analysis from IWAE requires assuming bounded likelihood ratios. The sample means Y k and \u03bc k have finite expectation and variance, with the variance vanishing as k \u2192 \u221e. The biased estimator \u03c6 k does not necessarily go to zero as k increases. Gradient clipping can be used to address the high variance issue in SUMO, improving log-likelihood performance compared to IWAE. By ignoring rare gradient samples with extremely large values, bias is introduced in favor of reduced variance. Experimentation shows that neither full clipping nor no clipping is ideal. This approach was not used to tune hyperparameters, and is not recommended for entropy maximization or policy gradient methods like REINFORCE. In density modeling experiments, models are trained with SUMO using gradient norm scaling and specific hyperparameters. The gradient norm is set differently for encoder and decoder in SUMO compared to IWAE. Performance is evaluated with early stopping if no improvements are seen after 300 epochs on the validation set. Additional plots of test NLL are included. In density modeling experiments, the encoder and decoder in SUMO are trained with specific hyperparameters and gradient norm scaling. Performance is evaluated with early stopping after 300 epochs on the validation set. The test NLL is plotted against the norm and percentage of gradients clipped for the decoder. The encoder and decoder architecture for reverse KL and combinatorial optimization tasks consist of one hidden layer with tanh nonlinearities and 200 hidden units. The latent state size is set to 20, with a standard Gaussian prior and a Gaussian encoder distribution with diagonal covariance. Independent Gaussian conditional likelihoods are used for reverse KL, while independent Bernoulli conditional distributions are used for combinatorial optimization. Training stability is improved for both IWAE and SUMO. For training stability, momentum was removed and specific optimizers were used with different learning rates and epsilon values. SUMO utilized an expected compute of 15 terms with specific parameters for the Zeta distribution."
