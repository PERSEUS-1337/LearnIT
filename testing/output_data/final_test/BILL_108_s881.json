    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its findings. The \"Rural Equity Payment Index Reform Act of 2003\" addresses physician payment inequities between urban and rural areas under the medicare physician fee schedule due to variations in work adjustment factors. The medicare program's spending disparities across the country exceed differences in cost of living or health status, leading to cross-subsidies from individuals in low payment areas. Congress has implemented floors to increase capitation payments to managed care plans in low payment counties, but this only benefits a small fraction of Medicare beneficiaries. Geographic variations in fee schedules remain a significant issue that Congress has yet to fully address. Improvements in rural hospital payment systems under Medicare help reduce payment variation. Rural communities struggle to attract and retain healthcare professionals. Targeted relief for rural doctors in low payment areas would improve access to services and payment equity. Geographic adjustment factors in Medicare unfairly suppress fee-for-service payments to rural providers. The current chunk highlights the challenges in accurately measuring actual costs and reflecting them in payments to rural healthcare providers. It warns that without changes to Medicare payments in rural areas, financial strain on communities will become impossible as the baby boom cohort ages into Medicare. This will particularly impact economically depressed rural areas with limited ability to shift costs. The text chunk focuses on revising the physician fee schedule wage index. The physician fee schedule wage index is being revised under Section 1848(e)(1) of the Social Security Act. Subparagraphs (B) and (C) are amended to include subparagraph (E), which sets a minimum floor for work geographic indices for services provided in 2004 and 2005. The physician fee schedule wage index is being revised to set minimum floors for work geographic indices for services provided in 2004 and subsequent years. The increase in expenditures for services furnished in 2005, 2006, and 2007 onwards shall not be counted towards annual adjustments."
