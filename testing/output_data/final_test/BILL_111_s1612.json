Congress finds that since 1974, many small businesses in the United States have transitioned ownership to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). Data shows that ESOP-owned small businesses provide significant benefits to employees and communities. Small businesses that qualify for preferences under the Small Business Act lose their eligibility if 50 percent or more of the business is acquired by an ESOP on behalf of employees. This change in ownership disqualifies the business, even if all other criteria remain the same. The Small Business Act is amended to address disqualification of small businesses if 50% or more is acquired by an ESOP solely because of the acquisition. SEC. 44. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS. In this section, an ESOP is defined as an employee stock ownership plan, and an ESOP business concern is a small business concern where 50 percent or more is acquired by an ESOP. An ESOP business concern can still be considered a small business if a majority of shares and control are held by individuals who meet necessary criteria. The amendments made by this section specify that for an ESOP business concern to be eligible for a loan or program, control must be with ESOP shareholders and comply with tax requirements. Effective date is January 1 after enactment of the Act."
