    "content": "The House and Senate conference committee reported H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, which combined six appropriations bills. The House approved the conference report on December 8, 2003, while the Senate postponed final consideration until January 2004. The Senate had passed its version of H.R. 2765 on November 18, 2003, and the House approved its version on September 9, 2003. The House also approved a school voucher program for the District of Columbia during consideration of the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1583 in 2003, later substituted as the text for the Senate version of H.R. 2765. The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 2765 in July 2004, recommending $466 million in special federal payments. The conference version of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2004 includes special federal payments for education initiatives such as college tuition assistance, school voucher programs, public schools, public charter schools, and funding for school facilities. The conference bill for the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2004 includes $2 million for the Family Literacy Program, $373.1 million for criminal justice activities, and $420.5 million in federal payments to the District, with a focus on courts and the criminal justice system. The President's proposed budget also allocated $166.5 million for the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency. The District of Columbia's proposed budget for FY2004 includes $915.9 million in special federal payments, with a focus on court operations, defender services, and offender supervision. The budget also includes a $50 million cash reserve fund. The District of Columbia's budget for FY2004 includes a $5.7 billion budget with a $50 million cash reserve fund. It seeks special federal payments for various programs, including charter school financing, early childhood education, special education, human support services, emergency preparedness, public safety, and public education. The House and Senate must pass a concurrent budget resolution to establish spending ceilings for each fiscal year. The House and Senate appropriators use aggregate spending ceilings for allocating funds. The House approved $466 million and the Senate approved $545 million in budget authority for the District of Columbia in FY2004, which is less than requested. Congress reviews the District's entire budget, including local funds expenditure. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees must approve the District's budget, which is then reconciled in a joint conference committee. The House approved $466 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia in the FY2004 budget. The House approved $466 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia in the FY2004 budget, including funding for college tuition assistance, security planning, court services, offender supervision, school choice program, and public school facilities. The bill did not include $48.7 million in funding for public education requested by the District. During the House debate on H.R. 2765 in September 2003, an amendment to remove a $10 million federal payment for a school voucher program was rejected, while another amendment authorizing a school voucher program in DC was approved. The bill also included provisions related to the District's Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, medical marijuana, abortion, and needle exchange programs. Additionally, the bill prohibited the city from using federal and local funds in FY2004. The Senate version of H.R. 2765 for FY2004 included $545 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia, with allocations for college tuition assistance, security planning, and court funding. The bill also prohibited the city from using funds to support a lawsuit enforcing the Assault Weapons Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990.

The Senate bill proposed various provisions, including removing the prohibition on using District funds for health care benefits and needle exchange programs. It also suggested lifting the ban on using District funds for lobbying and advocacy activities by elected officials. The Senate bill proposed provisions to allow the District of Columbia to use its funds for advocacy, including appointing an attorney for parents in adoption proceedings. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32045(pdf) on H.R. 2765. In November 2003, Congress consolidated funding measures into an omnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The House passed the bill on December 18, 2003, providing $545 million in federal payments for the District of Columbia and approving a $5.7 billion operating budget. The bill includes $17 million for city college tuition assistance, $13 million each for public schools and charter schools, and $13 million for a school voucher program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 allocated funds for various education-related initiatives, emergency planning and security, foster care improvements, and criminal justice activities. Additionally, it included provisions for the use of District funds for health care benefits and prohibited the use of federal and District funds for certain purposes. The House bill includes provisions prohibiting the use of federal and District funds for certain activities, such as boycotts, propaganda campaigns, needle exchange programs, medical marijuana, and abortion services. Local funds can be used for lobbying activities, except for statehood or voting representation in Congress. For more details, refer to the comparison of general provisions in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2004. The District of Columbia Special Federal Payment Funds for FY2004 appropriations include provisions for federal payments to courts for defender services, a 100% match requirement for federal funds, a request for $46 million for Emergency Preparedness, funding for public charter schools, and a similar program in the Labor, Health, and Human Services Appropriations Act. The FY2004 appropriations for the District of Columbia include funds for education, security, economic development, and health initiatives. The controversy over funding a needle exchange program raises issues of home rule, public health policy, and government involvement in illegal drug use. Proponents argue it reduces HIV spread, while opponents raise concerns about enabling drug use. Opponents of needle exchange programs argue that they amount to government-sanctioned illegal drug use by providing drug-addicted individuals with tools to use drugs. They suggest addressing public health concerns about HIV/AIDS through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs instead. Congress has prohibited the use of federal and District funds for needle exchange programs, allowing only private funding for such initiatives. The prohibition on federal and District funds for needle exchange programs was continued by P.L. 106-522. Section 150 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 restricted needle distribution near schools but was removed in P.L. 107-96. Private funds can now be used for needle exchange programs, with Prevention Works operating one such program. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act requires entities to track public and private funds for needle exchange programs. The House version of H.R. 2765 prohibits the use of District and federal funds for needle exchange programs but allows private funds. The Senate version only prohibits federal funds. The conference bill, H.R. 2673, aligns with the House position. The conference bill, H.R. 2673, prohibits the use of federal and local funds for a needle exchange program in the District of Columbia but allows private funds. It also includes a provision that prevented the counting of a voter-approved initiative for medical marijuana, which was challenged in court by the ACLU. The court ruled that Congress cannot suppress political speech, allowing the city to count the votes on the medical marijuana ballot initiative. Congress had 30 days to block the initiative, which they did in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000 and FY2002. Critics argue that this undermines home rule. The court ruled that a congressional ban on using public funds for a medical marijuana ballot initiative was unconstitutional, as it violated First Amendment rights. The amendment restricted the plaintiff's First Amendment rights to engage in political speech. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's ruling without comment. The prohibition on implementing the medical marijuana ballot initiative continued in House, Senate, and conference bills. Congressional debate on public funding of abortion services for District of Columbia residents is ongoing. Since 1979, Congress has restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia, with limitations on cases where the mother's life is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. This prohibition has been in place since 1995 and is still ongoing. In 1989, Congress restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mother's life is endangered. President Reagan and President Bush vetoed appropriations acts over the abortion issue, leading to the inclusion of language prohibiting the use of District revenues for abortion services except in cases of endangerment. The District successfully fought for the removal of the provision limiting funding for abortion services. The District of Columbia fought to remove restrictions on funding for abortion services in the FY1994 Act, but subsequent appropriations acts limited funding to cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. This restriction continued in later acts, including the FY2003 Act. The Health Care Benefits Expansion Act in the District of Columbia allows unmarried couples to register as domestic partners for health care benefits, lifting a congressional prohibition in P.L. 107-96. This provision permits domestic partners to be added to a District employee's health care policy for an additional charge. The Health Care Benefits Expansion Act in the District of Columbia allows unmarried couples to register as domestic partners for health care benefits, including hospital visiting rights and family health insurance coverage. Opponents argue it devalues marriage, while proponents support it as a matter of home rule and local autonomy. The amendment allowing unmarried couples to register as domestic partners for health care benefits is supported as a matter of home rule and local autonomy. Key policy issues in the District's FY2004 appropriations process include special education inefficiencies and delays in evaluating students with special needs. The time period between a student's referral and assessment for special education needs was extended from 50 days to 120 days in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999. However, this provision was later removed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003. Additionally, the FY1999 Appropriations Act limited compensation for attorneys representing disabled students who prevailed in actions against the District of Columbia Public Schools. The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) faced limitations on attorney fees for students seeking special education services in FY1999, FY2000, and FY2001. The FY2002 Appropriations Act lifted some restrictions due to concerns about financial hardship for families. District officials argued that attorney fees diverted funds from special education services, but could not quantify the impact. As a result, the superintendent of DCPS was directed to provide an itemized list of attorney fees in FY2002. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2003 limited attorney fees for special education cases under IDEA to $4,000, including fees for students and defending DCPS. Attorneys must disclose financial, corporate, and legal interests in such cases. The House, Senate, and conference bills would continue to limit attorney's fees in IDEA cases to $4,000 and require disclosure of any relationships with special education diagnostic services or schools. Charter schools in the District of Columbia operate independently under a charter granted by a public entity. In the District of Columbia, charter schools can be granted by either the District of Columbia Board of Education or the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board. Both DCPS schools and public charter schools receive funding based on a per-pupil basis. In the 2003-2004 school year, there were 41 public charter schools in operation with over 11,750 students enrolled. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2003 allocated $16.9 million for charter school activities, including funds for a credit enhancement revolving fund and a facilities improvement fund. Additionally, the act established the Office of Public Charter School Financing and Support. The District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 established the Charter School Fund and directed the General Accounting Office to analyze charter school facilities nationwide. District officials requested $6 million in federal special payments for charter schools in FY2004. The Senate version of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act proposed $13 million for public charter schools in the city, including $8 million for direct funding. The charter school component includes $8 million for the Direct Loans Fund for Charter School Improvement and $5 million for a new \"City Build\" charter school initiative to create five new charter schools in city neighborhoods. The conference bill also provides $13 million for charter schools as part of a $40 million federal payment for school improvements. The Bush Administration requested $75 million for a Choice Incentive Fund to expand opportunities for parents of children in low-performing schools to attend higher-performing public and private schools. The Bush Administration proposed a school choice initiative in the District of Columbia, endorsed by Mayor Anthony Williams and Peggy Cafritz. They supported private school vouchers to improve educational options for public-school children without reducing funding for traditional public schools or charter schools. The mayor's support of a voucher program in the District of Columbia has faced criticism for potentially reducing funding for public education. Opponents argue that the program may not benefit the majority of school children and could drain resources from public schools. Despite a Supreme Court ruling allowing public funding for school vouchers, objections remain about using public funds for religiously affiliated schools. The House Committee on Government Reform passed H.R. 2556, the DC Parental Choice Incentive Act of 2003, authorizing a federal grant program for low-income families in DC to attend private schools. Scholarships valued at up to $7,500 per year could be awarded to eligible students. Additionally, H.R. 2765 proposed a $10 million federal payment for a school choice program in DC. The House approved a $10 million federal payment for a school choice program in the District of Columbia. An amendment to delete the funding failed, and a new amendment was approved to authorize a school voucher program for low-income students in DC. Students could receive up to $7,500 to attend private schools. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill authorizing $13 million for a school voucher program in DC. The program would provide scholarship funds to low-income parents of children in underperforming public schools, with annual scholarship amounts limited to $7,500 per pupil. Eligible entities could include the DC government or nonprofit organizations. Discrimination based on race, color, or national origin would be prohibited. The Senate passed a bill authorizing a school choice program in DC, allowing students to attend religious-based and single-sex private schools. The program would prevent discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex, but would allow for single-sex schools operated by religious organizations. The Senate passed a bill for a school choice program in DC, allowing students to attend religious-based and single-sex private schools. The program aims to prevent discrimination based on various factors. The proposal is detailed in the CRS Report RL32019 by [author name scrubbed]."
