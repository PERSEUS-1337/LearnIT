    "content": "Several statutes authorize the use of administrative subpoenas primarily for criminal investigations related to health care fraud, child abuse, Secret Service protection, controlled substance cases, and Inspector General investigations. The Child Protection Act of 2012 allows the Marshals Service to use administrative subpoenas to track unregistered sex offenders. Administrative agencies have the power to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum to aid in their adjudicative and investigative functions. Federal agencies have been granted administrative subpoena power in over 300 instances, with statutes outlining the circumstances, scope, enforcement procedures, and limitations on information dissemination. The statute may grant the power to issue subpoena duces tecum but deny the agency authority to compel testimony. Authority is usually conferred upon a tribunal or the head of the agency. Failure to comply with an administrative subpoena may lead to adverse administrative decisions. Administrative agencies often rely on courts to enforce their subpoenas. Courts enforce administrative subpoenas based on constitutional provisions, congressional understanding, or general standards. Challenges often involve the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The Supreme Court has upheld enforcement of administrative subpoenas despite Fourth Amendment concerns. The Supreme Court has upheld the enforcement of administrative subpoenas issued by the Wage and Hour Administration, even without probable cause. The Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination do not pose significant obstacles to subpoena enforcement. The key is that the inquiry must be within the agency's authority, the demand not too vague, and the information sought reasonably relevant. The protection lies in ensuring that the disclosure requested is not unreasonable. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not need probable cause to issue a summons for documents. The Commissioner must demonstrate a legitimate purpose, relevance, lack of possession, and adherence to administrative procedures. The court can still inquire into the reason for the investigation to prevent abuse of the process. The Attorney General can issue subpoenas under the Controlled Substances Act for administrative purposes, such as regulating substances and activities in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite being primarily for administrative use, the authority has been delegated to both administrative and criminal law enforcement personnel. The Inspector General Act of 1978 provision authorizes subpoenas for inquiries conducted for criminal investigation purposes. Section 876 allows testimonial and subpoenas duces tecum, with judicial enforcement and contempt of court penalties for non-compliance. The provision does not explicitly prohibit disclosure and is intended for use in both administrative and criminal investigations. The Inspector General Act of 1978 authorizes subpoenas for criminal investigations, with testimonial and subpoenas duces tecum allowed under Section 876. The act does not explicitly prohibit disclosure of subpoenas issued. Section 3486 is primarily used in criminal investigations and includes provisions related to health care fraud, child abuse offenses, and threats against the President. The Marshals Service is vested with administrative subpoena power under this section. Section 3486 grants the Marshals Service administrative subpoena power for tracking unregistered sex offenders. It is more explicit and protective than other statutory counterparts, allowing motions to quash and ex parte nondisclosure court orders. The subpoena provides a reasonable time to respond and limits delivery distance for health care investigations. It includes a \"safe harbor\" provision for compliance in good faith and restricts further dissemination of information in health care investigations. The authority of section 3486 limits dissemination of secured information, with reported case law mainly focused on health care investigation subpoenas. Cases have addressed constitutional challenges, generally finding compliance with the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard. Administrative subpoenas under Section 3486 do not require probable cause, only that they satisfy the statute's terms, request relevant documents, and are for the Department of Justice's investigation. Section 3486 of the statutes outlines the requirements for administrative subpoenas during criminal investigations, including limitations on dissemination of information and the need for relevance to the Department of Justice's investigation. This statute is more detailed compared to others, with provisions for judicial enforcement and contempt power. Only 21 U.S.C. 876 extends beyond subpoenaing records to include testimonial subpoena authority. The Inspector General Act only covers subpoenas for records and documents, not testimonial subpoenas. Section 3486 of the statutes allows for the issuance of subpoenas for records and documents, with the custodian of the records potentially being compelled to testify about them. However, this section does not grant the power to issue testimonial subpoenas."
