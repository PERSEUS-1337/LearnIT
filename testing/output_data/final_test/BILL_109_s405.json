    "content": "The conveyance of property to Clark County, Nevada is outlined in Section 1. Congress finds that the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada is rapidly growing, leading to conflicts between helicopter tour operations and residential communities. The Act aims to establish a heliport to serve the Valley while minimizing the impact on conservation areas. The terms defined in the Act include Conservation Area (Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area), County (Clark County, Nevada), Helicopter tour (commercial operation for profit), Secretary (Secretary of the Interior), and Wilderness (North McCullough Mountains Wilderness). The McCullough Mountains Wilderness was established by the Clark County Conservation of Public Land and Natural Resources Act of 2002. The Secretary will convey approximately 229 acres of land to the County for the operation of a heliport facility. The Clark County Department of Aviation imposes a $3 conservation fee for each passenger on helicopter tours over the Conservation Area. Collected funds are deposited in a special account for cultural management. The curr_chunk discusses the flight path regulations for helicopter tours over the Conservation Area in Nevada, specifying altitude restrictions for different areas. It also mentions the reversion of land if the County stops using it. The County must revert land to the United States if it stops using it for specified purposes. The County is responsible for reclamation costs. The Secretary requires the County to pay administrative costs for the conveyance of the land."
