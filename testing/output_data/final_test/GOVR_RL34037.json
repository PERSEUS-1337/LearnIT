Some argue there is no constitutional grant for Congress to censure or express disapproval, while others believe it is within their authority. This issue was raised during the impeachment of President Clinton. During the impeachment of President Clinton, there was a debate on whether impeachment or censure was the proper response for Congress when questioning federal civil officers' conduct. Some members objected to resolutions of disapproval, citing interference with the President's prerogatives. Precedents show the House has rejected considering \"censure\" motions for federal judges as an alternative to impeachment. During the impeachment of President Clinton, there was a debate on whether impeachment or censure was the proper response for Congress when questioning federal civil officers' conduct. Some members objected to resolutions of disapproval, citing interference with the President's prerogatives. It has become accepted congressional practice to employ a simple resolution for certain nonlegislative matters, such as expressing the opinion of Congress on a public matter. The absence of express constitutional language does not necessarily indicate a lack of capacity for Congress to state its opinion on matters of public import in a resolution of praise or censure. The practice of Congress to express opinions through resolutions is recognized as a valid and inherent authority, even if not explicitly stated in the Constitution. This includes the adoption of resolutions to convey the \"sense of\" the House or Senate on various subjects and individuals. The House and Senate frequently adopt resolutions expressing disapproval or censure of government officials, but this is not considered impeachment or punishment under the Constitution. The House and Senate often pass resolutions expressing disapproval or censure of government officials, which is not considered impeachment or punishment under the Constitution. Such resolutions do not carry legal consequences and are unlikely to violate constitutional restrictions on Congress. The Senate considers resolutions expressing loss of confidence in an official, but the term \"vote of no confidence\" may be misleading as it has specific meaning and consequences in parliamentary democracies. The American system does not have provisions for such votes, except through impeachment. In the American system, Congress cannot directly remove executive branch officials except through impeachment. Resolutions expressing lack of confidence may have symbolic effects but do not lead to the dissolution of the government like in parliamentary democracies. In the American system, Congress cannot directly remove executive branch officials except through impeachment. Resolutions expressing lack of confidence may have symbolic effects but do not lead to the dissolution of the government like in parliamentary democracies. An expression of disapproval by Congress towards an executive branch official has been seen in past resolutions, but they hold no specific legal significance. In the early 1950s, resolutions were introduced against Secretary of State Dean Acheson, including calls for resignation. A total of 59 resolutions were identified from the 93rd through 114th Congresses (1973-2016) directed against federal officials, often expressing censure, condemnation, or calls for resignation. In recent resolutions, officials were asked to resign or the President was urged to request resignation, often accompanied by disapproval like censure or condemnation. Loss of confidence was expressed in 11 resolutions, with calls for resignation. Only 4 resolutions mentioned loss of confidence without other disapprobation. The use of \"no confidence\" language does not uniquely enhance the proposal's force. In recent instances, resolutions expressing \"no confidence\" in an executive official have not been adopted since the 93rd Congress. Most resolutions submitted after 1973 include a preamble stating reasons for congressional disapproval. Only five resolutions lacked a preamble, while 23 explicitly declared themselves as statements of Congress's or the house's sense. These resolutions are typically symbolic and not determinative in nature. The identified resolutions were mainly simple or concurrent resolutions, with some recent instances being joint resolutions. Simple and concurrent resolutions are symbolic and lack imperative force, unlike joint resolutions which are lawmaking vehicles requiring passage by both chambers and the President. It is unclear why some resolutions were submitted in the form of joint resolutions, giving the other house of Congress and the President a role in stating the sense of the resolution. The House and Senate rarely adopt resolutions identified in the search, with only one instance in the 93rd Congress. In 1997, the House adopted a resolution calling for the resignation of an Assistant Secretary of the Army, but it was not approved by the Senate. In 1999, the Senate rejected a resolution to censure President Clinton. In 2014, the House adopted a resolution, but it did not censure or condemn anyone specifically. The House adopted a resolution (H.Res. 644, 113th Congress) criticizing the Obama administration for failing to notify Congress about a prisoner swap at Guantanamo Bay. Before electronically searchable data, there were instances of Congress expressing disapproval of executive conduct or calling for resignations, but these examples do not represent a comprehensive list of resolutions to censure executive or judicial officials. The earliest attempt to censure an official in American history concerned resolutions proposing the censure of Secretary Alexander Hamilton in 1793, drafted by Thomas Jefferson for introduction by Representative William Branch. In 1860, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution reprimanding President Buchanan and his Secretary of the Navy for allowing political considerations to influence government contracts. The resolution passed 106-61 after debates on its authority. In 1896, the House condemned a United States Ambassador for misconduct, finding that he had committed an offense against diplomatic propriety. Some congressional resolutions have urged the President to seek the resignation of executive officers without specific terms of censure or condemnation. The House expressed in a resolution Henry A. Smyth's unfitness to hold the office of collector at the New York custom-house and recommended his removal. Similarly, the Senate in 1924 passed a resolution urging the President to request the resignation of the Secretary of Navy during the Teapot Dome investigation. In the 81st and 82nd Congresses, resolutions were submitted demanding the resignation of Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall without stating reasons for the action. During the 81st and 82nd Congresses, resolutions were proposed calling for the resignation of Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall, reflecting a loss of public confidence in them. These resolutions were seen as declarations of no confidence, even though they did not follow the formal process of a parliamentary vote of no confidence. The appropriateness of such actions has been debated in Congress. During discussions in Congress, resolutions have been introduced and considered to express disapproval of executive branch officials, calling for their resignation or removal by the President. These actions are akin to \"sense of Congress\" resolutions, addressing nonlegislative matters. Resolutions in Congress can express opinions or the sense of Congress on public matters, but they have no legal consequences. A resolution with a \"vote of no confidence\" does not have the same effect as in a parliamentary system and cannot succeed in the American constitutional system. In the American constitutional system, a resolution expressing congressional disapproval of a federal official has no legal consequences and is similar to other resolutions in American history."
