    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, difficult to diagnose due to invisible symptoms. Crohn's can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, while ulcerative colitis specifically targets the colon. Both diseases are collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, present symptoms like severe diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and rectal bleeding. The cause is unknown, but genetics, bacteria, and environmental factors may play a role. An estimated 1,400,000 Americans have inflammatory bowel disease, with an additional 600,000 potentially undiagnosed. Approximately 110 persons, including adolescents, are diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease in the country each day. It affects around 100,000 children under 18 and has been detected in infants as young as a few months old. Inflammatory bowel disease leads to about 200,000 hospitalizations in the US annually and costs billions of dollars in missed workdays, with each patient with active disease estimated to lose about $5,500. Additionally, around 200,000 patients receive permanent work disability compensation from the Social Security Administration. Children with inflammatory bowel disease often miss school and related activities due to the constant pain and impact on their daily lives. A significant number of these children will undergo multiple surgical operations in their lifetime, putting them at risk for complications such as short bowel syndrome. Additionally, growth failures are common in children with recurrent Crohn's disease, affecting their overall health and well-being. Children with inflammatory bowel disease often experience growth failures, delayed puberty, and impaired growth, impacting their overall health. Inflammatory bowel disease also increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Efforts are being made by various organizations to improve the quality of life for those affected by Crohn's disease. The United States Postal Service has issued stamps to raise awareness for critical causes, such as the breast cancer semipostal research stamp. The breast cancer semipostal research stamp is now the top-selling postage stamp in US history, raising over $60,000,000 for breast cancer research. The Postmaster General will issue a commemorative postage stamp on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease. The stamp will be in the denomination for first-class mail and sold for a period determined by the Postmaster General."
