Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County, evaluating FERC's authority to amend wholesale electricity agreements under the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine. This decision has significant implications for FERC's regulatory authority under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act, which govern wholesale electricity and natural gas sales. FERC is responsible for overseeing contracts between energy companies and customers to ensure fair rates. FERC evaluates contracts between energy companies and customers to ensure fair rates for interstate customers. The shift from \"cost-based\" to \"market-based\" rates for electricity was initiated by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This change allows pricing to be determined by market forces rather than the actual cost of service. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 shifted FERC's regulatory role to accommodate a competitive wholesale electricity market. The Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, established in 1956, limits FERC's authority to amend rate agreements approved in previous contracts. The Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, established in 1956, limits FERC's authority to change approved electricity or natural gas contracts unless it is in the public interest. Once FERC approves a rate agreement, it cannot be amended without showing that the change benefits the public. The Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, established in 1956, limits FERC's authority to change approved electricity or natural gas contracts unless it is in the public interest. The FERC standard for determining public interest is if the rate adversely affects the public interest, impairs the utility's financial ability, burdens other consumers excessively, or is unduly discriminatory. In the early 1980s, courts began allowing FERC more leeway to make changes to approved contracts, with the authority to amend rates for \"just and reasonable\" rates in certain situations. In Papago Tribal Util. Auth. v. FERC (Papago II), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered a utility's petition to adjust rates. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered a utility's petition to adjust rates under Section 206 of the FPA, which allows FERC to correct rates that are unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, or preferential. This differs from Section 205, which requires utilities to charge just and reasonable rates. In Papago I, it was determined that the rate contract in question eliminated the utilities' ability to petition FERC for rate changes under Section 205. Despite this, the utility filed a Section 206 complaint, leading to a court ruling that the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine applied, requiring a showing of public interest for any rate changes. The court ruled that the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine did not bar a Section 206 challenge to a rate agreement, allowing FERC to evaluate proposed rate changes under the \"just and reasonable\" standard. Another decision on the same day also found the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine inapplicable to a different rate dispute. In Kansas Cities v. FERC, the court allowed FERC to amend rate contracts with \"regulatory approval clauses\" under the \"just and reasonable\" standard instead of the stricter \"public interest\" standard of the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine. The court specified that this ruling applied only to the specific case presented. In the early 1990s, a Service Company dispute involved the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine. FERC initially used the \"just and reasonable\" standard, but the court directed them to apply the \"public interest\" standard as per the contract. FERC then revised the contracts in the public interest with a more flexible standard. FERC revised contracts \"in the public interest\" based on various factors, including contract review, party intent, and impacts on third parties. The First Circuit upheld FERC's interpretation, emphasizing the importance of protecting third parties. The Mobile-Sierra Doctrine has evolved, with some suggesting it is now less of a hurdle for FERC. In the late 1990s, a new twist on the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine allowed utilities to charge market-based rates instead of traditional cost-based rates, based on the competitiveness of the market. This change applied to contractual rate agreements for wholesale power services. The Mobile-Sierra Doctrine was tested in power purchase contracts formed after a spike in electricity prices in California. Wholesale customers paid high prices for stability but couldn't recoup losses. They petitioned FERC to change contract terms under Section 206 of the FPA. FERC rejected the wholesale customers' argument to change their contract price terms under Section 206 of the FPA, stating that contracts formed in a FERC-authorized market-based rate environment are presumed valid under the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, even if not reviewed prior to formation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine establishes one means of review under the just and reasonable standard, applicable in limited circumstances, and does not establish a stricter \"public interest\" standard for contract review. In a market-based rate environment, contracts are presumptively reasonable only if FERC has reviewed them promptly. The court held that FERC should review contracts to determine if rates exceed the \"zone of reasonableness.\" The Ninth Circuit found that FERC erred in applying the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine presumption of contractual validity to the contracts in question and remanded the decision for reevaluation. The Ninth Circuit remanded contracts to FERC for review, sellers petitioned Supreme Court, Court upheld remand but disagreed with rationale on Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, emphasizing contracts must be \"just and reasonable\" under FPA. The Court upheld the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, stating that FERC can only declare a contract rate unjust and unreasonable if it seriously harms the public. Market imperfections are a reason for long-term contracts, and it should not be harder to enforce them in volatile markets. The Court upheld the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, stating that FERC can only declare a contract rate unjust and unreasonable if it seriously harms the public interest. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's \"zone of reasonableness\" test and emphasized that challenges to contract rates should be based on whether they harm the public interest, not just exceed a marginal rate. The Court upheld the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, emphasizing that FERC can only adjust rates if they harm the public interest. The Court criticized FERC for only considering rates immediately after contracts were in effect, setting a stricter standard for rate adjustments. The Ninth Circuit's decision reined in FERC's authority to adjust rate contracts under the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, emphasizing the need for \"unequivocal public necessity\" or \"extraordinary circumstances.\" The Court also criticized FERC for dismissing findings of market manipulation in power purchase contracts, highlighting the influence of abnormally high open market prices on contract terms. The Ninth Circuit's decision limited FERC's ability to adjust rate contracts under the Mobile-Sierra Doctrine, requiring \"unequivocal public necessity\" or \"extraordinary circumstances.\" FERC was criticized for disregarding market manipulation findings in power purchase contracts due to high open market prices influencing contract terms. FERC's presumption of the contracts being \"just and reasonable\" was found to be in error by the Court, based on the Staff Report. FERC has not taken further action on this matter."
