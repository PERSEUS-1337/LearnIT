    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Action for Dental Health Act of 2015\". Congress finds that millions of Americans do not visit dentists despite high rates of gum disease and cavities. Volunteer dental projects provide free care to those in need, with dentists delivering $2.6 billion in free and discounted care annually. Emergency department charges for dental complaints reached $2.1 billion in 2010, with 80 percent of visits being nonurgent and could have been treated in a dental office. Seniors in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have special dental needs and complex medical histories, requiring collaboration between dentists and medical professionals for comprehensive healthcare. This could lead to potential cost savings of up to $1.7 billion annually and the establishment of a \"dental home\" for these individuals. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. VOLUNTEER DENTAL PROJECTS AND ACTION FOR DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM.\" is about a specific section related to volunteer dental projects and a dental health program. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to allow the Secretary to award grants or contracts to eligible entities for portable dental equipment and operational costs to provide free dental services to underserved populations in accordance with State laws. Eligible entities include State or local dental associations. Eligible entities, such as State or local dental associations, dental education programs, and community-based organizations partnering with academic institutions, can receive grants or contracts to provide free dental services to underserved populations. The Secretary may collaborate with these entities through the Action for Dental Health Program. The curr_chunk focuses on collaborating with public officials and stakeholders to improve oral health education, make dental services more accessible, and reduce barriers in service provision. The curr_chunk discusses reducing barriers in dental service provision, including targeting emergency department use for dental care and providing care to nursing home residents. Eligible entities include dental associations, oral health programs, accredited education programs, and community-based organizations. The curr_chunk discusses tax exemption for entities partnering to provide dental services for underserved populations and updates fiscal years for funding."
