The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Commission, IWTP, and secondary treatment in relation to environmental protection and water treatment facilities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State. The term \"Mexican facility\" denotes a proposed wastewater treatment facility in Mexico to treat sewage impacting both countries. \"mgd\" stands for million gallons per day. SEC. 4. ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION AND THE ADMINISTRATOR. The Commission is authorized to provide secondary treatment of up to 50 mgd in Mexico, including effluent from the IWTP and additional sewage from the Tijuana River area, subject to certain conditions and recommendations from a comprehensive plan. The Commission may provide up to 25 mgd of secondary treatment capacity in Mexico for the San Diego-Tijuana border region, as part of a comprehensive plan to address transborder sanitation issues. This plan includes analyzing long-term treatment needs, upgrading sewage collection systems in Tijuana, and identifying options for additional treatment capacity. The Commission may enter into a fee-for-services contract with a Mexican facility to carry out secondary treatment requirements for future sewage flows from the Tijuana River area. The contract shall include transportation of effluent from the IWTP to the Mexican facility for treatment. The Commission may contract with a Mexican facility for secondary treatment of sewage from the Tijuana River area, including transportation of effluent to the facility. Treatment must comply with water quality laws of the United States, California, and Mexico, with any treated effluent unable to be reused discharged into the Pacific Ocean. Additional sewage treatment capacity is required for advanced primary and secondary treatment. The Commission may contract with a Mexican facility for advanced primary and secondary treatment of sewage from the Tijuana River area. The contract includes a 30-year term, monitoring for compliance with water quality standards, arrangements for sludge disposal, and payment of fees for sewage treatment services. The contract with the Mexican facility includes provisions for transfer of ownership to the United States, a cancellation fee for non-performance by the Commission, and repayment of construction debt upon early termination.

The State will monitor contract implementation with the Mexican facility, evaluating compliance and reporting to Congress every 2 years. SEC. 5. NEGOTIATION OF NEW TREATY MINUTE. In response to the environmental threat posed by pollution in the San Diego-Tijuana border region, the Secretary is urged to prioritize negotiating a new Treaty Minute with Mexico to address the issue promptly. This negotiation should be initiated within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. Implementation of a new Treaty Minute or modification of Treaty Minute 283 under this Act must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The new Treaty Minute or modification should address the siting of treatment facilities in Mexico and the United States, provision for secondary treatment of effluent from the IWTP in Mexico if not available in the US, and additional capacity for advanced sewage treatment. The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of sewage from the Tijuana River area in Mexico, including approval from Mexican authorities, terms for using treated effluent in the US, and other necessary conditions. The curr_chunk includes any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary by the Secretary to implement the provisions of the Act.
