    "content": "The U.S. Congress has a long history of engagement on U.S. policy toward Sudan, with a bipartisan focus driven by advocacy groups and public awareness campaigns on issues ranging from famine to human rights violations. Sudan was Africa's largest nation before the split with South Sudan in 2011, leading to lingering mistrust and unresolved disputes threatening regional stability. The split with South Sudan in 2011 led to unresolved conflicts in Darfur, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan, causing displacement and human suffering. Sudan faces social tensions, economic pressures, and political dissent under an Islamist government since 1989. The secession of South Sudan resulted in a significant financial loss for Sudan, with heavy external debt and ongoing military operations drawing international condemnation. The ongoing economic troubles in Sudan, exacerbated by U.S. sanctions and debt arrears, have strained relations with Western countries. Foreign banks have stopped transacting with Sudanese banks, impacting the foreign exchange market and trade. The breakdown in relations with correspondent banks is expected to have a significant negative impact on the economy. Additionally, the cost of waging war on multiple fronts and allegations of political repression have fueled domestic criticism and periodic public protests. Relations with key Arab Gulf countries are also strained. Relations between Sudan and key Arab Gulf countries have cooled in recent years due to concerns over ties to Iran and support for the Muslim Brotherhood. Khartoum has taken steps to address these concerns, such as expelling Iran's cultural attach\u00e9 and closing cultural centers. Speculation remains about the extent of security association with Iran, despite routine port visits by Iranian warships and a history of diplomatic and military ties. Iran has reportedly contributed to Sudan's military industry development. Sudan's relations with key Arab Gulf countries have deteriorated due to concerns over ties to Iran and support for the Muslim Brotherhood. Sudan has taken steps to address these concerns, such as expelling Iran's cultural attach\u00e9 and closing cultural centers. Speculation remains about security association with Iran, despite routine port visits by Iranian warships and a history of diplomatic and military ties. Iran has reportedly contributed to Sudan's military industry development. Sudan's decision to join the Saudi-led regional military intervention in Yemen in 2015 may be aimed at reinvigorating Arab confidence and investment in the country. Northern \"Arab\"-led regimes in Sudan have historically imposed policies from the center in Khartoum, exacerbating racial, cultural, and religious differences. Resistance from marginalized groups led to insurgencies in the south and other regions. In the 1980s, minority groups in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile joined the southern rebellion. Revenues from Sudan's oil reserves primarily benefited the north, funding government counter-insurgency campaigns that targeted both fighters and civilians. The SPLA rebel group gained ground against the Sudanese military, facing internal divisions fueled by Khartoum. Arab militias were financed along the north-south border to combat the south. The north of Sudan used oil revenues to support Arab militias against the south in the north-south war. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in 2005, granting the south the right to self-determination after an interim period. Despite efforts to promote unity, the south voted to secede in 2011, leading to South Sudan's independence. Talks have since continued on unresolved issues such as border disputes, security, debts, and shared resources like oil. Sudan and South Sudan signed partial agreements on security and economic cooperation in 2012. The deployment of a joint monitoring mission for border demilitarization between Sudan and South Sudan has been repeatedly delayed. The Abyei region, with its unresolved status and history of violence, remains a potential flashpoint. The U.N. Interim Force for Abyei (UNISFA) helped defuse tensions in 2011, but local community conflicts still pose a threat to stability along the border. The Abyei region's status remains unresolved due to a dispute over voter eligibility, with the Ngok Dinka holding a referendum in 2013 to secede from Sudan, which has not been recognized. The final resolution is dependent on negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan, potentially as part of a broader deal on outstanding issues. Minor clashes between the armed forces of both countries have occurred sporadically along the border since their separation. Since their separation, minor clashes have occurred sporadically along the border between Sudan and South Sudan. In 2012, the South Sudanese army briefly occupied the Sudanese oil town of Heglig, leading to retaliatory bombings by Sudan. Both countries accuse each other of supporting rebel groups, sparking concerns of wider conflict in South Sudan. The alleged proxy support by both Sudan and South Sudan could lead to a wider regional war, with devastating humanitarian consequences due to mass displacement. Sudan's response to political demands often involves force, as seen in conflicts like Darfur and the Two Areas, drawing international concern. The conflict in Sudan's Two Areas has led to over two million people being displaced, with restricted humanitarian access. The Sudanese government has been accused of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, financing local Arab militias like the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for a \"proxy war\" against rebel groups. The RSF are criticized for indiscriminate attacks on civilians, while the government continues aerial bombings in Darfur and the Two Areas. The Sudanese government has been accused of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including targeting hospitals in Darfur and Southern Kordofan. The government's strategy involves collective punishment, forced displacement of communities, and direct engagement with armed opposition groups. The U.N. Panel of Experts reported that 3,324 Darfuri villages were destroyed in a five-month period coinciding with a military operation led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). In December 2014, Sudan's defense minister announced new offensive operations against rebels in Southern Kordofan and Darfur. President Omar al Bashir described the operations as aimed at eliminating armed groups that do not heed the government's call for dialogue. The conflict in Darfur stemmed from tensions over land, water, and grazing rights, leading to low-level violence for decades. Arms flows from internal and external actors have fueled the conflict in the region. The conflict in Darfur, described as the worst humanitarian crisis, began as tensions over land and ethnic groups, escalating into a civil war with widespread violence. Despite a humanitarian response in the mid-2000s, insecurity in the region has left over two million displaced persons reliant on food aid. Fighting among ethnic communities continues, creating a large semi-urban population with economic challenges. The conflict in Darfur has escalated since 2013, leading to displacement on a large scale. The 2011 Doha Document for Peace has not stopped the violence, with lack of accountability for crimes creating a sense of impunity. Khartoum's use of local proxies has fueled tensions between ethnic communities, complicating the path to a peaceful settlement. Arab groups previously aligned with the government have accused Khartoum of exploitation and declared opposition. Access by peacekeepers and humanitarian organizations in Darfur is limited due to insecurity and government restrictions. Violent criminality has increased, with humanitarian workers being abducted for ransom. Conflict over land and resources, such as gold, has fueled clashes. Attacks by armed groups on civilians, peacekeepers, and relief workers persist, raising doubts about the credibility of UNAMID. In 2014, a former UNAMID spokesperson revealed unpublished documents showing the mission's reluctance to blame the Sudanese government without irrefutable proof. Despite ongoing conflict and dire humanitarian conditions, UNAMID faces pressure from Sudan's government to develop an exit strategy. President Bashir criticized UNAMID for being a security burden on the Sudanese army. UNAMID is reducing its personnel and activities to focus on strategic priorities, cutting 1,260 civilian positions and downsizing its troop size. Sudan forced the closure of the mission's human rights office and expelled top UN officials. In 2005, the U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Darfur due to arms flowing between Darfur and the rest of Sudan. The Panel of Experts reported routine violations of the embargo by Sudan's security forces in attacks on civilians. Sudan's lack of cooperation with U.N. sanctions renders them ineffective within the country. The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Darfur in 2005 due to arms flowing between Darfur and Sudan. The Panel of Experts reported routine violations of the embargo by Sudan's security forces in attacks on civilians. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power highlighted the ineffectiveness of sanctions in Sudan due to government violations. The ICC was granted jurisdiction over serious crimes in Darfur, but has yet to commence a trial after ten years. Five ICC arrest warrants, including for Sudan's defense minister and President Bashir, remain outstanding for war crimes. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Sudan's defense minister and President Bashir on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Despite Sudan's lack of cooperation, the warrants remain active. The ICC Prosecutor has expressed frustration with the Security Council's inaction on the warrants, citing ongoing atrocities in Darfur. In 2015, the ICC requested the Security Council to enforce compliance with the arrest warrant for President Bashir. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Sudan's defense minister and President Bashir on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Despite Sudan's lack of cooperation, the warrants remain active. African countries have struggled with how to respond to a warrant against a sitting head of state, with some allowing Bashir to travel to their territories. In 2015, the African Union's Assembly approved a resolution requesting the Security Council to withdraw its referral of the Sudan case to the ICC. In 2011, rebellions in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile reignited conflicts in Sudan, driven by unresolved grievances against Khartoum dating back to the north-south war. The CPA aimed for greater autonomy for the Two Areas within Sudan, but the process stalled. South Sudan's ruling party denies ties to the insurgency, led by the SPLM-North rebels. The SPLM-N rebels, linked historically to the SPLM, receive alleged support from South Sudan and Darfur rebel groups like JEM. They, along with three main Darfur rebel groups, form the Sudan Revolutionary Front. Khartoum restricts aid agencies' access to rebel-held areas, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Fighting and air strikes have displaced the population into government-controlled urban areas. The conflict in Sudan has led to mass displacement, with millions requiring humanitarian aid. Air strikes target farms and food stocks to weaken support for the rebellion. Over 2.5 million people in Darfur are internally displaced, with Chad hosting hundreds of thousands of Darfuris. In the first four months of 2015, over 140,000 people have been displaced. Chad hosts 367,000 Darfur refugees, while 1.75 million Sudanese are internally displaced or affected by conflict in various regions. Relief agencies face challenges in assisting refugees in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Eritrea due to government restrictions and insecurity. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF)-Belgium halted operations in Sudan due to access denial in conflict areas. The Sudanese government has a history of denying access to conflict areas and expelling international relief organizations. Pressure is mounting on the NCP government due to international isolation, ICC arrest warrants against President Bashir, Western sanctions, and economic troubles leading to protests. MSF-France was forced to withdraw from Southern Kordofan after their hospital was bombed, adding to the challenges faced by relief agencies in the region. In recent years, economic troubles have led to protests in urban centers in Sudan, resulting in deaths of protestors by police. In 2013, Ghazi Salahaddin Atabani was expelled from the NCP for criticizing the government's response to fuel subsidy protests and later formed the Reform Now Party. The RNP and the Popular National Congress, led by Hassan al Turabi, represent growing Islamist opposition to the NCP. Turabi was a key figure in the 1989 coup that led to the formation of the NCP. The NCP, formed after a power struggle between Turabi and Bashir, faces economic constraints on distributing resources. Amendments in 2015 centralized authority in the presidency, allowing Bashir to appoint state governors and transforming the intelligence agency into a regular armed force. These changes aim to reconsolidate control amid regime fissures. The 2015 amendments centralized authority in the presidency, legitimizing the Rapid Support Forces. President Bashir, in office since 1989, won a controversial election in 2015 with over 94% of the vote. The election was criticized by the US and European governments but deemed peaceful by African Union observers. The AU monitors noted limits on political freedoms in the country, with concerns raised about the creation of political parties by the NCP to give the appearance of competitive elections. President Bashir announced a National Dialogue in 2014 to address conflict and political issues, despite opposition from armed and unarmed groups. The announcement of a National Dialogue in 2014 by President Bashir was met with cautious optimism by some, indicating recognition of public demands for reform. However, skepticism remains about the NCP leadership's willingness to make significant political changes. Efforts to involve armed opposition groups in the process have been unsuccessful, and the timing of elections has undermined international support for the government-led dialogue process. Reports of press censorship and political opponents' detention raise doubts about the regime's commitment to inclusive politics. The Sudanese regime's commitment to inclusive political dialogue is questioned due to censorship of newspapers and harassment of journalists. Opposition leader Sadiq al Mahdi, in exile since 2014, signed agreements for political collaboration. The government labeled these agreements as \"treason\" despite the opposition's readiness to cease hostilities for a national dialogue. The Sudan Call, labeled as \"treason\" by the government, outlines a joint platform for transforming Sudan through political, economic, and social reforms. It unites armed and unarmed opposition voices under common principles. Opposition leaders Farouk Abu Issa and Amin Mekki Madani were imprisoned for signing the document but released before the April elections. Many opposition parties and civil society groups plan to boycott the National Dialogue until a more inclusive environment is created. The National Dialogue faces uncertainty as opposition parties and tribal elders call for a boycott of elections until the constitution dialogue is complete. Abu Issa, recently released from prison, urges opposition forces to consider a popular uprising against the regime. The government is committed to dialogue with unarmed opposition and civil society groups but rejects combining peace negotiations with armed groups in Darfur. The AUHIP, led by Thabo Mbeki, mediates between Khartoum and armed groups in separate negotiations for Darfur and the Two Areas. The AUHIP aims to coordinate peace processes for all groups to participate in a national dialogue. Talks were held in late 2014 between the government and Darfur armed groups in Ethiopia. The Sudanese government seeks to maintain ownership of the National Dialogue process, resisting proposals by Mbeki to meet under AUHIP auspices with political parties. U.S.-Sudan relations have been turbulent since the 1989 coup, leading to the downgrading of diplomatic relations and aid cutoff. Sudan was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, supporting neighboring countries to contain Khartoum and provide aid to the southern rebellion. Relations between the United States and Sudan have been turbulent since the 1989 coup, leading to diplomatic downgrading and aid cutoff. Sudan was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993. In 1996, Sudan expelled Osama bin Laden under Western pressure. In 1998, President Clinton ordered the bombing of a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory in response to the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa. U.S. policy shifted under President George W. Bush to focus on achieving reforms through increased diplomatic engagement. The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum reopened in 2002, but the United States has not appointed an ambassador to Sudan since 1997. Sanctions on Sudan are maintained through Executive Orders and congressionally-imposed legal restrictions. Sanctions on Sudan, including trade sanctions and restrictions on aid, have been imposed by the United States since the 1989 coup. These sanctions are related to Sudan's state sponsor of terrorism designation, abuses during the north-south war, and the Darfur conflict. Executive Orders have frozen Sudanese government assets in the U.S. and prohibited transactions with designated persons involved in the Darfur conflict. The FY2015 consolidated appropriations act prohibits aid to the Sudanese government. The FY2015 consolidated appropriations act (P.L. 113-235) prohibits aid to Sudan and modification of loans held by the government. Sudan seeks to improve its relationship with the United States to boost its international standing and reengage with financial institutions. Efforts to normalize relations have been hindered by conflicts in the Two Areas and Darfur. U.S. officials cite mistreatment of Sudanese people as a key issue in the relationship. Khartoum accuses the U.S. of constantly changing criteria for lifting sanctions. The Obama Administration has faced challenges in improving bilateral dialogue with Sudan due to mistrust and miscommunication. Efforts to lift sanctions have been hindered by the U.S. constantly changing criteria. President Obama's Special Envoy for Sudan, Ambassador Donald Booth, supports AU efforts for cohesive mediation and inclusive national dialogue in Sudan. Booth emphasizes the need for a national dialogue in Sudan to address governance, inclusiveness, resource-sharing, identity, and social equality. He sees conflicts in Darfur and the Two Areas as symptoms of a common national issue. The Envoy encourages confidence-building measures for a sustainable solution. OFAC has issued licenses for certain activities in Sudan. Sudan, designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, has been described as a cooperative counterterrorism partner by the State Department. Hamas and Al Qaeda-inspired groups operate in the country, with concerns about Sudan's role in Iranian arms smuggling to Gaza. Three Sudanese nationals involved in the 2008 murder of two USAID employees were designated as Global Terrorists. Sudan has been designated for certain activities by OFAC. The State Department has designated Sudan as a Country of Particular Concern under the International Religious Freedom Act since 1999. In 2014, a Christian woman, Meriam Ibrahim Ishaq, was sentenced to death for apostasy, but her conviction was overturned. Congressional action has influenced U.S. policy towards Sudan, with efforts to tighten sanctions and provide development assistance. In 2002, Congress appropriated nonlethal assistance for opposition forces to protect civilians in Sudan. In 2003, Darfur conflict led to accusations of genocide against Khartoum, tightening sanctions. Darfur was added to areas eligible for U.S. foreign aid, with a contingency plan required for aid delivery. In 2006, Congress enacted sanctions against Khartoum to address the Darfur conflict and supported military aid for the SPLA. Sudan received over $1 billion annually in foreign aid before South Sudan's independence, but aid has been limited since then. The State Department and USAID requested $9.5 million for FY2015. Aid for Sudan has been limited, with requests for $9.5 million in FY2015 and $9.1 million in nonemergency aid for FY2016. Humanitarian aid totaled $260 million in FY2013 and roughly $413 million in combined FY2014 and FY2015 funding. The State Department's FY2016 request includes $366 million for UNAMID and $92.5 million for UNISFA, with a request for transfer authority for bilateral debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. U.S. policymakers have aimed to end human suffering and rights violations in Sudan for over two decades, but conflicting objectives have sometimes led to prioritizing one conflict over another. Negotiating humanitarian access has required compromise, moderating calls for a confrontational approach towards Bashir's regime. Pursuit of counterterrorism goals has also led to seeking cooperation from Khartoum, complicating efforts to facilitate peaceful relations between Sudan and South Sudan amidst ongoing conflicts. The U.S. has long prioritized peace and stability in Sudan, but achieving this goal has been challenging due to piecemeal approaches to conflicts. Calls for a comprehensive agreement promoting democratic reform and lasting peace have been made by the U.S. and African Union mediators. Khartoum has resisted combining discussions with various opponents, preferring separate negotiations. The U.S. has faced challenges in achieving peace and stability in Sudan due to piecemeal approaches to conflicts. Khartoum has resisted combining discussions with various opponents, preferring separate negotiations. The government's national dialogue rhetoric holds promise, but trust among critics is lacking due to deteriorating security conditions, ongoing conflicts, and violations of rights. The U.S. faces a complex range of policy options for engagement with Sudan, with Congress debating the current approach and considering new ideas from advocates and experts. Advocates and experts may have new ideas on policy options to promote peace and stability in Sudan. Congress has not passed standalone Sudan legislation since 2007. The 114th Congress may consider new punitive measures on Sudan or explore other legislative efforts to influence U.S. engagement."
