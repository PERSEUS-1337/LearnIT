    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 27388 of the Government Code in California is amended. Section 27388 of the Government Code in California is amended to include a fee of up to ten dollars ($10) for recording real estate instruments, papers, or notices required by law in a county, excluding certain exemptions. The types of real estate instruments covered by this fee are specified. The amendment to Section 27388 of the Government Code in California includes a fee of up to ten dollars for recording various real estate documents, with fees paid quarterly to the county auditor for the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund. Administrative costs are limited to 10 percent of the fees collected. The fee imposed for recording real estate documents in California may not apply if accompanied by a declaration or recorded concurrently with a document subject to a documentary transfer tax. Additionally, if presented for recording on the same business day related to a document subject to a documentary transfer tax, it may also be exempt. (i) Exemption from fee for real estate instrument, paper, or notice.\n(ii) Includes recording date and previous document details. Money from the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund is used to enhance local police and prosecutors' ability to combat real estate fraud. 60% of the funds go to district attorneys, 40% to local law enforcement agencies. In counties where only the district attorney investigates real estate fraud, 100% of the funds go to them. Some funds may also support county recorder fraud prevention. The funds allocated to the county recorder for fraud prevention programs are to be used exclusively for deterring, investigating, and prosecuting real estate fraud crimes. The board of supervisors may consider supporting these programs before establishing or increasing fees. The Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund Committee, consisting of key county officials, distributes funds to eligible law enforcement agencies for combating real estate fraud. The committee includes the district attorney, county chief administrative officer, chief officer for consumer protection, and a chief law enforcement officer selected by the other members. The chief law enforcement officer serves a one-year term and may appoint representatives to the committee. If a county lacks a consumer protection officer, the board of supervisors can appoint a suitable replacement. The committee responsible for consumer protection appoints a representative to review applications for funds and make determinations based on specific criteria. Each law enforcement agency seeking funds must submit a detailed written application to the committee, demonstrating either a dedicated unit for real estate fraud investigation or a history of actively investigating and prosecuting such cases. The committee awards funds to law enforcement agencies based on factors like the number of real estate fraud cases filed and investigated, the number of victims, and the total monetary loss suffered by victims. Each law enforcement agency awarded funds must submit a detailed accounting of funds received and expended in the prior year, including the amount received and expended, and the uses of the funds. District attorney's offices or local enforcement agencies may receive nonexpended funds from the previous fiscal year for ongoing investigations and prosecutions. Funds from the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund can only be used for criminal investigations or prosecutions related to recorded real estate documents, and cannot be used to replace other sources of funding."
