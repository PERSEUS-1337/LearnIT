    "content": "Challenges to Russia's democratic development concern Congress regarding U.S.-Russia cooperation. The Obama Administration criticized the flawed 2012 Russian presidential election but called for continued engagement with President Vladimir Putin. Congress debates implications of Putin's presidency, democratization, and human rights abuses in Russia for future foreign assistance and trade legislation. Putin served two terms from 2000 to 2008. Putin served two elected terms from 2000 to 2008, then endorsed Medvedev as his successor. Medvedev became president in 2008 and appointed Putin as prime minister. In 2011, they switched roles, causing resentment among Russians. This led to growing dissatisfaction with both leaders, culminating in the 2011 Duma election. In December 2011, a controversial election in Russia's Duma sparked widespread protests demanding free and fair elections. Despite initial shock, the government allowed the protests to continue as a release valve. President Medvedev introduced legislation for future democratization. Five candidates registered for the upcoming presidential election on March 4, 2012. In preparation for the March 4, 2012, presidential election in Russia, candidates had to gather 2 million signatures of support from at least 40 regions nationwide within about one month. Many prospective minor party and independent candidates faced restrictive requirements, leading to disqualifications by the Central Electoral Commission. Only three out of 17 initial candidates managed to submit signatures, including regional governor Dmitriy Mezentsev and opposition Yabloko Party. Two out of the three candidates, regional governor Dmitriy Mezentsev and opposition Yabloko Party head Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, were disqualified by the CEC for invalid signatures. Businessman Mikhail Prokhorov's signatures were deemed valid, and he was placed on the ballot. Critics claimed Mezentsev was a \"technical candidate\" nominated to ensure Putin had an opponent if others withdrew. Yavlinskiy was eliminated for electronically gathered signatures not handwritten in ink. Many believed he was the only genuine opposition candidate. Prokhorov was the only genuine opposition candidate on the ballot, with other candidates having previously lost in elections. Speculation arose that he was urged to run by the government to attract liberal protesters' votes. Polls showed negative views towards all candidates, with some voters refusing to vote for an \"oligarch\" like Prokhorov. Prokhorov, the third-richest man in Russia, faced negative views that hindered his campaign. Many voters may have chosen Putin as the \"lesser evil.\" The Medvedev-Putin government tried to appeal to disgruntled voters by offering jobs to opposition figures and making government changes. Russia's ambassador to NATO, Dmitriy Rogozin, was promoted to attract the nationalist vote. Large pro-Putin rallies were orchestrated, including one on February 4 in Moscow. Large pro-Putin rallies were organized in Moscow to rival attendance at a \"for free elections\" rally. The final campaign rally of the Putin campaign drew over 130,000 supporters, despite the stadium's capacity being 84,000. Television shows praising Putin and condemning alleged U.S. and opposition \"subversion\" were launched. Authorities targeted independent vote monitoring groups, the Internet, and certain media outlets relied on by the opposition. Putin avoided televised debates but made numerous TV appearances. During his election campaign, Putin extensively appeared on television and published seven articles covering policy issues. He boasted about his achievements in restoring Russia's economy and democracy under his rule. Putin argued that democracy was established in Russia in the 2000s, defining it in terms of rights to employment and freedom. Putin emphasized the importance of democracy in Russia, focusing on rights to employment, free healthcare, and education. He warned against a contentious electoral environment and called for a strong federal government. Putin also highlighted the need to combat corruption and promised increases in military and government pay, pensions, and student stipends. These efforts were seen as a reiteration of existing policies rather than new initiatives. Putin's campaign tactics shifted to blaming the US and the West for protests, promoting anti-American sentiment to rally patriotic support. Accusations were made against Secretary Clinton and former Secretary Albright for allegedly wanting to destroy Russia for resources. Putin urged voters to prioritize Russia's interests and love for the country at a campaign rally. Anti-American themes were also prevalent in non-partisan talk shows. Several major Russian polling organizations, including the state-owned All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTsIOM), have been criticized for potential bias in favor of the government. Critics argue that VTsIOM's polls may have been manipulated to support the government's desired election outcomes. Putin's close relationship with VTsIOM, evidenced by his awarding of a prestigious order after the 2007-2008 election cycle, raises concerns about collusion between the government and the polling organization. During the lead-up to the election, the Putin government and campaign made accusations of criminal conspiracies involving opposition politicians. Sensational claims included a plot by Chechen terrorists to assassinate Putin, allegations of ballot stuffing, and warnings of civil war if Putin was not elected. Putin announced the installation of webcams in polling places to ensure a free and fair election. He declared victory shortly after polls closed, hosting a victory rally in Moscow. Voters were able to view voting and vote-counting online. Putin declared victory in the election, stating that voters had rejected attempts to undermine the state. The Central Election Commission head, Vladimir Churov, claimed the election was open and fair before reviewing reports of violations. Putin received 63.6% of the 71.8 million votes cast, lower than his previous election percentage. Some candidates congratulated Putin on his win, while others alleged electoral irregularities. Putin received 63.6% of the 71.8 million votes cast, lower than his previous election percentage. Some irregularities were reported, including alleged voter fraud and efforts to inflate Putin's vote count in Moscow. Chechnya reported a high turnout and vote for Putin. Independent activists reported thousands of irregularities, including paid voters and buses allegedly transporting Putin's supporters to inflate voting results. The webcams at polling stations were unevenly focused, blocked, or malfunctioned. Golos reported \"carousel voting\" and absentee ballot irregularities, concluding the election was not free and fair. They estimated Putin received over 50% of the vote, with physicist Sergey Shpilkin suggesting it may have been inflated to 58%. The election results were inflated by ballot box stuffing and other means, with Putin receiving about 58% of the vote. The OSCE monitors found the election well organized but raised concerns about media coverage favoring Putin and the mobilization of resources to support him. Precinct polling place chairpersons were mostly affiliated with the ruling party or state employees. Demonstrators calling for fair elections were not hindered by the government. The OSCE reported that the government did not hinder demonstrators calling for fair elections, allowed many monitors at polling places, and installed webcams in most polling places. On election day, OSCE monitors assessed voting positively overall in over 1,000 polling places visited, but noted irregularities in vote-counting in nearly one-third of the 98 polling stations and about 15% of higher-level territorial electoral commissions. Putin and outgoing President Medvedev face rising dissatisfaction among Russians due to perceived tainted elections, corruption, and other political and human rights issues. Russian sociologists estimate that about one-quarter of the population belongs to the middle class, a number expected to grow to one-third by the end of the decade. The growing middle class in Russia, including business owners and private-sector employees, desires a non-corrupt government that follows the rule of law. This middle class has been active in protests following the Duma election, particularly in Moscow where Putin received a low percentage of the vote. There are concerns about the effectiveness of a new Putin presidency in meeting the demands of this rising middle class for reforms. Critics question Putin's ability to implement significant economic and democratic reforms. Some critics doubt Putin's commitment to democratic reforms and predict civil discontent during his third term. Speculation surrounds Putin's nomination of Medvedev as prime minister, with some urging Medvedev not to take the position. Medvedev's supporters fear he will be influenced by conservative Putin appointees and suggest changing the constitution to make him vice president for more independence. Putin stressed that he was running for president with Medvedev as prime minister, continuing their \"tandem\" leadership. Observers believe Medvedev will maintain authority as a former president, with Putin unlikely to replace him in the short term. Medvedev is expected to carry out democratization initiatives he announced during his presidency. Medvedev proposed democratization initiatives in his state of the federation speech on December 22, including restoring gubernatorial elections and increasing openness in legislative elections. Putin expressed concerns about losing control over candidate selection. The bill submitted to the Duma aimed to change electoral procedures for voters to select party lists with local candidates in 225 new districts. Golos researchers criticize two bills as \"propaganda,\" while a more reformist bill aims to reduce registration requirements for new parties. Medvedev orders review of Khodorkovskiy's conviction and other prisoners highlighted as \"political prisoners.\" Initial protests after Putin's election were smaller than after the Duma election. After Putin's election, smaller protests occurred in several cities of Russia, with up to 250 demonstrators detained in Moscow and 300 in St. Petersburg. Youth activists at Putin victory rallies were prepared to counter protester \"provocations.\" Putin victory rallies, attended by 1,000-7,000 people, were held in various cities on March 5. A \"for free elections\" protest rally in Moscow on March 10 drew 10,000-25,000 people. Some protesters were detained after attempting a march, including Udaltsov. Smaller protests with 350 or fewer people were reported in other Russian cities. The Communist Party plans to hold more protests against the election. Some protesters advocate for organizing new opposition parties, while others, like Udaltsov, believe unauthorized protests should continue to pressure the authorities. Mironov has called for changes in electoral law. Mironov has proposed changes in electoral law to allow party blocs, including A Just Russia Party and the Communist Party, to form a social democratic coalition. Business interests support Prokhorov's political role and party formation plans. The State Department looks forward to working with the President-elect and urges the Russian government to address election shortcomings mentioned in the OSCE report. The Russian government was urged to address election shortcomings mentioned in the report, despite the praise for civic engagement and government reforms. President Obama congratulated President-elect Putin on his victory and planned to meet at Camp David in May 2012. The European Union also acknowledged Putin's victory but called for addressing the mentioned shortcomings. The EU urged Russian authorities to address election shortcomings mentioned in the OSCE report and expressed readiness to work with the incoming Russian President on economic and political reforms. The US-Russia \"reset\" of relations saw successes such as cooperation on military transit to Afghanistan, sanctions on Iran, the START Treaty, and Russia's invitation to join the WTO. However, Putin's anti-Americanism during the campaign could strain future cooperation, especially if opposition protests continue and are met with government crackdowns. Opposition protests in Russia face government crackdowns and anti-American rhetoric. New U.S. Ambassador McFaul accused of supporting opposition politicians, but reports fruitful meetings with Russian officials. U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission meetings continue, and cooperation on transit to support U.S. and NATO operations in Afghanistan remains unaffected by other issues. Russia supports transit due to shared interest in countering terrorist threats from Afghanistan. The United States and Russia have differences on various foreign policy issues, including Russia's actions in Georgia and abstention on a UNSC resolution for a \"no-fly zone\" in Libya. Russia's veto on UNSC resolutions regarding Syria and Iran is seen as supporting regime change. Russia is a major arms supplier to Syria and has a naval facility in Tartus. Russia, a major arms supplier to Syria with a naval facility in Tartus, faced criticism for vetoing UNSC resolutions on Syria. Putin defended the veto, citing ongoing dialogue with the U.S. and praising the U.S.-Russia reset for achievements like the START Treaty and WTO accession. President Obama highlighted achievements in U.S.-Russia relations and agreed with President-elect Putin to build upon the successful reset. Putin is expected to attend the G-8 meeting at Camp David before a NATO summit in Chicago. There is a possibility of a summit between Obama and Putin. If European missile defense issues persist, Putin may deliver a harsh anti-U.S. speech at the NATO Summit. Russian official urged Putin to indicate readiness for talks on missile defense and nuclear issues with the U.S. Decision on attending NATO Summit awaited election results. Lack of progress on missile defense made NATO-Russia Council meeting in Chicago unlikely. Director of National Intelligence Clapper gave positive assessment of U.S.-Russia relations, predicting continuity under Putin presidency. Russian domestic and foreign policy under a Putin presidency may pose challenges to U.S.-Russian relations due to Putin's distrust of U.S. intentions. Congress has expressed concerns about Russia's democratic development, including the invasion of Georgia in 2008, the death of Sergey Magnitskiy in 2009, and the re-sentencing of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy in 2010. Legislation such as the Magnitskiy Rule of Law bills aims to impose sanctions on human rights abusers. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 calls for defensive weaponry to be provided to Georgia. The Administration's foreign assistance budget for FY2013 includes $52 million for Russia to support democratization. Putin's criticism of aid may lead to tighter restrictions on non-governmental organizations. Congressional concerns about democratization, human rights, and trade may be heightened by the Russian election outcome. During his trip to Russia in late February 2012, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus emphasized the importance of further democratization for U.S. trade and investment growth. Russia's legislature is expected to ratify WTO accession by mid-2012, prompting Congress to consider granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to Russia. The debate may include Russia's human rights and democratization record. Representative David Dreier congratulated Putin on his election victory but criticized his election night speech. Representative Dreier congratulated Putin on his election victory but criticized his election night speech, suggesting that the United States could offer advice to Russia as a country with a long history of democracy. He recommended that Putin not run again after his third term, called for new Duma and gubernatorial elections, and praised Medvedev's actions regarding Khodorkovskiy. Dreier also mentioned the possibility of Alexey Kudrin as prime minister and emphasized the desire for strong U.S.-Russia relations."
