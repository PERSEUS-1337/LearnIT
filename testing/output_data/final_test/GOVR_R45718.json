    "content": "Congress passed the Antiquities Act in 1906, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, empowering the federal government to protect archaeological sites from destruction. Interest in prehistoric ruins in the western United States grew in the 1880s, leading to unregulated excavation by antiquity hunters, causing damage to the sites. During the 1880s and 1890s, unregulated excavation by collectors caused extensive damage to historic ruins. Limited protections were in place, such as the General Land Office's authority to withdraw land temporarily and the President's ability to create forest reserves. Federal law did not provide general protection against excavation on public lands during this period. Legislation was introduced in Congress in 1900 to empower the President to protect historic sites from destruction. The first bill proposed allowing the President to designate prehistoric or primitive works as parks or reservations. The 1900 legislation proposed empowering the President to designate prehistoric or primitive works, monuments, natural formations, and wonders for preservation, with the authority to acquire surrounding land and private interests within reservation areas. The 1900 legislation proposed giving the President the authority to reserve public lands based on their scenic beauty, natural wonders, historic interest, or medicinal properties. In contrast, a bill introduced by Representative John Shafroth limited the Secretary of the Interior to creating monuments in specific states and territories. In the early 1900s, proposals were made in Congress to protect antiquities in Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico through temporary and permanent land withdrawals. The Senate passed legislation allowing the Secretary of the Interior to make temporary withdrawals for preservation purposes, with permanent withdrawals limited to 640 acres in one place. Some Members of Congress sought to limit the total amount of land the Executive could withdraw during this time. Delegate Bernard Rodey of New Mexico expressed concerns about the Senate-passed legislation during a hearing before the House Committee on the Public Lands. He wanted a limit on the amount of land withdrawals the Executive could make to protect archaeological sites. Other committee members and witnesses believed a 640-acre limitation would prevent extensive reservations in any one state. Edgar Lee Hewett, a prominent archaeologist, suggested solutions to address Rodey's concerns. The Antiquities Act was passed in 1906 after years of debate. Edgar Lee Hewett's proposal allowed the President to protect national monuments on federal land by issuing proclamations, limiting the land reserved for each monument to the smallest area necessary. The proposal limited the land reserved for each monument to the smallest area necessary. Representative John Lacey assured that the bill would not take off much land in the Western States, as it required the smallest area compatible with proper care and management. The Antiquities Act, passed in 1906, imposes penalties for damaging historic or prehistoric ruins on government-owned lands. The bill aimed to preserve objects of antiquity by creating small reservations. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 8, 1906. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to declare national monuments on government-owned lands without the need for an evidentiary record or specific procedures. The act aims to protect historic landmarks and structures by reserving parcels of land, with the requirement that the area be kept to the smallest size necessary for proper care and management. Presidential proclamations under the Antiquities Act do not require an evidentiary record or specific procedures, offering a quicker way to preserve federal lands compared to other environmental statutes. The act prohibits appropriation, excavation, injury, or destruction of historic or prehistoric ruins, monuments, or objects of antiquity within national monuments. The Antiquities Act prohibits appropriation, excavation, injury, or destruction of historic or prehistoric ruins, monuments, or objects of antiquity within national monuments. Use restrictions within monuments come from various sources such as the Mineral Leasing Act and presidential proclamations. Management plans by overseeing agencies also dictate restrictions, with accommodations made for valid existing rights. The responsible federal agency for managing a national monument is not specified in the act, but historically the National Park Service has been commonly chosen for this task. The Antiquities Act authorizes the National Park Service to care for monuments from 1933 to 1978, but some Presidents have tasked other agencies with this responsibility. It also allows permits for archaeological research and preservation in public museums. President Theodore Roosevelt used this authority to protect Devil's Tower in 1906. President Roosevelt issued his first proclamation under the Antiquities Act to protect Devil's Tower in Wyoming, reserving 1,152 acres of land. Subsequent designations for El Morro and Montezuma Castle were smaller in size, but the monuments grew larger with Chaco Canyon at 20,629 acres, Petrified Forest at 60,776 acres, and the Grand Canyon at 808,120 acres. President Roosevelt established the 808,120-acre Grand Canyon National Monument, the largest of his 18 monuments. Subsequent presidents varied in their use of the Antiquities Act, with President Franklin Roosevelt leading with 30 monuments. Presidents after Eisenhower used the act less, with President Carter creating or enlarging 17 monuments. President Clinton revived the Act, establishing 19 new monuments during his two terms. President Clinton established 19 new monuments, including the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. President Obama surpassed all predecessors by creating 29 new monuments, such as the Bears Ears monument in Utah. President Trump has established one national monument, Camp Nelson National Monument in Kentucky. In total, Presidents Roosevelt through Trump have created 158 national monuments using the Antiquities Act. Congress has also modified certain monuments under the Property Clause. President Trump's issuance of proclamations in December 2017 diminished the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by 700,000 acres and the Bears Ears National Monument. Past Presidents have also reduced the size of monuments on multiple occasions, with President Franklin Roosevelt and President Eisenhower taking such actions during their presidencies. President Trump reduced the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by 700,000 acres and the Bears Ears National Monument by 1.15 million acres. Controversies over monument declarations have led to corrective legislation and litigation, but Congress has not fundamentally changed the President's authority under the Antiquities Act. Courts have broadly interpreted the President's power to designate national monuments, including prehistoric ruins and man-made structures, for preservation. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the scope of judicial review of presidential actions. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the scope of judicial review of a presidential proclamation, but courts have concluded that such review is deferential. In a 1920 decision, the Court rejected a challenge to President Theodore Roosevelt's creation of the Grand Canyon National Monument, recognizing it as a great natural wonder. The Supreme Court recognized the Grand Canyon as a great natural wonder with significant scientific interest. President Roosevelt's establishment of the Jackson Hole National Monument led to litigation over the size and purpose of the reserved land. The court had limited jurisdiction to review the proclamation's legality. The court upheld the Jackson Hole National Monument, finding that the government had provided sufficient evidence to sustain the proclamation regarding the designated objects and reserved lands. The court's review was limited to assessing whether there was \"substantial evidence\" to support the proclamation. The court upheld the Jackson Hole National Monument, placing the burden on Congress to pass legislation to address any injustice. Congress responded with extensive hearings, highlighting economic concerns and criticizing the proclamation for disregarding the Antiquities Act's requirements. The Antiquities Act did not give the President authority to establish the Jackson Hole Monument, leading to efforts to disestablish it. Congress tried to abolish the monument, but President Roosevelt vetoed the bill. Congress then refused to fund the monument for seven years until it was consolidated with Grand Teton National Park by President Truman. Congress also amended the Antiquities Act to prevent the President from establishing monuments in Wyoming. The Supreme Court in the 1970s concluded that the Antiquities Act authorizes the preservation of waters and submerged lands. In Cappaert v. United States, the case involved ranchers pumping groundwater near Devil's Hole, threatening the survival of the Devil's Hole pupfish. The United States argued that the pumping was prohibited as the proclamation adding Devil's Hole to the Death Valley National Monument also reserved the groundwater feeding the pool. The Supreme Court upheld the inclusion of Devil's Hole in the Death Valley monument, stating that the Antiquities Act allows protection of water and animals. The Court ruled that the underground pool and endangered pupfish were objects of scientific interest and could be preserved under the Act. In 1980, Congress imposed territorial restrictions on the President's authority under the Antiquities Act in response to President Carter's creation of monuments in Alaska. President Carter established 17 new or expanded monuments in Alaska, sparking bitter opposition and protests throughout the state. In response to protests in Alaska, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) to balance environmental protection and economic needs. The law rescinded President Carter's monument designations but set aside over 100 million acres for conservation. Congress limited the President's authority under the Antiquities Act to prevent future controversies. President Carter's Alaska monuments were challenged in federal court, but the court upheld the President's use of the Antiquities Act to protect objects of scientific interest. Congress later passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to rescind the monument designations and set aside over 100 million acres for conservation, limiting the President's authority under the Antiquities Act. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Presidents Reagan and H. W. Bush did not use the Antiquities Act to establish national monuments, leading to a hiatus in litigation. Challenges to President Clinton's monument designations reignited the debate, with arguments that he exceeded his authority under the Antiquities Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ultimately rejected these arguments in cases such as Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Bush and Tulare County v. Bush. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected arguments against the President's Antiquities Act authority, stating it is not limited to protecting only archaeological sites. The court also dismissed claims that the reserved land was not the smallest area compatible with preservation, as plaintiffs failed to identify the lands with sufficient particularity. Judicial review of proclamations under the Antiquities Act is limited to the face of the Proclamation, prohibiting courts from reviewing the President's determinations and factual findings. The D.C. Circuit declined to decide on the scope of judicial review of a Presidential Proclamation under the Antiquities Act, stating that review is available to ensure consistency with constitutional principles and statutory authority. The court suggested that judicial review would be appropriate to ensure the President acted within his authority. The federal district court in Utah Association of Counties v. Bush definitively resolved the scope of judicial review of a monument proclamation. The court concluded that judicial review of monument proclamations is limited to ensuring that the President considered the principles required by the Antiquities Act when designating a monument. The federal district court in Utah Association of Counties v. Bush established that judicial review of monument proclamations is limited to ensuring the President considered the principles required by the Antiquities Act. The court rejected plaintiffs' claims against President Clinton's proclamation, stating he had considered Congress-mandated principles. A recent case challenged President Obama's establishment of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, arguing that the Antiquities Act does not cover submerged lands. The district court reviewed challenges to a presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act, distinguishing between challenges based on disputed questions of law and those that can be judged on the face of the proclamation. The plaintiffs argued that the monument proclamation was invalid because the reserved waters were not completely controlled by the United States, violating the Act's requirement that reserved lands be owned or controlled by the Federal Government. The district court differentiated challenges under the Antiquities Act based on law from those requiring factual development. Judicial review is conducted without deference, and plaintiffs must provide detailed factual allegations to show the President exceeded Congress's authority. The court rejected the plaintiffs' challenges, citing precedent that the Antiquities Act allows the President to reserve submerged lands and water. The district court concluded that the Antiquities Act authorizes the President to reserve submerged lands and associated water. It also rejected the argument that President Obama lacked authority to establish the monument due to lack of complete control over the Exclusive Economic Zone. The court concluded that the Antiquities Act gives the President broad authority to protect objects of historic and scientific interest, including submerged lands and bodies of water, based on the United States' sovereign control over the Exclusive Economic Zone. The Antiquities Act grants the President authority to protect historic and scientific objects, including submerged lands and bodies of water. Judicial review of monument proclamations is still uncertain, with courts showing deference but not defining the appropriate level of review. The President can establish national monuments, but the extent of authority to diminish or abolish them is unclear. Several Presidents have reduced monument sizes in the past, but the legality of such actions remains debated. President Trump issued proclamations modifying the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments, the first time a President has diminished a national monument since President Kennedy. The proclamations stated that the monuments lacked unique scientific or historic significance and were not in danger of damage. Other federal laws were cited as protecting these objects, such as the Archaeological Resources Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. President Trump's proclamations reduced the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument from 1.7 million acres to 1 million acres and the Bears Ears monument from 1.35 million acres to 228,784 million acres. These proclamations have sparked legal challenges, with plaintiffs arguing that the Antiquities Act does not authorize the President to make such reductions. The cases are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs argue that the Antiquities Act does not allow the President to diminish monuments once established, and that President Trump's proclamations exceed his authority under the Constitution. Some plaintiffs have also brought a claim under the APA against federal officials for not abiding by the original proclamations issued by President Clinton and President Obama. The United States contests the plaintiffs' standing to sue and argues that their claims are meritless. The plaintiffs argue that the President's authority under the Antiquities Act does not include the power to diminish or revoke monuments once established. They believe this power lies with Congress, not the President. The plaintiffs argue that Congress, not the President, has the authority to modify monuments once established. They point to various statutes, such as the Forest Service Organic Act of 1897 and the Reclamation Act of 1902, to support their argument. The absence of language in the Antiquities Act granting the President the power to modify reservations implies that such authority does not exist. The Forest Service Organic Act of 1897 expressly authorized the President to \"revoke, modify, or suspend\" existing forest reservations to clarify the President's authority. The plaintiffs argue that Congress intended for the Antiquities Act to not confer the authority to modify reservations, citing Representative Lacey's statement and the Reclamation Act of 1902. The plaintiffs argue that Congress intended for the Antiquities Act to not confer the authority to modify reservations, citing laws like the Forest Service Organic Act of 1897 and the Pickett Act of 1910. The United States, however, argues that the Antiquities Act does authorize the President to modify a previously established monument, emphasizing the act's requirement to reserve the smallest area compatible for preserving the monument. The United States argues that the President has the authority to diminish existing monuments, even without express statutory authorization, based on the general principle of reconsideration inherent in decision-making power. They also assert that various Executive Branch officers have the authority to make decisions that can be repealed or modified, including under the Antiquities Act. Additionally, the United States disputes the plaintiffs' argument that contemporaneous public land laws imply the absence of modification authority in the Antiquities Act. The United States argues that the Antiquities Act allows the President to modify existing reservations, citing Congress's authority under the Property Clause. They also contend that the Forest Service Organic Act's language on altering reservations does not indicate a lack of existing presidential power. The United States argues that past Presidents have reduced national monuments 18 times, showing the President's authority under the Antiquities Act. Congress never passed legislation disapproving this practice. The United States relies on legal opinions to support the President's authority to diminish national monuments under the Antiquities Act. The Department of the Interior concluded that the President has the power to reduce the size of existing monuments based on implied authority to undo reservations of public land. This authority has been upheld in past Supreme Court decisions. The Department of the Interior concluded that the President has the power to diminish national monuments based on implied authority from past Supreme Court decisions and legal opinions. This authority is derived from congressional acquiescence in the Executive's practice of making such modifications. The plaintiffs challenge the United States' reliance on past executive practice regarding the modification of national monuments. They argue that historical evidence does not support the systematic, unbroken executive practice necessary for the United States' acquiescence argument. Additionally, various executive branch departments have issued opinions stating that the President does not have implied authority to undo a reservation of land, as monuments once established become fixed reservations. The 1938 opinion by Attorney General Homer Cummings concluded that the President does not have the authority under the Antiquities Act to abolish a national monument entirely, based on past executive actions and legal opinions. The 1938 Attorney General opinion concluded that the President lacks authority to abolish a national monument entirely under the Antiquities Act, based on past executive actions and legal opinions. The opinion argued that the power to execute a trust does not imply the power to undo it once completed. Both the United States and the plaintiffs reference this opinion to support their positions on monument modification. The plaintiffs argue that the President lacks authority to modify national monuments, citing instances where the executive branch sought congressional authorization to reduce monuments, which was consistently denied. The Department of the Interior had requested Congress to reduce the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument and grant the President authority to eliminate lands from national monuments, but Congress only passed legislation reducing the monument without giving modification authority to the President. The plaintiffs also point to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) to argue that the President lacks authority to modify national monuments. The plaintiffs argue that the President lacks authority to modify national monuments, citing the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and a court decision in United States v. Midwest Oil Co. The United States contends that FLPMA's use of the term \"Secretary\" instead of \"President\" is controlling. The plaintiffs argue that the President lacks authority to modify national monuments, citing the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and a court decision in United States v. Midwest Oil Co. The United States contends that FLPMA's use of the term \"Secretary\" instead of \"President\" is controlling. The legislative history on which the plaintiffs rely cannot overcome the plain statutory language. The parties dispute the scope of judicial review of a presidential proclamation that purports to exercise that authority. The D.C. Circuit in Mountain States and Tulare, and the district court in Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association did not definitively resolve the scope of judicial review of a monument designation, while the district court in Utah Association of Counties concluded that judicial review was limited to assessing whether the President considered the principles specified in the Antiquities Act. Both parties rely on these cases to support their positions. The United States contends that judicial review of Presidential proclamations is \"extremely limited\" to \"addressing whether the President's decision to modify the Monument is authorized by the Antiquities Act.\" The United States argues that judicial review of Presidential proclamations is limited to assessing whether the President's decision to modify a monument is authorized by the Antiquities Act. President Trump's proclamations must be upheld if they adhere to the statutory standard for designating monument objects and reserving monument lands. The plaintiffs argue that courts have the authority to review the factual determinations and rationale underlying a proclamation that diminishes a national monument to ensure that the President did not abuse his discretion in modifying the monument's boundaries. They contend that President Trump's proclamations effectively dismantled the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears monuments, constituting an abuse of presidential authority. The plaintiffs argue that President Trump's proclamations to diminish national monuments were motivated by energy production and resource extraction, rather than protection of sensitive resources. They claim that removing certain objects from the monuments constitutes a revocation of the monument, which the Executive does not have the power to do. The plaintiffs argue that President Trump's proclamations to diminish national monuments exceeded his authority under the Antiquities Act. Both sides present arguments based on historical sources and legal interpretations, with uncertainty surrounding the President's authority to diminish monuments. However, it is clear that Congress has the power to codify or repeal a presidential proclamation under the Property Clause of the Constitution. Congress has the power to dispose of and regulate Territory or Property belonging to the United States, without limitations. This authority has been used to respond to presidential proclamations under the Antiquities Act by incorporating monuments into the National Park System, transferring them to state control, or abolishing them. Legislation has been introduced to address President Trump's proclamations diminishing monuments like Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears, with proposals to expand the monuments or amend the Antiquities Act to limit the President's authority. The President's authority to declare and diminish national monuments is being challenged by members of Congress through proposed amendments to the Antiquities Act. These proposals aim to limit the President's power to diminish existing monuments, with the final decision likely to be determined by the courts if no congressional action is taken."
