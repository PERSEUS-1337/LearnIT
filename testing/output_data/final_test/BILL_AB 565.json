    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Insurance Code Section 10203.4 is amended to allow group life insurance policies to cover dependents of insured employees, with coverage not exceeding 100 percent of the employee's insurance amount. Coverage for dependent children over the age of majority can be elected with age variations up to the limiting age. Section 10271.1 of the Insurance Code is amended to allow group life insurance policies to cover dependents, including spouses, minor children, and children up to 26 years old or older if incapable of self-sustaining employment due to disability. Premiums can be paid by the employer, employee, or both. Section 10271.1 of the Insurance Code is amended to define supplemental benefits that safeguard life insurance contracts against lapse by waiving premiums or monthly deductions when the insured becomes totally disabled. Total disability is defined as the inability to perform job duties for the first 24 months due to sickness or bodily injury. After 24 months of total disability, the insured must be unable to work in any other job they could reasonably perform, considering their age, education, training, experience, and physical/mental capacity. Total disability may also include specific conditions like loss of sight, hearing, speech, or limb use. The insurer may require a specified uninterrupted period of disability or allow for combined periods. The waiver of premium benefit must be at least as favorable as specified by the supplemental benefit. If the insured becomes totally disabled before turning 60, the insurer will waive all premiums or deductions until the insured reaches 65. Group policies issued before January 1, 2017, with supplemental benefits must be renewed with the option to change the benefit. If the insured's total disability begins after a certain age, the insurer will waive premiums or deductions until age 65, with exceptions for group policies issued after age 60. Renewals for group policies with supplemental benefits must offer the option to change the benefit. The insurer may exclude total disability occurring after a specified age of at least 65 years. A \"special surrender benefit\" waives surrender charges for withdrawals if the owner, insured, or annuitant has a medical condition with a limited life expectancy of 12 to 24 months. The individual must be receiving home care or community-based services, confined in a healthcare facility, or have a medical condition with a limited life expectancy. Additionally, they must be totally disabled. Total disability is defined as the inability to perform job duties due to sickness or injury for the first 24 months, and after that, the inability to engage in any job that can be performed satisfactorily based on age, education, and physical capacity. It may also include total and permanent loss of specific functions like sight, hearing, or limb use. The insurer may require uninterrupted total disability for a specified period or allow combining separate disability periods. Chronic illness is defined as impairment in daily living activities or cognitive ability deterioration requiring continual supervision. The term \"supplemental benefit\" in a life insurance policy provides additional coverage for impairment in daily living activities or cognitive ability deterioration requiring supervision due to severe cognitive impairment."
