FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the Arab League's trade boycott of Israel is inconsistent with WTO principles, hinders relations, and goes against US policy. Many WTO members enforce various levels of boycotts against Israel, requiring taxpayers to report any involvement. Section 999 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain a list of countries participating in a trade boycott of Israel. Currently, countries on the list include Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In 2005, the US received assurances from Saudi Arabia during WTO accession negotiations that WTO rules would apply between Saudi Arabia and all members, including Israel. Saudi Arabia is legally obligated to provide most-favored nation status. Arabia is legally obligated to provide most-favored nation treatment to all WTO Members, including Israel. Any government sanctioned activity on the Boycott [of Israel] would be a violation of Saudi Arabia's obligations and subject to dispute settlement. The United States Trade Representative reports annually on the Arab League's trade boycott of Israel under the National Trade Estimate report but that reporting can be improved through additional requirements for greater transparency and comprehensive reporting. This will assist United States taxpayers in complying with United States law and policy regarding trade boycotts of Israel and enhance efforts to end all trade boycotts of Israel. Improving transparency on the boycott of Israel can help eliminate trade boycotts and strengthen trade ties in the Middle East. Fostered trade and investment between Israel and the Middle East can promote understanding among the region's people. Congress reaffirms its opposition to trade boycotts of Israel and calls on the President to take stronger steps to end all trade boycotts of Israel. Section 181(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 is amended to require the United States Trade Representative to report on countries participating in trade boycotts of Israel, including the Arab League boycott. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to require the US Trade Representative to report on countries participating in trade boycotts of Israel, including details on officials attending boycott meetings, government offices enforcing the boycott, and laws prohibiting Israeli goods. The Trade Act of 1974 amendment requires the US Trade Representative to report on countries participating in trade boycotts of Israel, including details on laws prohibiting Israeli goods and any recent changes in domestic boycott laws. The Trade Act of 1974 amendment mandates the US Trade Representative to report on countries involved in trade boycotts of Israel, assessing the impact on US exports and businesses with ties to Israel. The Trade Act of 1974 amendment requires the US Trade Representative to report on efforts to end the trade boycott of Israel at international forums."
