    "content": "On October 31, 2012, the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force after being approved by Congress in October 2011 and signed into law by President Obama. President Martinelli repealed a law selling state-owned land in the Col\u00f3n Free Zone, leading to protests and clashes with police. Annual PANAMAX defense exercises were held in August 2012 with the U.S. and 16 nations to ensure Panama Canal security. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 highlighted Panama's efforts to combat the presence of FARC in the Dari\u00e9n province bordering Colombia. Panama has improved its border security and cooperation with Colombia. However, there are concerns about the enforcement of anti-money laundering and terrorist finance controls due to a weak judicial system. The State Department's 2011 human rights report noted that Panama generally respects human rights but faces issues such as harsh prison conditions, judicial ineffectiveness, and discrimination against various groups. The judiciary is susceptible to corruption and outside influence, with allegations of power manipulation by other government branches. Panama has made political and economic progress, with efforts to improve the functioning of the judiciary. (Source: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/186743.pdf) Panama has made significant political and economic progress since the 1989 U.S. military intervention that removed General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power. The country has had five civilian governments since then, with President Ricardo Martinelli leading the current government. The economy has been booming, driven by the Panama Canal expansion project. The U.S. military intervened in Panama in 1989 to remove General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power, citing reasons such as safeguarding American lives, defending democracy, combating drug trafficking, and protecting the Panama Canal Treaty. Noriega was arrested in 1990 and brought to the U.S. for trial on drug trafficking charges. President Endara succeeded Noriega after the U.S. intervention in Panama in 1989. He worked on restoring political institutions and demilitarizing the country. Despite facing challenges, he oversaw free elections in 1994, which were praised for their fairness. Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares won the presidency in these elections. In the 1994 elections in Panama, Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares of the pro-Noriega Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) won with 33% of the vote. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber of the Arnulfista Party (PA) came in second with 29% of the vote. P\u00e9rez Balladares campaigned on populist policies, focusing on social spending, addressing unemployment, and criticizing corruption in the previous government. He emphasized the PRD's ties to General Omar Torrijos' populist policies. President P\u00e9rez Balladares of the PRD implemented economic reforms, reduced tariffs, and worked closely with the United States regarding the Panama Canal turnover. He sought a second term in 1999 despite constitutional limitations on presidential reelection. In 1999, President P\u00e9rez Balladares sought reelection but faced a failed referendum to amend the constitution for a second term. He later became embroiled in a visa scandal. Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party won the May 1999 elections, defeating the PRD candidate Martin Torrijos. In the 1999 election, Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party won with almost 38% of the vote, becoming Panama's first female president. She ran on a populist platform promising to end corruption, slow privatization, and reduce poverty. Her husband, Arnulfo Arias, a former president, played a role in the campaign due to his history of being overthrown. Mireya Moscoso won the 1999 election in Panama and formed a coalition with various parties to secure a majority in the Legislative Assembly. Despite facing challenges like the Christian Democrats deserting the coalition and corruption scandals, her government maintained majority support. Moscoso's administration partially reversed trade liberalization by increasing tariffs on certain agricultural products. In 2004, Panama's President Mireya Moscoso's popularity declined significantly due to corruption scandals and poor economic performance. Mart\u00edn Torrijos of the PRD won the presidential race with 47.5% of the vote, defeating former President Guillermo Endara and former Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Miguel Alem\u00e1n. Torrijos' electoral alliance also secured a majority in the National Assembly with 43 out of 78 seats. Mart\u00edn Torrijos of the PRD won the presidential race in Panama with 47.5% of the vote, securing a majority in the National Assembly with 43 out of 78 seats. Torrijos emphasized anti-corruption measures, job creation, and a national strategy to address poverty and unemployment. He had strong support among younger voters and in rural areas. President Torrijos prioritized job creation and proposed widening the Panama Canal, a project costing billions. He aimed to negotiate a free trade agreement with the U.S., focusing on making Panama's economy more competitive. During his term, he faced challenges like social security deficits, Canal expansion, unemployment, poverty, and the impact of the global financial crisis. After facing protests and strikes in 2005, the Torrijos government adjusted its social security reform plans. The National Assembly approved a modified version in December 2005, introducing increased monthly payments and a dual pension system. A doctor's strike in 2007 was resolved with a salary increase and a commitment not to privatize the healthcare system. In 2006, plans were unveiled to expand the Panama Canal with a third set of locks. In 2006, plans were approved to expand the Panama Canal with a third set of locks, doubling its capacity for larger ships. A referendum in October 2006 saw 78% support for the project, seen as crucial for Panama's economic development. President Torrijos also focused on judicial, penal, and anti-corruption reforms, implementing a tougher penal code in May 2008. In August 2008, President Torrijos enacted laws reorganizing Panama's security services to combat drug crimes. Additional changes to the penal code were approved in December 2008, increasing penalties for firearms possession and attacks on police officials. In January 2009, a $1.1 billion fund was established to ease credit access and loans for financial institutions in Panama. In January 2009, a $1.1 billion fund was established to provide loans to financial institutions in Panama, supported by various organizations. Despite economic growth, the Torrijos government faced challenges in its last year, leading to a poor showing in the 2009 elections. In the 2009 presidential and legislative elections, Ricardo Martinelli emerged as the favored candidate over Balbina Herrera. Martinelli formed an alliance with Juan Carlos Varela, leading to a landslide victory with 60% of the vote. The Alliance for Change, led by Martinelli, also secured a majority in the National Assembly with 42 out of 71 seats. The Alliance for Change parties, led by President Martinelli, won 42 out of 71 seats in the legislature. The ruling alliance with the PP fell apart in 2011, leading to tensions within the coalition. PP leader Juan Carlos Varela was sacked as foreign minister, leading to his role as vice president but also as an opposition leader. Tensions within the coalition between the CD and the PP grew in 2011 over the 2014 presidential election. The CD gained a majority in the National Assembly with defections from the PP and PRD. President Martinelli's approval ratings dropped but have since recovered. President Martinelli's approval ratings dropped to about 43% but have since improved to almost 58% in September 2012. However, he has faced criticism for his heavy-handed governing approach and interference with the judiciary, including nominating political allies to the Supreme Court. This led to complaints heard by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in March 2010. In April 2011, a Supreme Court justice appointed by Martinelli resigned amid accusations of conspiracy. President Martinelli faced criticism for interfering with the judiciary by appointing political allies to the Supreme Court, leading to complaints to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In 2011, a Supreme Court justice appointed by Martinelli resigned amid conspiracy accusations. In 1999, legislation expanded Panama's Supreme Court to 12 judges, including a \"court of constitutional guarantees.\" President Moscoso later reduced the court to 9 members, but in 2011, the court reinstated 12 judges. Critics feared President Martinelli's influence over the court with the power to appoint 3 new justices. Public protests in 2012 led Martinelli to withdraw a proposal for a fifth chamber within the court. In July 2010, Panama faced labor unrest due to controversial legislation that sparked protests and clashes with police. Two workers were killed, and hundreds were injured. The strike ended after the government agreed to suspend some contentious aspects of the law. In October 2010, the government repealed the controversial labor and environmental provisions. In early 2011, protests by indigenous communities led to the repeal of a mining law facilitating foreign investment. Indigenous communities in Panama have opposed mining and hydroelectric projects in their territories, leading to protests and government concessions. In 2012, protests resulted in the death of two protestors and talks with indigenous communities. In late 2012, the government repealed a law selling state-owned land in response to protests, which resulted in clashes with the police. The law was seen as an attempt to conceal state spending. Panama's economy weathered the global financial crisis, with growth slowing to 3.9% in 2009 but rebounding to 7.6% in 2010 and 10.6% in 2011. The growth was fueled by the Panama Canal expansion project and construction of a metro system in Panama City. The country is categorized as having an upper-middle-income economy by the World Bank. Panama's economy is classified as upper-middle-income by the World Bank, with a per capita income of $7,910 in 2011. The country faces challenges of income inequality, with a poverty rate of 26% in 2009 and 2010. President Martinelli implemented a $100 monthly support program for poor seniors, and the World Bank approved a $100 million loan for poverty alleviation in May 2011. In May 2011, the World Bank approved a $100 million policy loan for Panama to strengthen fiscal management and expand social programs. The government enacted tax reform measures in 2010, raising sales tax and other taxes to increase revenue. Critics argue that the poor will be affected by the cost of living increase, leading to protests and clashes. However, the reform also improved Panama's credit rating. The tax measure in Panama led to an upgrade in the country's credit rating. President Martinelli's government initiated various infrastructure projects, including the Panama Canal expansion and building an urban metro system in Panama City. Concerns about public corruption persist, with low public trust in politicians and judicial independence. President Martinelli has defended his cabinet ministers. President Martinelli has faced allegations of corruption within his cabinet ministers, with reports in Panama's press documenting these claims. In response, he has taken action to dismiss government officials involved in corruption scandals. In June 2011, an agreement was signed between the Martinelli government and the UNODC to establish a regional anti-corruption academy in Panama. This academy aims to provide specialized training to prosecutors, judges, police officers, and other public officials to combat corruption in public offices. Additionally, the Martinelli government has grappled with a rise in crime rates, particularly in 2008 and 2009, with efforts being made to address this issue. In 2009, Panama saw a significant increase in homicides, reaching 23.6 per 100,000 inhabitants, with 818 murders reported. President Martinelli responded by expanding the national police force by 4,000 officers. This led to a decrease in murders to 759 in 2010 and 704 in 2011, showing a positive impact on reducing crime. According to the U.S. Department of State, Panama's homicide rate fell to 19.3 per 100,000 in 2011, with 704 reported homicides, showing a 7% decline. The government faces human rights issues such as harsh prison conditions, judicial ineffectiveness, discrimination against indigenous groups, and corruption within the judiciary. Efforts have been made to improve the judiciary, including implementing a new code of criminal procedure in two provinces. The State Department reported on Panama's efforts to improve prison conditions and the administration of justice, including the implementation of a new code of criminal procedure. Human rights abuses highlighted in the report included issues with freedom of the press, trafficking in persons, and child labor violations. Child labor violations in Panama are most common in rural areas during harvest time and in the informal sector. The State Department criticizes Panamanian labor laws for restricting union formation and allowing only one trade union per business. In 2010, labor unrest occurred after legislation weakened labor laws, but the government later repealed those provisions. Panama approved new laws in 2011 to comply with the bilateral free trade agreement. In 2011, Panama approved laws eliminating restrictions on collective bargaining for certain companies. Protests in 2012 resulted in fatalities, with concerns raised about excessive force by security forces. Similar concerns were raised in 2010 during labor protests. Hundreds of people injured in clashes during labor protests in Panama, with thousands of displaced Colombians seeking refuge in the Dari\u00e9n province. The Panamanian government restricts the movement of 1,500 displaced Colombians under \"temporary humanitarian protection,\" including Afro-Colombians and indigenous people fleeing violence. Additionally, there are 2,500 refugees and asylum seekers in Panama. The State Department notes 2,500 refugees and asylum seekers in Panama, while UNHCR classifies 15,000 people as \"persons of concern\" in need of protection. Panama gears up for the 2014 presidential election, with PRD and PP holding primaries in early 2013. Martinelli's party has not announced its primary date, as he is ineligible to run for a third term. The Constitution only allows for a president to serve two terms (10 years). There was speculation about Martinelli wanting to amend the Constitution for re-election, but this was unpopular. Observers suggest he may try to amend it for re-election after one term (five years). The US has close relations with Panama since the 1989 military intervention. Panama hosts major U.S. military installations with around 45,000 Americans present, including retirees and tourists. The U.S. has a strong relationship with Panama, focusing on counternarcotics efforts, economic development, and a bilateral free trade agreement. The FTA aims to solidify trade rules and attract foreign investment. The FTA with Panama enhances trade by giving the US access to Panama's market and services. Panama's strategic location as a major shipping route adds significance to the FTA. Panama is investing in infrastructure projects that could benefit US companies. The US handed over control of the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. The United States retains the right to use military force if necessary to reopen the Panama Canal under the Neutrality Treaty. Aid to Panama includes development assistance, health assistance, and security assistance. U.S. bilateral assistance amounted to $3 million in FY2011 and an estimated $2.8 million in FY2012. The FY2013 bilateral foreign aid request for Panama includes $2.8 million for Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to train and equip Panama's National Border Service and National Air-Naval Service, $720,000 for International Military Education and Training (IMET) to support training of Panama's Public Forces, and $135,000 for Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) to combat terrorist threats and secure borders. The FY2013 foreign aid appropriations for Panama include funding for training and equipping Panama's National Border Service and National Air-Naval Service to secure borders. Additionally, Panama receives aid from U.S. regional programs to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as assistance under initiatives to combat drug trafficking. The Administration has not disclosed the specific funding amounts for each Central American country under the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to combat drug trafficking and organized crime. Overall, Central America received nearly $497 million from FY2008-FY2012 through the M\u00e9rida Initiative/CARSI program, with an additional $107.5 million requested in FY2013. Various U.S. agencies, including the Peace Corps, State Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and Department of Homeland Security, provide counternarcotics support to Panama. The U.S. Southern Command (Southcom) also assists Panama through military exercises for humanitarian and medical purposes. Southcom supports Panama through military exercises for humanitarian and medical assistance, and provides emergency aid during natural disasters. Panama hosts the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and participates in U.S. security initiatives. USAID closed its Panama mission in 2012 due to the country's economic development progress. Panama participates in U.S. security initiatives such as the Container Security Initiative and the Megaports Initiative to ensure container security and detect nuclear materials. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 highlighted these efforts. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 noted the threat of FARC presence in Panama's Dari\u00e9n province, with the government increasing efforts to confront and expel the group. Panama has cooperated with Colombia to secure its border and conducted raids on FARC camps in the region. President Martinelli stated Panama would soon have sovereignty over all its national territory. In countering terrorist finance, the government has continued its efforts. The State Department's terrorism report highlighted Panama's legal framework for countering terrorist finance but raised concerns about enforcement and the vulnerability of the Col\u00f3n Free Zone. The US and Panama collaborate on protecting the Panama Canal through annual defense exercises since 2003. The State Department's March 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) emphasizes Panama's role as a major transit country for drug trafficking due to its geographic location and large maritime industry. Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking operations, as well as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), utilize Panama's remote regions, coastline, and transportation infrastructure for moving drugs. The country's financial sector and the Col\u00f3n Free Zone also pose vulnerabilities to money laundering. The INCSR highlights Panama's vulnerability to money laundering, primarily related to drug trafficking. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone is also at risk of abuse by criminal groups due to insufficient enforcement. The Martinelli government continues close counternarcotics cooperation with the US, seizing 34 metric tons of cocaine in 2011. The decrease in seizures is attributed to disrupting trafficking organizations and a shift in trafficking trends. Since 2009, the Martinelli government in Panama has established air and naval anti-drug bases on both coasts to enhance security forces' ability to intercept drug trafficking vessels. In 2012, radar systems were inaugurated to deter and interdict drug shipments. U.S. counternarcotics support includes improving interception capabilities, strengthening the judicial system, enhancing border security, and enforcing laws. Assistance has been provided to modernize and train Panama's security forces. The State Department supports Panama's efforts to modernize its security and justice services, including law enforcement, anti-corruption measures, strategic planning, and community-oriented policing. Panama has made progress in strengthening its anti-money-laundering regime since being cited as non-cooperative in 2000. Panama was previously labeled as non-cooperative in the fight against money laundering by FATF. However, after enacting new laws and decrees in 2000, the country was removed from the non-cooperative list in June 2001. Panama has since improved its financial system transparency, signing a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US in 2010 and enough tax agreements with other countries to be removed from the OECD's \"gray list\" by July 2011. Panama was removed from the OECD's \"gray list\" after signing enough tax agreements for the exchange of information. Despite this, the country will still undergo peer reviews for its legal and regulatory system. Concerns about Panama's use of bearer shares for money laundering led to the enactment of legislation to address this issue in 2011. The State Department acknowledges Panama's progress in anti-money laundering efforts but maintains vigilance in its assessments. The State Department criticizes Panama's anti-money laundering regime, citing weak enforcement and a corrupt judicial system that aids money launderers. Panama's approval of legislation on \"bearer shares\" was a key issue for the US in securing approval for a free trade agreement. Panama has a services-based economy with a trade deficit with the US, exporting goods like fish and seafood, gold, sugar, and fruits, while importing mainly from the US. Panama's major exports include fish, seafood, gold, sugar, and fruits, while major imports from the United States consist of oil, machinery, aircraft, consumer goods, and foodstuffs. The U.S. has a significant foreign direct investment in Panama, particularly in the finance/insurance and wholesale trade sectors. Panama was a beneficiary of specialized U.S. preferential import programs until the bilateral free trade agreement came into force in 2012. The Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) provided trade benefits to Panama, which were expanded with the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) in 2000. In May 2010, Congress extended trade benefits to Panama through September 2020. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States replaced previous trade preferences for Panama under various programs. Negotiations for the FTA began in 2004 and concluded in December 2006 after delays due to issues like market access for agricultural products and procurement provisions for the Panama Canal Authority. Negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Panama and the United States concluded in December 2006. A bilateral agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures was also signed, recognizing the equivalence of food safety inspections. Additional discussions on labor were planned before submitting the agreement to Congress, with bipartisan support announced in May 2007. On May 10, 2007, a bipartisan trade deal was announced between congressional leaders and the Bush Administration, including enforceable labor and environmental standards in pending free trade agreements. The deal required the adoption of five basic labor principles. The United States and Panama signed the proposed FTA on June 28, 2007, with Panama's National Assembly ratifying it on July 11, 2007. The U.S. Congress approved implementing legislation for the FTA on October 12, 2011 (P.L. 112-43). After the FTA was approved by both countries, work began on the implementation of the agreement over the next year. On October 22, 2012, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Panamanian Minister of Commerce and Industry Ricardo Quijano exchanged letters determining that the agreement would enter into force on October 31, 2012. Both countries completed a thorough review of their laws and regulations related to the agreement. Panama's National Assembly approved final laws for FTA implementation, including copyright and intellectual property rights laws, signed into law by President Martinelli by October 10, 2012. The FTA between the US and Panama entered into force on October 31, 2012, allowing over 86% of US exports to become duty-free immediately. Tariffs on remaining goods will be phased out over 10 years. Almost 50% of US agricultural exports to Panama became duty-free, with tariffs on the rest to be phased out in 15 years. The agreement guarantees fair access for US companies to sell goods and services to Panamanian government entities, including the Panama Canal Authority. Improved access to Panama's $22 billion services market is also provided. Panama has identified almost $10 billion in additional infrastructure projects in the coming years that could provide opportunities for U.S. companies. The U.S. Congress delayed consideration of the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement due to the election of Pedro Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, who is wanted in the United States for his alleged role in a murder case. The State Department expressed disappointment over the election of Gonz\u00e1lez in 1992 due to his indictment for the murder of Sergeant Hern\u00e1ndez. Despite being acquitted in Panama in 1997, the trial was criticized for jury rigging and witness intimidation. Gonz\u00e1lez denied involvement, citing inconclusive ballistic tests. Polls in 2007 showed Panamanians believed he should have stepped down, energizing the anti-American wing of the ruling PRD. Gonz\u00e1lez did not seek a second term as Assembly president in 2008, removing the issue as an impediment to the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement. In 2011, the Obama Administration focused on finalizing issues with Panama related to labor rights and tax transparency to secure congressional approval for the Panama Free Trade Agreement. Legislation addressing labor issues in Panama's export processing zones was approved by Panama's National Assembly and signed into law by President Martinelli. In 2011, Panama addressed labor rights issues in EPZs and eliminated the prohibition against the right to strike in new companies. Legislation extended collective bargaining rights in a special economic zone in Bar\u00fa. A Tax Information Exchange Agreement was signed between the US and Panama in November 2010. Panama enacted legislation to comply with the Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with the US, including requiring identification of bearer share owners. The TIEA was approved by Panama's National Assembly in April 2011, providing access to information for enforcing US tax laws, such as bank account details in Panama. The Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) between Panama and the US allows for the sharing of information on national taxes, including bank account details in Panama. Legislation was enacted in Panama to comply with the TIEA, requiring identification of bearer share owners. Additionally, measures were introduced in Congress to support the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. The Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea should be implemented immediately. Hearings were held in both houses of Congress on the proposed FTAs with Panama, urging the Administration to secure approval. Various committees held hearings on the trade agenda, featuring United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee discussed the Colombia and Panama FTAs. The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade held hearings on the Panama FTA, followed by the Senate Finance Committee. Draft bills for the FTA were approved by both committees, pending congressional agreement on trade adjustment assistance legislation. President Obama submitted implementing legislation for the Panama FTA on October 3, 2011, which was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on October 5, 2011. The Panama FTA bill was approved by both houses on October 12, 2011, and signed into law on October 21 as P.L. 112-43. Panama's Col\u00f3n Free Zone is the world's second-largest free trade zone, serving as a hub for trade between Latin America, Asia, and the United States. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone (CFZ) in Panama is a major hub for wholesale purchases of luxury goods, electronics, and clothing, with Hong Kong as the largest supplier and Colombia and Ecuador as the top destinations for exports. The U.S. Department of Commerce sees the CFZ as a significant opportunity for American retail companies to export to Latin America, offering benefits such as time savings, increased sales, reduced complexity, and lower financial risk. However, the CFZ has limitations, including restrictions on perishables and capital equipment, unsuitability for larger countries like Brazil and Mexico, and caution advised when dealing with certain merchants. When Panama proclaimed its independence from Colombia in 1903, it signed a treaty with the United States for rights to build and administer a canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone (CFZ) in Panama is a hub for wholesale purchases, with some merchants to be avoided due to involvement in illicit activities. The Department of State notes the CFZ's vulnerability to abuse by criminal groups due to Panama's insufficient enforcement of controls. A new electronic transaction system is expected to improve traceability of transactions in the CFZ. The United States gained rights in the Panama Canal Zone \"as if it were sovereign\" and \"in perpetuity\" through a treaty in 1914. In the 1960s, Panama sought to renegotiate the treaty due to growing resentment. New treaties were drafted in 1967 but rejected in 1970. Ultimately, in September 1977, President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaties, giving the US responsibility for operating and defending the Canal until December 31, 1999. Under the Treaty on the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, Panama and the United States agreed to maintain neutrality for the Canal, allowing ships of all nations. The U.S. Senate approved the Neutrality Treaty and the Panama Canal Treaty in 1978, with various amendments and conditions. The treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979, despite some critics arguing that Panama did not fully accept the U.S. Senate's conditions. The United States and Panama have the right to use military force to reopen or restore operations of the Canal if it is closed or interfered with. Panama accepted all U.S. Senate amendments to the treaties, leading to cooperation between the two countries on Canal-related matters. The Panama Canal Treaty was successfully transitioned to Panama on December 31, 1999. The Panama Canal Commission was replaced by the Panama Canal Authority, and Panama took over the responsibility of operating and defending the Canal under the Neutrality Treaty. Both Panama and the United States are committed to maintaining the neutrality of the Canal. The Neutrality Treaty grants the right to use military force to reopen or restore operations of the Panama Canal. The U.S. remains interested in the Canal's secure operation due to its importance for U.S. ocean-borne trade. The largest trade route is between the east coast of the U.S. and Asia, while the second-largest is between the east coast of the U.S. and the west coast of South America. The U.S. provides assistance to Panama for Canal security and port/maritime security enhancement. Since 2000, the Panama Canal has been efficiently run by the ACP, increasing safety and efficiency. In 2012, Jorge Luis Quijano became the new Canal administrator, succeeding Alberto Alem\u00e1n Zubieta. Quijano, an engineer, led the Canal expansion project starting in 2006, recommending a third channel and new locks to double capacity. U.S. officials have conducted exercises with Panama and other countries to protect the Canal since 2003. The Panama Canal expansion project, approved in June 2006, aims to double the Canal's capacity to accommodate post-Panamax ships. The $5.25 billion project will be self-financed through toll increases and external financing. The objectives include long-term sustainability, competitiveness, increased capacity, and improved productivity and safety. The Panama Canal expansion project was approved in June 2006 by the Legislative Assembly with 78% of the vote in a national referendum held on October 22, 2006. The project was officially launched on September 3, 2007, with former President Jimmy Carter in attendance. In March 2009, bids were placed for the contract to build the new locks, and in July 2009, the consortium Grupo Unidos was announced as the winner. The Panama Canal expansion project began in 2006 and the contract to build new locks was awarded to Grupo Unidos por el Canal in 2009 for $3.12 billion. The project faced delays, pushing the completion date to April 2015. The expansion aims to reduce shipping rates between Asia and the U.S. Gulf and East coasts. The Panama Canal expansion project aims to reduce shipping rates between Asia and the U.S. Gulf and East coasts, leading to significant savings. It is expected to increase Latin American trade with Asia and intra-Latin American trade. U.S. ports are preparing for the trade expansion, and analysts believe it will benefit the U.S. natural gas industry and make Midwest grain exports more competitive in Asia. The U.S. military intervention in Panama in 1989, known as Operation Just Cause, followed years of pressure against General Noriega's rule. Unrest in Panama led to the formation of an opposition coalition challenging Noriega's rule. The regime nullified election results, harassed U.S. citizens, and led to U.S. military intervention in 1989. President Bush ordered forces to safeguard Americans, defend democracy, combat drug trafficking, and protect the Panama Canal. By early 1990, democracy was restored, Noriega was arrested, and U.S. intervention objectives were achieved. 23 U.S. soldiers and 3 civilians were killed in the conflict. In 1989, U.S. military intervention in Panama led to the arrest of General Manuel Antonio Noriega in January 1990 on drug charges. He was convicted on drug trafficking charges in 1992 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. General Manuel Antonio Noriega was initially sentenced to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking in 1992. Despite being eligible for release in 2007, he remained in U.S. custody due to extradition appeals to France. In 2010, he was extradited to France where he faced a 10-year sentence for money laundering. After a new trial, he was convicted of drug money laundering and sentenced to seven years. Panama later requested his extradition for the 1989 killing of Major Mois\u00e9s Giroldi. In 2011, Noriega was extradited to Panama for the 1985 killing of Hugo Spadafora.
