    "content": "The \"Small Business Jobs Creation Act of 2004\" may be cited as the official title. It introduces a new section, SEC. 45G, which provides a credit for increasing employment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Small Business Jobs Creation Act of 2004\" introduces section 45G, offering a 50% increased employment credit for eligible employers with gross receipts under $25,000,000. The credit under section 45G for eligible employers is based on a minimum of 50% of wages paid in the preceding year. The total credit cannot exceed what would be determined under subsection (a) if certain conditions are met. Additionally, there is a $100,000 limitation on the credit for any employer in a calendar year. The $100,000 limitation on the credit for any employer in a calendar year is based on the definition of 'unemployment insurance wages' and is subject to special rules outlined in the section. For determining the credit allowable in a succeeding calendar year, an individual's net earnings from self-employment can increase the employer's aggregate unemployment insurance wages by up to $7,000. Married individuals have a $50,000 limitation. In the case of married individuals filing separate returns, the limitation for the credit is $50,000 instead of $100,000. This does not apply if the spouse has no business interest. The section does not apply to taxable years after 2009. The text chunk introduces an amendment related to the increased employment credit under section 45G(a) and includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter I. The amendment under section 45G provides a credit for increasing employment, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2004."
