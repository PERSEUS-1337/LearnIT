    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"More Water and Security for Californians Act\" and includes compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Congress finds that the economy of the San Joaquin Valley in California relies heavily on irrigated agriculture supported by the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. However, water availability for agriculture in these areas has been significantly reduced due to restrictions imposed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The San Joaquin Valley is a highly productive agricultural region in the world. The San Joaquin Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions globally, producing over 250 crops worth $17 billion annually. It supplies 8% of US agricultural production and 40% of the nation's fruits and vegetables on less than 1% of farmland. Water supply shortages due to regulatory restrictions have worsened the economic crisis in the region. In 2009, over 400,000 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley were fallowed, leading to high unemployment rates in rural communities. Food banks in the area are facing increased demand. Water shortages in the Central Valley have impacted agriculture and communities reliant on irrigation. Deliveries to water agencies from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are expected to remain low due to pumping restrictions. Water shortages in the Central Valley are expected to continue due to pumping restrictions imposed under the Endangered Species Act. This has led to increased reliance on unsustainable groundwater, putting infrastructure at risk of collapse. Habitat for native fish species in the California Bay-Delta has also been significantly reduced over the last century. Large-scale habitat restoration and fish passage improvements are crucial to restore the impaired ecosystem of the California Bay-Delta and recover native species. Federal and State agencies, along with interested parties, are working on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan to establish a habitat conservation plan for ecosystem restoration and native species recovery. The text chunk discusses compliance with the Endangered Species Act for the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project, based on biological opinions issued in 2008 and 2009. The text chunk outlines mandates for ensuring compliance with biological opinions issued in 2008 and 2009 regarding flow restrictions and pumping operations for the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. The text outlines restrictions on pumping operations at specific pumping plants during certain periods of the year to comply with biological opinions and water rights decisions. The Secretary of the Interior may modify flow and pumping operation mandates in the California Bay-Delta upon recommendations of the National Research Council Committee to benefit species without reducing water delivery capability. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce will establish a fish hatchery program or refuge to preserve and restore the delta smelt in collaboration with the Governor of California. They will also implement a habitat program to identify and prioritize ecosystem restoration and fish passage projects in the California Bay-Delta to ensure the viability of at-risk and threatened species. The legislation aims to protect species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and mandates the installation of the Head of Old River Barrier during specific flow periods. It also includes a savings clause to ensure no reduction in water supply deliveries and no shifting of obligations between water projects. The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act will not be affected by this legislation, including the Water Management Goal. States cannot enforce stricter requirements on project operations impacting species covered by biological opinions than those outlined in this section. All authorities under this section will terminate on March 1, 2020."
