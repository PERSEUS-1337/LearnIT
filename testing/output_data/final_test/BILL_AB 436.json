    "title": "AB 436",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2356.5 of the Probate Code is amended to provide conservatorship for people with dementia, granting powers to authorize medications with specified protections. This aims to meet their unique needs, reduce costs, and safeguard their dignity and rights. A conservator can authorize placing a conservatee with dementia in a secured care facility if they lack capacity to consent and have mental function deficits impairing their understanding of consequences. The court may authorize placement in a locked facility for a conservatee with dementia if it is deemed the least restrictive option and if clear evidence of dementia is presented. The conservatee lacks capacity to consent to medication for dementia care, needs medication as shown by evidence from a physician or psychologist, and treatment for adherents of religions relying on prayer alone should be by a practitioner of that religion. A conservatee placed in a facility under this section cannot be placed in certain mental health centers. A petition for authority to act under this section is subject to specific rules, including representation by an attorney and the conservatee's presence at the hearing. The conservatee must attend the hearing unless excused. A licensed physician or psychologist with dementia diagnosis experience must support the petition. The petition can be filed by designated persons. The court investigator must annually report on the conservator's actions, including the right of the conservatee to object. If objections arise, the court appoints an attorney for the conservatee within 30 days. The attorney must take action within 30 days of receiving the court investigator's report. A petition can be filed with the court to address the conservatee's status, and a written report must be submitted if the attorney determines the petition is inappropriate. Termination of authority granted under this section is governed by Section 2359, with exceptions for conservatorships of individuals with dementia and emergency situations. Current laws regarding a conservatee's residence and medical treatment remain unaffected by this section."
