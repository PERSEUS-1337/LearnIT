    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Local Environmental Improvement Facilitation Act\" and allows for the use of federal water pollution control act civil penalties to fund community environmental projects. Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow private individuals or entities to use civil penalties to fund community environmental projects. Private individuals or entities can use civil penalties under Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to fund community environmental projects. The penalty can be divided, with up to $500,000 allocated for a community project through an agreement, and the remaining amount paid according to the penalty terms. If chosen, the private person must consult with the State and local authorities before entering into an agreement for the project. Private individuals or entities can enter into an agreement to pay a specified amount for environmental projects described in the agreement. The parties involved are the private person, the Administrator, and those carrying out the project. The project details must be outlined in the agreement. Private individuals or entities can enter into an agreement to pay for environmental projects within the city or county where the violation occurred. The project must relate to the nature of the violation, comply with laws, not duplicate funded activities, and not solely involve a monetary contribution. Private individuals or entities can fund environmental research, studies, assessments, or projects without a commitment to implement the results. The Administrator oversees environmental projects funded through Federal loans, contracts, or grants to ensure compliance with agreements. If a private entity fails to carry out the project as agreed, the Administrator can terminate the agreement. The Administrator has the authority to terminate the agreement with a private entity and require them to pay a penalty if they fail to fulfill the project as agreed."
