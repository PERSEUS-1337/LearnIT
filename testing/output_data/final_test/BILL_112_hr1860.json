    "content": "The \"Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2011\" prohibits states and local jurisdictions from imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on digital goods and services to ensure fairness for providers and consumers. SEC. 4. RETAIL, SOURCING, AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AND RULES. Retail Limitation: Taxes on digital goods or services can only be imposed on sales to customers. Taxpayer Limitation: Taxes can only be collected from customers or sellers. Sourcing Limitation: Taxes can only be imposed by state and local jurisdictions where the customer's tax address is located. If sales are made to multiple locations, the seller can determine the customer's tax address based on the address provided by the customer. The seller is not liable for additional tax if they rely on the customer's provided tax address. No tax can be imposed on digital goods or services, only on sales to customers. Transactions involving digital goods are considered transactions of digital services unless specified otherwise. The provision states that no tax can be imposed on the sale or use of a digital service, unless it involves the transfer of a complete copy of a digital good. If charges for digital goods or services are bundled with other goods or services, they must be separately stated. Charges for digital goods or services may be taxed at the same rate as other goods unless separately stated. Charges for delivery may be treated as non-severable if aggregated with the digital good or service. The tax treatment of the sale of a digital code is the same as the sale of the digital good or service it relates to, and the sale of the digital code is considered the sale transaction for tax purposes. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"customer\" refers to a person purchasing a digital good or service for personal use, excluding resale. The term \"customer's tax address\" pertains to the location for tax purposes in the sale of digital goods or services by a mobile telecommunications provider. The location where a digital good or service is received by the customer is determined based on specific criteria outlined in the Act. The customer's address for digital goods/services is determined based on specific criteria outlined in the Act, including seller's known or obtained address, seller's address if customer's address is unknown, and delivery location for goods/services provided to someone other than the customer. The term \"delivered or transferred electronically\" refers to delivery or transfer via electronic means, excluding tangible storage media. A \"digital code\" is a code that grants access to a single type of digital good or service. A \"digital good\" includes electronically delivered products like software, digital audio-visual works, and digital books. The term \"digital service\" refers to any electronically provided service, excluding telecommunications, Internet access, and audio or video programming services. Audio or video programming is content similar to that of radio or television broadcasts. The term \"video programming\" excludes interactive on-demand services, pay-per-view services, or similar services, regardless of the technology used. A \"discriminatory tax\" refers to any tax imposed by a State or local jurisdiction on the sale or use of digital goods or services. The curr_chunk discusses imposing higher tax rates on digital goods and services compared to tangible property or similar non-electronic services. It also mentions taxing sellers of digital goods at a higher rate or with a broader tax base than sellers of tangible property or similar services. The curr_chunk discusses the imposition of higher tax rates on digital goods and services, attributing it to the fact that sellers of digital goods face disadvantageous terms compared to sellers of tangible property or similar non-electronic services. The tax on digital goods and services is higher than on tangible property, with all tax factors considered. A tax is not \"generally imposed\" if it targets specific services, industries, or types of property. The term \"multiple tax\" refers to a tax imposed on the sale or use of digital goods or services by a state or local jurisdiction without giving credit for taxes paid to another jurisdiction. A digital good or service is considered purchased for resale if it is bought with the intention of reselling it. The purchase of a digital service for resale or integration into another digital product for sale is considered a sale. The term \"seller\" refers to a person selling tangible personal property, digital goods, or digital services. The term \"tax\" refers to any charge imposed by a State or local jurisdiction for generating revenue. The term \"State or local jurisdiction\" includes States, the District of Columbia, territories, political subdivisions, and governmental entities authorized to assess taxes. The term \"tax\" refers to any charge imposed by a State or local jurisdiction for generating revenue, excluding taxes on net income or ad valorem taxes. Federal jurisdiction is granted to district courts of the United States to prevent violations of this Act, regardless of the amount in controversy or parties' citizenship. The Act will take effect upon enactment and does not affect tax liabilities accrued before enactment, except as specified. Additionally, the Act includes a provision expressing the Sense of Congress. SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS: States should prevent multiple taxation of digital goods and services when a foreign country has imposed a tax on them.\n\nSEC. 9. SAVINGS PROVISION: If any part of this Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the validity of other provisions."
