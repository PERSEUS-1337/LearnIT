    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Little Rock Central High School Desegregation 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act\". Congress acknowledges the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas in 1957, a significant event in the Civil Rights movement. The bravery of the \"Little Rock Nine\" played a crucial role in promoting equality and changing American history. The desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by 9 African American students was recognized by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a significant event in the Civil Rights movement. A commemorative coin will bring attention to the lasting legacy of this important event. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $1 coins with specific specifications, including weight, diameter, and metal composition. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins minted under this Act will symbolize the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School and its role in civil rights. The design will include the coin's value, the year \"2007\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5 of the Act specifies that coins will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities from a single mint facility starting January 1, 2007. The Secretary can start sales before this date but minting must cease by December 31, 2007. The Secretary will sell coins at a price including face value, surcharge, and production costs. Bulk sales will be discounted, and prepaid orders will also receive a discount. The Secretary will impose a $10 surcharge per coin sold. The surcharge proceeds will be divided equally and paid to the Jefferson National Parks Association for programs at the Little Rock Central High National Historic Site, and to the Secretary of the Interior for site improvements at the same location. The Jefferson National Parks Association will be audited for the amounts received under this section. The surcharges provided are meant to supplement appropriations for the Little Rock Central High National Historic Site, not replace them."
