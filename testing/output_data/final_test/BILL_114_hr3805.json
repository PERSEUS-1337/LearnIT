    "content": "The \"Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2015\" allows for the installation of broadband conduit in highway construction projects. The \"Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2015\" mandates States to assess the need for broadband conduit in highway construction projects in consultation with telecommunications providers. If the evaluation indicates a future need, the conduit must be installed under hard surfaces during the project. The Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2015 requires the installation of broadband conduits under hard surfaces in highway construction projects. The Secretary must ensure the installation of an appropriate number of broadband conduits along the highway, with sizes consistent with industry standards and sufficient to meet demand. Hand holes and manholes for fiber access must also be placed at intervals. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, will establish standards for broadband conduit installation in highway construction projects, considering safety, population density, type of highway, and existing broadband access in the area. The Secretary will ensure that broadband conduits installed in highway construction projects include a pull tape and are placed at a depth consistent with industry best practices. Access to the conduits will be provided to any requesting broadband provider in a competitively neutral manner. The Secretary may waive the application of this section for a covered highway construction project based on undue burden, unnecessary broadband conduit installation, cost-benefit analysis, or other relevant factors. Coordination with the FCC is required in making determinations. The Secretary must work with the Federal Communications Commission to determine broadband conduit needs and availability. Definitions for terms like \"Administrator\" and \"broadband\" are provided in this section. The Secretary is required to provide conduit availability information for the National Broadband Map within a year of enactment. The curr_chunk defines terms related to broadband infrastructure, such as broadband conduit and covered highway construction project. It also defines hard surfaces as part of highway construction projects. The curr_chunk focuses on the inclusion of broadband conduit installation in certain highway construction projects."
