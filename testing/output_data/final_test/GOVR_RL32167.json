    "content": "Allegations of North Korean drug production and trafficking have drawn attention in Congress, the press, and diplomatic circles. Senators questioned why North Korea was not included in the State Department's report on illicit drug activities. Reports indicated North Korea's opium production in 1995 was comparable to Mexico's. The State Department cited difficulties in obtaining data to substantiate these claims. The State Department's response in December 1997 mentioned challenges in verifying North Korean opium production levels. In October 1998, the President was directed to include information on North Korea's opium cultivation and production in the INCSR report. A Senate Bill introduced in January 1999 expressed concern over the State Department's handling of North Korea's drug activities. The Department of State has been cautious in labeling North Korea as a state sponsor of drug trafficking. The State Department has been cautious in labeling North Korea as a state sponsor of drug trafficking due to challenges in verifying opium production levels. The Department of State has maintained that the extent of North Korean involvement in manufacturing and trafficking illegal drugs remains uncertain. This uncertainty raises concerns about imposing foreign aid sanctions on the Pyongyang regime based on unverified information. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 requires countries with 1,000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy to undergo annual drug reporting and certification. The President must report to Congress by September 15 on major drug transit or producing countries, designating those that have \"failed demonstrably\" in counternarcotics efforts. These designated countries may be ineligible for foreign assistance unless deemed vital to U.S. national interest or if substantial counternarcotics improvements have been made. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 requires countries with significant illicit opium poppy cultivation to report annually on drug activities. Countries failing in counternarcotics efforts may lose foreign aid, except for humanitarian assistance. North Korea's aid is limited due to its support for terrorism, with only food aid allowed. Petroleum assistance was suspended in 2002. In 1994, the U.S. agreed to provide oil and wheat to North Korea in exchange for suspending its nuclear weapons program. North Korea's legal exports in 2003 were valued at $1.1 billion, with imports totaling $2 billion, resulting in a shortfall of $999 million. North Korea's need for hard currency is worsened by poor economic conditions and a costly nuclear program. President George W. Bush raised concerns about North Korea's involvement in drug trafficking and demanded they stop all criminal activities. Despite no recent drug seizures linked to North Korea, the US remains wary of their state-directed criminal activities. The United States Government has expressed concerns about North Korea's state-directed criminal activities, including drug trafficking and passing counterfeit U.S. notes. There have been at least 50 arrests and drug seizures involving North Koreans in over 20 countries since 1976. The Department of State's 2006 report highlights North Korea's involvement in drug trafficking and other criminal activities, including counterfeiting and trading copyrighted products. While there were no specific incidents reported in 2006, the government still believes that North Korea likely sponsors criminal activities like narcotics production. The North Korean government is involved in criminal activities such as narcotics production and trafficking to earn foreign currency. Reports indicate a connection to drug trafficking, with North Korean boats transporting heroin and methamphetamine. The North Korean government is suspected of cultivating opium, refining heroin, and manufacturing methamphetamine as a state-organized activity for trafficking and earning foreign exchange. Reports suggest links to drug trafficking, money laundering through Macau, and involvement in illegal businesses like gold smuggling and trafficking of endangered species. North Korean officials are increasingly involved in financial crimes such as trafficking counterfeit currency, rare earth metals, and endangered species. Concerns over North Korea's role in international drug trafficking were highlighted in a 2000 US Government report, indicating a significant amount of methamphetamine consumed in Japan originates from North Korea. Reports suggest North Korea engages in drug trafficking as a criminal enterprise to generate revenue, primarily targeting Japan, Russia, and China. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) expressed concerns over North Korean drug production and trafficking in their 1997 report. They noted that North Korean officials have been apprehended trying to smuggle drugs produced elsewhere. The Board also mentioned that the Government of North Korea had not accepted their proposal to send a mission to study drug control issues. In June 2002, a mission was sent to review the Government's compliance with international drug control treaties. The INCB expressed concerns about North Korean drug production and trafficking in 1997. A mission was sent in 2002 to review the DPRK's compliance with international drug control treaties. Reports show a pattern of drug trafficking by North Korean diplomats over the past 27 years, with over 50 incidents in 20 countries since 1976. Reports indicate that North Korea has been involved in drug production and trafficking for several decades, with over 50 incidents in 20 countries since 1976. The regime established \"Bureau No. 39\" to generate foreign currency through illicit activities such as drug trafficking, counterfeiting, and smuggling. This is seen as a response to the country's struggling economy and the impact of economic sanctions imposed since the Korean War. Bureau 39 in North Korea engages in drug production, trafficking, counterfeiting, and smuggling to earn foreign currency. The cash hoard generated is used to buy loyalty, fund diplomatic missions, finance national security activities, and procure components for weapons programs. It is estimated that around $5 billion is currently stashed away by the Pyongyang regime. North Korea's Bureau 39 engages in drug production, including opium cultivation. Estimates suggest opium cultivation areas ranged from 4,000 to 7,000 hectares in the 1990s, with production declining due to poor policies and agricultural output. In 1998, cultivation was estimated at 3,000-4,000 hectares. U.S. sources estimated North Korea's raw opium production capacity at 50 tons annually, with 40 tons produced in 1995. Estimates in 2000 ranged from 4,200 to 7,000 hectares, yielding 30 to 44 metric tons of opium. North Korean opium cultivation areas ranged from 4,000 to 7,000 hectares in the 1990s, with production declining due to poor policies. North Korea's pharmaceutical labs can process 100 tons of raw opium annually. Methamphetamine production started in 1996 after a decrease in income from poppy production. North Korea was the source of approximately 1/3 of the methamphetamine seized by Japanese authorities in 2002. North Korea's maximum methamphetamine production capacity is estimated to be 10-15 tons per year for export. Reports suggest involvement in diverting 20 tons of ephedrine. Concerns exist that North Korea may be using alternate technology for illicit drug production, possibly supported by petroleum assistance. North Korea's illicit drug production is estimated to have generated significant profits, with conservative estimates suggesting $85 million in 1997. Recent estimates indicate a substantial increase in drug exports, with annual profits reaching at least $500 million in 2003. Additionally, profits from methamphetamine and heroin trade are estimated at $200 million, while income from counterfeiting U.S. bills is unclear. U.S. military sources suggest counterfeiting income was $15-20 million in 2001. North Korea's illicit drug production has been profitable, with estimates suggesting $85 million in 1997 and increasing to at least $500 million in 2003. The government has been involved in buying and selling illicit drugs since the 1970s, cultivating opium poppy in the mid-1970s, refining opium for export in the mid-1980s, and manufacturing methamphetamine in the mid-1990s. The government may be enlisting foreign criminal groups for smuggling operations. The government of North Korea may respond to financial pressures and expanding methamphetamine markets by increasing drug trafficking activity. However, the reliability of information from defectors and South Korean sources is questioned due to the closed nature of North Korea. North Korean officials dismiss reports of government involvement in drug trafficking as slander. They acknowledge that corruption and criminal activities are prevalent in all societies. North Korean officials deny state involvement in drug trafficking, attributing criminal activity to individuals. They emphasize that offenders are punished, and drug-related issues are internal matters. U.N. officials note the politically charged nature of allegations against North Korea and highlight drug smuggling in the diplomatic community. Over fifty documented drug trafficking incidents are linked to North Korea, including allegations of state sponsorship of drug production and trafficking. The sponsorship of opium poppy cultivation, heroin, and methamphetamine production by North Korea raises significant issues for the United States and its allies in combating international drug trafficking. The challenge for policymakers is how to pursue sound counter-drug policy while complying with U.S. law, which may require cutting off aid to North Korea. This is particularly concerning as reports suggest North Korea may be prioritizing drug crop production over food crops, although the acreage involved is small. The use of profits from North Korean drug trafficking to fund nuclear and missile programs is a rising concern. Policy debate over DPRK illicit poppy production lacks hard data like satellite imagery. Enhanced law enforcement efforts have made it harder for North Korean entities to engage in illicit smuggling activities. The need for North Korean trafficking fronts to enter joint ventures with criminal organizations in neighboring nations like Russian, Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese criminal enterprises has increased smuggling activities. The \"Pong Su\" case in April 20, 2003, involving a North Korean crew on a North Korean vessel carrying Southeast Asian heroin, demonstrates this joint venture activity. This partnership may require the level of North Korean drug smuggling to double to maintain income levels for DPRK illicit drug enterprises. The \"Pong Su\" case in April 20, 2003, showed joint venture relationships between North Korean enterprises and foreign criminal groups, indicating a two-way street for drug smuggling. Concerns are rising about ties between DPRK criminals and transnational groups, despite few recent instances of detected drug trafficking. Analysts note that the scale of North Korean drug activities since 2003 is small compared to previous years. Two incidents involving DPRK officials stationed abroad at embassies were reported, the first in several years. The March 2006 INCSR reported no seizures of methamphetamines in Japan in 2005 linked to the DPRK, despite traditionally high percentages. Speculation suggests that DPRK source methamphetamine may be mistakenly identified as \"Chinese source\" due to growing links of Chinese criminal elements to North Korea's drug activities. The March 2005 INCSR noted a decline in DPRK drug production/trafficking, with heroin and methamphetamine seized in Taiwan in 2004 generally ascribed to domestic manufacture. Japanese press reports also mention government officials in Japan discussing this issue. In early 2006, there were no seizures of DPRK source stimulants for the third consecutive year in Japan. However, in December 2006, 14 kilograms of narcotics believed to be of DPRK origin were seized in Yokohama from a ship that arrived from Dalian, China. Chinese mafia figures claim that Japanese yakuza members are buying DPRK source methamphetamine directly in China, leading to an increase in drug trafficking between China and the DPRK since 2002. Despite lack of recent seizures involving DPRK drugs, press reports in early 2007 mention earlier arrests. Press reports in early 2007 mention arrests in China of North Korean nationals involved in trafficking methamphetamine. Chinese police arrested individuals connected to an international drug ring that trafficked large quantities of methamphetamine into China. These were the first public cases of DPRK nationals' involvement in drug trafficking in two years. The increase in international scrutiny has led to changes in North Korean drug trafficking patterns, making it difficult to determine trends. It is possible that North Korea has reduced drug trafficking and focused on counterfeit cigarettes to compensate for lost income. However, overall, there has been an expansion in North Korean criminal activities over the past decade. North Korean criminal activities have expanded in scale and scope, including production and trafficking of drugs, counterfeit cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, currency, and small arms. Estimates suggest DPRK earns $500 million annually from criminal activities, with some sources indicating revenues of $1 billion or more. Criminal ventures play a crucial role in supporting North Korea's economy, with activities on the rise. The scale and scope of North Korean criminal activities are increasing globally. Analysts are concerned about Pyongyang's control over decentralized drug smuggling and foreign currency generating activities involving foreign criminal organizations. Economic deterioration and corruption among DPRK party functionaries suggest rogue operations are growing. Policymakers face challenges in curbing illicit drug activity and other criminal enterprises in North Korea. North Korean drug trafficking and other criminal activities are a growing concern, with fears that it may spiral out of control. Those involved in such illicit activities are unlikely to stop without severe consequences, and over time, these activities may become institutionalized, making it difficult to curb them."
