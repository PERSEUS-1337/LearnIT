    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Juvenile Crime Avoidance and Prevention Act of 1996\". It pertains to Federal Juvenile Proceedings. The \"Juvenile Crime Avoidance and Prevention Act of 1996\" amends Chapter 403 of title 18, United States Code, by introducing a new section for initial intake screening and referrals to youth development specialists for at-risk juveniles. An appropriate Federal authority designated by the Attorney General will conduct an initial intake screening of juveniles taken into custody to determine if they are at risk. If deemed at risk, the juvenile will be referred to a youth development specialist promptly. The screening body determines if a juvenile is at risk based on factors like school behavior and family problems. If deemed at risk, the juvenile is referred to a youth development specialist promptly. Family problems such as death, incarceration, financial difficulties, divorce, child abuse, and substance abuse, as well as runaway tendencies, delinquent activities, gang participation, and other approved factors by the National Institute of Justice, are considered in determining juvenile recidivism risk. Juvenile recidivism risk factors include family problems, delinquent activities, and gang participation. A youth development specialist is designated by a court to assess and counsel juveniles involved in the criminal system. The specialist must have relevant experience and understanding of juvenile criminal issues. A specialist in the juvenile criminal system assesses and plans interventions to prevent further criminal behavior and facilitate the successful reintegration of the juvenile into their community and school. They convene community group meetings to determine appropriate actions for the juvenile, provide written reports with recommendations for court proceedings. The specialist in the juvenile criminal system assesses the juvenile, meets with parents and community members, and provides assistance to implement recommendations for preventing recidivism. The specialist in the juvenile criminal system works with guardians and community groups to implement recommended actions, monitor the juvenile's progress through the court system, act as a liaison to the juvenile's family and community group, and maintain contact with the juvenile during custody, court proceedings, incarceration, and after release. The specialist in the juvenile criminal system may pay for expenses to implement recommendations, such as tutors, counselors, and incentive programs for academic achievement, with a limit of $10,000 annually from appropriated funds. The juvenile criminal system specialist can use funds for various purposes, including educational materials, community activities, parenting instruction, and other expenses approved by the court to stabilize the juvenile's life and steer them away from crime. Up to 20% of the funds can be used for salaries and administration. The juvenile's community group includes their parents or guardians. The juvenile's community group includes parents, extended family, teachers, clergy, coaches, friends, and interested parties. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the United States Code. The Attorney General will collect data on the effects of screening and youth specialist activities, including costs compared to incarceration, recidivism rates, and rehabilitation of at-risk juveniles. This data will be made available to States, localities, and the public as part of the grant program for at-risk juveniles. TITLE II--GRANT PROGRAM FOR AT RISK JUVENILES\n\nSEC. 201.
