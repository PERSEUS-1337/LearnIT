    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"USDA Debarment Act of 1993\". Congress finds that several Secretaries of Agriculture have failed to comply with Executive Order No. 12549, allowing companies that violate Department of Agriculture regulations to continue participating in programs and receive billions of dollars in benefits. The Act defines key terms such as Department, Executive agency, final determination, and material violation. Nonprocurement debarment is an action that bars a person from Department programs involving Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance, excluding certain programs like Federal procurement and conservation programs. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, and other legal entities participating in Department programs. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT. Initiation of Proceedings.--If the Secretary receives notice of a material violation of a Department regulation, they must start a nonprocurement debarment proceeding within 180 days if there is sufficient reason. This reason can include violating relevant laws affecting Department programs. If the Secretary needs more time to investigate a person's actions related to a material violation, they can extend the 180-day period for initiating a nonprocurement debarment proceeding. SEC. 5. NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT PROCEEDINGS. After determining the need for a nonprocurement debarment proceeding, the Secretary must provide the accused individual with full notice of the allegations, an informal hearing with due process procedures, a decision on any material violations, and the length of debarment. Those found guilty of material violations will be barred from participating in the relevant program or activity. (c) Previous Debarment.--A person previously debarred by another Executive agency or under a nonprocurement debarment proceeding, found to have committed a material violation based on separate factual occurrences, will be permanently debarred from Department programs. Prior to judicial review, the individual must exhaust all administrative procedures and receive final determination notice from the Secretary. The Secretary may reduce or eliminate debarment periods for individuals who acted in good faith. Nonprocurement debarment actions will be coordinated and consolidated within the Department. This Act takes precedence over any conflicting administrative debarment procedures. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will report on the appropriateness of a consistent debarment policy for all Executive agencies within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, regulations will be established regarding procurement and nonprocurement debarment. SEC. 7. REGULATIONS. The Secretary must issue regulations within 30 days of the Act's enactment to ensure compliance with Executive Order No. 12549. A rulemaking proceeding will be initiated to implement the Act, identifying affected agencies, specifying reasons for debarment proceedings, outlining procedures, guidelines for material violations, and administrative actions against violators. The authority provided by this Act will end on September 30, 1999."
