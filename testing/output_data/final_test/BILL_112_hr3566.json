An action for a deficiency judgment on a residential mortgage must be brought within 12 months of the foreclosure sale or as provided by state law. If no action is taken during this period, the proceeds from the foreclosure sale satisfy the mortgage obligation. Securing repayment of the mortgage obligation, regardless of the amount, within a specified period after foreclosure sale satisfies the mortgage, and no deficiency action can be pursued after that time. Requirement of commercially reasonable sale for deficiency judgments under residential mortgages includes conducting the sale in a recognized market, ensuring the sale price is current, and following reasonable commercial practices. Adversely affected parties can challenge the commercial reasonableness of the sale and associated costs in court. SEC. 5. AMOUNT. The total amount recovered by a plaintiff in a deficiency judgment from a residential mortgage includes the obligation owed under the mortgage, prior mortgages, liens, and costs of the action, minus the fair market value of the property. The fair market value of a property in a deficiency judgment can be determined by an independent appraisal or the sale price at foreclosure. A party can submit evidence to establish the property's value. SEC. 6. PROHIBITIONS ON DEFICIENCY JUDGMENTS.
