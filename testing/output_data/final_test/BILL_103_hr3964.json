    "content": "The \"Santa Fe National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 1994\" modifies and expands the boundary of the Santa Fe National Forest as depicted on a map dated July 19, 1994. The map is available for public inspection in the office of the Chief, Forest Service, Washington, DC. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to exchange public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management for private lands depicted on a map. Upon acquisition, the exchanged lands are withdrawn from various forms of entry and disposal under public land laws. Additionally, there is an interchange of federal lands in New Mexico. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior will identify federally-owned lands in the Santa Fe National Forest for transfer to the Bureau of Land Management. The Secretary of Agriculture will transfer the identified lands to the Bureau of Land Management upon publication in the Federal Register. The Santa Fe National Forest boundary will be modified to exclude lands transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, which will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management as part of public lands. Lands acquired for the Forest Service will be added to the Santa Fe National Forest. Upon acquisition, the identified areas will be added to the Santa Fe National Forest and managed to preserve open space and scenic values, precluding development. The modified boundary will be treated as if it were established in 1965 for funding purposes. SEC. 5. SAVINGS PROVISION. The Secretary of Agriculture retains authority to acquire lands in New Mexico by purchase or exchange, managing them as part of the National Forest System. SEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION. Land transfers will follow agreed procedures between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 7. SEARCH AND RESCUE. Mechanical transport is allowed in emergencies within Santa Fe National Forest as per the Wilderness Act. The House of Representatives passed the bill on August 8, 1994."
