    "content": "The \"Responsible Use of Coal Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Definitions are provided in Section 2. The \"Responsible Use of Coal Act of 2009\" defines \"carbon capture and storage technology\" as an advanced concept to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants and industrial sources, and use it for beneficial purposes. It also defines \"carbon capture technology\" as any technology to capture carbon dioxide. The term \"carbon capture technology\" includes precombustion, post-combustion, or oxy-combustion processes. Enhanced oil and natural gas recovery involves using carbon dioxide to improve oil or gas extraction. Precombustion technology refers to coal or coal-biomass gasification with carbon dioxide storage. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The section discusses the purposes outlined in the document. The Act aims to promote the responsible use of coal resources in the US through research and development of carbon capture and storage technologies and advanced coal power generation. It also seeks to export these technologies to countries like China and India and support their deployment by quantifying risks and establishing appropriate measures. The Act aims to establish a framework for managing liabilities related to carbon capture and storage technology projects, including the capture, transportation, siting, design, operation, closure, and long-term stewardship of carbon dioxide storage facilities. The Act establishes programs for managing liabilities related to carbon capture and storage technology projects. The Act establishes a research and development program through the National Energy Technology Laboratory to advance carbon capture and storage technologies in coal power generation. This program includes a commercial demonstration program. The National Energy Technology Laboratory will conduct a large-scale commercial demonstration program to assess carbon capture and storage technologies. The Secretary will also initiate research and development programs to evaluate and improve carbon capture technologies and options for carbon dioxide storage in geological formations. The Secretary will evaluate options for carbon dioxide storage in geological formations for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery and to improve the performance of carbon capture and storage technologies. Additionally, a research and development program will be conducted to assess advanced clean coal power generation technologies for efficient power generation and carbon dioxide capture and storage. The Federal government will provide cost-sharing for projects related to advanced clean coal power generation technologies, including turbines, fuel cells, hydrogen production, and gasification. The Federal share of project costs will be up to 50% for projects under the commercial demonstration program and up to 80% for projects under other programs. Authorization of appropriations for projects related to advanced clean coal power generation technologies. Authorization of appropriations for commercial demonstration and research and development programs related to advanced clean coal power generation technologies, with specific funding amounts allocated for fiscal years 2010 to 2013. Authorization of appropriations for commercial demonstration and research and development programs related to advanced clean coal power generation technologies, with specific funding amounts allocated for fiscal years 2010 to 2013, including $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, $225,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $225,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, $270,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2013 for the research and development program under section 4(a)(6)."
