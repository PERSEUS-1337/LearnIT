    "title": "AB 1146",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 115800 of the Health and Safety Code requires operators of skateboard parks to ensure that individuals wear helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads while riding. For facilities owned by local public agencies that are unsupervised, compliance can be met by the adoption of an ordinance mandating protective gear for skateboarders. (2) Signs must be posted at the facility requiring individuals riding skateboards or other wheeled recreational devices to wear helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads. Failure to comply may result in citation. \"Local public agency\" includes cities, counties, or city and county. \"Other wheeled recreational device\" refers to nonmotorized bicycles, scooters, in-line skates, roller skates, or wheelchairs. Riding these devices at a public skateboard park owned or operated by a public entity is considered a hazardous recreational activity if specific conditions are met. The liability of a public entity is not limited by this section for injuries caused by stunt riding on skateboards or other wheeled recreational devices at a public skateboard park on compliant public property. This section does not affect other legal rights, defenses, or immunities available at law. For public skateboard parks constructed before January 1, 1998, hazardous recreational activity injuries are covered from 1998 to 2001. For parks built after January 1, 1998, injuries are covered from 1998 onwards. Parks constructed between 1996 and 1998 are covered from 2012 for hazardous recreational activity injuries. The local public agency must keep records of injuries and claims related to skateboarding in public parks. Records must be filed annually with the Assembly and Senate Judiciary Committees. This requirement does not apply to parks built before 1998 after January 1, 2001. Section 115800 of the Health and Safety Code mandates that operators of skateboard parks must ensure individuals wear helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads while riding skateboards in the park. This requirement applies to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2016, for wheeled recreational devices in skateboard facilities built after January 1, 1996. The section is set to be repealed on January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute enacted before that date. Operators of skateboard parks must ensure individuals wear helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads while riding skateboards. Local public agencies can comply by adopting an ordinance and posting signs at the facility. The term \"local public agency\" includes cities, counties, or city and county entities. Riding a skateboard at a public skateboard park owned or operated by a public entity is considered a hazardous recreational activity if the rider is 12 years or older, the injury was caused by stunt, trick, or luge riding, and the park complies with certain requirements on public property. The skateboard park is on public property that complies with certain requirements. This section does not limit the liability of a public entity with respect to any other duty imposed by existing law. It does not abrogate or limit any other legal rights, defenses, or immunities available at law. For public skateboard parks constructed before January 1, 1998, this subdivision applies to injuries from hazardous recreational activities between 1998 and 2001. For parks built after January 1, 1998, it applies to injuries from 1998 onwards. For parks constructed between 1996 and 1998, it applies to injuries from 2012 onwards. A movable skateboard facility is considered constructed when first available for use by the local public agency. The local public agency must keep records of injuries and claims related to skateboard incidents in public parks. Records must be submitted annually to the Assembly and Senate Judiciary Committees. The subdivision applies to parks built before 1998 for injuries between 1998-2001, and for parks built after 1998, it applies to injuries from 1998 onwards. For parks built between 1996-1998, it applies to injuries from 2012 onwards. This section will be effective starting January 1, 2020."
