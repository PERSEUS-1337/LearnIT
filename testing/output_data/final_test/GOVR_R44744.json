    "content": "Congressional actions since 2011 have focused on changing the EPA's authority to regulate emissions, particularly greenhouse gases. EPA has used Clean Air Act authority to address emissions issues, with a focus on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is the most prevalent gas, accounting for 80% of annual emissions. EPA has faced concerns from both sides of Congress regarding GHG regulations and their economic impacts. Four sets of GHG standards have been finalized for power plants, oil and gas industry, trucks, and light-duty vehicles. Some argue that the case for GHG controls is unproven, while others suggest delaying action until Congress explicitly authorizes it. The EPA conducted a Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) of the 2022-2025 GHG standards for light-duty vehicles in January 2017. Controversy has arisen under the Trump Administration regarding these standards, which were initially supported by auto manufacturers and stakeholders during the Obama Administration. Agreements were reached with major U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers, the state of California, and other stakeholders for GHG emission and fuel economy standards in 2009 and 2012. EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation were involved in setting these standards. The U.S. Department of Transportation and California would establish \"One National Program\" for GHG emissions and fuel economy, supported by the auto industry to avoid state-by-state standards. The second round of GHG standards for cars and light trucks aims to reduce emissions by 50% compared to 2010 levels, with fuel economy reaching nearly 50 mpg by 2025. EPA committed to a Mid-Term Evaluation for the MY2022-2025 standards by April 2018 due to the long time frame involved. The EPA conducted a Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) to determine the appropriateness of the MY2022-2025 standards, ultimately deciding to retain them as originally promulgated after considering input from various stakeholders and technical reports. The EPA conducted a Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) and decided to retain the MY2022-2025 standards, despite critics calling for potential revisions. The Administration reopened the MTE in mid-March 2017 and released a revised final determination on April 2, 2018. In 2018, the EPA revised the MY2022-2025 standards, deeming them inappropriate and proposing to freeze fuel economy and GHG emission standards at the 2020 level through MY2026. This would result in an estimated average fuel economy of 37 mpg for vehicles during that period, with an increase in fuel consumption of about 0.5 million barrels per day. The proposed standards are open to public comment for 60 days. The EPA and DOT have finalized joint GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks on August 16, 2016. The new standards cover MY2018-2027 for certain trailers and MY2021-2027 for semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses, and work trucks. The Phase 2 standards are expected to lower CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons, save $170 billion in fuel costs, and reduce oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels. The Phase 2 standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks are projected to cost $29-$31 billion over the lifetime of MY2018-2029 trucks. The standards will increase the cost of a long haul tractor-trailer by up to $13,500 in MY2027, but the buyer would recoup the investment in fuel-efficient technology in less than two years through fuel savings. Fuel consumption of 2027 model tractor-trailers is expected to decline by 34% as a result of the rule, which has been well-received by industry stakeholders. The final rule on Phase 2 standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks includes input from industry stakeholders such as the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association. The rule aims to harmonize greenhouse gas reductions and fuel efficiency improvements. EPA requested a legal challenge to be held in April 2017. The Court of Appeals granted EPA's request to hold the legal challenge in abeyance for the medium- and heavy-duty vehicles rule. Certain requirements for trailers were stayed pending judicial review, while emission standards for vehicles with \"glider kits\" were established. EPA proposed to repeal the glider kit provisions in November 2017. Power plants are significant sources of U.S. GHG emissions, with EPA finalizing emission standards for them in August 2015. The EPA finalized emission standards for modified fossil-fueled power plants in August 2015, primarily affecting coal-fired units emitting twice the CO2 of natural gas units. The Clean Power Plan sets state-specific goals for CO2 emissions, based on efficiency improvements, NGCC generation, and renewable energy. EPA received over 4 million public comments on the proposed standards, making it the most commented rulemaking in the agency's history. The Clean Power Plan sets state-specific goals for CO2 emissions, allowing states to reach these goals through various options like renewable energy, efficiency programs, and tradeable allowances. States heavily reliant on coal-fired power would have to reduce emissions by a greater percentage. Implementation plans were to be submitted by states in September 2016. The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants rely on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology to reduce emissions by about 20%. Critics argue that CCS is costly and unproven, effectively prohibiting the construction of new coal-fired plants. EPA defended the rule despite the lack of operational CCS facilities in the US. EPA argued that CCS components have been successfully operated for decades, with new fossil-fueled plants likely using NGCC technology due to low natural gas costs. The 114th Congress passed resolutions to disapprove of NSPS and Clean Power Plan in December 2015. President Obama vetoed Congressional Review Act resolutions (S.J.Res. 23 and S.J.Res. 24) aimed at revoking EPA rules on GHG emissions from power plants. These resolutions were part of ongoing efforts by House members to limit EPA's authority in implementing emission requirements for electric generating units. In June 2015, the House passed H.R. 2042 to delay compliance with GHG standards for existing EGUs and allow states to opt out if the rule would harm rate-payers or reliability. The House passed bills to restrict EPA's authority on GHG emission requirements for power plants, but the Senate did not take up the bills. Another option discussed was an appropriations rider to prevent EPA action on GHG emissions. The House passed H.R. 5538 to prevent funds from being used to implement NSPS and Clean Power Plan, but the rider was not included in funding bills. The Consolidated Appropriations Act funded EPA through the fiscal year, with action on the Clean Power Plan being a key topic. The Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the CPP in February 2016, with challenges consolidated into a single case in West Virginia v. EPA. The D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments in September 2016, but a decision has not been issued yet. President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 on March 28, 2017, directing EPA to review the Clean Power Plan and other regulations for consistency with energy development policies. EPA proposed repealing the CPP on October 16, 2017, and issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for public input. The EPA is considering repealing the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and replacing it with new emission reduction systems. This process involves administrative steps, potential opposition from stakeholders, and the possibility of judicial review. Congress could also intervene through legislation, but a filibuster in the Senate may hinder this. Additionally, the EPA has already set controls for methane emissions through the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). The EPA is proposing new controls under the Clean Air Act to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, aiming to reduce emissions by 40%-45% from 2012 levels by 2025 as part of the Climate Action Plan. The EPA aims to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% from 2005 levels by 2025, with a focus on methane emissions from oil and natural gas activities. EPA projects that new standards will cut methane emissions by 510,000 tons in 2025, equivalent to reducing 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The estimated cost of implementing the standards is $530 million, with significant climate benefits. In 2025, EPA estimated the costs and climate benefits of the proposed NSPS rule. The rule aims to reduce emissions of VOCs and hazardous air pollutants. EPA is reviewing the rule under E.O. 13783 and has proposed a two-year stay during the review process. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated a 90-day stay of portions of the rule on July 3, 2017. The D.C. Circuit vacated the 90-day stay on July 3, 2017, concluding that EPA did not have the authority to issue it. The rule is now in effect while EPA conducts its review. Air quality has improved significantly since the Clean Air Act in 1970, with emissions of six air pollutants declining by over 70%. Despite this progress, clean air goals are still challenging to achieve due to tighter EPA standards based on evolving scientific understanding of air pollution's health effects. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) every five years. Studies have linked air pollution to illness and premature mortality, with ozone and fine particles being the most widespread air quality issues. As of June 30, 2018, 107 million people lived in areas classified as \"nonattainment\" for ozone NAAQS, and 23 million lived in areas nonattainment for fine particle NAAQS. EPA identifies areas with pollution levels exceeding NAAQS and conducts Integrated Science Assessments and Risk Analyses to review NAAQS. Since 2008, the review of NAAQS for ozone has been controversial. The standards were made more stringent, but the Administrator chose a health-based standard outside the recommended range. EPA suspended the 2008 standard in 2009 to consider further strengthening it. President Obama requested the EPA Administrator to withdraw the final rule in 2011. President Obama requested the EPA Administrator to withdraw the all-but-final ozone standards in 2011. The EPA missed the deadline for the review in March 2013, but released the final standards on October 1, 2015, which have been challenged in court. The 2015 revision of ozone standards set more stringent levels at 70 parts per billion, with 213 counties in 32 states showing nonattainment. EPA's final designation decisions in 2018 identified 201 counties and 2 tribal areas as nonattainment. EPA estimated the cost of meeting a 70 ppb ozone standard in nonattainment counties, with California having separate cost estimates. The cost estimates are lower than industry sources' estimates. Members of Congress are interested in whether the benefits of the new ozone standards will justify the costs. The EPA prepares cost and benefit estimates for ozone NAAQS to comply with Executive Order 12866. The Clean Air Act prohibits weighing costs against benefits in setting standards, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2001. The EPA Administrator is required to set the primary standard for protecting public health without considering economic factors. The court determined that cost considerations are not allowed in the process of setting NAAQS. Cost-effectiveness is considered in selecting emission control options, but when determining the level of pollution that poses a health threat, costs cannot be taken into account. The 2015 ozone review results have attracted Congress's attention, leading to the introduction of multiple bills to modify EPA's authority. Bills like H.R. 806 and S. 263 aim to delay nonattainment area designations and State Implementation Plans submission, while also proposing NAAQS reviews every 10 years. H.R. 806, similar to a previous bill, passed the House in 2017. The House passed H.R. 806 and H.R. 3354 in 2017. Section 432 of H.R. 3354 would delay the implementation of the 2015 ozone NAAQS until the mid-2020s. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was highlighted as a tool to override EPA regulatory actions during the 115th Congress with Republican majorities. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was considered as a tool to override EPA regulations during the 115th Congress. A list of major rules promulgated after June 13, 2016, included Clean Air Act rules such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program Standards for 2017 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2018. The CRA's fast track authority expired on May 11, 2017, without any rules being disapproved. In the 115th Congress, the House Energy and Commerce Committee reported three bills overturning specific EPA air regulations: H.R. 1917 (BRICK Act) delaying emission standards for brick manufacturers, H.R. 1119 (SENSE Act) easing emission limits for coal-powered units, and H.R. 453 delaying wood heater emission standards. The House passed H.R. 1119 and a combined bill on March 8, 2018. These bills address industry criticism of previous EPA administrations. The EPA's Clean Air Act standards are often challenged in court by industry and environmental groups, with uncertainty surrounding possible changes in regulations. The 115th Congress and EPA may make revisions to address criticisms from industry and public health groups. The structure faces uncertainty in 2018, with potential changes from the executive, legislative, and judicial branches."
