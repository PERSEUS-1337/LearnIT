    "content": "The \"Expanding Industrial Energy Efficiency Incentives Act of 2009\" includes amendments to the 1986 Code related to energy efficiency incentives such as modifications in credits for combined heat and power systems, motor energy efficiency improvements, replacement of CFC refrigerant chillers, and credits for qualifying efficient industrial process water use projects. MODIFICATIONS IN CREDIT FOR COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM PROPERTY. Modification of capacity limitations in section 48(c)(3) includes increasing the limits for megawatts and horsepower. Nonapplication of certain rules for determining combined heat and power system property is also addressed. The amendments made by this section apply to periods after the enactment date of this Act, following rules similar to section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 45R. MOTOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT TAX CREDIT is added to the tax code to provide a credit for improving motor energy efficiency. The motor energy efficiency improvement tax credit is $120 multiplied by the motor horsepower of newly designed or upgraded appliances, machines, or equipment with advanced motor systems. For systems with less than 10 horsepower, the credit is prorated based on the total horsepower. The tax credit for motor energy efficiency improvement is based on the motor horsepower of appliances with advanced motor systems. The credit is capped at $2,000,000 per taxpayer for all taxable years. The tax credit for motor energy efficiency improvement is capped at $2,000,000 per taxpayer for all prior taxable years. Aggregation rules apply to treat certain persons as a single taxpayer. Special rules include basis reduction for credited property, no double benefits, and disallowance of credits for property used outside the United States. The tax credit for motor energy efficiency improvement is capped at $2,000,000 per taxpayer for all prior taxable years. Special rules apply, including basis reduction for credited property, no double benefits, and disallowance of credits for property used outside the United States. This section does not apply to property manufactured or placed back into service before 6 months after enactment or after December 31, 2013. Conforming amendments are made to sections 38(b) and 1016(a) to include the motor energy efficiency improvement tax credit. The tax credit for motor energy efficiency improvement is capped at $2,000,000 per taxpayer for all prior taxable years. Special rules apply, including basis reduction for credited property, no double benefits, and disallowance of credits for property used outside the United States. This section does not apply to property manufactured or placed back into service before 6 months after enactment or after December 31, 2013. Conforming amendments are made to sections 38(b) and 1016(a) to include the motor energy efficiency improvement tax credit. The tax credit for motor energy efficiency improvement is capped at $2,000,000 per taxpayer for all prior taxable years. Special rules apply, including basis reduction for credited property, no double benefits, and disallowance of credits for property used outside the United States. This section does not apply to property manufactured or placed back into service before 6 months after enactment or after December 31, 2013. Conforming amendments are made to sections 38(b) and 1016(a) to include the motor energy efficiency improvement tax credit. The amendments made by this section shall apply to property manufactured or placed back into service after the date which is 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act. The CFC chiller replacement credit under section 38 is $150 multiplied by the tonnage rating of a replaced chiller, plus $100 multiplied by tonnage downsizing if new efficient chillers with variable frequency drives are used. A CFC chiller is defined as property installed between 1980 and 1993, using chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, and in operation until replaced. The tax credit for replacing a CFC chiller with a new efficient chiller is based on the tonnage rating of the old chiller and any tonnage downsizing. An energy audit is required before installation to identify cost-effective energy-saving measures. The tax credit for replacing a CFC chiller with a new efficient chiller is subject to criteria set by the Secretary of Energy. If a tax-exempt entity replaces a CFC chiller with a new efficient chiller, the seller must disclose the credit amount and certify to the Secretary that the price was reduced by the credit. This section does not apply to replacements made after December 31, 2012. The tax credit for replacing a CFC chiller with a new efficient chiller is subject to criteria set by the Secretary of Energy. Conforming amendments are made to section 38(b) and the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to replacements made after the enactment of this Act. A new qualifying efficient industrial process water use project credit is added to Section 46, with the amount of credit determined in Section 48D. The qualifying efficient industrial process water use project credit is determined by the applicable percentage of the qualified investment for the taxable year. The applicable percentage varies based on the project's net energy consumption and the date it is placed in service. The qualifying efficient industrial process water use project credit is based on the net energy consumption of the project. The credit ranges from 20% to 30% depending on the energy efficiency achieved. The qualified investment is the basis of eligible property placed in service as part of the project. The section discusses rules related to permitting, land acquisition, and infrastructure for sourcing or water discharge in qualifying efficient industrial process water use projects. Rules similar to those of section 46 and 48(a)(4) apply, with limitations on the amount treated for taxable years. The qualifying efficient industrial process water use project at any site must not exceed $10,000,000. It involves replacing or modifying water or steam systems in manufacturing to achieve a minimum 20% reduction. The qualifying efficient industrial process water use project requires a reduction of at least 20% in water withdrawal and 10% in water discharge compared to existing water use at the site. Eligible property includes any necessary property for achieving these reductions. The term 'net energy consumption' refers to the energy consumed in relation to industrial water use, normalized per unit of output, and measured according to established rules. The Environmental Protection Agency defines water discharge and water withdrawal in relation to site water usage. This section does not apply after December 31, 2014, with conforming amendments made to section 49(a)(1)(C). Section 49(a)(1)(C) is amended to include a new clause regarding the basis of property in a qualifying efficient industrial use water project under section 48D. Additionally, the table of sections is updated to reflect this change. The amendments made by section 48D apply to periods after January 1, 2011, under rules similar to section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
