    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2018\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. The Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2018 acknowledges pervasive discrimination against LGBT students in public schools, including harassment, bullying, and violence, leading to unequal educational opportunities nationwide. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is highlighted as a severe issue inadequately addressed by current Federal law. Studies show that such discrimination in schools contributes to high rates of negative outcomes. Discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity leads to negative outcomes like absenteeism, academic underachievement, dropping out, and adverse health consequences among LGBT youth. This discrimination can escalate to life-threatening violence and suicide if not addressed promptly. Federal statutory law prohibits discrimination based on various factors, but discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity remains a significant issue in public schools. The absence of express Federal law prohibitions on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has created uncertainty, limiting access to legal remedies for LGBT students and their parents. The purposes of this Act are to ensure all students have a safe, discrimination-free environment in public education. The Act aims to provide explicit Federal prohibition of discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, offer effective remedies for such discrimination, and utilize congressional powers to enforce these protections. The Act aims to prohibit discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, allowing the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to enforce regulations effectively.
