    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Reform Act of 2010\" or the \"Not Too Small to Succeed in Business Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges the importance of small businesses in the US economy, noting that they account for over 99.7% of all employer firms and employ over half of private sector employees. Economically disadvantaged-owned businesses face challenges in accessing capital and support, with less than 7% of venture capital going to them. Small businesses require assistance to stay competitive, especially during tough economic times. The Small Business Administration, established in 1953, aids small businesses to survive and thrive. It assists economically disadvantaged firms through counseling, training, and access to opportunities under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. The Small Business Administration aids small businesses through section 8(a) of the Business Act, but the program has issues with graduating companies unprepared to compete in the private sector due to outdated measures of income and net worth. The Small Business Administration's program for economically disadvantaged companies may hinder their success by relying on outdated measures of income and net worth. This could result in small businesses being kept too small to thrive, similar to protecting companies that are too big to fail. Improvement of the program under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act is addressed in SEC. 3. Extension of eligibility period for small business program under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to 11 years and 7 years, allowing businesses with net worth between $750,000 and $2,250,000 to participate for 2 years after completing a 9-year period prior to enactment. The Small Business Act is amended to increase the net worth and income limitations for Program Participants, allowing individuals with a net worth not exceeding $750,000 for admission and $2,250,000 for continued eligibility. The modified adjusted gross income limit is set at $500,000 for eligibility and continued participation. The Small Business Act is amended to increase net worth and income limits for Program Participants. Small businesses can participate for up to 11 years after graduation if they meet new requirements."
