    "content": "Credit unions are nonprofit financial institutions owned and operated by members, known as natural person credit unions. They return profits to members in the form of share dividends. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the primary federal regulator and insurer for credit unions. The three federal bank prudential regulators are the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve. The NCUA serves all functions for federally regulated credit unions and manages the NCUSIF. Scholars are unsure of the exact origin of the credit union movement. The concept of credit cooperatives dates back to colonial times, initially providing microlending in underserved areas. These cooperatives relied on pooled funds and subsidies before becoming self-sufficient systems. Small memberships allow for peer monitoring of lending decisions and repayment behavior. Credit unions originated from cooperatives promoting thrift and providing low-cost credit after the Great Depression. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 was passed by Congress to create federally chartered financial institutions for promoting thrift and providing credit for productive purposes. Congress later expanded credit unions' activities to adapt to the changing marketplace, allowing them to offer a wider range of services to attract and retain members' savings. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 created federally chartered financial institutions to promote thrift and provide credit. Congress later expanded credit unions' activities to offer a wider range of services. Credit unions are entitled to updated authority to better serve members in a competitive financial environment, benefiting from economies of scale for risk diversification and lower costs per transaction. The Mini Bill of 1977 amended the FCU Act, allowing credit unions to offer various financial products similar to commercial banks. Credit unions primarily focus on consumer and residential lending, with some offering commercial business loans for members. However, their lending and investment powers are more limited compared to commercial banks, as they can only lend to their members, other credit unions, and credit union organizations. There is a statutory interest rate cap for credit union loans, with exceptions to ensure sufficient earnings for credit availability. The lending and investment powers of federally insured credit unions are limited compared to commercial banks. They are restricted to loans, government securities, deposits, and certain other investments. Business lending restrictions include limits on member business loan balances and loan amounts to individual members. Relaxing these restrictions could require greater harmonization of regulatory regimes to protect against financial risk exposures. This report focuses on policy developments related to the credit union system's lending powers. The credit union system has been expanding its lending capacities, particularly in mortgage lending. The system faced financial distress after the 2008 financial crisis but has made progress in improving its resiliency to credit and insolvency risks. Legislation and rules have supported the expansion of lending activities, which is expected to increase cash flows and revenues for credit unions. The credit union system's \"field of membership\" defines who can join based on a common bond. Charters can be single common bond, multiple common bond, or community-based. Credit unions are owned by members who elect a board of directors. They can only lend to members, other credit unions, and credit union organizations. Field of membership restrictions may limit deposit collection. Credit unions, like banks, face vulnerabilities due to restrictions on access to funds. Larger credit unions may overcome limitations by diversifying their depositor base. However, all financial intermediaries are at risk of cash flow disruptions during adverse events. Access to more depositors can enhance stability. Access to more depositors can enhance liquidity management for credit unions and banks. NCUA revised field of membership rules to broaden access to federal credit unions, facing legal challenges from competitors. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the NCUA's revised field of membership rule but remanded two provisions. One provision would have allowed smaller areas to qualify as local communities, potentially impacting poor and minority residents. The second provision would have raised the population limit for rural districts, possibly extending beyond state borders. The NCUA proposed clarifications to reject certain fields of membership applications. The NCUA proposed clarifications to reject fields of membership applications that may exclude low- or moderate-income individuals. Congress established a commercial lending cap in 1998, limiting credit unions to lending no more than 12.25% of their assets to small businesses. The CUMAA aims to amend existing law to strengthen prudential safeguards for federally insured credit unions and restrict commercial business lending. This will ensure credit unions focus on consumer loans to meet the needs of consumers, especially those of modest means. The CUMAA aims to prevent credit unions from allocating resources to large commercial loans that may pose safety concerns and increase the risk of taxpayer losses. It codifies the definition of Member Business Loans (MBLs) and limits the aggregate amount of MBLs that can be made by an individual credit union. The CUMAA aims to prevent credit unions from allocating resources to large commercial loans that may pose safety concerns and increase the risk of taxpayer losses. It codifies the definition of Member Business Loans (MBLs) and limits the aggregate amount of MBLs that can be made by an individual credit union to 1.75 times the minimum net worth amount required to be well-capitalized. Exceptions to the aggregate MBL limit are authorized for credit unions with low-income designations, chartered for business loans, or with a history of primarily making such loans. Additionally, a NCUA regulation limits the aggregate amount of a business loan that can be made to one member or group of associated members. The NCUA replaced a prescriptive approach to Member Business Loans (MBLs) with a principles-based regulatory approach in 2017. This new approach grants credit unions more flexibility and autonomy in the MBL underwriting process, streamlining it and reducing delays. Credit unions must still adhere to prudential underwriting practices and net worth requirements. The NCUA updated MBL exemptions and definitions to facilitate the streamlined underwriting approach. The NCUA revised the definition of Member Business Loans (MBLs) to exclude non-owner occupied real estate loans, such as rental properties, from counting towards the MBL cap. This change was made to address a disparity in the treatment of certain residential real estate loans by credit unions and banks. The EGRRCPA Section 103 amended the MBL definition to exclude rental property loans from the aggregate MBL cap. Additionally, certain rural real estate transactions valued at or below $400,000 are exempt from appraisal requirements if no state-certified appraiser is available. The NCUA increased the appraisal threshold to $1 million for commercial real estate. NCUA increased the commercial real estate appraisal threshold to $1 million, higher than banks' $500,000 threshold. The board had differing opinions due to the banking system's expertise in evaluating commercial lending risks. The credit union industry supports increasing the MBL cap, with potential for larger credit unions to compete with small and midsize banks in the commercial lending market. Increasing the MBL cap would benefit credit unions with a strong presence in commercial lending and a large asset base. Utilizing participation loans can help institutions provide credit jointly, diversify their loan portfolios, and overcome funding limitations. The credit union system can use loans to diversify asset portfolios and compete with banks in commercial lending. However, multiple credit unions participating in loans still pose risks to the NCUSIF. A lending cap may be too high for some credit unions and too low for others, leading to shortages in commercial lending. Some argue that the cap limits credit unions from meeting their members' financial needs. A lending cap is considered \"too low\" by some, as it may not meet the financial needs of credit union members. Instead of a blanket cap, a policy focusing on the costs of originating Member Business Loans (MBLs) could be more effective. This could involve imposing a tax on the net income from MBL activities, such as the Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) for tax-exempt organizations. Credit unions, being not-for-profit entities, are exempt from federal income tax, but revenue from non-member financial services could be subject to UBIT. Implementing the UBIT for Member Business Loans (MBLs) would allow costs to grow in proportion to the amount of MBL activity, providing more flexibility for credit unions. Enhanced capitalization requirements could potentially substitute for an MBL cap, enhancing prudential safety and soundness in the credit union system. The credit union system has evolved to provide financial services but lacks full lending powers compared to banks. Some lending authorities are temporary and need regular renewal. The FCU Act sets a 12% interest rate ceiling for loans, raised to 15% after the DIDMCA. NCUA can set a ceiling above 15% for up to 18 months. The NCUA can set a ceiling above the 15% cap for up to 18 months after consulting with Congress and other federal financial agencies. The current credit union interest rate ceiling is 18% and is calculated as an annual percentage rate (APR) including both interest rates and origination fees. The NCUA raised the ceiling to 21% in 1980 but reduced it to 18% in 1987, maintaining it since then. When setting the interest rate above 15%, the NCUA must review money market interest rate trends and assess potential threats to credit unions' safety and soundness. The NCUA retained the 18% rate ceiling for federally insured credit union loans from March 11, 2020, through September 10, 2021, due to concerns about rising money market rates and adverse trends in liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth. The Military Lending Act of 2006 was passed to protect active duty military personnel and their eligible. The Military Lending Act of 2006 (MLA; P.L. 109-364) limits the Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) to 36% for small-dollar loans and credit products for active duty military personnel and their eligible family members. The MLA does not apply to mortgages, automobile loans, and secured loans. Credit unions typically offer interest rates below the federal MLA cap for covered transactions. The NCUA allows credit unions to offer payday alternative loans (PALs) with restrictions on amount, payment structure, and term length. The Payday Alternative Loans (PALs) program offered by credit unions has specific requirements such as fully amortizing payments, term length between 46 to 180 days, and a maximum application fee of $20. Borrowers can rollover into a new PAL if unable to repay the initial loan, with a limit of three PALs in a six-month period. PALs I requires a one-month membership and has a 28% ceiling exempt from the 36% MAPR ceiling. The PAL loan APR may exceed the MAPR ceiling when including the $20 origination fee. The NCUA granted a PAL exemption from the MAPR to credit unions, allowing for a higher PAL ceiling and excluding the application fee and origination fee from the APR calculation. PALs II offers loans up to $2000 with fully amortizing payments over 1-to-12 months, without a minimum membership length requirement. Credit unions cannot charge overdraft or insufficient funds fees for PALs II, reducing the likelihood of additional fees for borrowers. On September 22, 1959, the FCU Act was amended to increase credit union loan maturities to up to 5 years. In 1968, the Act was further amended to allow unsecured loans with maturities not exceeding 5 years and secured loans with maturities not exceeding 10 years. The Mini Bill of 1977 extended loan maturities to 12 years and allowed credit unions to offer residential real estate loans with maturities up to 30 years. The Garn-St. Germain Act of 1982 extended mortgage loan refinancing and increased maturity limits to 15 years for second mortgages. The CEBA of 1987 authorized NCUA to allow loans beyond 15 years, with a final rule in 1989 extending the limit to 20 years. In 2006, P.L. 109-351 set a 15-year maximum maturity on credit union loans, with exceptions for residential mortgages. H.R. 1661 in the 116th Congress aimed to address loan maturity terms. H.R. 1661 in the 116th Congress aims to amend the FCU Act to allow NCUA flexibility in extending loan maturities, including MBLs and student loans. The NCUSIF, created in 1970, is funded by insured credit unions through premiums, examination fees, and penalties collected by NCUA. Premiums were originally set at one-twelfth of 1% of member share accounts, but P.L. 98-369 required a 1% fund deposit from each federally insured credit union. The NCUSIF collects penalties from insured institutions, which are then deposited into the fund. Reserves consist of a 1% deposit, insurance premiums, fees, and interest earnings. Prudential safety regulations, like holding sufficient capital reserves, reduce insolvency risk and promote public confidence. Higher capital requirements enhance financial firms' ability to absorb losses and strengthen public confidence in their soundness during financial stress. The NCUA has proposed enhanced net worth requirements for credit unions to increase resilience to insolvency risk and minimize losses to the NCUSIF. Credit unions gained more powers in the mortgage market in the late 1970s and 1980s to mitigate interest rate risk. Regulations were adopted in 1978 allowing credit unions to sell mortgage loans in the secondary market. The Garn-St. Germain Act in the late 1970s granted credit unions the authority to sell mortgage loans in the secondary market to various entities. Additionally, the act eliminated limits on mortgage size and maturity, allowed refinancing, and extended maturity limits for second mortgages. The CEBA further expanded credit unions' lending capabilities by authorizing loans beyond 15 years and allowing the issuance and sale of guaranteed securities. In 1988, credit unions were permitted to invest in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to reduce asset duration risk. They were also allowed to use financial derivatives in 1989 to protect against declines in MBS values due to rising interest rates. This increased their exposure to financial risks associated with the mortgage market. During the 2008 financial crisis, credit unions and other financial entities faced distress due to a sharp rise in delinquent mortgage loans. Corporate credit unions, which provide services to retail credit unions, experienced liquidity pressures as the value of their mortgage-backed securities deteriorated. Corporate credit unions provide services to retail credit unions, reducing costs for smaller institutions. Retail credit unions are cooperative owners of corporate credit unions and are federally insured by the NCUSIF. The NCUA placed five corporate credit unions under conservatorship in 2009 and 2010, representing a significant portion of the corporate system's assets and investment losses. The share equity ratio is an indicator of the adequacy of reserves to protect share depositors. The NCUA determines the normal operating level for the share equity ratio, which must be between 1.2% and 1.5%. The equity ratio fell below the statutory minimum to 1.18% by August 2010. The NCUA may assess a premium when the ratio falls between 1.2% and the declared operating level, and must assess a premium if the ratio falls below 1.2%. Congress established a Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund in 2009 to recover losses from corporate credit unions. The NCUA raised assessments on all federally insured credit unions to restore the NCUSIF equity ratio. The TCCUSF closed in October 2017, with assets transferred to the NCUSIF. An equity distribution of $160.1 million was administered to member institutions. Increases in capital requirements were announced on January 23, 2014. On January 23, 2014, the NCUA announced increased capital requirements for complex credit unions, defined as having at least $100 million in assets. On October 29, 2015, the NCUA finalized the risk-based capital rule, introducing a new asset risk-weighting system and a 10% risk-based capital ratio for well-capitalized complex credit unions. Complex credit unions with assets of at least $100 million were required to maintain a 10% risk-based capital ratio to be considered well-capitalized under NCUA regulations. Non-complex credit unions below this threshold were exempt from the new risk-weighting system and only needed to comply with the existing 7% net-worth asset ratio. Credit unions with a high concentration of commercial lending were mandated to hold higher levels of net worth. Compliance with these requirements was necessary by January 1, 2019, to avoid NCUA enforcement actions. The NCUA issued a final rule on December 17, 2019, moving the effective date for complex credit unions' higher net worth requirements to January 1, 2022. The asset threshold for complex credit unions was raised from $100 million to $500 million. Some Members of Congress are monitoring the implementation progress of the risk-based capital rule for credit unions. The NCUA is considering adopting supplemental capital requirements for credit unions to increase lending capacity and introduce a new risk management tool. Three sources of supplemental capital have been proposed, including voluntary patronage capital (VPC) where noninstitutional members can purchase \"equity shares\" in the organization. VPC equity shares would pay dividends and be repaid after reimbursement of the NCUSIF following liquidation of an insolvent credit union. The NCUA is considering supplemental capital requirements for credit unions, including voluntary patronage capital (VPC) where members can purchase equity shares. VPC investors would receive dividends but no voting rights, limited to 5% of net worth. Mandatory membership capital (MMC) is like a membership fee, considered equity but no dividends. Subordinate debt (SD) from external investors functions as a hybrid debt-equity instrument with no voting rights or involvement in managerial affairs. SD investors must commit to a minimum five-year investment with no early redemption option. Credit union advocates argue for lifting lending restrictions to increase available credit pools, while community banks fear expansion beyond mandated mission could threaten financial stability. Congress has amended the FCU Act multiple times to recognize the evolving credit union system as a sophisticated financial intermediary. Following the 2008 financial crisis, federal bank regulators implemented prudential requirements to enhance the U.S. banking system's resiliency. The NCUA has proposed rules to support expanding lending activities for credit unions, potentially increasing profitability. The adoption of enhanced prudential net worth requirements may help mitigate financial risks.
