    "content": "The inclusion of hazardous duty pay and diving pay in the computation of military retired pay for members of the armed forces with extensive hazardous duty experience is addressed in this section. Members with extensive hazardous duty experience may receive an increase in retired pay based on qualifying hazardous duty performed. The increase is calculated by adding hazardous duty special pay to the retired pay amount. Members with extensive hazardous duty experience may receive an increase in retired pay by adding hazardous duty special pay based on the number of months they received such pay. Members with extensive hazardous duty experience may receive an increase in retired pay by adding hazardous duty special pay for at least 60 months. This increase in retired pay is not considered as retired pay for certain purposes. Retainer pay is also included in the definition of retired pay. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections in the chapter is amended by adding a new item at the end. Members with hazardous duty experience may see an increase in retired pay. Comptroller General will study tax credits and small business loan changes to support businesses employing Guard and Reserve members. The Comptroller General will conduct a study to determine if National Guard and Reserve members are overrepresented in businesses, the appropriate Federal tax benefit for these businesses, and potential changes to small business loan programs to support employing Guard and Reserve members called to active duty. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment, containing legislative proposals for a recommended tax benefit and modifications to the small business loan program to support businesses employing National Guard and Reserve members. The Secretary of Defense will provide a report to Congress on expanding Junior ROTC and similar military programs for young people. Congress finds that the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, Civil Air Patrol, Naval Sea Cadet Corps, and Young Marines provide significant benefits for the Armed Forces and there is interest in expanding these programs. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing the feasibility and desirability of expanding these programs. The Secretary may expand programs like Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps through increased units, participants, or funding as deemed appropriate."
