    "content": "The report provides information on the historical budget authority for veterans' benefits and services from FY1940 to FY2012, including direct and indirect spending. Budget authority has generally increased over this period, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. The FY2012 budget authority in current dollars was significantly higher than the FY1940 budget authority, with an average annual growth rate of 7.9%. In constant 2011 dollars, the FY2012 budget authority was 14 times higher than FY1940, with a 3.8% average annual growth rate. WWII saw 16.1 million Americans serving in the military, making it the largest conflict in terms of servicemembers. The GI Bill was signed into law in 1944, providing significant changes for servicemembers. The GI Bill, signed into law in 1944, provided education, training benefits, and housing loan guarantees for WWII veterans. The budget authority for veterans increased significantly from $561.1 million in FY1940 to almost $8.4 billion in FY1947. The budget authority for veterans increased significantly after WWII, reaching $80.7 billion in constant 2011 dollars by FY1947. The Vietnam era saw 8.7 million Americans serving in the military, with a draft in place until 1972. Unlike WWII, no new large benefit programs were started during this period, resulting in a smaller peak in budget authority at the end of the Vietnam era. The budget authority for veterans increased significantly after WWII, reaching $80.7 billion in constant 2011 dollars by FY1947. In contrast, the budget authority for FY1975 and FY1976, reflecting the end of the Vietnam conflict, was below that of FY1947 when adjusted for inflation. Unlike WWII, there was no military draft during the current conflicts, and servicemembers generally leave at the end of their obligation or retirement. The budget authority for veterans' benefits has steadily increased since the late 1990s due to the aging veteran population and returning OEF/OIF veterans. Increases in appropriations for disability compensation also reflect changes for Vietnam veterans. By FY2011, over half of veterans receiving disability compensation were aged 55 or older, showing the impact of aging veterans on budget authority. Additionally, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Program has influenced budget authority in recent years. The budget authority for veterans' benefits has increased over time due to the impact of wars, aging veteran population, and changes in benefits. The most significant impact was seen after World War II."
