    "content": "The current budget situation has led Congress to consider various revenue-raising options, including changes to tax expenditures like the exclusion of interest on state and local government debt. Proposals include capping the preference, eliminating it entirely, or changing it to a direct issuer subsidy. The President's FY2013 budget proposes capping the preference at 28%, Simpson-Bowles suggests complete elimination, and the CBO recommends changing the tax exclusion to a direct subsidy. The \"Options\" report suggests changing the tax exclusion for investors to a direct tax subsidy to issuers. The preference for tax-exempt bonds is seen as financially inefficient, leading to a greater federal revenue loss than the subsidy to state and local governments. Modifying or eliminating this preference could increase federal revenue and improve economic efficiency. Policymakers need to consider various factors when evaluating these proposals, as issuers benefit from lower borrowing costs and investors benefit from tax-free income. The impact of changing the tax treatment of interest on state and local government debt is significant. The top 10% of earners receive over 77% of tax-exempt interest income, leading to a tax expenditure estimate of $227.5 billion for public purpose bonds. Issuers may face higher borrowing costs, while wealthy investors would lose a tax preference. Considerations include the size of the tax subsidy, distribution of tax-exempt income, and value to issuers. The 2013 budget estimates significant revenue losses from tax-exempt bonds, with non-profit hospital bonds being the largest expenditure. Different tax reform proposals suggest capping or eliminating the interest income exclusion for tax-exempt bonds. The distribution of this tax subsidy among taxpayers is crucial for analyzing the potential impact of these proposals. The deficit reduction options report proposes replacing the interest exclusion for tax-exempt bonds with a direct payment to issuers. Tax-exempt interest distribution is skewed towards higher income taxpayers due to higher after-tax rates of return. In 2009, 4.5% of all returns reported tax-exempt interest income, with 64.1% of returns with AGI over $1 million including tax-exempt interest income. In 2009, tax-exempt interest income was skewed towards higher income taxpayers, with 64.1% of returns with AGI over $1 million including this income. Returns under $200,000 accounted for 50.5% of tax-exempt interest income, while those above reported 49.5%. IRS data provides insight into the distribution of tax-exempt interest income. The distribution of tax-exempt interest income in 2007 varied among different income deciles. The highest decile, with AGI above $113,400, reported over 77% of all tax-exempt interest income. Interestingly, the bottom decile, with negative AGI, claimed 2.0% of the interest income. This cohort likely includes retired taxpayers and individuals with temporary low income levels. In 2007, tax-exempt interest income was concentrated in the top decile, with the top one percent earning 49.0% of it. The tax exclusion benefit primarily benefits higher income groups, making them the most impacted by any modifications to the tax preference. The difference between taxable and tax-exempt bonds, known as the spread, quantifies the value of the interest subsidy received by issuing governments. The spread, or bonds' value, is a key factor in evaluating the interest exclusion for issuers. Various proposals, such as capping the tax-exemption benefit at 28%, eliminating the exemption while broadening the tax base, or replacing it with direct payments to issuers, could impact tax-exempt bonds. These proposals were included in the 2013 budget, Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan, and Congressional Budget Revenue Option. One proposal in the 2013 budget is to cap the benefit of tax-exempt interest at the 28% marginal tax rate. This would affect investors in higher tax brackets the most, as more of their tax-exempt earnings would be subject to some tax. Investors compare tax-exempt bond investments to taxable alternatives based on market interest rates. The market interest rate where the after-tax rate of return on a taxable bond matches the tax-exempt rate is known as the \"market clearing rate.\" If interest on a tax-exempt bond becomes taxable, the market clearing rate will increase, indicating the impact of the proposed tax treatment changes. Higher income investors would accept lower tax-exempt bond returns due to the declining after-tax return on taxable bonds. For example, a taxpayer in the 35.0% marginal tax bracket would earn a 3.90% after-tax rate of return on a taxable bond with a hypothetical 6% pre-tax rate. Under the proposed tax policy changes, tax-exempt bonds would need to offer higher yields to match the after-tax return of taxable bonds. The after-tax rate of return for partially tax-exempt bonds for taxpayers in the 35.0% marginal tax bracket would rise to 4.19%, a 0.29% premium compared to current law. The premium would vary with market interest rates, with higher rates resulting in a larger premium. The market clearing rate for tax-exempt securities is influenced by the taxpayer's marginal tax rate and the policy tax rate cap. A tax cap could reduce the appeal of tax-exempt bonds for higher tax brackets, leading to increased borrowing costs for governments. The response from investors to the proposed tax policy changes may be limited. The proposed tax policy changes may impact the tax status of tax-exempt bonds for investors, potentially leading to increased borrowing costs for governments. However, most tax-exempt bonds would still offer a higher after-tax return compared to taxable investments. The array of marginal tax rates in the President's FY2013 budget would affect taxpayers with different income levels. Investors calculate the after-tax return of investments by considering the tax implications. Under the proposed tax changes, investors would need a higher return on tax-exempt bonds due to potential taxation on some interest. The tax premium on tax-exempt bonds for high-income investors could increase borrowing costs for governments. The top two tax brackets, comprising 1.9% of all returns, account for 35.2% of tax-exempt interest. If the 28% proposal is implemented, these taxpayers would pay taxes on these earnings, generating an additional $70.3 million in revenue. The proposed tax changes could lead to higher borrowing costs for governments as high-income investors may require a higher return on tax-exempt bonds. The additional revenue from taxes on tax-exempt interest for top tax brackets could amount to $70.3 million. The impact on issuers is uncertain due to the potential tax-risk premium introduced by the proposed tax cap, which could result in higher interest costs passed on to issuers. The Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction committee plan recommends eliminating the tax-exemption for state and local government bonds, which would result in interest payments being treated like all other income. This would remove the tax preference for high-income investors, potentially leading them to adjust their portfolios away from tax-exempt bonds. The Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction committee plan proposes eliminating the tax-exemption for state and local government bonds, impacting high-income investors who may shift from tax-exempt bonds to taxable alternatives. However, new demand from international investors and U.S. pension funds could partially offset the reduction in demand. This shift would mainly affect the top two current marginal tax rates, with tax-exempt interest generating a tax liability of 28% instead of a tax savings of 33% or 35%. The Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction committee plan proposes eliminating the tax-exemption for state and local government bonds, impacting high-income investors. Almost 40% of tax-exempt interest was earned by taxpayers in the top two marginal rate brackets. The elimination of tax-exempt bonds could lead to a significant windfall gain for current holders. Proponents argue that eliminating tax-exempt bonds could result in higher interest rates on taxable bonds, causing delays in important projects. The tax-exempt bond market for new projects under SB would eliminate the federal preference for riskier projects, potentially causing delays or cutbacks in education, health care, and community amenity projects. The tax preference currently applies to all projects regardless of risk, with higher-risk projects having a greater federal revenue loss due to higher interest rates. The tax-exempt interest rate would need to be at least 5.2% to justify investment in riskier projects under SB. The elimination of the exclusion of interest on state and local government debt would have a differential impact across states, with debt-reliant states and local governments being relatively worse off. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) proposed replacing the tax exclusion for interest income on state and local government bonds with a direct subsidy to the issuer. This change is estimated to increase revenues by $142.7 billion over the 2012 to 2021 budget window and would also improve the economic efficiency of the tax preference for non-federal government borrowing. The proposal aims to eliminate the disproportionately greater benefit high-income taxpayers receive under the current law. The CBO proposed replacing the tax exclusion for interest income on state and local government bonds with a subsidy payment to the issuer. The proposed payment amount is 15% of the issuer coupon payment, lower than the previous Build America Bond program. The President's 2013 budget also includes a similar proposal for an expanded BAB program with subsidy rates of 30% for 2013, dropping to 28% thereafter. The subsidy rates are intended to be revenue neutral but may reduce revenues by $1.1 billion over the 2013 to 2022 budget window. If the CBO proposal becomes law, high marginal tax rate tax-exempt bond investors would lose a tax preference, leading to a negative impact on the market for existing taxable bonds. Current holders of tax-exempt bonds could see windfall gains, while new investors like pension funds and international investors may buy state and local government bonds. Investors in higher tax brackets may lose a tax preference if the CBO proposal becomes law, impacting the market for existing taxable bonds. New investors like pension funds and international investors could buy state and local government bonds, providing additional investment options. The subsidy under the proposal would flow directly to issuers, resulting in a higher interest cost but still offering a federal tax benefit. This subsidy is seen as more economically efficient than the current tax exclusion for investors. The federal government provides tax benefits to issuers of tax-exempt bonds, benefiting entities like state and local governments, hospitals, and educational institutions. However, three proposals aim to reduce these benefits for issuers and investors, increasing federal revenues. This would lead to higher borrowing costs for issuers and limit tax-free income options for investors. The proposals vary in their impact on investors and issuers, with the FY2013 budget proposal affecting both equally and not addressing inefficiencies in using tax-exempt bonds for public capital investment. The SB tax reform plan would eliminate the tax preference altogether. The CBO proposal aims to eliminate the tax preference for investors and reduce it for issuers, resulting in a more economically efficient tax code. Congress faces the challenge of balancing the loss of tax preferences with the benefits of a smaller deficit."
