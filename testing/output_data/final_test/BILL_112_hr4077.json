Congress finds that the Department of State's rewards programs allow for payments for information leading to the arrest or conviction of individuals involved in international terrorism, narcotics-related offenses, and indicted by international criminal tribunals.

The Department of State's rewards program should be expanded to address the growing threat of transnational criminal activity, including piracy, money laundering, trafficking, arms trafficking, and cybercrime. It should also target individuals indicted for genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity by international tribunals.
