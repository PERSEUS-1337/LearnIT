    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California declares the importance of lichens, symbiotic organisms with antibacterial properties used medicinally. Lichens serve as biological indicators of air quality and climate change, with Ramalina menziesii named as the official state lichen to promote appreciation and study. The official state lichen, Lace lichen (Ramalina menziesii), is designated in Section 424.6 of the Government Code. The responsibility for planning, designing, and constructing boating facilities in state parks lies with the Division of Boating and Waterways as per Section 5003.6 of the Public Resources Code. Section 5008 mandates the protection of state park systems and vehicular recreation areas from damage and preservation of peace. The director may designate an officer or employee as a peace officer with duties including enforcing specific laws and regulations within the department's jurisdiction and making arrests for public offenses. The peace officer's authority is limited to that of peace officers listed in Section 830.2 of the Penal Code. The department protects property in the California recreational trail system and enforces rules and regulations, including making arrests for public offenses within the trail system. Any person who violates department rules may face a misdemeanor charge with a maximum 90-day jail term or a fine up to $1,000. The judge can reduce the offense to an infraction based on the prosecuting attorney's recommendation. A conviction post-reduction incurs a fine ranging from $10 to $1,000. In a prosecution for violating state park rules or regulations, proof that the registered owner of a vehicle or vessel parked in violation constitutes evidence that the owner committed the violation. Proof of vehicle or vessel ownership is not proof of other violations. Compliance with Vehicle Code procedures is necessary. A written lease or rental agreement can rebut evidence of the registered owner's involvement in a violation. Section 5044 of the Public Resources Code is repealed, and Section 5071.7 is amended to involve consultation with the Department of Transportation in planning trail routes. The Department of Transportation will install signs along heritage corridors once adequate volunteers or funds are available, or until the Legislature appropriates sufficient funds. The Division of Boating and Waterways will prepare and maintain boating trails related to waterways, integrated with the California Protected Waterways Plan. The Division of Off/Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation will handle trails for off/highway motor vehicles. The Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency appoints members to an advisory panel, including representatives from various departments and industries. The Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency appoints members to an advisory panel, including representatives from the fish industry, aquaculture industry, ocean engineering industry, University of California, California State University, private California institution of higher education, State Lands Commission, Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, State Water Resources Control Board, and Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response. Section 6311 of the Public Resources Code is amended. Section 6311 of the Public Resources Code is amended to require any grant of tidelands or submerged lands after January 1, 1971, in designated small craft harbor areas to include a plan for construction of necessary facilities within a specified timeframe. The Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Fish and Game Commission are responsible for wildlife and fishery management programs. The commission cannot impose controls that duplicate existing regulations. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may study degraded wetlands for restoration in conjunction with boating facility development. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may study degraded wetlands for restoration in conjunction with boating facility development, considering factors such as the wetland's capability for recovery, the potential for restoration of a substantial portion of the wetland, and the feasibility of achieving and maintaining natural values through this approach. The Legislature supports saltwater or brackish water aquaculture as a coastal-dependent use to enhance food supplies. The Department of Fish and Wildlife can designate suitable coastal sites for aquaculture facilities, which must be shared with the commission and local government. These entities should allocate coastal sites for aquaculture in line with coastal planning requirements and policies outlined in Chapter 3 of the division. Any state agency managing coastal land for public use must actively participate in selecting suitable sites for aquaculture facilities and make the land available for aquaculture when feasible. The Division of Boating and Waterways evaluates the economic feasibility of boating facilities in the coastal zone. The Coastal Commission can request the Division of Boating and Waterways to provide cost analysis and comments on boating facility economic viability within 30 days for permit decisions."
