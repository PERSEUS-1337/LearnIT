    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Bill Emerson English Language Empowerment Act of 1997\" and includes findings. The Congress declares the importance of a common language in the United States, emphasizing the benefits of diversity and unity. The Federal Government should maintain English as the common language to preserve unity and prevent division along linguistic lines. The purpose of this title is to help immigrants assimilate and access economic opportunities in the country. By learning English, immigrants can become responsible citizens and productive workers in the United States. The use of a common language in official Federal Government business promotes efficiency and fairness. English should be recognized as the official language for government business, with any cost savings used for teaching English to non-English-speaking immigrants. The text proposes English as the official language of the Federal Government, with a new chapter added to Title 4, United States Code. The official language of the Federal Government is English, with representatives having an obligation to preserve and enhance its role. Official Federal Government activities must be conducted in English. The Federal Government mandates that official business must be conducted in English. Individuals have the right to communicate, receive information, and be subject to official orders in English. Violations of this policy can result in civil action for appropriate relief. The text discusses the requirement for fluency in English for full citizenship in the United States, mandating that all naturalization ceremonies be conducted in English. It also states that the provisions of this chapter supersede any existing Federal law that contradicts it. The text prohibits communication in languages other than English during official business, limits the use of Native Alaskan or Native American languages, prohibits discrimination, and discourages the use of languages other than English in nonofficial capacities. It affirms constitutional protections and provides definitions for terms used in the chapter. The term 'Federal Government' includes all branches, employees, and officials conducting official business enforceable by the government. Exclusions are teaching languages, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requirements, and actions related to national security or international relations. The curr_chunk discusses actions or documents that are exempt from certain regulations, including those related to public health, census activities, non-enforceable policies, victim rights, civil lawsuits, and non-English terms. The table of chapters for title 4, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item. SEC. 4. PREEMPTION: This title shall not preempt any State law. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment."
