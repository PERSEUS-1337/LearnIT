    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. The Congress finds that there is a growing number of child support cases annually involving disputes between parents residing in different States, with nonuniform laws determining authority to establish child support orders, leading to noncustodial parents relocating to avoid jurisdiction, increasing interstate travel and communication for child support collection. The Congress finds that child support orders are burdensome for custodial parents, expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to their lives. This contributes to low child support payments in interstate cases, encourages noncompliance with court orders, and allows noncustodial parents to avoid payments, causing hardship for the children. The Congress recognizes that failure to enforce child support orders causes hardship for children and custodians, leads to relitigation and conflicting orders across jurisdictions, undermines public confidence in the rule of law, and hinders full faith and credit among states' judicial proceedings, resulting in harm to children, parents, and custodians. The Act aims to establish national standards for determining jurisdiction and enforcing child support orders across states to prevent interstate controversies and jurisdictional conflicts among state courts. SEC. 3. FULL FAITH AND CREDIT GIVEN TO CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS. Section 1738B of Title 28, US Code, mandates that each State must enforce child support orders from another State without modification, except as allowed. Definitions include 'child' as under 18, 'child's State' as where the child resides, and 'child support order' as a court-issued payment mandate. A court order for child support involves the payment of money or benefits for a child's support, including ongoing support, modifications, and arrearages. A contestant is someone claiming the right to receive child support, and a court refers to a state-authorized entity to establish support amounts. A court order for child support involves the payment of money or benefits for a child's support, including ongoing support, modifications, and arrearages. A contestant is someone claiming the right to receive child support, and a court refers to a state-authorized entity to establish or modify support amounts in accordance with state law. A court order for child support must be made by a court of a State with jurisdiction over the matter and contestants, providing notice and opportunity to be heard. The court retains jurisdiction if the State is the child's residence unless another State modifies the order. Another State can modify a child support order made by a different State. The court of a State can enforce a child support order if it no longer has jurisdiction over the matter, specifically for nonmodifiable obligations and unsatisfied obligations accrued before a modification of the order. The court of a State can enforce a child support order even after losing jurisdiction, for nonmodifiable and unsatisfied obligations accrued before a modification. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in title 28, United States Code. The term \"State\" in section 2 refers to the definition in section 1738B(b) of title 28, United States Code."
