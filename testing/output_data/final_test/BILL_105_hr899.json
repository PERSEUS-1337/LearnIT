It also requires a report on access to child care by low-income working families. Congress finds that availability and affordability of quality child care is a major obstacle for working parents, especially the working poor who receive the least assistance with child care costs. Low-income families spend a significant portion of their income on child care, with many states having waiting lists for child care services. For example, Georgia has 41,000 individuals on its waiting list, Texas has 36,000, and Illinois and Alabama each have 20,000. One survey found that 71% of low-income families on a child care waiting list faced serious debt. Half of the states increased child care assistance for welfare families over working poor families. Congressional Budget Office predicts $1.4 billion less in child care expenditures. The implementation of work requirements under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 will result in $1.4 billion less in child care expenditures for working poor families. Certain States lack important types of child care such as infant care, school-age care, care for children with disabilities, and child care for parents with unconventional work hours. A 1995 State study highlighted shortages of child care for infants, children with special needs in inner cities, and all types of child care in rural areas. Existing child care arrangements do not accommodate the work schedules of many working women, with nearly 1 in 5 full-time workers working nonstandard hours. Only one-third of schools in low-income neighborhoods offer school-age child care, compared to 52 percent in more affluent areas. Eighth-graders left home alone for 11 or more hours a week show increased use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Only 10 percent of child care centers offer infant care. Only 10% of child care centers and 6% of family day care providers offer weekend child care. Working mothers, including those below the poverty level, often work on weekends. Less than 30% of Head Start programs operate full-time, full-year. Authorization of appropriations for child care services for low-income working families and to address child care supply shortages is specified in the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990. $1.4 billion is authorized for child care services and $500 million for child care activities annually from 1997 to 2002. Authorization of appropriations for child care services for low-income working families and to address child care supply shortages is specified in the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990. $1.4 billion is authorized for child care services and $500 million for child care activities annually from 1997 to 2002. SEC. 4. EXPENDITURES FOR CHILD SERVICES CARE FOR LOW-INCOME WORKING FAMILIES AND FOR CHILD CARE SUPPLY SHORTAGES. The Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 authorizes appropriations for child care services for low-income working families and to address child care supply shortages. From 1997 to 2002, $1.4 billion is allocated for child care services and $500 million for child care activities annually. The Act also mandates that 100 percent of funds appropriated under section 658B(b) during this period be used to provide child care services for specific low-income working families. The Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 allocates funds to address child care supply shortages. From 1997 to 2002, all funds under section 658B(c) must be used for child care activities in areas with shortages, including infant care programs. The Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 allocates funds for various child care programs, including infant care, before- and after-school care, resource and referral programs, nontraditional work hours care, extending prekindergarten hours, and other programs deemed appropriate by the Secretary. A conforming amendment was made to Section 658E(c)(3)(A) of the Act. SEC. 5. REPORT ON ACCESS TO CHILD CARE BY LOW-INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. The amendment to the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 requires reporting on the total number of families eligible for assistance but did not receive it, as well as the total number of families that did receive assistance and how it was provided. The Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 now requires reporting on the total number of families eligible for assistance, with a focus on access for low-income working families."
