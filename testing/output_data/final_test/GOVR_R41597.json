    "content": "In April 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced plans to restructure the Army's Future Combat System (FCS) program, which was a major research and development initiative aimed at transforming the Army. The program included 18 manned and unmanned systems connected by a communication network. Secretary Gates recommended canceling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component of the FCS program, leading to the development of a ground combat vehicle (GCV) as part of the restructuring. The Army was directed to develop a ground combat vehicle (GCV) relevant across all Army operations, incorporating lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. Congressional interest in the program is significant as it equips armored brigade combat teams. The GCV is a new start for ground weapon systems amidst budget constraints and scrutiny due to past failures. Secretary Gates announced restructuring the FCS program, canceling the MGV component, and accelerating the spin out of selected technologies to BCTs. After canceling the MGV component of the FCS program, Secretary Gates reevaluated the Army's vehicle modernization strategy, leading to the establishment of a new ground combat vehicle acquisition program in 2010. The Army's 2009 Modernization Strategy focused on quickly developing a new GCV using the Incremental Development Approach, featuring a modular design to accommodate future technological advancements. The GCV concept aimed to field a new vehicle by 2015-2017 with room for future capabilities, mature technologies, continuous armor development, and network integration. The Army considered tracked or wheeled options, common chassis for logistics support, V-shaped hull, side armor against IEDs, fuel efficiency, and air transportability as key design features. The GCV is designed to be fuel efficient and air transportable on C-17 transports. Non-lethal weapon systems are required for the vehicle to be a \"full spectrum\" combat vehicle. The Army released a Request for Proposal for the technology development phase of the Infantry Fighting Vehicle under the GCV effort. Army officials are relying on industry recommendations for specific solutions. The GCV acquisition program, led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, will involve three phases: technology development, engineering and manufacturing design, and low rate initial production. The Army plans to award up to three contracts in a competitive program, with the first contracts expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Industry will have 60 days to submit proposals for the development effort, which aims to modernize the Army's combat vehicle fleet by incorporating Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. The GCV acquisition program aims to modernize the Army's combat vehicle fleet by incorporating MRAP vehicles and introducing a highly survivable Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The GCV will offer greater lethality, ballistic protection, and IED/mine protection, with the mobility of an Abrams tank. The Army has engaged with industry to gather feedback and proposals for the development of the GCV. The Army engaged with industry to gather feedback and proposals for the development of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). Three industry teams submitted technology development proposals in response to the Army's RFP in February 2010. The teams included BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, MTU Detroit Diesel, SAIC, Boeing, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), and Rheinmetall Defence. The BAE Systems-led team claimed their design would exceed survivability standards. The General Dynamics team claimed their design would exceed MRAP survivability and have enhanced mobility for urban and cross-country operations. SAIC-led team planned to base their design on the German Puma IFV, emphasizing all work would be done in the US. Army expected to award contracts for the GCV Technology Development phase in FY2010. The Army's Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology cancelled the RFP for the GCV program to allow for more time for technology integration and ensure the use of mature technologies. A Red Team review found that the GCV had too many performance requirements and capabilities to be affordable within the established time frame. The Army planned to reissue the RFP within 60 days. The Army canceled the RFP for the GCV program due to excessive performance requirements and costs. A revised RFP was issued with a $10 million per vehicle cost limit and affordability targets of $9-10.5 million per unit. Industry had until January 21, 2011, to submit proposals for tracked or wheeled vehicles. The Army revised the RFP for the GCV program with a $200 sustainment cost per operational mile. The GCV must fit on a C-17 transport but not on a C-130. Technology development contracts were expected to be awarded to three contractors by April 2011, with the TD Phase planned to last 24 months. The new RFP is a fixed price incentive fee contract with a ceiling of $450 million per contractor for the TD Phase. The revised RFP for the GCV program includes a fixed price incentive fee contract with a $450 million ceiling cap for the technology development phase. Industry has concerns about the open-ended technical specifications and uncertainty about the number of vehicles to be built. Analysts warn that the GCV's high price per vehicle could make it susceptible to future budget cuts. The high price of the GCV program could lead to budget cuts and political controversy, similar to the fate of the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. Concerns have been raised about the program not reaching production and its impact on the industrial base. Production of new combat vehicles is limited, with the Abrams tank remanufacturing program ending in 2014 and the GCV not starting production until 2017. Defense industry analysts are worried about the lack of opportunities for armored vehicle development. Industry analysts are concerned about the limited opportunities for developing armored fighting vehicles in the U.S., which may lead to some defense firms dropping out of the business. The Pentagon authorized technology demonstration contracts for the GCV program, with specific cost requirements set by then Secretary Ashton Carter. The Army awarded two technology development contracts for the Ground Combat Vehicle program in August 2011, with General Dynamics and BAE Systems-Northrop Grumman teams receiving contracts. The technology development phase is expected to last 24 months, with extensions granted to both teams. SAIC-Boeing filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office contending evaluation errors. The SAIC-Boeing GCV proposal was rejected by the Army due to concerns over the vehicle's evaluation process, leading to a protest and a stop-work order on General Dynamics and BAE Systems-Northrop Grumman teams. The protest was denied by GAO, and work on the GCV resumed after the stop-work order was lifted by the Army. The Army rejected the SAIC-Boeing GCV proposal primarily due to concerns over force protection features, including the active protection system and underbody armor. The Army identified 20 significant weaknesses and emphasized the importance of addressing them. SAIC's response regarding classified information from the German Ministry of Defense was deemed inadequate. Additional concerns included insufficient head clearance for crew members. The Army had concerns about the SAIC-Boeing GCV proposal, including force protection features, head clearance issues, and other hazards affecting crew members. The Under Secretary of Defense made changes to the GCV program to make it more affordable and executable, extending the Technology Demonstration phase for contractors to modify their designs. The Technology Demonstration phase for the GCV program was extended by six months to allow contractors to modify designs for a more affordable and executable GCV design. This change saved the department nearly $2.5 billion in resources. Milestone B will remain a full and open competition for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of the program. The decision to extend the Technology Demonstration phase for the GCV program by six months will save $4+ billion over the FYDP. This move eliminates spending on incomplete designs and supports schedule risk during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase. Milestone C will be shifted from FY2018 to FY2019 for better affordability and execution. The Ground Combat Vehicle program has been extended by six months, with only one contractor proceeding to the EMD phase. The Milestone C production decision has been postponed until FY2019, adding costs to the program. Secretary of Defense Hagel has accepted the Army's recommendation to terminate the current program and redirect funds towards a next-generation platform. The Ground Combat Vehicle program has been terminated due to budget constraints, with funding redirected towards new vehicle modernization efforts. The FY2014 budget request for the GCV was $592.2 million, but only $100.2 million was appropriated for the program. It is unclear how the Army will use the remaining funds following the program's termination. The Army has cancelled the Ground Combat Vehicle program due to budget constraints, leading to uncertainty in developing a replacement for the M-2 Bradley series infantry fighting vehicle. Congress may engage with Army leadership to understand their future intentions and potentially facilitate a follow-on program. The Army has cancelled the Ground Combat Vehicle program due to budget constraints. There is potential consideration to reexamine foreign-developed infantry fighting vehicles that received favorable ratings during evaluations as alternatives to replacing the Bradley vehicles. Despite the program being terminated, reports suggest it will continue as part of a science and technology effort with funding set aside to preserve the engineering base associated with GCV. The Army has cancelled the Ground Combat Vehicle program due to budget constraints. $100 million in research and development funding will be used in the Army's labs and research centers involved in GCV efforts. There is a disparity between DOD and the Army regarding the program status, with the Army continuing program activities and funding unspecified aspects. This situation could raise issues for Congress regarding the understanding of the GCV program status. The Army has cancelled the Ground Combat Vehicle program due to budget constraints. Congress may need to examine the $150 million in FY2015 budget for GCV-related activities and how post-termination science and technology efforts will benefit future vehicle development."
