    "content": "The dispute in Gonzales v. Raich involved a conflict between California's Compassionate Use Act and the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Respondents argued that the CSA exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause and was unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, \"as applied\" to the respondents, the CSA exceeded Congress's power. In Gonzales v. Raich, the court found that the CSA exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause when applied to intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medical purposes. The court applied the Lopez/Morrison test and determined that the activity was not commercial or economic in nature. The court in a recent case analyzed the jurisdictional hook in the CSA and found no specific hook in relevant sections. It cited congressional findings on intrastate drug trafficking's impact on interstate commerce but downplayed their relevance to marijuana. The court also referenced Morrison's discussion on congressional findings and Ninth Circuit precedent. The court referenced Ninth Circuit precedent and doubted the substantial interstate effect of homegrown medical marijuana, favoring a finding that the CSA cannot be constitutionally applied to the activities in question. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari on the power vested in Congress by the \"Necessary and Proper Clause\" and the \"Commerce Clause.\" The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision, holding that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities that impact interstate commerce, citing the Wickard v. Filburn case. This decision allows Congress to prohibit the local growth, possession, and use of marijuana permitted by California law. The Supreme Court found substantial impacts on interstate commerce in the Raich case, similar to Wickard. The Court noted that home-grown medicinal marijuana could affect price and market conditions, just like wheat production for personal use vs. sale. Congress had a rational basis for regulating marijuana to prevent market disruptions. The respondents argued that the personal cultivation and use of medicinal marijuana is non-commercial and does not substantially affect the interstate market. However, the Court applied a deferential standard, stating that Congress had a rational basis for regulating marijuana to prevent market disruptions. The Court upheld Congress's authority to regulate intrastate possession of marijuana under the Commerce Clause, citing a rational basis for preventing market disruptions. The CSA was deemed constitutional as it regulated activity considered \"quintessentially economic,\" distinguishing it from previous Commerce Clause decisions like Lopez and Morrison. The Court upheld Congress's authority to regulate intrastate possession of marijuana under the Commerce Clause, citing a rational basis for preventing market disruptions. It rejected the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and found that Congress acted rationally in regulating marijuana as a \"Schedule I\" narcotic with no medicinal value. The Court emphasized that medicinal marijuana was indistinguishable from recreational marijuana, supporting Congress's intent to regulate all forms of the drug. The Court upheld Congress's authority to regulate intrastate possession of marijuana under the Commerce Clause, rejecting the Ninth Circuit's distinction between medicinal and recreational use. California's state law permitting medicinal use does not exempt activities from federal regulation due to the Supremacy Clause. The Court emphasized that all forms of marijuana are subject to federal regulation to prevent market disruptions. The Court upheld Congress's authority to regulate intrastate possession of marijuana under the Commerce Clause, rejecting the Ninth Circuit's distinction between medicinal and recreational use. California's state law permitting medicinal use does not exempt activities from federal regulation. The Court concluded that the case for exemption based on locally grown product used domestically is precluded by previous decisions. Justice O'Connor's dissent focused on the lack of evidence showing medicinal marijuana users significantly affect the interstate market regulated by Congress. Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas debated the extent of Congress's power under the \"Necessary and Proper\" clause in the context of regulating intrastate marijuana activity. Scalia argued that extending the Controlled Substances Act to cover such activity was necessary to achieve Congress's goal of regulating the interstate market. In contrast, Thomas contended that the clause should not be used to expand Congress's powers beyond what was originally intended. Thomas argues that allowing Congress to regulate intrastate, non-commercial activity grants the federal government excessive power that undermines the Constitution's principles of federalism and dual sovereignty."
