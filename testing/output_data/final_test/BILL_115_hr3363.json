    "content": "The \"Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act\" or the \"CLAIM Act\" allows for state flexibility in multistate adjuster licensing reforms. The \"CLAIM Act\" requires states to enact uniform laws and regulations for licensing independent claims adjusters within a 4-year period, including criteria for integrity, qualifications, education, training, and experience. The \"CLAIM Act\" mandates states to establish uniform licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters in property and casualty insurance, workers compensation insurance, and other regulated lines. It also requires uniform continuing education and ethics course requirements for adjusters, without limiting nonresident adjusters' activities. The \"CLAIM Act\" mandates states to establish reciprocity for independent claims adjusters, allowing nonresident adjusters to receive licenses in other states without additional requirements, as long as they submit a request using a uniform application. The \"CLAIM Act\" requires independent claims adjusters to submit a uniform license application, provide proof of a valid license from their home state, and pay any necessary fees. States must accept the adjuster's satisfaction of their home state's continuing education requirements. Nonresident adjusters are not subject to additional requirements in other states. The \"CLAIM Act\" prohibits states from imposing licensing or qualification requirements on nonresident independent claims adjusters that limit their activities based on their residence or place of operations. States must grant reciprocity to residents of other states that meet certain criteria. Compliance with the Act is determined by the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers within a 4-year period. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers determines compliance with the \"CLAIM Act\" annually for states. Judicial review is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for any challenges arising from this section. The court will review any challenges under this section using the standards from section 706 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITIES. This Act does not require states without licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt them, does not limit states' rights to establish licensing fees, and does not affect states' jurisdiction to regulate independent claims adjuster activity. SEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING. SEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING. Independent claims adjusters can apply for membership with the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers to obtain licensure in states not compliant with licensing requirements after a 4-year period. They must pay necessary fees for licensing. For the purpose of this Act, the definition of \"home state\" for an independent claims adjuster is the state where they are licensed after passing an exam and maintain their principal place of residence or business. If their home state does not issue a license or require an exam, it can be any other state where they are licensed. The term \"independent claims adjuster\" refers to an individual who investigates, evaluates, and negotiates property, casualty, liability, disability, or workers' compensation claims on behalf of insurers or self-insurers. This includes company or staff adjusters employed by property casualty insurers. A public adjuster is a person who, for compensation, helps insured individuals determine and settle first-party claims related to property insurance. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States and its territories. The term \"State law\" includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action of any State having the effect of law; a law of the United States applicable only to the District of Columbia is treated as a State law."
