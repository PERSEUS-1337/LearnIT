    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Learning and Opportunity State Grants Act of 2000\". The Congress recognizes the critical importance of the first 3 years of a child's life for brain development, emotional growth, and overall well-being. Research shows that experiences during this period significantly impact individuals throughout their lives. Alarmingly, one in 3 victims of physical abuse is under 1 year old, and nearly half of infants in the US lack necessary resources for growth. High-quality care from adults is essential for child development. More than 50% of mothers with children under 1 year old work outside the home, leaving 5 million children in the care of others. Parents of young children have limited affordable child care options, with less than 20% of services for young children being of good quality. In 1998, child care workers earned $14,820, making it hard to retain qualified caregivers for infants and toddlers. Families with children under 3 years old are the largest group in poverty, with 25% of them, 3 million children, living below the poverty line and at risk for malnutrition and maltreatment. The Act aims to enhance child care services for children under 3 years old by improving quality, affordability, family support services, and program coordination. Grants are provided for these services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to eligible States to improve child care services for very young children and support services for their families. Priority is given to States that minimize administrative costs, coordinate activities with child care providers for older children, and family support services. The State must take legislative or executive action to reduce duplication and barriers in providing child care services. Providers will be reimbursed at rates reflecting higher costs for accredited providers and for very young children. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS. To be eligible for a grant under section 4, a State must submit an application prepared in consultation with child care and family support providers. The application must include a plan to use the grant for improving child care services and licensing standards. To improve child care services for very young children, the grant aims to enhance staff qualifications, training, safety measures, and parent/community involvement. Additionally, it seeks to enforce licensing standards, increase caregiver compensation, provide advanced training (including for children with special needs), and incentivize hiring trained individuals in child care centers. The grant aims to improve accessibility and quality of child care services for very young children by expanding infant care, supporting child care networks, and providing ongoing support for child care providers. The grant aims to improve accessibility and quality of child care services for very young children by expanding infant care, supporting child care networks, and providing ongoing support for child care providers of infants and toddlers. The application for the grant must include assurances related to hiring specialists, improving affordability, expanding support services to families, and coordinating existing Federal and State programs. The grant will supplement non-Federal funds for child care services for young children and their families. The State must contribute at least 30% of the grant amount in cash or in kind. The grant will be administered by the lead agency designated by the State under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The application for the grant must include additional information and assurances as required by the Secretary. The Secretary will develop a model training program for caregivers of infants and toddlers in child care services, based on existing requirements. This program will be voluntary and provide technical assistance to providers and Head Start agencies for implementation. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Definitions include caregiver, family support services, Secretary, and very young children. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $1,000,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005."
