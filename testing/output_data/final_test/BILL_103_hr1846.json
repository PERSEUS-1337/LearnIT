Title I focuses on interest payments on invested funds. The Act of June 24, 1938 is amended to require investment of funds and payment of interest to Indian tribes or individuals. Technical corrections are made to subsection designations. The Act of June 24, 1938 is amended to allow for earnings generated from deposited or invested funds to be paid to Indian tribes or individuals. The amendments also specify that interest earned on amounts deposited or invested after the enactment of the Act will be subject to these changes. The Secretary is authorized to make payments to Indian tribes or individuals in satisfaction of claims for interest owed on funds deposited or invested before the enactment of the Act of June 24, 1938. This includes payments for interest that would have been earned if funds were deposited or invested according to the Act. The purpose of this title is to demonstrate new approaches for the management of tribal and individual Indian funds held in trust by the United States and managed by the Secretary through the Bureau, giving greater control to Indian tribal governments and individual account holders over the management of trust funds. This includes involving investment of trust funds by the Secretary to promote economic development in Indian communities and demonstrating how the principles of self-determination can work in managing trust funds. SEC. 202. DEFINITION. The terms \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribe\" refer to an Indian tribe, consortia of Indian tribes, or an association of Indians with individual Indian trust fund accounts managed by the Secretary through the Bureau. An Indian tribe can propose a new plan to manage tribal or individual Indian funds held in trust by the United States, currently managed by the Secretary through the Bureau. The plan can involve direct management by the tribe in selected financial institutions under the supervision of the Secretary or management by the Secretary in a specific manner. The Secretary can manage tribal funds in financial institutions on or near the reservation, increase tribal access to institutions, promote economic development activities, or support tribal priorities. Funds can also be managed locally through contracts with financial institutions or other approaches determined by the Secretary. SEC. 204. Approval of plans by the Secretary. The Secretary must approve and implement a plan that meets specific conditions, including approval by the appropriate Indian tribe and resolution from the tribal governing body for tribal trust funds or individual Indian money accounts.

The tribe must sign a statement accepting the limitations on the trust responsibility of the United States before implementing any demonstration. SEC. 206. TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will provide Indian tribes with technical and financial assistance for demonstration plans. SEC. 207. NO INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES. Funds managed under the program will be treated the same for tax purposes as if managed directly by the Secretary. SEC. 208. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL FROM TRUST FUND PROGRAM. SEC. 208.

The Congress recognizes the trust responsibility of the United States towards tribal and individual Indian owners of natural resources on reservations and trust lands, including managing funds derived from various sources. This extends to training and personnel provisions in the Act of June 24, 1938. The Secretary will establish a training program to help Indians gain expertise in trust fund management, including outreach to private financial institutions for employment opportunities. Agreements with entities will provide training and employment opportunities for Bureau employees. Employment descriptions for Federal positions related to Indian trust funds will be ensured by the Secretary. The management of Indian trust funds requires individuals with necessary skills based on industry standards. The Secretary will establish pay rates for these positions at a General Schedule level. Indian preference laws cannot be waived. RESPONSIBILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR INDIAN TRUST FUNDS: The Secretary is responsible for accounting for the daily and annual balances of Indian trust funds. The Secretary is required to account for all funds held in trust for Indian tribes or individuals, providing periodic statements of performance and conducting annual audits. The annual audit requirement for funds held in trust by the United States for Indian tribes or individuals, as mandated by the Act of June 24, 1938, includes a letter in the first performance statement after completion.
