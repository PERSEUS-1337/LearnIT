    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North American Energy Security Act\". Congress finds that the United States' overdependence on oil imports from hostile or unstable regions jeopardizes national security, economy, and lives of personnel. The country imports more than half of its oil, often from countries with lower environmental standards and political instability, putting the oil supply at risk. Despite some imports from allies like Canada and Mexico, the US remains vulnerable to supply disruptions. The United States is vulnerable to supply disruptions due to geopolitical turmoil in major oil-producing nations and increasing oil consumption in the developing world. Importing oil from Canada is in the national interest to secure reliable oil supplies and complement domestic energy priorities. Developing North American energy resources, including Canadian oil, enhances access to oil. Importing Canadian oil enhances access to stable and reliable crude oil for domestic refiners, ensuring a secure fuel supply for the Department of Defense. The trading relationship between Canada and the United States is significant, with a high return on investment for products from Canada. Canadian oil exporters have the option to send crude oil to the United States or Asia, particularly China. Increased Canadian oil exports to China would lead to increased crude oil imports to the United States from less secure and reliable foreign sources. This reduces wealth transfers to distant foreign sources and benefits US companies invested in Canadian oil sands. The Keystone XL pipeline project has undergone a thorough review by multiple Federal agencies for over 3 years. It is a high-capacity pipeline that could meet both short-term and long-term crude oil demand for US refineries. The completion of the pipeline would increase the total Keystone pipeline system capacity by 700,000 barrels per day to 1,290,000 barrels per day. The Keystone XL pipeline project would create 20,000 jobs and increase Canadian oil reserves for US use, meeting high safety standards. Extensive governmental studies support its construction for national interest. The Keystone XL pipeline project should receive a prompt decision on its Presidential permit without delays or impediments. The Keystone XL pipeline project should receive a prompt decision on its Presidential permit without delays or impediments. SEC. 3. PERMIT FOR KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE. The President must grant a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project within 60 days, unless it is determined not to serve the national interest. The President must submit a report to relevant committees justifying a determination on the Keystone XL pipeline within 15 days. If no decision is made within 60 days, the permit for the pipeline will be granted. The permit granted for the Keystone XL pipeline must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, obtain necessary permits, and take measures to prevent environmental impact or disruption of historic properties. The permit for the Keystone XL pipeline must comply with all laws and regulations, including environmental and historic preservation requirements. The final environmental impact statement from August 26, 2011, satisfies all necessary environmental review processes, and no further federal review is needed. The construction, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline must adhere to the requirements outlined in the final environmental impact statement issued on August 26, 2011. No additional federal environmental review is necessary. The Keystone XL pipeline must comply with specific measures for the Sand Hills region and other standard industry practices outlined in federal permits. The permit issued under subsection (a) requires the reconsideration of routing of the Keystone XL pipeline within Nebraska, with the President coordinating the review process and approving the final route submitted by the Governor of Nebraska. If the President does not approve the route submitted by the Governor of Nebraska within 10 days, it will be considered approved by law."
