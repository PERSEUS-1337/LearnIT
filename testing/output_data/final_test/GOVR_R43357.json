In FY2014, it served 65 million individuals at a cost of $498 billion, with the federal government covering $303 billion. Medicaid is a crucial safety net, covering 18% of the U.S. population in 2013 and being a significant payer for services like long-term care and childbirth. It represents 15% of national health care spending. Medicaid is a significant payer in the U.S. health care system, representing 15% of national health care spending in CY2013. It was enacted in 1965 alongside Medicare, with state participation being voluntary. Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and states, with federal spending being an entitlement dependent on state policy decisions. States have flexibility in designing their own versions of Medicaid within the federal statute's framework. Medicaid state plans outline how each state administers its program, submitted to CMS for approval. Medicaid covers diverse populations with unique healthcare needs not typically included in private insurance plans. This includes services like nursing facility care and EPSDT. Medicaid covers a wide range of services including nursing facility care, EPSDT, and Medicare premiums for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities. It also pays for special providers like FQHCs, RHCs, and IHS facilities. The program has evolved over time with changes in federal laws impacting eligibility, benefits, cost sharing, and fraud prevention. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) made significant changes to the Medicaid program, expanding eligibility and benefits starting in 2014. The ACA aims to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by utilizing employer-based insurance, individual market changes, and Medicaid expansion. Medicaid and health insurance exchanges are intended to work together to provide continuous coverage. The ACA made changes to Medicaid, expanding eligibility and benefits. Medicaid and health insurance exchanges work together to provide continuous coverage. Medicaid agencies coordinate with exchanges to educate and assist with enrollment. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state law. Selected issues addressed include the ACA Medicaid expansion and maintenance of effort requirement. Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by federal and state law, with states setting criteria within federal standards. Individuals must meet categorical and financial criteria, as well as residency, immigration status, and citizenship requirements. Some groups are mandatory for coverage, while others are optional. States can apply for waivers to expand coverage. Medicaid coverage is provided to various groups including low-income families, pregnant women, children under 18, elderly individuals, disabled individuals, recipients of adoption assistance and foster care, individuals aging out of foster care up to age 26, and certain groups of legal permanent resident immigrants. Medicaid coverage is provided to various groups including low-income families, pregnant women, children under 18, elderly individuals, disabled individuals, recipients of adoption assistance and foster care, individuals aging out of foster care up to age 26, and certain groups of legal permanent resident immigrants. Eligible individuals include those with 40 quarters of Social Security coverage, honorably discharged U.S. military veterans, pregnant women with family income between 133% and 185% of FPL, individuals qualifying for nursing facility care with incomes up to 300% of SSI benefit level, medically needy individuals with high medical expenses, working people with disabilities, and non-elderly adults. As of January 1, 2014, Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly populations, including the ACA Medicaid expansion, is determined by MAGI rules. This change in income calculation could result in some individuals no longer being eligible for Medicaid, while others may become eligible. For example, children previously eligible may now be ineligible due to stepparent income being included in MAGI calculations, while children previously ineligible may now qualify due to child support income being excluded. Medicaid eligibility under MAGI rules may change for individuals, as certain types of income are excluded or subtracted to determine MAGI. The state deducts 5% from each individual's MAGI and compares it to new income standards. The transition to MAGI income rules for Medicaid eligibility had significant implications, requiring a redesign of eligibility and enrollment systems. These systems were integrated with health insurance exchanges and other social programs serving low-income populations. Medicaid enrollment has shown steady growth, especially among nondisabled children and adults during economic downturns. The ACA Medicaid expansion is expected to add millions of newly eligible adults to the program. Regardless of state decisions on the expansion, all states will see an increase in enrollment due to the woodwork effect. The woodwork effect in Medicaid enrollment refers to uninsured individuals eligible for Medicaid who enroll due to increased media attention and outreach efforts associated with the ACA. Different Medicaid enrollment groups have varying service utilization patterns, with children without disabilities accounting for a smaller proportion of expenditures, while individuals with disabilities represent the largest share of benefit spending. Medicaid enrollees vary in demographics and corresponding benefit spending. Children without disabilities make up 17% of enrollees but only 44% of spending, while the elderly represent 9% of enrollees but 21% of spending. Medicaid coverage includes a range of services, with different eligibility classifications determining available benefits. Federal law outlines traditional benefits and alternative benefit plans for state Medicaid programs. States may offer a more restrictive benefit package for the medically needy subgroup. States have the flexibility to tailor Medicaid benefit packages for specific subgroups using waiver authority. Mandatory services include inpatient hospital care, lab services, physician care, and nursing facility services for individuals aged 21 and older. Optional services like personal care, prescription drugs, and physical therapy may also be covered. States define covered benefits within federal guidelines to ensure sufficiency in amount, duration, and scope. Limits may be placed on services as deemed appropriate. States have the flexibility to tailor Medicaid benefit packages for specific subgroups using waiver authority, ensuring sufficiency in amount, duration, and scope. Services must be equal in amount, duration, and scope within a state, with freedom of choice among providers. Coverage for a given benefit can vary from state to state, even for mandatory services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to offer benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, now known as Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs), which can waive certain Medicaid benefit requirements. ABPs give states flexibility in defining populations served and benefit packages. Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) offer flexibility in defining populations served and benefit packages. ABPs must cover essential health benefits and comply with federal requirements for mental health parity. States implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion must provide ABP coverage to eligible individuals. Medicaid plays a key role in providing a broad range of health and health-related services and supports needed by individuals who lack the capacity for self-care. Federal requirements for mental health parity apply, along with special rules for prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, and preventive care. Medicaid LTSS covers nursing facility services and home health, with states having the option to cover other types of LTSS such as case management and personal care services. Medicaid LTSS accounted for 26% of all Medicaid spending in FY2014, with 4.2 million beneficiaries receiving LTSS in FY2010. Medicaid funds LTSS in institutional and home-based settings, with services varying by state. Federal authority has expanded to increase Medicaid LTSS coverage, with a significant increase in spending for home and community-based services. The share of Medicaid LTSS spending for HCBS has increased significantly, from 33% in 2003 to 51% in 2013. In FY2014, 37% of benefit spending was for capitated payments under managed care, while LTSS and acute care services each represented a quarter of Medicaid payments. Medicaid provides additional coverage when other insurance sources are available. Federal statutes regulate cost-sharing for Medicaid enrollees. States can require certain Medicaid beneficiaries to share in the costs of services through cost sharing, including co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Premiums and enrollment fees are generally prohibited, but may be imposed on specific groups like individuals with higher incomes or certain disabilities. There are federal limits on the amounts states can impose and the services for which cost sharing can be charged. Medicaid beneficiaries may have to share costs through cost sharing like co-payments and deductibles, with an aggregate cap of up to 5% of monthly income. Benefits are provided through fee-for-service or managed care delivery systems, with an increasing number of enrollees under managed care since the 1990s. The managed care model has significantly increased, with about 72% of Medicaid enrollees covered by managed care in FY2011. Three types of Medicaid managed care include Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), Primary Care Case Management (PCCM), and fee-for-service delivery systems. States pay MCOs on a capitated basis to provide benefits, while PCCM involves primary care providers offering case management services to enrollees. Some states use limited benefit plans for Medicaid services, providing only one or two specific services. Managed care is expanding to include elderly and disabled populations. Alternative models like premium assistance and health savings accounts are also being utilized for ACA Medicaid expansion, such as in Arkansas. Arkansas and Michigan utilize different approaches for ACA Medicaid expansion - premium assistance and health savings accounts, respectively. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with no upper limit on federal funding. In FY2014, total Medicaid expenditures were $498 billion, with the federal share at $303 billion and the state share at $195 billion. Federal reimbursement rates vary by state based on per capita income relative to the U.S. average. The FMAP formula provides varying reimbursement rates to states based on per capita income, with rates ranging from 50% to 83%. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services in Medicaid expenditures. The ACA included exceptions to the regular FMAP rate for Medicaid, such as the newly eligible federal matching rates and the expansion state federal matching rates. The newly eligible federal matching rate starts at 100% in 2014 and phases down to 90% thereafter. The expansion state federal matching rate is based on a state's regular federal matching rate. The expansion state federal matching rates vary by state until 2019, when they will converge with the newly eligible rates at 93% and then phase down to 90% for 2020 and beyond. Certain federal Medicaid funding, like DSH funding and territories' Medicaid programs, are capped. States have guidelines for funding sources for the state share of Medicaid expenditures. States have flexibility in funding their share of Medicaid expenditures, using state general funds and other sources like provider taxes and local government funds. In 2013, 73% of the state share was financed by state general funds, with the remaining 27% from other state funds. Federal regulations prohibit the state share from being funded with federal funds. Medicaid maximization strategies involve using various funding mechanisms to draw down federal Medicaid funds without using much state general funds. Medicaid costs have been increasing faster than the overall U.S. economic growth, due to expansions in eligibility criteria and rising per enrollee costs. Medicaid expenditures are influenced by economic, demographic, and programmatic factors, including health care prices, unemployment rates, population growth, state decisions, and enrollment in other health insurance programs. Medicaid expenditures totaled $494 billion in FY2014 and are projected to reach $835 billion in FY2023. The federal government's share of Medicaid expenditures increased with the ACA Medicaid expansion, funding a majority of the expansion costs. The federal government's share of Medicaid expenditures increased to 60% in FY2014 and is expected to remain at that level through FY2023. States set their own payment rates for Medicaid providers, which must be sufficient to ensure access to covered benefits. Concerns about low physician payment rates have led some states to reduce rates during recessions, but recent trends show more states enhancing provider rates. States have been enhancing provider rates due to improvements in state finances. The ACA required Medicaid payment rates for certain primary care services to be raised to Medicare levels for CY2013 and CY2014. While the federal funding for this has expired, 15 states planned to continue the higher rates partially, 24 states did not, and the rest were undecided. Some states also make supplemental payments to Medicaid providers in addition to standard rates. In addition to standard payment rates, states can provide supplemental payments to Medicaid providers, subject to upper payment limits. Hospitals, nursing facilities, and clinics are among the institutions subject to these limits. Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments are a type of supplemental payment required by federal statute. In FY2014, federal DSH allotments totaled $11.7 billion, with reductions made by the ACA. The ACA made reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments totaling $11.7 billion in FY2014. Current law indicates that these reductions will impact FY2018 through FY2025, with states' DSH allotments rebounding to pre-reduced levels in FY2026. States have waiver authorities under the Social Security Act to try new approaches in Medicaid programs, including Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Projects. Waiver authorities under the Social Security Act, such as Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Projects, allow states to change Medicaid requirements, eligibility criteria, service offerings, program enrollment, and service delivery systems. Section 1915(b) permits states to establish managed care programs, while Section 1915(c) allows for Home- and Community-Based Services waivers. Section 1915(c) authorizes the Secretary of HHS to waive certain requirements of Medicaid law, allowing states to cover a broad range of Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) for individuals with LTSS needs. States can waive rules regarding statewideness and comparability of services, and apply income counting rules to make individuals eligible for Medicaid. Section 1915(b)/(c) waivers allow states to provide HCBS in a managed care setting or within a limited pool of providers, with states operating multiple waiver programs alongside their state plans. Key characteristics of primary Medicaid waiver authorities are summarized in Table 3, with waivers being time-limited and subject to reporting and evaluation requirements. All waivers must comply with financing requirements and program integrity initiatives to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicaid program. Oversight efforts focus on prevention through effective program management and addressing problems through investigations and enforcement activities. Eligibility determination has multiple integrity initiatives. Program integrity initiatives in Medicaid involve multiple federal and state agencies, including CMS, HHS, DOJ, and GAO. Coordination can be challenging due to the various agencies involved, each state's unique approach, and funding contributions from both federal and state governments to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The ACA introduced provisions to increase uniformity in program integrity activities for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. This includes additional provider screening requirements and the creation of an integrated data repository for better data sharing among federal and state agencies. Additionally, the ACA established a recovery audit contractor requirement for Medicaid. The ACA introduced provisions for program integrity activities in Medicaid, including the requirement for Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC) to identify overpayments and underpayments. Medicaid is facing challenges related to the ACA Medicaid expansion, coordination of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries, ACA health insurance annual fees, and the Medicaid maintenance of effort provision. The ACA aims to increase access to affordable health insurance for the uninsured and make it more affordable for those with coverage. The Medicaid expansion under the ACA created a new eligibility group for adults under 65 with income up to 133% of FPL. States were expected to implement the expansion in 2014 to receive federal matching rates. The Supreme Court's ruling in NFIB made state participation in the ACA Medicaid expansion voluntary, with no deadline for states to decide. If a state accepts the expansion funds, it must follow the new coverage rules. The ACA Medicaid expansion allows states to decide whether to implement it, with the option to discontinue at any time. To receive 100% federal financing for newly eligible enrollees, states must have implemented the expansion by January 1, 2014. Some states implemented the expansion on later dates, such as Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Montana. In April 2015, Alaska signed a bill for the ACA Medicaid expansion, requiring a federal waiver for implementation. Utah is currently debating the expansion. In FY2011, there were 10.2 million dual-eligible beneficiaries, qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid. Dual-eligible individuals qualify for Medicaid based on categorical and financial requirements, with different types of coverage available. There are various eligibility pathways for dual-eligible beneficiaries, including full and partial dual-eligible beneficiaries. Full dual-eligible beneficiaries receive full benefits from both Medicare and Medicaid. In FY2011, there were 7.5 million full dual-eligible beneficiaries who receive full benefits from Medicare and Medicaid, with Medicaid spending totaling $134.3 billion. Additionally, there were 2.6 million partial dual-eligible beneficiaries who receive full benefits from Medicare and financial assistance from Medicaid, with $6.0 billion in Medicaid spending. Coordinating care and services for dual-eligible beneficiaries presents challenges due to the administrative complexity of coordinating benefits between Medicare and Medicaid. Coordinating care for dual-eligible beneficiaries is complex due to the different rules and processes of Medicare and Medicaid. Uncoordinated care can be costly and inefficient, impacting the quality of care and increasing spending. To address this, federal and state policymakers are focusing on improving care coordination. The ACA established the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office to enhance care coordination and test innovative payment models. CMS is funding demonstrations to reduce costs and improve care for dual-eligible beneficiaries. The ACA imposes an annual fee on certain for-profit health insurers, starting in 2014, including Medicaid MCOs. Approximately 80% of Medicaid enrollees covered by managed care are impacted by this fee, leading some insurance plans to pass on the cost to businesses and enrollees through higher premiums. The ACA imposes an annual fee on for-profit health insurers, including Medicaid MCOs. State governors caution that this fee will increase costs to Medicaid, as some states are willing to include it in capitation rates, leading to higher Medicaid expenditures. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions to maintain Medicaid eligibility standards and procedures to ensure coverage continuity until the implementation of health insurance exchanges. The ACA MOE provisions required states to maintain Medicaid eligibility standards and procedures until the health insurance exchanges were operational. Failure to comply would result in the loss of federal Medicaid matching funds. States were allowed to make cuts to Medicaid in other ways, but income eligibility could not be restricted from July 1, 2008, through January 1, 2014. The ACA MOE for children is to remain in place until September 30, 2019. The ACA MOE for children is to remain in place until September 30, 2019. For more information on Medicaid, CRS reports are available on topics such as financing, benefits, long-term services, prescription drug pricing, out-of-pocket costs, and eligibility standards. Table A-1 shows Medicaid eligibility levels based on MAGI as of January 1, 2015, expressed as a percentage of the federal poverty level. Table B-1 provides state-by-state Medicaid data on enrollment, expenditures, and FMAP rates."
