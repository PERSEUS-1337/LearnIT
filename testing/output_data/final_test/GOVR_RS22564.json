    "content": "The federal government operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs) through the Department of Energy. These PMAs include the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Congressional interest in the PMAs covers various issues such as rate setting, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, and privatization concerns. PMAs market electric power from federal dams, giving preference to public utility districts and cooperatives, and selling power at cost-based rates. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) was created in 1937 to market federal power from dams in the Pacific Northwest. It serves 60 million Americans in 34 states, providing electricity at cost-based rates with preference to public customers. Each PMA has unique regional issues affecting its business. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) was established in 1937 to market federal power from dams in the Pacific Northwest. BPA covers its operating costs through power rates and has a self-financed model, with no federal appropriations. It maintains a large transmission system with over 15,000 miles of transmission lines and approximately 300 substations. BPA also has permanent Treasury borrowing authority for capital on large projects, repaid through power sales. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has a borrowing authority of $4.45 billion for large projects, funded through power sales. In FY2007 and FY2008, BPA plans to use $461 million and $538 million respectively. There are ongoing issues related to salmon recovery in the Columbia and Snake Rivers, involving conflicts over dam operations and environmental concerns. The Endangered Species Act is seen as inadequate in preventing the extinction of threatened species. Some argue that removing dams on the Snake River is necessary for the survival of salmon and steelhead species. The resolution of the lawsuit and the fate of the dams could impact the Bonneville Power Administration's ability to sell electricity and may lead to increased power rates. Another issue for BPA is the regional dialogue, which aims to define its power supply and marketing role long-term, including 20-year contracts and tiered rate methodology post FY2011. Developing a plan that satisfies BPA's customers and addresses service to public utilities is a challenge in the regional dialogue. SEPA, a small PMA with 40 employees, does not operate transmission facilities and contracts with other utilities to transmit federal power to over 13 million consumers. It receives annual appropriations and repays funding through power revenues. FY2007 appropriation request was $6.5 million, actual appropriations were $6.4 million. SEPA is facing reduced generation from one of its dams. SEPA is contending with reduced generation from the Wolf Creek Dam in Kentucky, leading to a decrease in power generation capability. The dam's powerhouse has a capacity of 270 MW, approximately 8% of SEPA's total generating capacity. SWPA serves over 100 preference customer utilities with 7 million end-use customers in the south-central United States, managing 1,400 miles of high-voltage transmission lines with 24 substations. SWPA returns revenues to the U.S. Treasury for repayment of federal investment in facilities. SWPA requested $30.4 million in appropriations for FY2008 but received $30.2 million due to a Department of Energy rescission. The agency faced challenges due to low water conditions as it relies on rain-based water supply. Operating through 21 months of drought in 2006, SWPA had to use a fund to cover power purchases. Continued dryness would make it difficult to purchase power for customers. Generation improved in FY2007, and FY2008 generation has been better. During the drought period of 2006, SWPA faced challenges due to low water conditions and had to use a fund to cover power purchases. Access to the fund was initially denied by OMB, raising policy questions for the 110th Congress. A proposal in the FY2008 Congressional Budget Request would require PMAs to recover expenditures from ratepayers within one year. WAPA, created by the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, is the newest and largest of the PMAs, serving customers over a vast area with a high voltage grid. WAPA, one of the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), serves customers in 15 western states with electricity from federal dams. It also sells power from the Navajo Generating Station and gives preference to Native American tribes. In FY2008, WAPA requested $201.0 million but received $228.9 million. One of its key concerns is relieving transmission congestion in its marketing area. WAPA is interested in resolving transmission congestion issues in the West, such as Path 15 and TOT 3. While lacking funds for new construction, WAPA is willing to collaborate with other parties. Congress allocated $30 million more than requested for WAPA projects under P.L. 110-161. In FY2006, Congress allocated $30 million more than requested for WAPA construction, rehabilitation, and O&M funding. The budget proposal aimed to reclassify receipts to allow PMAs to fund their expenses through offsetting collections, potentially reducing reallocation of appropriations to other efforts. The budget proposal aimed to reclassify receipts to allow PMAs to fund their expenses through offsetting collections, potentially reducing reallocation of appropriations to other efforts. Congress did not agree to this change for FY2006, but a renewed proposal for a net-zero appropriations approach to PMA operations funding may be an issue for the 110th Congress."
