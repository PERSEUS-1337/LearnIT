    "title": "AB 867",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 42 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows for a refund of any tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount that has been illegally collected, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Revenue and Taxation Code allows for refunds of illegally collected amounts. Claims for refund must be filed within one year of a final court decision. Refunds will be issued in accordance with the provisions of this section. Interest will be paid on refunds as per the relevant provisions of the tax code. The period for filing a recovery action against the tax agency for overpayments will not start until the one-year claim period has expired. Refund suits must adhere to the code's provisions. Section 5148 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow tax agencies to refund amounts paid without the need for a claim, with the Legislature allocating necessary funds for refunds. The definition of \"tax agency\" includes the board and the Franchise Tax Board. Section 5148 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to specify that an action to recover taxes on state-assessed property due to assessment disputes must be brought by the state assessee, with all parties joined in a single complaint for any year. The action to recover taxes on state-assessed property must name the board and county or counties involved. If a county collected taxes on behalf of a city, they must notify the city within 30 days. The state assessee must pay a fee for the county's notification costs. Cities can intervene in the action within 30 days. Any judgment against the assessee will be against the county, which can then recover taxes from the city or other tax entities. Payment to the taxpayer upon judgment and any interest may be deferred by the county until the next property tax revenue apportionment. The county can offset the judgment amount against funds in the treasury or amounts due to the city or tax entities. The fee required by this section is not recoverable by the assessee in the action. Service of the summons and complaint is only upon the board, acting as agent for the defendant county or counties. The venue of the action can be in any county where the Attorney General of California has an office or where the state assessee has a significant presence. The action is limited to specific grounds for valuation and allocation disputes. A timely filed petition for reassessment or correction of allocated assessment serves as a claim for refund if stated in the petition. The action must be initiated within four years of the State Board of Equalization's decision, and any tax overpayments refunded by the defendant county. The Legislature allows refunds for taxes, fees, or other amounts determined to be illegally collected by the Franchise Tax Board or State Board of Equalization in a court decision. The action must be initiated within one year of the court's decision."
