    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), including historical aid levels, specific country programs, and current issues. It also analyzes the Administration's FY2021 budget request for State Department and USAID SFOPS appropriations in the region. Congress oversees aid programs and the Middle East is a major recipient of U.S. assistance. Data is sourced from USAID's Greenbook and appropriations data. The report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), sourced from the Loans and Grants Database. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to impact all MENA countries, especially poorer nations receiving international assistance. The data in the report predates the pandemic. U.S. aid to MENA countries aims to support foreign policy goals like countering terrorism and containing Iranian influence. U.S. foreign assistance in the MENA region focuses on countering terrorism, preventing weapons proliferation, supporting Israeli-Arab peace, and addressing humanitarian crises in Syria and Yemen. The majority of aid goes to Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, with Israel being the largest recipient since World War II, primarily in the form of military assistance to maintain its military edge. U.S. military aid to Egypt and Jordan aims to promote Israeli-Arab cooperation on security issues and ensure interoperability with U.S. partners in the CENTCOM area. Economic assistance in the MENA region focuses on education, water, health, and economic growth to address public dissatisfaction and youth challenges like rising living costs and unemployment. The Arab Barometer notes widespread youth discontent in the Middle East about economic prospects, leading to frustration with government efforts. Governments in the MENA region face challenges like corruption, over-reliance on oil, and high public debt. U.S. foreign assistance to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq reflects significant support. The Administration proposes reducing aid to the MENA region in FY2021. The Administration proposes a 12% reduction in bilateral assistance to the MENA region for FY2021, totaling $6.6 billion. This includes cuts to military and economic aid for Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Jordan. Stabilization programs in Syria will not receive funding. The Administration aims to share the economic burden with the international community while promoting self-reliance in MENA countries. The Administration is requesting up to $160 million in funding for the Relief and Recovery Fund (RRF) to assist areas liberated or at risk from terrorist organizations like the Islamic State in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. The RRF aims to provide flexibility in supporting efforts in rapidly changing situations on the ground. The Trump Administration ended U.S. contributions to stabilization efforts in Syria but may use FY2021 funds for programs there. No U.S. bilateral economic or security assistance aid was requested for the Palestinians, with reduced funding to the West Bank and Gaza and discontinued contributions to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees. The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 has halted bilateral assistance to Palestinians since January 2019. The Administration proposed using funds from the \"Diplomatic Progress Fund\" to resume security assistance in the West Bank or support Middle East peace efforts. Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II, receiving $142.3 billion in military aid. The U.S. provides military aid to Israel through a 10-year Memorandum of Understanding, pledging $38 billion in total. This includes $33 billion in Foreign Military Financing grants and $5 billion for missile defense. Israel is the largest recipient of FMF worldwide, using the aid to purchase advanced U.S. weapons systems. In 2020, a sale of eight KC-46A Boeing aircraft to Israel was notified to Congress for $2.4 billion. Israel is set to purchase eight KC-46A Boeing \"Pegasus\" aircraft for $2.4 billion. The aircraft will allow Israel to refuel its F-35 fighters, making it the second foreign user of the KC-46A after Japan. The U.S. has provided Egypt with significant foreign assistance since the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. The U.S. has provided significant foreign assistance to Egypt, including military aid for regional stability and economic aid for various programs. Congress has appropriated $300 million for the U.S.-Egyptian Enterprise Fund. Egypt's governance and human rights record has faced criticism from U.S. officials and Congress, leading to conditions on the obligation of military aid. The Trump Administration has obligated $1 billion in FMF for Egypt, with $300 million remaining withheld until certification is issued. Congress has appropriated over $1.4 billion in total bilateral aid for Egypt in the past three fiscal years. The United States provides significant foreign aid to Egypt and Jordan. In addition to aid for Egypt, the U.S. has committed $6.375 billion in bilateral assistance to Jordan over a five-year period. This aid includes military assistance for weapons procurement and economic aid to support Jordan's development. The United States provides economic aid to Jordan for budgetary support, USAID programs, and loan guarantees. Cash transfer assistance is the largest budget support given to any U.S. foreign aid recipient. The aid helps with foreign debt payments, Syrian refugee support, and fuel import costs. Since FY2012, over $1.3 billion has been allocated for humanitarian assistance in Jordan. The United States provides military, economic, stabilization, and security assistance to Iraq, primarily through the Defense Department Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF). Congress has authorized over $6.5 billion in funding for train and equip assistance in Iraq from FY2015 to FY2020. Iraq purchases U.S.-origin weapons systems through the Foreign Military Sales program, with FMF funds used for urgent counterterrorism requirements during the battle against the Islamic State. The U.S. provides military, economic, stabilization, and security assistance to Iraq, including a $6.5 billion FMF loan for defense systems. Assistance also includes public financial management reform, stabilization programs, loan guarantees, and support for persecuted Iraqi religious minority groups. P.L. 116-94 directs funds for Anbar province, Kurdistan Region, transitional justice, and accountability programs for genocide and war crimes in Iraq. Tunisia has transitioned to democracy since the Arab uprisings in 2011, receiving increased U.S. aid for economic growth, governance, and security. U.S.-Tunisia security cooperation has grown, with support for defense reform and counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. has provided funding for law enforcement strengthening and reform, as well as bilateral military assistance to Tunisia. The United States has provided additional counterterrorism and border security assistance to Tunisia under its \"global train and equip\" authority. Congress has consistently appropriated more bilateral aid to Tunisia than the President requested. The Administration cited a request for a $500 million FMF loan for U.S.-manufactured light attack aircraft for the Tunisian Armed Forces. The U.S. aims to bolster forces to counter Syrian and Iranian influence in Lebanon through various military and economic assistance programs. The U.S. provides military and economic assistance to Lebanon to address concerns about Sunni jihadist groups, Hezbollah, and to support Israel's military edge. Economic aid aims to promote democracy and stability amidst challenges from the conflict in Syria. Congress imposes certification requirements to prevent misuse of funds or equipment transfer to designated terrorists like Hezbollah. Concerns have risen over U.S. assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces due to Hezbollah's involvement in the Syria conflict. The United States provides military and economic assistance to Lebanon through programs like FMF and CTEF. Between FY2015 and FY2019, an average of $224 million annually was allocated for security assistance. This funding has been used to procure light attack helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and night vision devices for the Lebanese Armed Forces. Additionally, U.S. programs aim to increase the capacity of the public sector to provide basic services to refugees and Lebanese host communities, including water, sanitation, and health services. The United States provides military and economic assistance to Lebanon through programs like FMF and CTEF. U.S. programs aim to increase the capacity of the public education system to cope with the refugee influx. For FY2021, the President is requesting $133 million in total bilateral aid to Lebanon, which is 46% less than what Congress provided in FY2020. Congress has appropriated an average of $113.5 million per year above the President's request for the past three fiscal years. Additionally, the United States provides aid to Middle Eastern countries through regional programs like the Middle East Regional Partnership Initiative (MEPI) to support political reform, women's and youth empowerment, quality education, and economic opportunity in the Arab world. MEPI, funded by Congress with $1.1 billion in ESF since 2002, supports U.S. democracy promotion in the Arab world by funding local NGOs. The Local Grants Program builds capacity for small organizations in the Middle East, but legal restrictions in some countries pose risks for cooperation. Egypt's arrests of NGO specialists highlight challenges. The Middle East Regional (MER) program, managed by USAID, focuses on women's rights, public health, water scarcity, and education, with a $50 million ESF funding request for FY2021. The Administration is requesting $50 million in ESF funding for the Middle East Regional (MER) program for FY2021. Near East Regional Democracy (NERD) promotes democracy and human rights in Iran, with training for activists funded through ESF. The Administration has bundled its NERD request with MEPI for an $84.5 million ESF request for \"State NEA Regional\" in FY2021. For FY2020, Appropriators specified $70 million in ESF for NERD. The Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) program, managed by USAID and funded through ESF, supports scientific cooperation between Israelis and Arabs. Established in 1979, MERC funds joint Arab-Israeli research in various sectors. The Administration is not requesting ESF for MERC in FY2021, but $5 million was specified for MERC in FY2020 appropriations. The Administration is not requesting ESF for MEM in FY2021, and the last funding was in FY2018. TSCTP is a State Department-led initiative supporting counter-terrorism efforts in North and West Africa. Three North African countries participate, with Libya also involved. The majority of funding has been focused on the Sahel region. Since 2010, the United States has allocated $16.4 billion in humanitarian response funding to the Middle East, with over $10.6 billion directed towards the Syria crisis. Yemen's humanitarian crisis is considered the worst globally, with 80% of its population needing aid. The United States, along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, are major donors to U.N. appeals for aid, providing over $3 billion since 2011. The United States has provided over $3 billion in emergency humanitarian aid for Yemen since 2011, primarily through USAID's Office of Food for Peace. They have also been a major donor of humanitarian assistance during Iraq's confrontation with the Islamic State, providing more than $2.6 billion since 2014 for food, sanitation, and assistance for displaced communities. Humanitarian assistance is managed by USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, Office of Food for Peace, and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. The Trump Administration's policy changes and legislation have halted various types of U.S. aid to the Palestinians. This includes withholding bilateral economic assistance in FY2017 and ceasing requests for assistance after Palestinian leadership protested the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Palestinian Authority stopped accepting all U.S. aid, including security assistance, after the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018. The Palestinian Authority decided not to accept U.S. bilateral aid to avoid U.S. jurisdiction in terrorism-related lawsuits. Congress passed the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 to address the impact of this decision. The Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019, part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, changes the legal framework for terrorism-related offenses. It is uncertain if Palestinians will accept the changes and resume U.S. aid. Congress allocated $75 million for PA security assistance and $75 million for economic assistance in FY2020. The Trump Administration's stance on restarting U.S. aid for Palestinians remains uncertain, with potential conditions tied to diplomatic contacts. The omission of bilateral assistance for the West Bank and Gaza in the FY2021 budget request, along with a proposal for a \"Diplomatic Progress Fund,\" may signal a shift towards supporting future diplomatic efforts. The Trump Administration's stance on restarting U.S. aid for Palestinians remains uncertain. The Administration requested funds for a Diplomatic Progress Fund in FY2020, but Congress provided $150 million in bilateral aid instead. Concerns have been raised by some Members of Congress about the impact of the uncertainty on humanitarian aid reaching the Palestinian population during the COVID-19 outbreak. In response, several Senators urged the Administration to provide necessary assistance to prevent a humanitarian disaster in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Trump Administration announced $5 million in International Disaster Assistance for the West Bank as part of its global COVID-19 response. This aid is not a change in policy towards Palestinians but aims to combat the pandemic in the Middle East. Debate continues over the effectiveness of U.S. military assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces in countering terrorism. Critics argue that U.S. aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) risks equipment falling into the hands of Hezbollah. They claim the LAF is unable to enforce UN Resolution 1701 for disarmament. Recent concerns include Hezbollah's support for the Assad regime in Syria, leading to closer coordination between Hezbollah and the LAF along the Lebanese-Syrian border. In 2019, the Trump Administration withheld $105 million in military aid to the LAF for a policy review. Lawmakers introduced the \"Countering Hezbollah in Lebanon's Military Act of 2019\" in response. The House and Senate introduced the \"Countering Hezbollah in Lebanon's Military Act of 2019,\" withholding 20% of U.S. military assistance to the LAF unless measures are taken to limit Hezbollah's influence. State and Defense Departments opposed the hold on aid, citing the LAF as a stabilizing force in Lebanon. In December 2019, the Administration lifted the hold on aid to Lebanon. In December 2019, the Administration lifted its hold on FMF to Lebanon. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed U.S. security assistance to Lebanon, noting progress but gaps in performance information. In January 2020, Lebanon formed a new government criticized for its composition. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper affirmed commitment to security assistance for the Lebanese Armed Forces. Iraq's economy has been strained by years of war, corruption, and economic mismanagement, leading to widespread frustration and protests. The 2019 national budget ran a record deficit, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices in 2020. Iraqi authorities are confident in their ability to withstand these challenges in the short term, but concerns remain about potential violence, unrest, and an Islamic State resurgence due to pressure on state finances and economic activity. Iraq's draft 2020 budget assumed an oil export price of $56 per barrel, but with prices dropping, Iraq faces a monthly deficit of over $2 billion. Without outside assistance, Iraq may need to tap into reserves, cut salaries, and limit social spending. International financial institutions like the IMF could provide external financing, but Iraq has not met reform targets. IMF has previously provided over $5 billion in loans to help Iraq cope with lower oil prices. Iraq faces a monthly deficit of over $2 billion due to dropping oil prices. The IMF has provided over $5 billion in loans to help Iraq cope with this situation. The future of U.S.-Iraq ties and assistance, including the presence of U.S. forces, will be discussed in a high-level strategic dialogue in June. Congress is considering the appropriate level of assistance for the MENA region in the President's FY2021 budget request. The FY2021 budget request for MENA focuses on stabilizing and reconstructing areas recaptured from ISIS. Recent intelligence warns of an insurgent campaign in Syria and Iraq, with billions needed for reconstruction. Despite minimal progress in rebuilding post-ISIS areas, there are concerns about potential challenges arising. Residents' resentment towards ISIS may not lead them back to the group, but there are worries about the future if these areas are not addressed. Since FY2017, Congress has allocated over $1 billion in aid for areas affected by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Lawmakers have mandated that funds for the Relief and Recovery Fund be used to help vulnerable communities on a cost-matching basis. Geographic limitations on the fund have been removed to ensure assistance for ethnic and religious minorities affected by conflict. Congress has allocated over $1 billion in aid for areas affected by ISIS and other terrorist groups since FY2017. Funds from the Relief and Recovery Fund have been directed to countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Jordan, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, Lebanon, East and West Africa, the Sahel, and the Lake Chad Basin region. Stabilization efforts in Iraq have received over $396 million in U.S. aid through the United Nations Development Program's Funding Facility for Stabilization. The Trump Administration has also directed contributions to address war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in Iraq and Syria. The Trump Administration has directed U.S. contributions to the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS) in Iraq to help vulnerable religious and ethnic minority communities in Ninewa Plain and western Ninewa. The international community has pledged $30 billion for Iraq's reconstruction efforts, but the country needs $88 billion according to the Iraqi government. Only over $1 billion has been received for reconstruction as of late 2019. As of late 2019, just over $1 billion in reconstruction pledges have been delivered for Syria. The conflict has entered its tenth year with estimated costs exceeding $388 billion. The Trump Administration has supported stabilization in areas controlled by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and sought to prevent aid to areas controlled by the Syrian government. However, in 2018 and 2019, the Administration aimed to shift funding responsibility to coalition partners. The FY2020 and FY2021 foreign assistance budget requests have no Syria-specific funding. The Trump Administration has provided $50 million in stabilization funding for Syria in late 2019, primarily from FY2019 ESF-OCO funds. The administration has stated its intent not to contribute to the reconstruction of Asad-controlled areas without a political settlement. The Trump Administration has provided $50 million in stabilization funding for Syria in late 2019, primarily from FY2019 ESF-OCO funds. Congress has restricted U.S. funds for assistance projects in Asad-held areas to discourage international assistance. Without U.S. engagement, Russia or China could potentially provide assistance for reconstruction, but may not mobilize sufficient resources or coordinate investments effectively. Predatory conditional assistance could further indebt Syria to international actors and strengthen strategic ties in ways contrary to U.S. interests, delaying the country's recovery and exacerbating the conflict's legacy effects. In the Middle East, the United States faces challenges in balancing national security interests with democratic principles when providing foreign aid. Cooperation with non-democratic governments for stability and counterterrorism has been necessary, but policy levers like conditional aid have been used to demand better behavior. This delicate balance could impact Syria's recovery and worsen the conflict's effects on its population. The United States faces challenges in balancing national security interests with democratic principles in the Middle East. Policy levers like conditional aid have been used to demand better behavior from non-democratic governments accused of human rights abuses. U.S. laws limit foreign assistance in cases of gross violations of human rights, aiming to reinforce democratic principles while maintaining security cooperation. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) includes provisions addressing human rights concerns, such as restrictions on the sale of defense articles for specific purposes only. The \"Leahy Laws\" prohibit the sale of U.S.-origin defense articles if they are used in substantial violation of agreements or for unauthorized purposes. The \"Leahy Laws\" and other legislative provisions restrict U.S. security assistance to foreign security forces with human rights violations. Recent legislation conditions aid to Egypt on improvements in democracy and human rights. The Secretary of State may waive certification requirements for advancing democracy and human rights in Egypt, but any waiver must be justified to appropriations committees. There is ongoing debate about using foreign aid as leverage to promote human rights. The State Department has considered cutting up to $300 million in aid to Egypt after the death of an American citizen in 2020. In 2017, the Trump Administration reduced aid to Egypt by $65.7 million due to Egyptian inaction on critical requests. The Republic of Korea has made little progress on the 2013 convictions of U.S. and Egyptian NGO workers. A restrictive NGO law has been enacted, complicating U.S. assistance to the country."
