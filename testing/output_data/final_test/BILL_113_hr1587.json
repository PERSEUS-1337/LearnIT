    "content": "The \"Energy Infrastructure Improvement Act\" may be cited as the short title. It provides authority for natural gas and oil pipelines. The Energy Infrastructure Improvement Act allows the Secretary to issue permits for natural gas, oil, or petroleum products pipelines on eligible Federal lands. Permits must comply with applicable laws and regulations and include fees to cover processing and monitoring costs. The Secretary charges an annual fee for each permit based on fair market rental value. The initial fixed term for a permit considers costs, useful life, and public/economic purpose of the pipeline. The Secretary may renew a right-of-way permit for a pipeline if it is in commercial operation and compliant with regulations. Enforcement measures include citations, fines, and permit suspension for noncompliance or violations. The Secretary may suspend or terminate a permit if grounds exist, after providing due notice, opportunity to remedy, and an administrative proceeding. Misuse or nonuse of a permit for two years may lead to abandonment. The Secretary can suspend or terminate a permit if necessary, with a process involving notice and opportunity to remedy. Failure to use the permit may not lead to suspension if circumstances are beyond the permittee's control. A permittee can challenge the Secretary's decision in court within 90 days. The Secretary can modify a permit if agreed upon by the permittee and compliant with regulations. (g) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, \"eligible Federal lands\" refer to Federal lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, excluding lands held in trust for a federally recognized Indian tribe or on the Outer Continental Shelf, and National Forest System lands. The term \"facility\" includes buildings and pipelines. The term \"permittee\" refers to the owner of a natural gas, oil, or petroleum products pipeline and their successors or assigns. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture, depending on the administrative jurisdiction over the Federal lands involved."
