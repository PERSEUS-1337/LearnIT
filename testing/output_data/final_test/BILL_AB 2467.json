    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016 aims to ensure efficient use of taxpayer funds by regulating excessive compensation packages for executives of nonprofit hospitals. The Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016 aims to prevent excessive compensation for executives in nonprofit hospitals, as it can divert funds from charitable purposes and lead to less charitable care provided by these institutions. Current laws do not effectively prevent assets meant for charitable use from being used to enrich executives through excessive compensation. The compensation packages for executives in for-profit hospitals in California are often excessive and inconsistent with providing affordable medical care. Executives who also serve on boards of other companies risk neglecting their primary responsibilities. The California Legislature aims to understand and address excessive compensation in the nonprofit hospital sector to control healthcare costs. They also seek to ensure equal compensation for healthcare workers based on job classification and demographic factors. The goal is to align compensation packages for hospital executives with the aim of providing affordable, high-quality medical care to all Californians. The California Legislature aims to regulate compensation in the nonprofit hospital sector to control costs and ensure fair pay for healthcare workers. The Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016 aims to align executive compensation with the charitable purposes of nonprofits and prevent discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016 aims to regulate executive compensation in nonprofit hospitals to ensure fair pay for healthcare workers. Definitions in the act include terms like \"annual hospital executive compensation report\" and \"board compensation.\" Covered entities include private nonprofit general acute care hospitals and acute psychiatric hospitals. The Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016 regulates executive compensation in nonprofit hospitals. It includes definitions for various entities like acute psychiatric hospitals, for-profit general acute care hospitals, hospital groups, and hospital-affiliated medication foundations. The medical foundation is considered a disregarded entity or related organization of a hospital, hospital group, or nonprofit corporation that owns or operates a hospital. A hospital-affiliated physicians group is defined as a physicians group or medical group that is majority-owned by a hospital, hospital group, or nonprofit corporation that operates a hospital. A hospital-affiliated physicians group is considered a related organization to a hospital, hospital group, or hospital-affiliated medical foundation. It may also be majority-owned by a nonprofit corporation that operates a hospital. This definition excludes health care districts organized under specific regulations. The definition of \"Covered hospital or medical entity\" excludes certain hospitals, such as those operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs or public hospitals, except for those owned by health care districts. The \"Executive compensation reporting threshold\" is set at annual compensation exceeding $250,000 or $300,000 for work performed at the covered entity. The definition of \"Hospital executive\" includes individuals with executive, managerial, or administrative roles at the covered hospital or medical entity, with examples such as chief executive officers, presidents, and vice presidents. The definition of \"hospital executive\" applies to individuals with executive, managerial, or administrative authority at a covered hospital or medical entity, regardless of employment status. It also includes individuals who held such duties during the period covered by the annual report, but excludes medical or health care professionals primarily involved in direct patient care or nonmanagerial roles. The \"Total annual compensation\" includes all remuneration for work performed in a fiscal year, including benefits in any form other than cash, as defined by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The \"Total annual compensation\" encompasses various forms of remuneration for work performed, including wages, bonuses, housing payments, transportation expenses, stock options, insurance contributions, and deferred compensation. The total value of compensation or payments under a severance arrangement includes cash and non-cash remuneration. Payments for work at a hospital or medical entity are also covered, regardless of the entity making the payment. The text chunk discusses the payment of compensation by entities related to hospitals or medical organizations, which is presumed to be for work performed at the entity. Each covered hospital or medical entity must submit an annual report on hospital executive compensation, excluding health insurance costs. The report should detail the names, positions, and total annual compensation of executives meeting or exceeding the reporting threshold. The annual report on hospital executive compensation must include a breakdown of all wage and nonwage compensation, identification of excluded benefits, and details of board compensation received from other organizations. Each covered hospital or medical entity with 100 or more employees must submit annual equal employment opportunity and compensation reports by job category and pay bands for employees' ethnicity, race, and gender, as well as self-reported sexual orientation and gender identity. The annual hospital executive compensation report for covered hospitals or medical entities must include the total hours worked by employees in each pay band. Nonprofit or for-profit corporations owning such entities must approve the report before submission to the office. Directors are required to act in good faith and ensure compliance with the section's requirements. The annual report for covered hospitals or medical entities must be approved by the board of directors and attested to under penalty of perjury. Any attempt to avoid reporting requirements or provide disproportionate payments to evade executive compensation reporting is a violation of the section. The office will establish reasonable fees for annual reports to cover costs of implementing this section. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts as this act pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
