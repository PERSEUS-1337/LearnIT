    "content": "Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"PART E--CLASS SIZE REDUCTION\" with the short title \"Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act of 1999\". Congress finds that students in small classes in early grades show faster educational progress compared to larger classes. This benefit is most significant for lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. Teachers in small classes can provide more individualized attention, cover more material effectively, and work better with parents to enhance children's education. Students in smaller classes show faster educational progress, especially lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. Smaller classes allow for more individualized attention, better engagement in learning, and potentially reduce the need for special education services. To improve educational achievement, well-prepared teachers should be hired and receive training for working effectively in smaller classroom settings. The Federal Government can assist in reducing class sizes in early elementary grades by providing funding for grades 1 through 3 and ensuring well-prepared teachers are hired. The purpose of this part is to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 additional teachers over 7 years to reduce class sizes in grades 1 through 3 to an average of 18 students per classroom and improve teaching for early grades to ensure all students can read well by the end of third grade. The authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2005 totals $1.4 billion to $2.8 billion. The Secretary will allot funds to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, outlying areas, and States based on previous allocations. The funds allocated to States for the previous fiscal year under section 1122 or section 2202(b) will be ratably decreased as necessary. States can use a portion of the amount received for administrative costs. Each State must distribute their allotted amount accordingly. The remaining funds under this section will be distributed to local educational agencies based on the number of children aged 5 to 17 from low-income families in the school district served by the agency. The funds will be allocated to local educational agencies based on the number of children aged 5 to 17 from low-income families in the school districts served by the agencies. 20 percent of the remaining funds will be distributed according to the relative enrollments of children in public and private nonprofit schools. The funds will be allocated to local educational agencies based on the number of children aged 5 to 17 from low-income families in the school districts served by the agencies. If the award to a local educational agency is less than the starting salary for a new teacher, the State shall not make the award unless the agency forms a consortium or supplements the award with non-Federal funds. The funds allocated to local educational agencies are based on the number of children from low-income families. If the award is less than a new teacher's starting salary, the agency must form a consortium or supplement with non-Federal funds. Each local educational agency receiving funds must use them to reduce class size with qualified teachers, especially in early grades. They can achieve this by recruiting, hiring, and training certified teachers, including those from alternative routes, and testing new teachers for academic content. The local educational agency must use funds to reduce class size with qualified teachers, including testing new teachers for academic content knowledge and providing professional development. They are restricted to using 15% of funds for these activities in fiscal years 2000 through 2003, with no funds allowed for these activities in fiscal years 2004 or 2005. A local educational agency can use funds to further reduce class size in early grades, improve teacher quality, and supplement state and local funds. No funds can be used to increase salaries or provide benefits. The local educational agency can use funds for professional development activities, ensuring participation of private nonprofit schools. Up to 3 percent of funds can be used for administrative expenses. The Federal share of costs for activities under this program can be up to 100% for local educational agencies with child-poverty levels of 50% or more, and no more than 65% for agencies with child-poverty rates below 50%. Local agencies must provide the non-Federal share through cash expenditures from non-Federal sources, or allocated funds from specific programs. Each local educational agency applying for funds under this program must describe their plan to reduce class size by hiring qualified teachers. States and schools receiving funds must report on their activities and student achievement resulting from hiring additional teachers and reducing class size."
