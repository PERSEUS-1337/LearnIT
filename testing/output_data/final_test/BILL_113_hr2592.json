Eligible networks include various stakeholders aiming to prepare students for STEM careers. The \"STEM Innovation Networks Act of 2013\" aims to increase student achievement in STEM fields, particularly for historically underrepresented students. Eligible networks can apply for grants to expand STEM education opportunities, including afterschool programs. Eligible networks must submit an application with required information to receive a grant under this section. They must also provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 30 percent of the grant amount. The funds can be used for testing, sharing, and scaling up STEM education research and programs among network members.
