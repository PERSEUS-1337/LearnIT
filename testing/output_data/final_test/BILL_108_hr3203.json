    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Foot Complication and Lower Extremity Amputation Reduction Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that diabetes in the United States is a significant issue, with 17 million patients costing $132 billion annually. There has been a 61% increase in diabetes cases since 1990, leading to more lower extremity amputations. Medicare costs for diabetes patients with foot ulcers are three times higher than for diabetes patients in general. Cost effective ulcer prevention and treatment interventions can reduce Medicare costs as inpatient care makes up 74% of diabetic ulcer-related costs. Lower extremity amputations, costing an average of $60,000, are a burden on the health system. Research shows that a multidisciplinary approach can reduce amputation rates by over 50% at a fraction of the cost. Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include grants for education, screening, and treatment of diabetic foot complications. The Secretary awards grants to eligible entities for providing high-risk populations with diabetic foot complication education and treatment, evaluating medical interventions, and restricting the use of grants to preventive treatments or comprehensive care. Eligible entities are multidisciplinary health care programs demonstrating eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary awards grants to eligible entities for providing high-risk populations with diabetic foot complication education and treatment. Eligible entities must demonstrate the ability to provide high-quality, cost-effective, and accessible treatment to a patient population with a high incidence of diabetes. They should also educate patients and healthcare providers on preventive measures and treatment methods for diabetic foot complications, analyze research on diabetic foot complications, and conduct additional research. The Secretary will develop criteria for the grant program and data collection in consultation with professional organizations. The criteria for the grant program include establishing a multi-center study on diabetic foot complications, creating evidence-based guidelines, and providing resources for effective patient treatment. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary to seek a grant under this section. The entity must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. The Secretary may not award a grant without yearly evaluations. An authoritative study on grant results must be conducted annually, with a report submitted to Congress. $25,000,000 is authorized for this section. Authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2005 through 2008."
