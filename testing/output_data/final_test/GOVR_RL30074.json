The Bureau of Labor Statistics was created in 1888 to provide information on labor-related subjects and was later transferred to the Department of Labor in 1913. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects and publishes statistics on labor conditions and product distribution. Two CPIs are published by the BLS: CPI-W and CPI-U. CPI-W represents 32% of the population based on specific criteria, while CPI-U includes all urban consumers to provide a broader representation of price level changes. The CPI-U and CPI-W are two price indexes published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI-U covers about 87% of the population and is more publicized. Between 1989 and 2009, the CPI-U increased by 73.0% compared to 71.0% for the CPI-W. Both indexes are used for inflation indexing by the federal government, with the advantage of the CPI being rarely revised. Since January 2007, the CPI and its component indexes are published rounded to three decimal places for precision in percentage change estimates. This change was made to maintain accuracy in published data, as prior to 2007, the CPI was rounded to only one decimal place, resulting in some loss of precision in percentage change figures. The effect of this change was expected to be minimal. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is based on retail market prices collected from various outlets in urban areas across the country. Prices for over 80,000 items are collected confidentially, with examples including white bread, men's shirts, and automobile tires. The \"all-items\" CPI is a composite index that measures the price change of a fixed basket of goods and services. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the price change of goods and services in a fixed market basket based on spending patterns from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The weights assigned to each item in the basket determine its impact on the overall CPI. The CPI market basket is updated every two years, with major expenditure categories included in the index. Based on the CPI-U data from December 2009, the relative importance of goods and services is determined by expenditure weights and price changes. Concerns may arise regarding the small weight of medical care costs in the index, especially for the elderly who spend more on healthcare. However, the CPI calculation only considers \"out-of-pocket\" medical expenses, not total outlays, as a growing portion of medical costs are covered by employers and government. The CPI calculation only considers \"out-of-pocket\" medical expenses, not total outlays, as a growing portion of medical costs are covered by employers and government. There is considerable variation among consumers in the demand for medical care, and different population groups tend to have different purchasing patterns. The CPI may overstate increases in the cost of living for some elderly individuals if medical care costs rise more rapidly than other goods and services. The experimental CPI for Americans aged 62 and older rose by an average of 2.9% per year between December 1989 and December 2009, slightly higher than the CPI-U and CPI-W. The CPI aims to measure changes in the price level accurately but may not reflect individual inflation experiences due to varying spending patterns. The CPI may overstate inflation rates due to fixed weights and quality improvements not immediately accounted for. BLS adjusts for quality changes in areas like automobiles and personal computers. Home ownership costs in the CPI have been treated differently since 1983 for CPI-U and 1985 for CPI-W. The CPI measures changes in the consumption aspect of housing costs through the concept of \"rental equivalence\" since 1983 for CPI-U and 1985 for CPI-W. BLS also publishes a core inflation rate that excludes food and energy prices to show the underlying trend rate of inflation, which is useful for policymakers. Inflation is a key variable, with the \"core\" rate often mentioned in press reports on CPI data releases. Food and energy prices are considered in calculating Social Security cost-of-living adjustments using the all-items CPI, not the core index. A 1996 report to the Senate Finance Committee suggested the CPI overstates inflation by 1.1% annually, but no legislative changes were made. The methodology for calculating the CPI has evolved over time and is likely to continue to do so. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) continues to explore methods for a more accurate measure of the cost of living. In July 2002, BLS introduced an alternative CPI called C-CPI-U, which uses chain-weights and updated expenditure weights. The C-CPI-U has not replaced CPI-U or CPI-W and is subject to revision. CPI is published for 26 metropolitan areas, but indexes are not updated monthly. These metropolitan area CPIs are for comparing inflation rates, not the actual cost of living between cities. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has set up an Internet home page for the CPI, where visitors can access the most recent CPI press release and detailed CPI data. Users can obtain CPI data by making selections from menus on the BLS website. An \"inflation calculator\" is also available for users to adjust dollar amounts. BLS has published CPI estimates dating back to 1800, making it the longest continuous price index series. The data in Table 3 show year-over-year changes in the CPI from 1800 to 1912, with data spliced from three separate studies. Before 1978, only one CPI was available, and after 1978, the data corresponds to the CPI-U. The accuracy of the CPI for early years is considered crude estimates. Between 1800 and 1945, there was no long-term price trend, but since 1945, prices have been steadily increasing with few declines. The CPI figures are averages of monthly data for each year. The CPI is an indicator of changes in the price level, expressed relative to the average level of prices in the years 1982, 1983, and 1984. The average of all monthly CPI numbers for those years is equal to 100. The percentage change in the CPI between any two years is calculated using a simple formula. For example, the total percentage change in the CPI-U between 1989 and 2009 was calculated as ((214.537 \u00f7 124.0) - 1) x 100. The total percentage change in the CPI-U between 1989 and 2009 was 73.0 percent. Calculating the average annual rate of change in the CPI-U between 1989 and 2009, the result was 2.8 percent. The CPI is also used to adjust dollar amounts for inflation, allowing for comparisons of purchasing power between different years. In 2009, $100 had the same purchasing power as $173.01 in 1989, calculated using the formula: equivalent purchasing power in period 2 = (CPI 2 \u00f7 CPI 1) x dollar amount in period 1. This calculation can be reversed to find the purchasing power in an earlier period. For example, the equivalent purchasing power in 1989 of $100 in 2009 is $57.80. These formulae allow for comparisons of dollar values with constant purchasing power. When comparing dollars of constant purchasing power, it is important to specify the base year. Constant dollar values can be compared using formulae based on CPI data, such as (CPI 2 \u00f7 CPI 1) x dollar amount in period 1. This allows for comparisons of dollar values in terms of purchasing power in a specific base year."
