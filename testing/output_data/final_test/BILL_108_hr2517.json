    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that the Internet has changed the nature of crimes, including intellectual property theft. Trafficking in copyrighted works through electronic means threatens jobs, income for creators, tax revenue, and honest purchasers. Popular peer-to-peer file trading software programs have been downloaded over 200 million times, with millions of users transferring billions of digital-media files each month. Many computer users are unaware of copyright laws on the Internet and the security risks posed by peer-to-peer systems. Users often share files unknowingly, exposing their personal computers and networks to potential threats. Millions of copies of popular peer-to-peer networks have software that can compromise users' computers and track online habits. Federal law enforcement should pursue copyright thieves and educate the public on security risks. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection also plays a role in cybersecurity. The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to act against copyright infringements, including those protected under international agreements. Merchandise can be seized or forfeited by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection for violations of copyright, trademark, or trade name protection. Registered copyrighted works can be recorded with the Bureau for import protection. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection can seize infringing copyrighted materials without them being registered with the United States Copyright Office. Registration is only required before taking legal action for infringement under title 17, United States Code. Foreign works do not need to be registered for copyright protection in the US. The rights under title 17, US Code, including distribution and importation control, depend on registration. Foreign copyright owners have direct access to US courts without registration. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection can enforce copyright importation prohibitions. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection's legal authority to seize infringing copyrighted materials, regardless of registration, needs clarification to align with copyright laws. SEC. 3. DETERRENCE AND COORDINATION. The Director of the FBI will develop a program to deter public copyright infringement by offering or making copies of copyrighted works without authorization. This program will also facilitate sharing information among law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, and copyright owners. Warnings will be issued to individuals engaged in such activities, indicating potential criminal prosecution. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION AND TRAINING OF AGENTS IN COMPUTER HACKING AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNITS. The Attorney General will assign agents to units investigating computer hacking and intellectual property crimes, ensuring they receive training in enforcement. The Internet Use Education Program will be established within the Office of the Associate Attorney General to educate the public on the value of copyrighted works, risks of obtaining unauthorized copies online, and ensure compliance with copyright laws in educational institutions and corporations. SEC. 6. CUSTOMS RECORDATION. Section 411(a) of title 17, United States Code is amended to exclude infringement actions by the Government or its agencies. Section 602(a) is amended to include infringing importation regardless of registration. Section 603(a) prohibits importation of protected works. The amendment excludes infringement actions by the Government or its agencies and includes infringing importation regardless of registration. It also prohibits importation of protected works. The Attorney General will establish criteria for copyright owners to use the FBI seal as a deterrent for infringement within 3 months of this Act's enactment."
