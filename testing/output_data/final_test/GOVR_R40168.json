    "content": "High levels of oil imports and high crude oil and gasoline prices in recent years have increased interest in the U.S. fuel supply. Congressional focus has been on alternatives to petroleum, improving transportation sector efficiency, and enhancing stability and security in the petroleum supply and refining sectors. Global oil prices and refinery constraints led to historic highs in U.S. gasoline pump prices from 2006 to 2008. Interest in alternative fuels and vehicles fluctuates with oil and gasoline price volatility. Statutory policies can help maintain interest during market fluctuations. Public interest in periods of mixed market signals as seen recently, with fluctuations in gasoline and petroleum prices from 2006 to 2012. Environmental concerns have also raised interest in alternatives to petroleum and more efficient use of fuel. Federal policies focus on promoting alternative fuels and efficient vehicles. This report provides an overview of current issues surrounding alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. Key tax incentives for biofuels, alternative fuel infrastructure, and certain electric vehicles expired in 2011, with some extensions granted until 2013. The mandate to use biofuels in transportation is set to increase yearly through 2022, despite the expiration of tax incentives. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels in transportation fuel, with a requirement of 2.0 billion gallons of advanced biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels. However, only a small amount of cellulosic fuel was actually registered. Covered entities must submit credits (RINs) equal to their obligations each year. Fraud in the biodiesel RINs market has led to criminal prosecutions. Recent volatility in the spot market for ethanol RINs has raised concerns. EPA granted a partial waiver petition to allow blends of up to 15% ethanol in gasoline (E15) in 2011. EPA approved a partial waiver petition from Growth Energy to allow blends of up to 15% ethanol in gasoline (E15), removing a component of the \"blend wall\" that limits ethanol blending. Concerns over potential damage to engines and infrastructure have led to challenges in federal court, with a major case dismissed due to lack of standing by the plaintiffs. The 102nd Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, requiring the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles by federal agencies, state governments, and fuel providers. This law aims to move the US away from petroleum fuels towards alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles by federal agencies, state governments, and fuel providers. Congress later worked on comprehensive energy legislation in response to high fuel prices and other energy concerns, including tax credits for electric, alternative fuel, and hybrid vehicles. The 108th Congress debated vehicle tax credits, amendments to vehicle purchase requirements, renewable fuel mandates, and tax credits for ethanol. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 addressed various energy topics, including renewable fuel mandates and tax credits. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 further expanded renewable fuel mandates and tightened fuel economy standards to increase energy security. Biofuels are considered a key strategy for enhancing energy security. The 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills included titles to promote biofuels and other farm-based energy supplies, with the 2008 Farm Bill expanding existing biofuels tax credits to promote cellulosic fuels. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes provisions supporting alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles through 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further extended these incentives through 2013, including retroactive extensions for some expired credits. The law extended various tax credits for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including production tax credits, refinery depreciation, cellulosic biofuels, algae-based biofuels, biomass-based diesel fuels, alternative fuels like natural gas and propane, electric vehicles, and alternative fuel infrastructure. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) for conventional ethanol was not extended. Other laws impacting these vehicles include the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Air Act (P.L. 101-549) and highway authorization bills (P.L. 109-59 and P.L. 105-178) promote low emission vehicles and tax incentives for alternative fuels. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) extended tax incentives for biodiesel and alternative fuels. Recent events have increased interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicles due to concerns over fuel conservation and energy security. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) requires an increase in fuel economy for passenger cars and light trucks to 35 mpg combined by 2020. Policy questions arise regarding tax incentives for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, government involvement in vehicle and fuel markets, production costs and environmental impacts of ethanol and hydrogen fuels, and research and development. Gasoline prices have spiked and faced disruptions due to various factors, raising congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum. Congressional focus remains strong on research and development funds for high-risk technologies like fuel cells or near-term technologies such as hybrids. Congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum remains strong, with key tax incentives for alternative fuels including ethanol, biodiesel, and cellulosic biofuels. Most of these incentives were extended through 2013, except for the conventional ethanol tax credit. The main conventional ethanol tax credit was not extended, but there is ongoing interest in tax incentives for alternative fuels. Supporters argue that economic incentives are necessary due to the market favoring conventional fuels and the widespread use of them in automobiles. Opponents believe that federal programs like biofuel mandates and fuel economy standards make tax incentives unnecessary. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established federal requirements for renewable fuels. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the mandate for renewable fuels, requiring 36 billion gallons by 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules for the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard in 2010, mandating 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuels. The mandate for 2013 is 16.55 billion gallons, with controversy surrounding EPA's conclusions on the greenhouse gas impacts of biofuels. The EPA modified its methodology for fuel pathways in the final rule of the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard. The requirement for cellulosic biofuels to meet a growing portion of the RFS starting in 2010 was set at 6.5 million gallons due to low U.S. production capacity. The EPA set the cellulosic biofuel standard at 6.5 million gallons for 2010, lower than the initial proposal of 100 million gallons due to project delays and scaling back. Commercial volumes are expected in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2011, EPA established a cellulosic mandate of 6.6 million gallons. The EPA established lower cellulosic biofuel mandates for 2011 and 2012, which were challenged in court. The 2013 mandate is set at 14 million gallons, with expectations of increased production capacity. Ethanol concentration in gasoline was historically limited to 10% due to regulatory and technical factors. The EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Act includes regulations on fuel additives, vehicle warranties, infrastructure design, and state/local codes. The current limit for ethanol blending in U.S. gasoline is around 14-15 billion gallons, but the RFS mandates will soon exceed this \"blend wall.\" Gasoline suppliers may need to blend ethanol above 10% or explore other options like using E85 or biodiesel to meet RFS requirements. Stakeholders are advocating for higher ethanol blends like E15. Stakeholders are advocating for EPA to allow higher-level ethanol blends like E15, E20, or higher. Growth Energy applied for a waiver to increase the maximum ethanol concentration to 15% (E15) in 2009. EPA approved E15 for MY2007 and newer vehicles in 2010, expanding it to include MY2001 and later vehicles in 2011. However, a waiver for older vehicles, motorcycles, heavy trucks, and non-road engines was denied due to insufficient data on emissions performance. The EPA is considering the effects of increased ethanol content on emissions from various vehicles and engines. Automakers and small engine manufacturers limit ethanol levels due to concerns over equipment damage. Challenges have been made regarding the use of E15 in newer vehicles, with potential corrosion issues in older vehicles and equipment. The EPA waiver for higher ethanol concentrations may lead to corrosion of seals and components, fuel tanks, and higher emissions of pollutants. Fueling infrastructure implications include the need to update warranties/certifications for systems designed for E10. EPA proposed new pump labeling rules to indicate which pumps dispense E15. The EPA finalized rules for labeling gasoline pumps dispensing E15 in 2011. There are concerns about fuel suppliers selling E15 if customers don't use it. Ethanol, mainly produced from corn, is a resource-intensive crop. Biofuels from cellulosic materials like trees and grasses are seen as a more sustainable alternative. The U.S. biofuels industry is expected to expand using abundant feedstocks like cellulose, which requires complex processing. Cellulose must be broken down into sugars or starches before fermentation, making it currently expensive compared to other fuel options. Research is focused on reducing processing costs and addressing environmental concerns. Research and development efforts are focused on increasing the yield of potential biofuel crops, developing harvesting techniques, and limiting the environmental impact of dedicated energy crops. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions to promote the development of cellulosic biofuels, with incentives for domestic production and a mandate for gasoline to contain a minimum amount of cellulosic ethanol annually starting in 2013. President Bush signed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which established a 50% depreciation allowance for biofuel development. The tax law (P.L. 109-432) established a 50% depreciation allowance for cellulosic ethanol plants before January 1, 2013. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel mandate, requiring 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2022. The 2008 Farm Bill provided a tax credit of up to $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic biofuels production. The Renewable Fuel Standard is a market-based compliance system for obligated parties. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a market-based compliance system where obligated parties must submit Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to cover their obligations. RINs are commodities that represent each gallon of renewable fuel, with a 38-digit number indicating various data. Concerns have arisen regarding RIN generation and market integrity due to errors, fraud opportunities, and issues like transposed digits and double-counting. EPA established the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) to address concerns of errors and fraud in RIN transactions. Obligated parties are responsible for verifying RIN validity, with recent cases of RIN fraud leading to criminal convictions. EPA is considering further measures to prevent RIN fraud. EPA is considering establishing a system for third-party certification of RINs to prevent fraud. Obligated parties may receive an \"affirmative defense\" if fraudulent RINs are used, but invalid RINs must be replaced. Rules are expected to be finalized in July 2013, with auditors allowed to \"pre-register.\" Ethanol RIN prices surged in the first quarter of 2013. Ethanol RIN prices surged in the first quarter of 2013, with prices increasing ten-fold to $0.90 per gallon in March before dropping to $0.60-$0.70 per gallon. The spike may be attributed to concerns over the blend wall, reduced output from U.S. ethanol producers, and speculation on RIN scarcity. Stakeholders, including corn growers and ethanol producers, support the renewable fuel standard despite concerns over ethanol imports. EPA is considering third-party certification of RINs to prevent fraud. Concerns have arisen over ethanol imports due to lower production costs and government incentives in other countries, leading to significantly lower ethanol prices compared to the United States. The added duty on imports, which effectively nullified the U.S. tax incentive, has expired, making it unlikely for either policy to be reinstated. Duty-free status was previously granted to ethanol imports from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries under certain conditions. The Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries were granted duty-free status for ethanol imports, even if produced in a non-CBI country. Ethanol was dehydrated in a CBI country and shipped to the U.S., reaching up to 5% of the market. Stakeholders criticized this method, and with high U.S. gasoline prices, there may be more interest in importing ethanol. Increased ethanol imports from Brazil may grow due to the renewable fuel standard requiring more advanced biofuels. The duty on imported ethanol was extended through various acts but has since expired. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated alternative fuel vehicle purchases for federal and state fleets. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that 75% of federal and state vehicle fleets must be capable of operating on alternative fuels, while 90% of vehicles purchased by alternative fuel providers must be alternative fuel vehicles. However, the effectiveness of this mandate has been criticized as vehicles purchased are primarily dual-fuel and run on gasoline due to its availability and lower cost compared to alternative fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that federal and state vehicle fleets must use alternative fuels. Despite the mandate, many agencies failed to meet their obligations, leading to a lawsuit in 2002. The court ruled that agencies must comply with EPAct, and most have since met the requirement. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified the requirements for EPAct compliance, requiring dual-fuel vehicles to operate on alternative fuels unless granted a waiver. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended EPAct requirements, allowing waivers for vehicle purchase if fuel-saving measures are certified. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 expanded the definition of \"alternative fuel vehicle\" to include hybrid, advanced diesel, and fuel cell vehicles for EPAct credits. EPAct 1992 grants DOE authority to extend requirements to local government and private fleets, but as of 2002, no determination was made. Court ordered DOE to establish timeline for new rulemaking, which determined program would not promote EPAct goals. $300 million appropriated in 2009 for GSA to purchase vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 granted the Department of Energy authority to extend requirements to local government and private fleets. In 2009, $300 million was appropriated to the General Services Administration for the purchase of vehicles with high fuel economy, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and pure electric vehicles. Executive Orders signed by Presidents Bush and Obama mandated federal agencies to use plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and set government-wide fuel savings goals. Tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles are supported by some as more effective than purchase mandates. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded vehicle purchase incentives for fuel cell, hybrid, alternative fuel, and advanced diesel vehicles, offering tax credits up to $3,400 for hybrids and advanced diesels, and up to $4,000 for alternative fuel vehicles. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established a tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in vehicles, including pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified plug-in vehicle credits, with a maximum credit of $7,500 based on battery capacity. The law also established credits for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and low-speed four-wheeled plug-in vehicles, as well as vehicle conversions to run on battery power. Purchasers can claim these credits even if subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Eligibility for the tax credit phases out after a manufacturer produces 200,000 eligible vehicles. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are synthetic fuels produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease. They can be blended with conventional diesel and used in engines with minimal modifications. Interest in biodiesel is growing due to its ability to displace conventional diesel, promote rural economies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, production costs are currently high. Biodiesel production is expensive, with costs up to two times more than conventional diesel. Tax incentives and new technologies are being explored to reduce costs, but organic oils used as raw materials remain a significant expense. The American Jobs Creation Act provides a tax credit of up to $1.00 per gallon for biodiesel sales. The American Jobs Creation Act provides tax credits for biodiesel sales, including a credit of $1.00 per gallon for biodiesel blends. These credits were extended through various acts until 2011. The tax credits for hydrogen fuel and fuel cells were extended through various acts until the end of 2013. Interest in hydrogen fuel has grown due to its potential to reduce energy imports and vehicle emissions. However, production costs are high and fuel-cycle emissions remain a concern. The Bush Administration strongly supported research and development for hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles. The FreedomCAR initiative promoted R&D between American auto manufacturers and the federal government. President Bush announced the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative in 2003, increasing federal spending on hydrogen fuel and fuel cell R&D. Congress appropriated $1.4 billion for the initiatives between FY2004 and FY2008. Opponents of the hydrogen fuel and fuel cell initiatives argued that they may never be commercialized and draw funding away from near-term technologies like hybrid vehicles. Some suggest that research alone will not reduce petroleum dependence, advocating for tighter fuel economy standards for all vehicles. Congress did tighten fuel economy standards in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Hybrid vehicles, combining gasoline/diesel engines with electric motors, have gained popularity in the US and could help improve overall efficiency. Hybrid vehicles have gained popularity in the US and could help improve overall efficiency without significant changes to existing infrastructure. Some states provide exemptions for drivers of hybrid vehicles from high occupancy vehicle lane requirements. Legislation such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 expanded incentives for the purchase of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 expanded incentives for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the US. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program provides federal loans for the production of highly fuel efficient vehicles, with critics questioning its effectiveness in promoting technologies already incentivized by stricter fuel economy standards. The Government Accountability Office has questioned DOE's technical expertise in assessing loan applications and evaluating project performance. Various organizations in Washington, DC provide information on alternative fuel vehicles, including fuel cells, hydrogen energy, methanol, and biodiesel. Various organizations in Washington, DC provide information on alternative fuel vehicles, including biodiesel, natural gas vehicles, propane autogas, ethanol, and hydrogen fuel cells. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reports limited progress in acquiring alternative fuel vehicles and reaching fuel goals as per the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Additionally, the Advanced Technology Vehicle Loan Program implementation is underway, but requires enhanced technical oversight and performance measures."
