Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) must be located in medically underserved communities, provide services to all residents regardless of ability to pay, and offer affordable care to low-income families. They are also required to offer comprehensive primary health care services. FQHCs provide comprehensive primary and preventive care to millions of people, including those without health insurance. They are governed by a board of directors with a majority of active patients to ensure responsiveness to community needs. FQHCs employ around 100,000 people nationwide but face financial challenges that threaten their ability to serve medically underserved populations. Health insurance costs have risen over 30 percent in the small employer market, leading FQHCs to use additional Federal funding to provide coverage. The Federal Government negotiates premiums for Federal employees, resulting in lower premium increases compared to large employers. FQHCs receive Federal grants to help cover the cost of providing affordable healthcare for all. Last year, almost 1,400,000 Americans joined the ranks of the uninsured, bringing the nation's total to more than 45,000,000 people without health insurance. The uninsured are in significantly worse health than those with health insurance, receive fewer preventive services, are less likely to receive regular care for chronic diseases, and are more likely to be hospitalized for a condition. Adding FQHC employees to the FEHBP coverage list would help control health insurance costs, reduce employee insurance expenses, and allow centers to allocate funds for community care. Adding health center employees to the FEHBP coverage list would control costs, reduce employee expenses, and allocate funds for community care. Adding health center employees to the FEHBP coverage list would control costs, reduce employee expenses, and allocate funds for community care. Definitions in the United States Code are amended to include employees of federally qualified health centers and grantees receiving funds under the Public Health Service Act. Employees of federally qualified health centers and grantees receiving funds under the Public Health Service Act must contribute to the Employees Health Benefits Fund, covering their health benefits plan and administrative expenses. The Office can use up to 2 percent of the total amount for administrative expenses."
