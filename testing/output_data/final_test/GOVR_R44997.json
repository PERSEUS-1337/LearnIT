    "content": "The Appointments Clause of the Constitution requires high-level officers to be appointed by the President with Senate approval. Vacancies in these positions can occur during transitions, leading to temporary appointments by individuals not officially appointed. The Vacancies Act allows certain employees to temporarily serve in vacant advice and consent positions, with limitations on their authority and duration. It outlines who can serve as an acting officer and when the Act applies, exempting some offices. The Vacancies Act outlines the limitations on acting officers and the exclusive means for temporarily authorizing them to perform the functions of vacant advice and consent positions in the executive branch. It specifies that the Act applies when an officer in such a position dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties. The Vacancies Act specifies that a \"function or duty\" must be performed by the officer in question for a vacant advice and consent position. Section 3348 allows the agency head, a person complying with the Vacancies Act, or a person complying with another statute to perform the duties of the vacant office. The Vacancies Act states that actions taken by noncompliant individuals in a vacant office are considered void ab initio, meaning null from the beginning. Unlike voidable actions, void actions cannot be ratified or cured, making their consequences more severe. The Vacancies Act prohibits ratification of acts taken by individuals in a vacant office, making them void and unable to be validated. The Act is enforced through court challenges when agency actions are undertaken by an officer in violation of the statute. It applies to advice and consent positions in executive agencies as defined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. The Vacancies Act excludes certain offices from its provisions, such as officers of the Government Accountability Office and members of specific boards or commissions. Some offices are exempt from certain requirements of the Act. The Vacancies Act excludes specific offices from its provisions, including certain high-ranking officials like the General Counsels and Inspectors General. This exemption aims to maintain the independence of these positions. The Vacancies Act excludes high-ranking officials like General Counsels and Inspectors General to maintain their independence. Section 3348 prohibits officials in these positions from performing nondelegable duties to preserve their independence. Consequences of violating the Vacancies Act in these exempt positions are unclear, potentially rendering noncompliant actions voidable. The Supreme Court's ruling in NLRB v. SW General, Inc. found that the service of the Acting General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board violated the Vacancies Act, but actions taken in violation of the Act may not necessarily be invalidated. The D.C. Circuit clarified that the appropriate remedy for such violations is not fully explored, assuming that the actions of an improperly serving Acting General Counsel are voidable, not void. The D.C. Circuit rejected legal doctrines that could have upheld the NLRB's actions, as they assumed the Acting General Counsel's actions were voidable, not void. The Vacancies Act allows for other statutes to supplement or supersede its provisions under limited circumstances. The Vacancies Act allows for other statutes to supplement or supersede its provisions under limited circumstances, but a statute must \"expressly\" authorize \"acting\" service to do so. Multiple statutes may govern acting service in a given office, allowing a person to lawfully serve as an acting officer under either statute. The Vacancies Act also makes exemptions for holdover provisions in other statutes. The Vacancies Act allows for exemptions for holdover provisions in other statutes, stating that it does not affect any statute authorizing a person to continue serving in an office after their term expires. It limits an officer or employee's ability to perform the functions and duties of a vacant advice and consent office, which must be established by statute or regulation and required to be performed by that specific officer. The Act applies only to functions or duties exclusively assigned to a specific officer. The Vacancies Act limits an officer or employee's ability to perform the functions and duties of a vacant advice and consent office, which must be established by statute or regulation and required to be performed by that specific officer. The Act applies only to functions or duties exclusively assigned to a specific officer, while allowing delegation of tasks that are not nondelegable. There is limited case law clarifying what functions and duties fall under the Vacancies Act. The Vacancies Act limits the ability of an officer or employee to perform the functions and duties of a vacant advice and consent office, which must be established by statute or regulation. Only certain officers or employees can perform these duties, and if not in compliance with the Act, only the agency head can perform nondelegable duties. The Vacancies Act limits acting service by specifying who can serve as an acting officer and for how long. Section 3345 allows three classes of officials or employees to temporarily fill a vacant advice and consent office. The \"first assistant\" typically becomes the acting officer, but the term is not always clearly defined. The President can also direct two other classes to serve. The President can direct two other classes of people to serve as acting officers of an agency instead of the \"first assistant.\" This includes individuals serving in different advice and consent positions or senior officers/employees of the same executive agency meeting specific criteria. There are limitations on these appointments, especially if the President nominates someone for the vacant position. The President can appoint individuals to serve as acting officers in an agency instead of the \"first assistant\" under certain circumstances. This can lead to shifts in government employees within the executive branch, as seen with the example of Noel Francisco being named Acting Solicitor General before being nominated for the position permanently. This process may require reassigning individuals to different roles within the department. Noel Francisco became the acting Solicitor General before being confirmed to the position by the Senate on September 19, 2017. The Vacancies Act allows for exceptions where a person nominated for an office can serve as an acting officer if they are in a \"first assistant\" position and meet certain criteria. However, this exception did not apply to Francisco as he had not served in the position for 90 days or been appointed through the advice and consent process. The Vacancies Act limits the time a vacant advice and consent position can be filled by an acting officer to 210 days. This period starts when the vacancy occurs and can be extended if a nomination is pending in the Senate. The time limitation is tied to the vacancy, not the person serving in the office. The Vacancies Act limits the time a vacant advice and consent position can be filled by an acting officer to 210 days, which can be extended during a presidential transition period. If an acting officer attempts to perform duties after the 210-day period without a nomination, it will have no effect. Alternatively, an acting officer can serve while a nomination is pending in the Senate. The Vacancies Act allows an acting officer to serve for 210 days, which can be extended during a presidential transition. If a nomination is pending in the Senate, the acting officer can continue to serve even after the initial 210-day period. If the nomination is rejected, withdrawn, or returned, the acting officer can serve for another 210-day period. If a second nomination is made and also rejected, the acting officer can serve for one final 210-day period. However, the Vacancies Act does not allow acting service beyond this final period. The Vacancies Act allows an acting officer to serve for 210 days, which can be extended during a presidential transition. If a nomination is pending in the Senate, the acting officer can continue to serve even after the initial 210-day period. However, the Vacancies Act does not allow acting service beyond this final period. The Vacancies Act provides the exclusive means to authorize an acting official to perform the functions and duties of a vacant office, unless another statute expressly designates an officer or employee to temporarily act in an acting capacity. The Vacancies Act allows an acting officer to serve for 210 days, extendable during a presidential transition. If a nomination is pending, the acting officer can continue beyond 210 days. Agency-specific statutes may designate an acting officer, making the Vacancies Act non-exclusive but still applicable. The Vacancies Act and agency-specific statutes may both be used to temporarily fill a vacancy. If two statutes authorize acting service, conflicts may arise. The Vacancies Act outlines rules for acting officers and limits their duration. The Vacancies Act and agency-specific statutes may conflict when designating acting officers, with the former setting time limits while the latter often does not. Courts aim to harmonize statutes when possible, assuming they can coexist unless Congress expresses otherwise. Courts have sometimes resolved conflicts between the Vacancies Act and agency-specific statutes by holding that whichever statute is invoked is controlling. However, this approach may conflict with the general rule that more specific statutes should prevail over more general ones. For example, in Hooks ex rel. NLRB v. Kitsap Tenant Support Services, a court rejected the argument that an agency-specific statute displaced the Vacancies Act as the exclusive means to temporarily fill a vacant position. The President can designate an acting General Counsel if the office is vacant, choosing between the Vacancies Act and agency-specific statutes. The court ruled that the appointment is valid even if it doesn't comply with the agency-specific statute. However, conflicts may arise when both statutes authorize the President to select an acting officer. The federal courts recently considered a dispute over who could serve as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) when the position became vacant in late 2017. The President designated Mick Mulvaney under the Vacancies Act, but the Deputy Director, Leandra English, argued she was the lawful Acting Director under an agency-specific statute. English claimed the agency-specific statute should take precedence over the Vacancies Act. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the President could appoint Mick Mulvaney as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Vacancies Act, despite Deputy Director Leandra English's argument that she should hold the position based on an agency-specific statute. The court determined that both statutes could be used, with the Vacancies Act overriding the default rule in the agency-specific statute. The court required an \"express statement\" to displace the Vacancies Act entirely, as the agency-specific statute was silent on the President's appointment authority. Courts are grappling with reconciling statutory provisions like the Vacancies Act and agency-specific statutes, which can lead to difficult questions. Congressional clarification on how these statutes interact can help resolve any inconsistencies. For example, the statute governing vacancies in the office of Attorney General clarifies the relationship between the Deputy Attorney General and the Vacancies Act. The Vacancies Act allows agencies to delegate duties of vacant advice and consent positions to any employee, as long as the duties are not nondelegable. This flexibility was highlighted in a 2008 case involving the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel. The GAO concluded that the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General did not violate the Vacancies Act by performing the duties of the absent Assistant Attorney General for the OLC. Courts have upheld the ability of government officials to perform delegated duties of a vacant office as long as the delegation is lawful. The Vacancies Act allows delegation of duties unless expressly prohibited by statute, limiting the class of officers to whom duties can be delegated. The Act aims to prevent the Executive from appointing officers without Senate consent. Section 3347 of the Vacancies Act states that it is the exclusive means to authorize temporary performance of duties for a vacant advice and consent office. A general delegation statute could allow an agency head to delegate responsibilities of a vacant office to another officer or employee, potentially conflicting with the goals of the Vacancies Act. Congress could pass a statute specifying functions and duties of an acting officer in an advice and consent position, limiting delegation by other officers when the position is vacant. Statutory limitations could restrict officers' authority to delegate, with enforcement through political processes and litigation under the Vacancies Act. The Vacancies Act provisions are enforced politically rather than through the courts. It lacks a clear mechanism to remove noncompliant acting officers and relies on the Comptroller General to report violations to Congress. This reporting may lead to congressional action pressuring the executive branch. The Vacancies Act is enforced politically, with Congress pressuring the executive branch to comply. In a recent example, the House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security held a hearing on a violation of the Vacancies Act by the Acting Commissioner of Social Security. This led to the Acting Commissioner stepping down from their position. Private suits can also be used to nullify noncompliant agency actions under the Vacancies Act. The Vacancies Act is enforced politically, with Congress pressuring the executive branch to comply. Private suits can also be used to nullify noncompliant agency actions under the Vacancies Act. A determination that an action is void means that legally, it is as if the action had never been taken. Violations of the Vacancies Act are generally enforced only if a third party successfully challenges the action as void in court. Relief for a regulated entity in such cases is not always clear, and there is little case law interpreting the consequences of violating the Vacancies Act. The Vacancies Act is enforced politically, with Congress pressuring the executive branch to comply. Private suits can nullify noncompliant agency actions under the Vacancies Act. Courts may look to the APA for consequences of actions deemed void. The Supreme Court has not officially recognized the similarity between the Vacancies Act and the APA standards. In NLRB v. SW General, Inc., the question of remedy for officials exempt from Section 3348 remains open. The Vacancies Act allows for certain officials to be exempt from its provisions, leaving unclear consequences for noncompliant actions. In NLRB v. SW General, it was determined that actions of a noncompliant Acting General Counsel could be voidable, potentially impacting court challenges. The Vacancies Act's potential to wholly insulate certain offices remains open for interpretation. The D.C. Circuit left open the possibility that the Vacancies Act could protect the actions of Acting General Counsel, even if they violate the Act. Congress may need to clarify the consequences of violating the Vacancies Act, especially for exempt offices. The D.C. Circuit suggested that Congress may need to clarify consequences for violating the Vacancies Act, possibly through altering reporting requirements or adding additional consequences."
