    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the United States has been involved militarily in Afghanistan since 2001 under a congressional authorization for the use of military force following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Osama Bin Laden, the head of Al-Qaeda responsible for the attacks, was killed in 2011. The US military and its partners have captured or killed tens of thousands since then. Since 2001, coalition partners have killed or captured tens of thousands of Al Qaeda, Taliban, and other insurgents in Afghanistan. The United States ended 13 years of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014, marking the longest war in American history. Over 2,200 US service members have been killed and more than 20,000 wounded in Afghanistan since 2001. Additionally, $800 billion of US taxpayers' money has been spent on the conflict. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has documented billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse of American taxpayers' money in Afghanistan. Examples include importing rare blond Italian goats to boost the cashmere industry, costing $6 million. An ongoing investigation by SIGAR revealed that American taxpayers are funding up to 200,000 fictitious Afghan soldiers, potentially costing hundreds of millions annually. In 2012, Afghan President Karzai and US President Obama signed a partnership agreement for US support in Afghanistan for 10 years, which was approved by the Afghan Parliament but not by the US Congress. The US still maintains a military presence in Afghanistan. The United States has 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, spending $43 billion annually on training Afghan military and police forces, reconstruction, and foreign aid programs. General Charles Krulak believes solving Afghanistan's problems would take decades and drain precious resources, including American lives. In a January 2017 article, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai stated that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan has not brought security but has instead fueled extremism. There has been no full debate in Congress on continuing U.S. engagement in Afghanistan. Prohibition on funds for activities in Afghanistan. No funds may be used for activities in Afghanistan one year after the enactment of this Act, except for operations of the US Embassy and intelligence gathering. The prohibition can be waived if the President certifies to Congress that funding is in the national interest and Congress enacts a joint resolution within 30 days. Expedited procedures for joint resolutions in the Senate and House of Representatives are outlined in subsection (d), with references to specific committees and requirements for application. Expedited procedures for joint resolutions in the Senate and House of Representatives are outlined in subsection (d), with references to specific committees and requirements for application. The procedures can be applied and administered by substituting \"not less than eight hours but not more than ten hours\" for \"not more than ten hours\"."
