    "content": "The Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives (CAO) is an elected officer overseeing various support functions for the House, including human resources, financial services, technology, procurement, and facilities management. The position was created in the 104th Congress to consolidate administrative functions previously handled by different offices. In the 102nd Congress, Representative Richard Gephardt introduced H.Res. 423, creating the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services position in the House. The Director was responsible for daily nonlegislative and financial operations, appointed jointly by the Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader, requiring extensive management and financial experience. The House passed H.Res. 423, creating the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services position with oversight over various administrative and financial functions. In January 1993, the House incorporated the rule governing the Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services into Rule VI for the 103rd Congress. Lt. Gen. Leonard P. Wishart, III (ret.) was the first Director appointed in October 1992. In the 104th Congress, the House abolished the Director position and created the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to provide infrastructure and support for House operations, including managing employee payroll, benefits, and other services. The Committee on House Administration oversees the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) position, which manages various services for House operations. Representative Ben Cardin advocated for appointing, rather than electing, the CAO to maintain bipartisanship. The creation of the CAO position was discussed during the 104th Congress to reduce partisanship in House administration. The Director of Financial and Non-Legislative Services was replaced by a partisan Chief Administrative Officer, elected by House members at the start of a new Congress. The majority party typically introduces a resolution to elect officers, including the CAO, with the minority party offering their own slate of candidates through an amendment. This change marks a shift from previous bipartisan efforts in House administration. In two instances, the Speaker appointed an interim Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) following resignations. In the 105th Congress, Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed Jeff Trandahl, and in 2010, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Daniel J. Strodel. The interim CAO serves until a replacement is elected and oversees non-legislative functions of the House of Representatives. The CAO office divisions are organized along operational and mission lines, including the immediate office of the CAO, operations, and customer solutions. The immediate office oversees operations and customer solutions, manages House media galleries, assists with press coverage, distributes press releases, issues reports, and maintains a public website. Operations is responsible for developing and maintaining facilities and systems used by the House. The Operations division of the CAO office is responsible for developing and maintaining facilities and systems used by the House of Representatives. It is divided into four groups: Administration and Financial Services, Workforce Services, House Information Resources, and Immediate Operations Office. Each group handles specific areas such as procurement, financial management, technology support, and business continuity. The Operations division of the CAO office manages projects related to business continuity, disaster recovery, portfolio management, and committee hearing rooms renovation. It also oversees improvements in payroll and benefit services, financial and purchasing systems, HouseNet, and the House messaging system. Customer Solutions facilitates the daily work of congressional staff through the CAO Customer Solutions Center, divided into three groups: Customer Solutions Delivery, Assets, Furnishings and Logistics, and Immediate Customer. The Customer Solutions Office manages resources, supplies, office renovations, and office relocations for members of the House. They also organize equipment fairs and service fairs to showcase new technology and support offices. In 2007, a 'Green the Capitol' initiative was launched to update House practices. The \"Green the Capitol\" initiative, started in 2007, aims to reduce the House's carbon footprint through various programs like my green office, using low VOC carpets, renewable electricity, green cleaning products, and locally sourced food. Seven individuals have served as Directors or CAOs of the House since the office was created in the 102nd Congress."
