The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission will conduct a study on mental disease institutions under Medicaid, including the number and types of facilities in each state. The study will include information on the facility types, coverage limitations, services provided, assessment process, discharge process, and any federal waivers for mental disease institutions under Medicaid in each state. The study will provide details on federal waivers and Medicaid funding sources used by states for mental disease institutions, as well as state requirements and standards for these institutions to receive payment under the state plan or waiver. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission will provide recommendations for improving care and standards in State Medicaid programs, including data collection improvements by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Stakeholder input will be sought from State Medicaid directors, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Medicaid beneficiary advocates, and others.
