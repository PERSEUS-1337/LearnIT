The panel of arbitrators, consisting of 5 members, is appointed by the Secretary - 1 designated by each party and 3 neutral arbitrators.

If the Secretary determines that part of the selection is invalid, the parties can agree to set aside only the invalid part. The Secretary will then order the parties to give effect to the valid part and remand the invalid part for further action. Judicial review of the Secretary's final order is available upon request by either party. Upon issuance of an order to resolve a labor dispute, no changes can be made by either party to the rates of pay, rules, or working conditions until the Secretary's final order becomes effective. Any unilateral changes before this are subject to injunction by a court upon request of the other party. The term \"rates of pay\" in labor disputes includes wages, vacation, holidays, insurance, pension plans, profit-sharing, medical benefits, job stability, and other benefits."
