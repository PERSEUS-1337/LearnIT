    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 42008.8 of the Vehicle Code is amended to establish a one-time infraction amnesty program to provide relief to individuals with unpaid traffic bail or fines, address driving privilege suspensions, increase revenue by encouraging payment of old fines, and allow courts to focus on more recent cases. A one-time amnesty program for unpaid fines and bail will be established in each county, with government entities responsible for implementation. The term \"fine\" or \"bail\" includes the total amounts due for a specific violation, such as base fine or bail set by court order or statute. The text discusses various penalties and assessments that may be imposed, including base fines, penalty assessments, state surcharges, court operations assessments, and criminal conviction assessments. Additionally, it mentions that civil assessments imposed under a specific code section will not be collected during an upcoming amnesty program. The court must issue a certificate within 90 days for participants of the one-time amnesty program who have satisfied their fines for specific violations. Applications submitted before January 1, 2017, must have certificates issued by March 31, 2017. Payment plans for applications submitted by March 31, 2017, will remain in effect after that date. The court must issue a certificate within 90 days for participants of the one-time amnesty program who have satisfied their fines for specific violations. Certificates for applications submitted before January 1, 2017, must be issued by March 31, 2017. Payment plans for applications submitted by March 31, 2017, will remain valid after that date. Any person eligible for a driver's license under specific sections is eligible for the amnesty program for certain violations. The Department of Motor Vehicles cannot deny reinstating driving privileges for participants in the amnesty program for fines related to the specific violation. The court and county may extend the one-time amnesty program to fines and bail for misdemeanor violations, excluding parking violations and specific Penal Code sections. Violations eligible for amnesty must meet certain criteria, including being an infraction violation or related to specific code sections. The amnesty program accepts 50% of eligible fines or bail amounts in full satisfaction, provided certain criteria are met, including no outstanding warrants, victim restitution owed, or payments made after September 30, 2015. Requests must be filed with the court by March 31, 2017. The amnesty program accepts 20 percent of eligible fines or bail amounts in full satisfaction if the participant certifies receiving specific public benefits or meets certain conditions. Guidelines for the program must be adopted by the Judicial Council by October 1, 2015, in consultation with the California State Association of Counties. The court or county implementing the amnesty program can recover costs and charge a $50 fee. A payment plan option is available based on the participant's ability to pay monthly. Relevant information is collected for debt collection by the Franchise Tax Board if a participant defaults on payments. If a participant in the amnesty program fails to comply with the payment plan terms, the agency will send a notice giving them 30 days to resume payments or request a change. Failure to respond may result in referral to the Franchise Tax Board for collection, including administrative costs. The Board will collect any delinquent amounts owed according to established protocols. Additional collection efforts may be utilized as well. The agency may use additional collection efforts as outlined in the Penal Code if a participant fails to comply with the payment plan terms. The Judicial Council will reimburse costs up to $250,000 for outreach related to the amnesty program, including providing information on a website and with motor vehicle registration renewal notices. Personnel costs for the program will also be covered. The Judicial Council may develop mechanisms for reinstating driving privileges for those eligible for amnesty. Criminal actions cannot be taken for delinquent fines paid under the program. The funds collected under the amnesty program are deposited in the county treasury. After a specified amount is accepted, the remaining revenues are distributed pro rata. Funds collected under this section are distributed differently, with the first $250,000 transferred to the Judicial Council. Following the transfer of funds, 82.20% goes to the Peace Officers\u2019 Training Fund and 17.80% goes to the Corrections Training Fund each month. Each court or county with an amnesty program must submit a report to the Judicial Council by May 31, 2017, detailing cases resolved, money collected, and program costs. The Judicial Council will then report to the Legislature by August 31, 2017."
