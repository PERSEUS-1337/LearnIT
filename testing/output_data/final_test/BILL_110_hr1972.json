    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Environmental Equity Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Congress recognizes that urban, low-income, and minority communities are disproportionately burdened with polluting facilities, leading to health issues like asthma. Addressing contaminated surroundings in these communities is a national priority. Asthma is a prevalent chronic health condition in the United States, affecting over 15 million people, including 6.5 million children. Communities at risk require resources to plan preventive health strategies against air pollution and biological contaminants. Community-based organizations and health centers can develop neighborhood health profiles to aid policymakers in assessing the health impact of future growth. Federal resources can help protect communities from disproportionate exposure to contaminants causing respiratory health issues like asthma. The Act aims to prevent disproportionate exposure to hazardous materials, protect individuals and communities, empower community-based organizations to measure environmental impacts, and prevent discriminatory exposure to harmful substances. SEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION REGARDING EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include TITLE XXX--DISCRIMINATION REGARDING EXPOSURE TO COVERED SUBSTANCES. SEC. 3001 defines key terms. The term 'covered entity' refers to any entity that handles, manages, treats, releases, disposes of, stores, transports, removes, moves, or delivers covered substances. A 'covered substance' includes contaminants identified under the Safe Drinking Water Act, substances described in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and chemicals listed as human carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program. The curr_chunk lists various types of substances regulated under different acts, including those identified as human carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program. The curr_chunk lists substances regulated under different acts, including air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and other contaminants determined by the President. The curr_chunk prohibits discrimination. The curr_chunk outlines that a covered entity cannot disproportionately expose individuals or communities to covered substances based on race, color, national origin, or economic status. It also requires the entity to work with relevant authorities to address any such exposure before seeking authorization for handling these substances. The President will require federal officials to issue regulations for implementing the section on covered substances, ensuring compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Enforcement may involve termination of authorization for handling covered substances or other legal means. Compliance for entities receiving federal assistance may also be enforced under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Community Environmental Equity Act mandates specific timelines for issuing proposed and final rules, with final rules taking effect within 30 months of enactment. A biennial report by the Federal Interagency Environmental Justice Working Group is required every 2 years after the final rules are issued. The Working Group established under Executive Order 12898 must submit a report to Congress on activities conducted under this section. SEC. 3003. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPACT PROFILE PROGRAM GRANTS. The Secretary will establish a Health Impact Profile Program to provide grants to community-based organizations and health centers for developing community health impact profiles. Grants can only be given to organizations located in the community or in partnership with a local entity. Funds must be used for conducting neighborhood health assessments. The Health Impact Profile Program includes conducting neighborhood health assessments for proposed growth or exposure to substances, building community expertise, improving identification of harmful environmental exposure, and preserving a healthy community. Administrative costs are regulated for grant recipients. Authorization of Appropriations: $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2010 is authorized to carry out activities with a limit of 10 percent for administrative costs."
