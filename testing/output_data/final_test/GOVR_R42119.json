Amendments in 2008 expanded its scope to include unlawful actions such as importing, exporting, transporting, selling, or acquiring wildlife or plants in violation of laws or regulations. The Lacey Act, enacted in 1900, regulates the trade of wildlife and plants, creating penalties for violations involving illegal trade domestically and internationally. In 2008, amendments expanded its scope to include nonindigenous plants and violations of foreign laws related to conservation actions. It is now unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, or acquire plants in violation of any state or foreign law, including those taken without appropriate royalties or exported illegally. The Lacey Act prohibits the import, export, transport, sale, or purchase of plants or plant products in violation of state, foreign, or tribal laws. It also prohibits falsifying documents related to plants covered by the act and importing certain plants without a declaration. The 2008 amendments expanded the definition of plants to include nonindigenous plants. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act expanded the definition of plants to include nonindigenous plants, requiring importers to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for all covered plants and plant products. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act require importers to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for all covered plants and plant products. The amendments aim to reduce illegal logging and increase the value of U.S. wood exports, which is a pervasive problem affecting countries that produce, export, and import wood products. Estimates suggest that 15% to 30% of all forestry volume is due to illegal logging, with even higher rates in tropical countries. Global illegal logging is a significant concern due to its economic, environmental, social, and political impacts. The estimated economic value of illegal logging in the global wood trade is between $50 billion and $100 billion. The United States, as the world's largest wood products consumer, plays a role in exacerbating illegal logging, particularly in countries like Peru where a large percentage of mahogany is illegally logged. This activity can devalue U.S. timber exports. Illegal logging of wood lowers market prices, harming legal timber operations. American Forest and Paper Association report estimates illegal logging depresses world wood prices by 7%-16% annually. Eliminating illegal wood could increase U.S. wood exports by $460 million yearly. Halting illegal logging could boost U.S. wood products value by approximately $1.0 billion annually. The Lacey Act, implemented in the United States, aims to prevent the illegal trade of wood products. Other countries like the European Union and Australia have similar regulations in place. The Act is enforced by various government agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and aims to address policy issues related to illegal logging. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act raised policy issues regarding U.S. importers' responsibility for foreign law violations. Concerns include the difficulty of monitoring foreign harvesting practices and the cumbersome declaration requirements for imported plants and plant products. Some argue that meeting the species identification requirements for composite wood materials and finished products can be challenging under the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act. There are also concerns about compliance with other requirements and the difficulty of obtaining declaration information for plants and plant products imported before 2008. Despite criticisms, supporters highlight the economic and environmental benefits of reducing illegal logging and deforestation. Congressional interest in the Lacey Act stems from its broad impact on U.S. industries and consumers. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act have wide-reaching applicability for U.S. industries importing plant products, including musical instrument makers, furniture manufacturers, and toy manufacturers. These amendments aim to reduce illegal logging, increase biodiversity, and conservation in timber-supplying countries, and boost revenues for companies. Proposed legislation in the 113th Congress, such as H.R. 3324, would require importers to provide specific information about the plant products being imported. The bill H.R. 3280 would amend the Lacey Act to exempt plants and plant products imported before May 22, 2008. Under the Lacey Act, all imported plants or plant products must be declared, with some exceptions. The declaration is made by the importer at the time of import. The 2008 amendments aim to reduce illegal logging and increase biodiversity. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act require declaration of plant imports to improve accountability and data collection. The declaration includes the scientific name, value, quantity, and country of origin of the plant. If a product contains material from multiple plants, the declaration should list all possible plant species used. If the exact country of origin is unknown, all relevant information must be provided. The declaration for plant imports under the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act requires listing the scientific names, value, quantity, and country of origin of the plant species used in the product. If the exact country of origin is unknown, all relevant countries must be included. The information from declarations is stored in a database by APHIS, but it is unclear if this data will be publicly available. The declaration does not need details on the chain of custody for the product or its parts. APHIS has developed special use designations (SUDs) to ease burdens of declarations for plant imports under the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act. SUDs substitute for required information and apply to specific products, including shorthand names for trade groupings and special codes for composite woods or recycled products. Declaration requirements were delayed due to complexity concerns. The declaration requirements for certain plant products were delayed between April 2009 and April 2010 due to complexity concerns. Implementation is based on Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes, with some products like musical instruments being declared by April 2010. Enforcement for compliance is only for items in the current schedule, with other products like firearms and furniture being considered for phased-in implementation. APHIS is not enforcing the declaration requirements for these products yet. APHIS is not enforcing the declaration requirement for informal entries like personal shipments. It is uncertain when or if these products will have to be declared. Any additions to the declaration items will be reported in the Federal Register. A review of the declaration requirements and exclusions is required within two years of the 2008 amendments. APHIS initiated a review in 2011 and is seeking comments on implementation. A report on the effectiveness of the declaration requirements will be submitted to congressional committees 180 days after the review is complete. The report on declaration requirements for plant imports was completed in May 2013 and sent to Congress. It includes statistics on the number of declarations received by APHIS and issues associated with incomplete declarations. Recommendations for legislation to identify illegally imported plants and the impact on legal plant imports and illegal logging practices are also discussed. The report on declaration requirements for plant imports highlighted issues such as mislabeling, difficulties in processing paper declarations, and unsuccessful pilot programs. It did not suggest legislative recommendations but emphasized the use of SUDs to ease importers' burden. Regulations reflecting the study's findings may be implemented 180 days after the review, with amendments allowing for limits on declaration requirements for specific plant products. The Lacey Act requires enforcement by various agencies like CBP, U.S. Coast Guard, and others. It can be enforced at the border or through investigations, with inspectors monitoring imports and declaration processes. The Lacey Act enforcement involves inspectors monitoring imports and declarations, conducting investigations into violations, and relying on information from various sources. Enforcement can be challenging due to the lack of a federal database of foreign wildlife and plant laws. Rewards may be provided to informants leading to the arrest or conviction of violators. The Lacey Act prohibits violations of U.S. or tribal laws regarding fish, wildlife, or plants, with penalties including fines, forfeiture, and incarceration. Enforcement may rely on discretionary appropriations for funding. The Secretary is directed to identify funds for enforcing the Lacey Act as a special appropriations item in the Department of the Interior budget proposal to Congress. Funds for enforcement could come from various federal agency accounts. The Office of Law Enforcement for FWS received $62.3 million in FY2013 and employs 219 agents and 143 inspectors. Investigators conducted 12,996 investigations in FY2012, with 2,474 involving the Lacey Act. FWS also has an international wildlife trade program that implements domestic laws and international treaties. The Lacey Act is enforced with funds from various federal agency accounts. Money from penalties can go into the Lacey Act Reward Fund, used for rewards and temporary care for wildlife. Policy issues arise from the 2008 amendments, with coalitions proposing solutions like addressing declaration requirements through regulations. The Lacey Act is enforced with funds from federal agency accounts and penalties. Policy issues from the 2008 amendments include proposed solutions through regulations or congressional action. One key issue is the responsibility of importers to ensure legality of imported plants and products, with debates on enforcing foreign laws and the role of the United States as a consumer contributing to illegal trade. The United States has the potential to reduce illegal trade of plants and wildlife by applying demand-side pressure on legally sourced products. Other countries, like the EU, are adopting regulations to prohibit illegally harvested timber. Responsibility for regulating timber falls on importers and producers. The EU and Australia have regulations in place to prevent the import and sale of illegally harvested timber. Importers and producers must practice due diligence and trace their suppliers and customers. Australia's law is similar to the EU's regulation, requiring due diligence to mitigate the risk of products containing illegally logged timber. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act aim to decrease the market for illegally harvested plants by increasing consumer awareness. Some argue that these amendments go beyond the Act's original intent by addressing foreign laws unrelated to conservation, such as making it illegal to possess plants processed illegally abroad. This was exemplified in the Gibson guitar case, where exporting unfinished wood from India violated Indian law and potentially the Lacey Act. Some argue that the Lacey Act may overreach its intent by prohibiting the processing and export of wood that may not directly impact conservation. However, others defend the Act as a conservation tool, emphasizing that enforcing payment of fees and taxes can deter illegal logging and generate revenue for conservation efforts. Enforcing export laws can help reduce illegal plants and plant products in the market. Limiting foreign laws to those addressing conservation could narrow the scope of the Lacey Act. The 2008 amendments to the law have sparked debate over their impact on costs and job creation in the plant and plant product industries. Compliance with the amendments involves ensuring legal harvesting and processing of imported plants, leading to increased declaration requirements. APHIS has reported receiving around 40,000 declarations as a result. APHIS receives approximately 40,000 declarations per month, costing regulated entities $56 million annually. Compliance costs depend on importer due care and declaration requirements. Larger companies may have more resources for due care. Identifying wood species and filling out paperwork for declarations may require additional staff. The 2008 amendments to wood import regulations incur costs for companies importing wood products, including indirect costs from changing trade partners and potential violations with penalties up to $500,000. The amendments aim to reduce illegal logging, increase revenues for legal logging operations, and stabilize wood prices in domestic and international markets. Reducing illegal logging can lead to higher prices for legally harvested wood, with estimates of a 7%-16% annual increase. The 2008 amendments aim to curb illegal logging, potentially saving the U.S. forest products industry $1 billion annually and creating more domestic jobs. Additionally, reducing illegal logging can increase government revenues in countries where wood is harvested by curbing corruption and tax evasion. Illegal logging leads to corruption and tax evasion, causing governments to lose $15 billion annually. The effectiveness of the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act in reducing illegal logging worldwide is uncertain. Some believe foreign logging operations in China and Vietnam are complying with laws due to consumer pressure, while others fear a potential increase in sales of illegally harvested wood to countries without restrictions. The declaration requirements for plants and plant products under the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act are controversial, with some finding them burdensome and difficult to comply with. Proponents argue that these requirements are necessary to ensure compliance and serve as an oversight mechanism. Some find the declaration requirements of the Lacey Act burdensome, especially for wood products with multiple species that are hard to identify. Suggestions include excluding these products from declaration until species identification is feasible. The law addresses challenges in identifying various wood species in products by allowing declaration of all possible species used. APHIS is considering regulatory options for declaring composite wood, proposing a definition and two approaches for declaration. One approach involves identifying the genus, species, and country of harvest for a certain percentage of the wood in the product. The second approach for declaring composite plant content in products involves stating the \"average percent composite plant content\" without specifying the species and country of harvest. A de minimis standard is proposed for products with highly processed plant materials in small quantities, exempting them from declaration requirements. This proposal applies to products like cosmetics, textiles, and rubber or cork products. The proposal suggests that federal agencies have rulemaking authority to establish exclusions to declaration requirements, but congressional action may be necessary for clarification. APHIS uses SUDs to identify composite woods or recycled products when species and genus cannot be determined. Some argue against broadening exemptions, stating that knowing the type and source of wood is crucial for legal practices and combating illegal trade. They oppose modifications that would exclude pulp and paper from declaration requirements. The proposal aims to exempt pulp and paper imports from declaration requirements to reduce administrative burden and costs. Importers could submit a blanket declaration for similar products over a period, as tested in the Lacey Act Blanket Declaration Pilot Program. Eligible importers can participate in the program for one month, providing a reconciliation report on actual imports. The Lacey Act Blanket Declaration Pilot Program was deemed unsuccessful according to a report submitted to Congress by APHIS. Users found the program redundant with existing declaration efforts. Changes to declaration requirements can be made through regulations or legislation, with the Secretary authorized to modify them based on reviews and reports. The Secretary must review and report on the effectiveness of declaration requirements to Congress. The Secretary can modify declaration requirements for plant products through regulations, potentially excluding difficult-to-declare products. H.R. 3324 in the 113th Congress aims to require importers to possess information about imported plant products, reducing the burden of declaration processing. The bill aims to lower the burden of processing declarations for APHIS by modifying declaration requirements for plant products, but importers would still face challenges in identifying species and country of origin. H.R. 3280 in the 113th Congress proposes excluding plants imported before May 22, 2008, from the Lacey Act. The provision aims to exclude plant products created and imported before May 22, 2008, from Lacey Act coverage. U.S. importers can protect themselves by exercising due care in determining the legality of imported plants. Some argue that the actions required to demonstrate due care under the Lacey Act are unclear. The Lacey Act lacks clear definitions of due care, which is crucial for avoiding penalties. Due care requires individuals to take steps to ensure they are not violating the law, with steeper penalties for knowingly engaging in prohibited conduct. The Lacey Act imposes steeper penalties for violations committed unknowingly without exercising due care. Exercising due care can help individuals avoid liability for certain violations, but penalties such as forfeiting goods may still apply. The due care standard does not apply to marking or labeling violations and is excluded from declaration requirements under the act. The intent behind the due care standard in the Lacey Act is to reduce the potential for abusive and indiscriminate actions. The due care standard in the Lacey Act aims to lower abusive enforcement efforts and varies based on knowledge and responsibility levels. Practical measures to demonstrate due care include asking about wood's chain of custody, implementing compliance plans, and recording supply chain efforts. Some red flags indicating violations of logging or processing laws include goods trading below market rate, cash transactions without paperwork, and falsified documents. The Lacey Act Compliance Program serves as a guideline for due care, requiring steps like communicating with suppliers and researching risky sources of wood. The Lacey Act Compliance Program requires steps such as researching risky sources of wood, requesting sample documentation, and making a determination of legality before purchasing wood. Gibson Guitar supplements these requirements by procuring wood from certified forests and verifying certifications when working with new suppliers. The DOJ is clarifying guidelines for exercising due care under the Lacey Act regarding plants and plant products. Stakeholders are proposing a process that includes steps to verify compliance with the Act, potentially leading to certification for the products. Some are considering certification of individual items or manufacturers, importers, and retailers. Another group is developing a process centered on obtaining forest certification to ensure protection and assess risk, compliance, and legality. The EU has adopted a process for exercising due care to curb illegal logging, with three primary elements: information on timber products, risk assessment of illegal timber in the supply chain, and risk mitigation strategies. The EU has implemented a due diligence process to combat illegal logging, involving risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This includes obtaining additional information from timber suppliers and potentially using third-party verification. The process requires chain of custody information and risk mitigation calculations, offering clarity on how to exercise due care and a defense against charges. Implementing a process to ensure the legality of imported products can help importers coordinate efforts, reduce compliance costs, and provide a benchmark for law enforcement. However, challenges include verifying timber practices in foreign countries and the risk of violations going unnoticed. Third-party verification may be a component of this due care process. Third parties can invest resources in foreign countries to monitor timber operations for importers and provide certification for compliance with the law, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). However, the effectiveness of third-party monitoring has been questioned due to potential corruption and fraud, which could undermine the credibility of certification schemes and their ability to curb illegal logging. Some certification schemes may also not cover all aspects of due care processes for timber products. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) does not provide rigorous oversight for \"FSC Controlled Wood,\" allowing non-certified wood to be mixed with certified wood. Certification schemes may not cover all steps in the timber importation process, such as laws related to export and processing after harvest. Importers face challenges in exercising due care under the Lacey Act, as it requires understanding foreign laws and monitoring in the country of harvest. Indonesia alone has over 900 laws related to timber harvesting. Indonesia has over 900 laws related to timber harvesting. Importers are responsible for knowing foreign laws regarding plants and plant products. Suggestions to reduce illegal logging include supply-side driven options like encouraging timber-producing countries to establish timber legality standards. Supply-side guidelines were implemented in a trade agreement between the United States and Peru in 2006 to address illegal logging. Several measures have been implemented to deter illegal logging in countries, including increasing enforcement personnel, imposing penalties, monitoring endangered plant species, verifying exporters and producers, and developing tools to strengthen regulatory controls. Countries like Indonesia have established legality standards with indicators for timber operations and forest management, where independent auditors assess and award certificates for legal operations. International cooperation is also promoted to identify areas of legal and illegal logging practices. Opportunities for coordination among importers in Europe and North America exist with the EU regulation to address illegal logging practices. Efforts to identify \"hot spots\" of illegal logging could incentivize suppliers to adhere to legal practices. However, creating subjective lists of countries with illegal logging could lead to controversy and questions about criteria for inclusion and removal from the list. Legal operators in listed countries may argue against being labeled as illegal. Some suggest strengthening federal programs to aid compliance with the Lacey Act, such as those by the U.S. Agency of International Development and Department of State. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act helps conserve tropical forests by restructuring debt in eligible countries to support law enforcement against illegal logging. This reduces illegal logging practices in supplier countries. The 2008 Lacey Act Amendments aim to reduce illegal logging practices in supplier countries. Controversy surrounds potential changes, with some advocating for legislative changes and others for regulatory changes. Efforts to change implementation through regulations have stalled, with delays in producing review reports. Some argue that applying foreign laws to harvesting and producing plant and wildlife products is not feasible for the average person or corporation in the United States. Some suggest removing violations of foreign laws from the Lacey Act in the United States, arguing that amending the act could lead to unintended consequences and subvert the process of making changes through regulations."
