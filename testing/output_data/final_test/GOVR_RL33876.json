In 1934, the Philippine Independence Act set a 10-year timetable for independence, establishing a Commonwealth of the Philippines. Full independence was delayed until 1946 due to Japanese occupation during World War II. The U.S. retained the power to maintain military bases in the Philippines. During World War II, President Roosevelt placed all Philippine military forces under the United States Armed Forces of the Far East (USAFFE). Congress has passed laws providing benefits to Filipino veterans since 1946. This report outlines major legislation for Filipino veterans enacted by Congress. The Rescission Acts of 1946 impacted benefits for Filipino veterans who served as Philippine Scouts before October 6, 1945. They are entitled to benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Table 1 in the report shows the current benefits for Filipino veterans and survivors. During the Japanese occupation of the Islands, Philippine citizens served in resistance units recognized by the U.S. Armed Forces. They later became part of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines and served with the U.S. Armed Forces between October 6, 1945, and June 30, 1947. These individuals, known as \"New\" Scouts, were recruited under the Armed Forces Voluntary Recruitment Act of 1945. The Rescission Acts of 1946 applied only to Filipino veterans who were members of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerrilla Forces, or the New Philippine Scouts. Regular Philippine Scouts were categorized as U.S. veterans and entitled to all veterans' benefits. P.L. 79-301 authorized a $200 million appropriation for service-connected disabilities or death benefits for these veterans. P.L. 79-301 provided compensation for service-connected disabilities or death for Commonwealth Army veterans in the Philippines, specifying that their service would not be considered active military service for U.S. benefits. Benefits were paid at the rate of one Philippine peso. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 79-301, Commonwealth Army veterans were eligible for U.S. veterans' benefits. P.L. 79-391 specified that service in the Philippine Scouts shall not be considered active military service for U.S. benefits. The intent of Congress in passing the first Rescission Act, affecting Commonwealth veterans, is unclear. The intent of Congress in passing the first Rescission Act, affecting Commonwealth Army veterans, is unclear. Senator Carl Hayden's statements during hearings on the second Rescission Act, which impacted New Philippine Scouts, provide some insight into legislative intent. Events at the time, such as Congress considering a $200 million appropriation for the Philippine Army post-World War II, also shed light on the context surrounding the Rescission Acts. General Omar Bradley's response to Senator Hayden's inquiry about Filipino servicemen's veterans benefits costs was a significant factor in the legislative process. General Bradley estimated that veterans' benefits for the Philippine Commonwealth Army would cost $3 billion over 75 years. The first Rescission Act aimed to balance financial interests by providing some benefits while reducing future liabilities. Senators Hayden, Russell, and Brooks amended the bill to exclude service in the Commonwealth Army from being considered active military service. Congress intended to limit wartime benefits for these veterans based on hearings for the second Rescission Act. The Act limits wartime benefits for New Philippine Scouts, clarifying that they are only entitled to pensions for service-connected disability or death, not GI Bill benefits. The Rescission Acts limited wartime benefits for New Philippine Scouts to pensions for service-connected disability or death. Congress also passed the Philippine Rehabilitation Act and the Philippine Trade Act in 1946 to provide economic stability to the Philippines. The Rescission Acts limited wartime benefits for Filipino veterans to pensions for service-connected disability or death. Congress considered the Acts in the context of providing economic development for the Philippines. P.L. 80-865 authorized aid for a hospital in the Philippines to care for Commonwealth Army veterans and Recognized Guerrilla Forces. P.L. 80-865 authorized funding for a new hospital in the Philippines for Commonwealth Army veterans and Recognized Guerrilla Forces. The hospital, known as Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC), was completed in 1955 at a cost of $9.4 million. P.L. 82-311 allowed the transfer of the United States Army Provisional Philippine Scout Hospital to the Philippine government in 1952. P.L. 82-311 authorized a grant program to reimburse the Republic of the Philippines for medical care of Regular Philippine Scouts at the United States Army Provisional Philippine Scout Hospital. P.L. 83-421 extended the program for five more years with decreasing payments. The VMMC was initially for service-connected conditions but expanded to include veterans of any war for nonservice-connected disabilities in 1958. The VA was authorized to pay for necessary hospital care for Commonwealth Army veterans and Recognized Guerrilla Forces in the Republic of the Philippines under P.L. 85-461. The agreement allowed for the modification of the contract between the United States and the Philippines for hospital and medical care. The contract had to be entered into before July 1, 1958, for a period of up to five consecutive fiscal years, providing payments for hospital care at a set rate. The VA was authorized to pay for necessary hospital care for Commonwealth Army veterans and Recognized Guerrilla Forces in the Republic of the Philippines under P.L. 85-461. The agreement allowed for payments for hospital care at a per diem rate jointly determined by the two governments for each fiscal year. P.L. 88-40 extended the grant program for another five years, with costs not to exceed $500,000 per fiscal year. P.L. 89-612 expanded the grant program to include hospital care at the VMMC for Commonwealth Army veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. P.L. 89-612 authorized hospital care for New Philippine Scouts for service-connected disabilities and nonservice-connected conditions if enlisted before July 4, 1946. It also allocated funds for equipment replacement and upgrades, as well as medical research and training grants to VMMC. P.L. 93-82, enacted in 1973, allowed nursing home care for eligible Commonwealth Army veterans and New Philippine Scouts at VMMC. P.L. 93-82 authorized funding for medical care, education grants for health service personnel, and equipment upgrades at VMMC. P.L. 97-72 amended existing law to clarify the US's responsibility for providing medical care to Commonwealth Army veterans and New Philippine Scouts. The Republic of the Philippines is responsible for medical care for Commonwealth Army veterans and New Philippine Scouts. Congress intended for a temporary grant program for Filipino veterans' medical benefits to be funded by the Philippine government eventually. Grants were renewed but decreased over five years to signify Congress's intent. The program for Filipino veterans' medical benefits was initially intended to be funded by the Philippine government, with grants decreasing over five years to signify Congress's intent. However, due to concerns about the quality of care for veterans, the program was extended in 5-year increments until 1978. Additional legislation expanded coverage to include nonservice-connected disabilities and granted the VA authority to provide care at the VMMC. The VMMC received a grant of $500,000 per year for five years to upgrade equipment and facilities. Legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s further authorized amendments to the grant program. In 1993, the VA stopped referring veterans to the VMMC due to concerns about the quality of care provided. The VMMC received a $500,000 grant from the U.S. government to purchase equipment for Filipino veterans. This funding was authorized through P.L. 102-585 and continued until September 30, 1996. The VA provides grants under 38 U.S.C. \u00a71731 for equipment. Additionally, P.L. 82-21 authorized funeral and burial benefits for Commonwealth Army veterans in the Philippines. P.L. 89-613 extended education assistance benefits to children of Commonwealth Army veterans and New Philippine Scouts at half the rate of U.S. veterans. P.L. 89-641 changed benefit computation to pay in pesos based on a set exchange rate. The intent was to restore Philippines beneficiaries to their 1946 situation. Since 1946, legislative changes and peso devaluations have led to Filipino veterans receiving higher benefits than U.S. counterparts. P.L. 106-169 expanded U.S. benefits to Filipino World War II veterans, allowing them to retain 75% of their Supplemental Security Income benefits in the Philippines. Filipino veterans residing in the United States were granted 75% of their SSI benefits under P.L. 106-477. This law also authorized the VA to provide healthcare services to these veterans, similar to those available to U.S. veterans. Additionally, outpatient care at the Manila VA Outpatient Clinic was made available to U.S. veterans for their nonservice-connected disabilities under P.L. 106-377. The VA provides healthcare services to U.S. veterans in the Philippines for service-connected conditions. Legislation enacted in 2000 and 2003 changed burial benefits and authorized hospital and nursing home care for Filipino veterans. Service in the New Philippine Scouts is now eligible for disability compensation and burial benefits. The VA provides healthcare services to U.S. veterans in the Philippines for service-connected conditions, including indemnity compensation (DIC) and burial benefits. Veterans of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Recognized Guerrilla Forces residing in the U.S. receive DIC at the full-dollar rate. Filipino veterans have similar entitlement to monetary benefits as in the U.S., except for home loans. H.R. 760 and S. 57 aimed to remove distinctions between different groups of veterans. Three groups of veterans from the Philippines, including Commonwealth Army, Recognized Guerrilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts, are eligible for VA benefits similar to U.S. veterans. Legislation such as H.R. 760 and S. 1315 aimed to validate claims and provide benefits for Filipino veterans who served during World War II. Single Filipino veterans living outside the U.S. would receive $3,600 a year under S. 1315. Under S. 1315, Filipino veterans living outside the United States would receive annual benefits based on their marital status. However, those already receiving Social Security benefits for World War II veterans living overseas would not be eligible for the new Improved Pension rates. The bill also waived income and net worth limitations for veterans who served with the Philippine forces and their survivors living abroad. Additionally, veterans or their survivors already receiving federal benefits would not be required to apply for the Improved Pension or Death Pension if it would make them ineligible for their current benefits. S. 1315 provided disability compensation at a fixed rate for all recipients regardless of residence. The House passed an amended version without Filipino benefit provisions. H.R. 6897 offered a one-time payment to Filipino veterans based on their citizenship status. The Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund, funded by P.L. 110-329 and ARRA, provides a one-time payment of $15,000 for U.S. citizens and $9,000 for non-U.S. citizens to Filipino veterans. This payment does not affect current benefits and serves as a settlement for future claims related to their service. Veterans may receive benefits based on laws in effect before September 17, 2009."
