    "content": "Mexico has transitioned from a centralized political system dominated by the PRI to a multiparty democracy. Presidential power is now constrained by Congress, the Supreme Court, and powerful governors. Weak institutions hinder democratic consolidation. Calder\u00f3n of the PAN won the 2006 election in a close race. President Calder\u00f3n served from 2006 to 2012, succeeded by Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Despite economic and security challenges, Calder\u00f3n achieved significant reforms, maintained stability, expanded health insurance access, and improved Mexico's security apparatus. Relations with the U.S. and Latin America strengthened through cooperation. President Calder\u00f3n faced a security crisis due to the government's campaign against organized crime, leading to escalating violence, poverty, and corruption. Despite challenges, he achieved significant reforms and strengthened relations with the U.S. and Latin America. In his first term, Calder\u00f3n worked with the PRI to pass fiscal and pension reforms, as well as a judicial reform decree in 2008. Mexico underwent significant reforms, including a judicial reform to transition to a public trial system by 2016 and an energy sector reform in 2008. The PRI performed well in the 2009 mid-term elections, capturing a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and governorships. Critics raised concerns about limited private partnerships in the energy sector reform. In the 2009 mid-term elections in Mexico, the PAN lost seats in the Chamber of Deputies and governorships, while the PRD fared even worse. The PRI, with the support of the Green Ecological Party, controlled a majority in the Chamber, complicating President Calderon's legislative agenda. During its three-year term, the Congress in Mexico enacted various reforms, including antitrust legislation, immigration laws, constitutional reforms, and limited political reforms. In the 2012 elections, voter turnout reached record levels with 63% of eligible voters casting ballots. In the 2012 Mexican elections, the Federal Electoral Institute oversaw the process, certified by the Federal Electoral Tribunal on August 31, 2012. The PRD-led coalition's claims of vote-buying were dismissed. The PRI regained the presidency after 12 years, with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto winning by a smaller margin than predicted. L\u00f3pez Obrador refused to accept the results, leaving the PRD to form the Morena party. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto won the 2012 Mexican presidential election with 38.2% of the vote, promising a corruption-free government and bold reforms. The PRI/PVEM coalition did not secure a majority in the legislature, potentially complicating Pe\u00f1a Nieto's ability to pass legislation. They may need to align with the PANAL party to achieve a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI will need to form cross-party coalitions to pass constitutional amendments, likely finding support from the PAN. The PRD-led coalition could complicate reform efforts, especially in the energy sector. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto may face legislative opposition but could leverage the PRI's strength at the state and local level for support. Prior to the 2012 elections, the PRI controlled 19 of 32 governorships in Mexico. The PRI picked up the governorship of Jalisco and Chiapas, but lost the state of Tabasco. Pe\u00f1a Nieto may have to balance between maintaining party unity and challenging PRI governors if his national agenda reform conflicts with state interests. Mexico's five-month transition period between presidencies can be awkward for both outgoing and incoming Administrations. Outgoing President Calder\u00f3n introduced labor reform legislation approved by the Mexican Congress in November 2012. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in December 2012 and announced a reform agenda focused on reducing violence, combating poverty, boosting economic growth, reforming education, and fostering social responsibility. Leaders from the conservative PAN and leftist PRD signed on to his \"Pact for Mexico\" agreement, which included legislative proposals for advancing the reform agenda. The Congress approved an education reform bill, one of the 13 proposals identified as short-term priorities. Mexico is a major producer and supplier of heroin to the U.S. market. Mexico is a major producer and supplier of heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana to the U.S. market. It is also a key transit country for cocaine into the United States. Mexican drug trafficking organizations dominate the supply and distribution of illicit drugs in the U.S. and violence among these organizations has escalated in recent years. Mexican drug trafficking organizations, known as transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), have expanded into various criminal activities beyond drug distribution, including human trafficking, kidnapping, armed robbery, and extortion. The DTOs have employed tactics resembling armed insurgencies, such as car bombs and grenades. The Calder\u00f3n Administration prioritized combating drug trafficking and organized crime, leading to the takedown of major DTO leaders through arrests or deaths, with increased enforcement efforts by Mexican military forces. The Mexican government accelerated takedowns of major drug trafficking organization leaders starting in late 2009, with increased intelligence-sharing with the U.S. By October 2012, 25 of the country's 37 most wanted criminals were captured or killed. The Calder\u00f3n government extradited a record number of criminals to the U.S., but top DTO leaders captured were not tried in Mexican courts. This focus on dismantling criminal leadership led to brutal succession struggles and more violent groups emerging. Drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico may have caused around 60,000 deaths in the last six years. Violence in Mexico has led to approximately 60,000 deaths in the last six years, with 25,000 individuals reported missing. The violence peaked in 2011 and decreased by 20% in 2012. It has mainly occurred in drug production and transit areas, but has spread to large cities like Monterrey and tourist zones like Acapulco. The security situation varies across the country, prompting a State Department Travel Warning for certain states. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto outlined a strategy for achieving a peaceful Mexico with respect for human rights. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's strategy for achieving a peaceful Mexico involves a \"state\" security policy with six pillars, including planning, prevention, and human rights protection. The primary goal is to improve security conditions by reducing homicides and other crimes, rather than focusing on drug seizures or arrests of kingpins. Mexico began restructuring its economy in the late 1980s, accelerating towards an open market economy. Mexico's economy transitioned to an open market after joining NAFTA in 1994, leading to a focus on manufacturing-for-export. The country has diversified its exports, including automobiles and electronics. Despite efforts to diversify, Mexico remains heavily reliant on the US as an export market, with 12 free trade agreements in place. Mexico's economy heavily depends on the United States as an export market, tourism revenue source, and for remittances and investment. Economic conditions in Mexico closely follow those in the U.S., with growth or decline mirroring each other. The Calder\u00f3n government maintained stability during the global economic crisis, using international reserves to support the peso amidst challenges like the H1N1 epidemic and declining oil production. During the global economic crisis, Mexico's government took measures to stabilize the economy by using international reserves to support the peso, establishing currency swap lines with the U.S. Federal Reserve, hedging oil exports, increasing liquidity in the banking system, and expanding credit lines with international organizations. Fiscal stimulus in 2009 included infrastructure spending and subsidies, while programs supporting businesses, job creation, and social safety nets were maintained. The economy rebounded in late 2009, driven in part by increased U.S. demand for Mexican exports, leading to GDP growth of 5.5% in 2010 and 3.9% in 2011. Mexico's GDP grew by 5.5% in 2010 and 3.9% in 2011. The government rolled back stimulus measures, increased taxes, extended credit lines with the IMF, and hedged oil exports. Steps were taken to boost consumer spending and housing construction. The economy grew by 4% in 2012, but challenges remain for long-term growth potential, including sluggish U.S. economic growth. Organized crime-related violence is also a concern. Some studies suggest that organized crime-related violence has hindered Mexico's competitiveness by increasing business costs. Mexico faces obstacles such as a low tax base, reliance on declining oil revenues, rigid labor market, weak education system, and lack of competition in certain sectors. Recent labor and education reforms aim to address these challenges. Despite macroeconomic stability during PAN rule, Mexico still struggles with high poverty and inequality rates. The 2009 economic downturn negatively impacted poverty reduction efforts. Mexico, with a population of 114.7 million, is classified as an upper-middle-income developing country by the World Bank, with a per capita income of $10,064. The percentage of Mexicans living in poverty increased to 46.2% between 2008 and 2010, despite government efforts to improve access to healthcare and housing. Rural poverty worsened due to a drought starting in 2011, affecting subsistence farmers. The Mexican government allocated $2.5 billion for drought relief, including infrastructure for drinking water. Mexico allocated $2.5 billion for drought relief, purchasing U.S. corn to prevent price increases for a key food staple. The country's cattle industry may take years to recover. The main poverty reduction program, Oportunidades, benefits 5.8 million Mexican families in rural areas by providing cash transfers and improving nutrition, health, and education. Mexico's Oportunidades program aims to improve educational attainment by providing cash transfers to families in poverty who attend medical appointments and ensure their children go to school. While some praise its positive effects, others criticize it for fostering dependency. The program has expanded to urban areas and increased high school enrollment by 85% in rural areas. Another initiative, Seguro Popular, aims to provide health insurance to those not covered by social security. In 2003, the Mexican Congress passed a law to increase public funding for health care over seven years to achieve universal health insurance through the program known as Seguro Popular. By 2012, over 52 million previously uninsured people received insurance. While praised for expanding access to health care, some criticize Seguro Popular for inefficiency and not reaching the poorest communities. President Calder\u00f3n aimed to strengthen Mexico's ties with Latin America, signing agreements with Colombia and focusing on bilateral relations with the United States. In June 2012, Mexico signed an agreement with Colombia, Peru, and Chile to establish the Pacific Alliance for regional integration and trade with Asia. Calder\u00f3n supported the Central American Security Strategy, signed a free trade agreement with Central America, and explored forming a Brazil-Mexico FTA. He also worked on energy cooperation with Brazil's Petrobras and tried to improve relations with Cuba and Venezuela. Calder\u00f3n played a lead role in global climate change negotiations. In global climate change negotiations, Mexico hosted the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Canc\u00fan in late 2010. Mexico sought consultations with partner countries to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. As rotating head of the G20 nations, Mexico hosted the G20 Summit in June 2012, focusing on food security issues and sustainability. Mexico's economy shifted towards trade and investment under Presidents Salinas and Zedillo, with increased cooperation with the United States on various issues. President Fox further strengthened relations with the US and called for greater cooperation under NAFTA and a migration agreement. After the September 2001 terrorist attacks, US-Mexico relations focused on border security due to US homeland security concerns. Tensions rose during the immigration reform debate, leading to Mexico denouncing the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Security cooperation, especially in combating drug trafficking, became a priority under the Calder\u00f3n government. This led to the development of the M\u00e9rida Initiative in October 2007, a multi-year US assistance effort to help Mexico and Central America. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a U.S. assistance effort announced in October 2007 to combat drug trafficking and crime in Mexico and Central America, marked a significant diplomatic step forward for bilateral cooperation. Under the first Obama Administration, security cooperation intensified with a new strategy focusing on institution-building, border issues, and development in Mexico. President Calder\u00f3n visited President-elect Obama in January 2009, highlighting the importance of strong U.S.-Mexican relations. During his first term, Calder\u00f3n focused on enhancing North American competitiveness and energy cooperation in bilateral and trilateral meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. U.S.-Mexican security cooperation continued despite tensions, with cabinet-level meetings and the establishment of working groups to address specific topics. In September 2012, officials from both countries reaffirmed their commitment to the M\u00e9rida Initiative and pledged to deepen cooperation. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico resigned after incidents of U.S. agents being shot. With a shift in power in Mexico, U.S.-Mexican relations may change. In 2013, both countries have new presidents facing domestic challenges. Analysts urge cooperation on trade and job creation. President Obama and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto aim to strengthen economic ties and address various bilateral issues. Congress plays a more active role in shaping U.S.-Mexican relations. In recent years, Congress has played a significant role in shaping U.S.-Mexican relations through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, which began in FY2008 to provide anticrime and counterdrug assistance to Mexico. U.S. assistance to Mexico increased from $65 million in FY2007 to $406 million in FY2008 as a result of this initiative. Congress appropriated $1.9 billion in M\u00e9rida assistance for Mexico from FY2008-FY2012, with $1.1 billion delivered by November 2012. Assistance has been provided through various accounts including INCLE, ESF, and FMF. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, which began in FY2008, aims to address societal problems in Mexico that have allowed the drug trade to flourish. The updated strategy focuses on disrupting organized crime, institutionalizing the rule of law, building a modern border, and strengthening communities. U.S. assistance supports training and technical programs for Mexico's justice sector, with a shift towards assisting key states with police and judicial reform efforts. Congress has played a significant role in determining the level and composition of assistance. Congress has influenced the level and composition of M\u00e9rida funding for Mexico, including earmarking funds for specific purposes and placing conditions on assistance to prioritize certain programs and address human rights concerns. There is strong bipartisan support in Congress for maintaining U.S. support through the M\u00e9rida Initiative accounts. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $234 million in assistance for Mexico. In FY2013, Congress considered various funding levels for Mexico, including $199 million in the INCLE account and $35 million in the ESF account. The Senate and House versions of the foreign operations appropriations bill differed in their allocations, with the final decision being a continuing resolution to fund aid programs at FY2012 levels plus 0.6% through March 27, 2013. In FY2012, Congress increased development assistance to Mexico to $33 million. USAID uses this funding for programs supporting private sector competitiveness, sustainable energy development, and partnerships with Mexican universities on climate change and rule of law issues. Military training programs and counterterrorism assistance are also provided through different accounts. DOD provides counterdrug assistance to Mexico through the NADR account and its own legislative authorities. DOD programs in Mexico are overseen by NORTHCOM. Total DOD support to Mexico in FY2012 was $100.4 million and may exceed $75.3 million in FY2013. In the 1980s and 1990s, U.S.-Mexican counternarcotics efforts were marked by mistrust, especially after the killing of DEA Special Agent Enrique Camarena in Mexico in 1985. Reforms to the U.S. drug certification process in 2002 improved antidrug cooperation with Mexico. During the Fox administration (2000-2006), antidrug cooperation with Mexico improved significantly due to legislative changes. U.S.-Mexican security cooperation intensified with the M\u00e9rida Initiative, continuing despite challenges like the \"Fast and Furious\" operation. U.S. training and law enforcement support in Mexico advanced, even amid incidents where U.S. personnel were injured or killed. The U.S. government assisted in investigating an attack on two CIA employees in 2012. In August 2012, CIA employees were wounded in Mexico by Federal Police. The U.S. government pledged to address drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and money laundering in the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Concerns about drug-related violence in Mexico spilling over into the U.S. have been raised. U.S. officials deny any spillover violence. The recent increase in violence in Mexico has led to concerns about spillover into the United States. In response, initiatives were announced to guard against violent crime, support Mexico's crackdown on drug cartels, and reduce contraband movement across the border. National Guard troops were deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border to assist with counternarcotics enforcement efforts. In 2011, the National Guard shifted to providing aerial surveillance support for the Border Patrol. This mission continues in 2013. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to bolster efforts to secure the Southwest border, including increasing penalties for aviation smuggling and tightening sentencing guidelines for building border tunnels. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has established Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BESTs) to enhance cooperation among local, state, and federal agencies, as well as with Mexico's Secretary of Public Security (SSP). P.L. 112-205 provides statutory support for these efforts. ICE has set up a Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU) in Mexico to work on criminal investigations and prosecutions. ICE, CBP, and the U.S. Coast Guard collaborate with Mexican counterparts to disrupt DTO activities. DHS reimburses Southwest border states for security expenses through Operation Stonegarden. DOJ has increased efforts to combat Mexican drug cartels in the U.S. and support Mexican law enforcement. DOJ components, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, USM, Criminal Division, and Office of Justice Programs, have intensified efforts against Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) in the U.S. Over 5,500 suspects have been arrested, and $300 million in illicit funds seized. The Criminal Division has a dedicated team for investigating and prosecuting cases against Mexican DTOs. Extraditions from Mexico are being pursued to combat the estimated $19-29 billion in illicit proceeds flowing to DTOs annually. Criminals in the United States are selling drugs and laundering money to Mexico, using methods like bulk cash smuggling. They are now turning to stored value cards to move money, bypassing the reporting requirement for cash over $10,000. Current federal regulations do not cover stored value cards as monetary instruments. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has issued a rule defining \"stored value\" as \"prepaid access\" and implementing regulations for recordkeeping and reporting on prepaid access products and services. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has issued a rule defining \"stored value\" as \"prepaid access\" and implementing regulations for recordkeeping and reporting on prepaid access products and services. A proposed rule would amend the definition of \"monetary instrument\" to include prepaid access devices for international monetary transport regulations. Challenges remain in law enforcement's ability to detect and differentiate legitimate from illegitimate stored value on cards, travelers' ability to remember stored value amounts, and law enforcement's ability to locate and freeze illegitimate stored value. Mexican traffickers use various methods to move and launder money, including digital currency accounts, online businesses, online games, and mobile banking. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy aims to counter financial crimes like money laundering and bulk cash smuggling. This is crucial to prevent the flow of drug sale proceeds to criminal groups for acquiring weapons and corrupting officials in the United States. The SWBCS aims to curb southbound money flow from drug sales in the US by targeting bulk cash smuggling, illegal MSB use, and enhancing financial sanctions. \"Operation Firewall\" was launched in 2005 to combat bulk cash smuggling, resulting in arrests and seizures. Efforts against money laundering are expanding beyond federal level, with ICE opening a bulk cash smuggling center in 2009 to assist law enforcement at all levels. ICE opened a bulk cash smuggling center to assist U.S. law enforcement agencies in tracking illicit funding flows. The United States and Mexico have a Bilateral Money Laundering Working Group to coordinate efforts against money laundering and bulk cash smuggling. Major points for bulk cash smuggling along the Southwest border include San Ysidro, Nogales, Laredo, McAllen, and Brownsville. Studies like the Bi-national Criminal Proceeds Study can help inform future efforts against money laundering. The 112th Congress focused on enhancing money laundering efforts, particularly in relation to illegal firearms trafficking from the United States to Mexico. The ATF implemented \"Project Gunrunner\" to enforce gun control laws and trained Mexican officials in firearm tracing. ATF has shared data on firearms traces for Mexican authorities, despite methodological limitations. In June 2009, GAO recommended that ATF update its reporting on firearms trace data and trends. However, ATF has only released limited trace data in the last two years. In February 2011, ATF faced scrutiny for Operation Fast and Furious, where suspected straw purchasers acquired large quantities of firearms for trafficking. Some of these firearms were allegedly trafficked to gunrunners. Some firearms allegedly trafficked to criminals, including those involved in the shooting of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and ICE Special Agent Jamie Zapata. Questions raised about ATF's knowledge and communication with Mexican counterparts regarding these investigations. Legislators in the US and Mexico have concerns about Operation Fast and Furious. US Attorney General ordered an evaluation of Project Gunrunner in response to Congressional inquiries. ATF implemented a reporting requirement for multiple rifle sales in Southwest border states. Efforts under the M\u00e9rida Initiative and US domestic actions aim to combat illicit flows linked to drug trade, particularly targeting Mexican DTOs like Los Zetas. Illicit flows related to the drug trade have intensified, leading Mexican DTOs, especially Los Zetas, to expand into alien smuggling and human trafficking. Alien smuggling involves illegal transportation of people from Mexico to the United States, with some smugglers having ties to DTOs and engaging in criminal activities. Organized crime groups' increasing involvement in alien smuggling is a shared security concern for U.S. and Mexican officials. Human trafficking involves coercion into sexual exploitation or forced labor, with some migrants becoming victims after contracting with smugglers. Undocumented migrants, women, children, and indigenous persons are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico. Mexican and U.S. law enforcement agencies collaborate to combat these crimes. Mexican and U.S. law enforcement agencies collaborate to combat human trafficking in Mexico. Through initiatives like OASISS, Mexican alien smugglers apprehended in the U.S. can be prosecuted in Mexico. Since 2007, Mexico has intensified investigations and prosecutions against human trafficking, leading to its removal from the human trafficking watch list and ranking as a \"Tier 2\" country in the State Department's annual reports. According to the State Department's TIP report for 2011, Mexico convicted 14 sex traffickers but had no convictions for forced labor. Observers note low prosecution rates compared to the scale of human trafficking. Mexico passed a new law against trafficking with up to 40 years in prison for sexual exploitation convictions, but funding for anti-TIP efforts was cut in 2012. U.S. supports some Mexican law enforcement activities against human trafficking. Considered additional investments in these programs could enhance Mexico's role in migration enforcement. The United States may consider additional investments in migration control programs, including within existing initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Mexico is a major recipient of U.S. anti-trafficking assistance, but concerns about human rights conditions persist due to violence by organized crime groups and the government's response. Domestic violence and other societal abuses are also ongoing issues in the country. In Mexico, ongoing concerns about human rights abuses include domestic violence, femicide, trafficking in persons, and abuses against migrants. Reports have cited police involvement in extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, and torture, with corruption and collaboration with criminal groups at the municipal and state levels. Federal forces, including the Federal Police, have also been implicated in serious abuses, particularly targeting individuals in preventive detention. The Calder\u00f3n government in Mexico implemented measures to combat police corruption and human rights abuses, including increased vetting of federal forces, creation of a national police registry, use of internal affairs units, and human rights training. New protocols on the use of force and detentions were announced in 2012 to prevent abuses. Efforts to reform municipal police forces have been slow, and there are concerns about the accountability of the Mexican military to civilian authorities. The Mexican military, less accountable than police, is reportedly committing more human rights abuses while carrying out public security functions. Reports show a significant increase in cases of torture, disappearances, and extrajudicial killings in states where federal authorities are fighting organized crime. Complaints of abuses by Mexico's National Defense Secretariat have risen, with a peak of 1800 in 2009 before slightly decreasing in 2011. The number of investigated abuses by SEDENA forces has also declined since 2008-2009, especially in areas with reduced deployments. Complaints of abuses against SEMAR reported to CNDH increased by 150% from 2010 to 2011 as its forces became more involved in anti-DTO efforts. Only a small percentage of allegations resulted in CNDH issuing recommendations for corrective action to SEDENA or SEMAR, which they have largely accepted. Mexican and international human rights groups criticize the government for not holding military and police officials accountable for past abuses. The Calder\u00f3n government took steps to comply with Inter-American rulings. The Calder\u00f3n government took steps to comply with Inter-American Court of Human Rights rulings by transferring some cases of military abuses against civilians to civilian courts. Despite efforts to accelerate transfers, most cases were still processed in the military justice system. Military prosecutors opened thousands of investigations into human rights abuses, but few resulted in convictions. Then-President Calder\u00f3n submitted a reform mandating certain human rights violations be investigated and prosecuted in civilian courts. The Mexican Senate's Justice Commission approved a bill in April 2012 to transfer cases of military human rights violations to civilian courts, but it was blocked from a vote. A reform of Article 57 of the military justice code is now more urgent, especially with the Supreme Court establishing legal precedent on jurisdiction. Human rights defenders and journalists are at risk from organized crime and corrupt authorities, with some being harassed, attacked, or killed. Increasing violent crimes against journalists in Mexico, with high levels of impunity, have made it the most dangerous country in the Western Hemisphere for journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented 58 murders and 10 disappearances of journalists since 2000. Threats from organized crime groups have led to fear among journalists, resulting in limited coverage of crime-related stories. Despite some government efforts to protect human rights defenders and journalists, many organizations have called for more action. The Calder\u00f3n government established a special prosecutor within the Attorney General's Office to attend to crimes against freedom of expression and created mechanisms to provide increased protection for journalists and human rights defenders. The Mexican Congress enacted laws to make crimes against journalists a federal offense and require the federal government to provide protection to journalists and human rights defenders at risk. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto signed a law to track victims of organized crime and provide assistance to them and their families. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto signed the \"victims' law\" in January 2013, which was well-received by organizations. The real test of his government's commitment to human rights lies in the implementation of this and other laws. In 2008, Congress debated adding human rights conditions to M\u00e9rida assistance, with stricter conditions later implemented in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012. The FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act had less stringent human rights conditions than initially proposed. The funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative had less stringent human rights conditions than initially proposed, due to Mexico's concerns about violating national sovereignty. Conditions required withholding 15% of assistance until Mexico takes action in four human rights areas. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act does not include the conditions on aid to Mexico that were in previous appropriations measures. It is uncertain if the FY2013 appropriations measure will include similar human rights conditions. The FY2013 foreign operations appropriations measure S. 3241 (S.Rept. 112-172) includes conditions related to torture and requires Mexico to reform its military justice code. The State Department has submitted progress reports on Mexico to release M\u00e9rida funds, but has held back funding pending further progress in key areas. The State Department withheld funds in FY2012 and FY2013 until progress was made in transparency and combating impunity in Mexico. Approximately $18 million in FY2012 funding was held back until human rights challenges were addressed, including improving civilian institutions, enforcing prohibitions against torture, and protecting human rights defenders. The State Department has initiated a high-level human rights dialogue with Mexico, provided training for security forces, and implemented various human rights programs. USAID has provided funding for human rights programs in Mexico, including support for civil society groups monitoring abuses by security forces. Congress may consider increasing funding for human rights training programs for military and police. Policy makers are likely to monitor Mexico's efforts to address past human rights abuses and prevent new ones. Mexico is the leading country of origin for U.S. legal permanent residents and unauthorized immigrants. Mexican immigrants are exempt from immigration limits due to their relationship with U.S. citizens. In 2010, Mexicans made up 62% of unauthorized aliens in the U.S. The unauthorized migration flow from Mexico started to decline in mid-2006. Mexican migration flows, particularly unauthorized ones, began declining in mid-2006 and have continued on a downward trajectory. Data estimates show that the net rate of unauthorized migration from Mexico to the United States is near zero. Factors contributing to this decline include the U.S. recession, increased border security, abuses by smugglers, and job opportunities in Mexico. Emigration flows may increase with U.S. economic growth, but future flows may be smaller as young Mexicans feel less pressure to emigrate for work. Mexico plays a unique role in international migration as both a source of emigrants and immigrants. Mexico is a key player in international migration, serving as a source, transit, and destination country for migrants. Unauthorized migration through Mexico, mainly from Central America to the U.S., peaked in 2005 but has since declined due to various factors, including fears of criminal victimization. Mexico's lack of a cohesive migration policy in the past contributed to the high number of Mexican citizens leaving for the U.S. without proper documentation. In the late 1990s, increasing emigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border led the Mexican government to take a more active approach to migration issues. Vicente Fox's election in 2000 prioritized reaching a U.S.-Mexico immigration agreement, but efforts faded after the 9/11 attacks. In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Mexican government supported comprehensive immigration reform in the United States. The Mexican Congress passed a resolution in 2006 acknowledging shared responsibility for legal emigration and border security. The Calder\u00f3n Administration made efforts to overhaul Mexico's migration policies between 2006 and 2011. In 2007, Mexico criminalized human trafficking at the federal level, with all states enacting anti-trafficking reforms by 2010. In 2008, the General Population Act was reformed to decriminalize simple migration offenses, imposing fines and voluntary repatriation for unauthorized migrants. The Calder\u00f3n government announced a new strategy in 2008, investing over $200 million to improve security, modernize customs, and promote development in the southern border region. In 2010, Mexico passed a law to increase penalties for alien smuggling, focusing on abuses by public officials. Efforts to identify and punish corrupt officials who mistreat migrants have progressed more at the federal level. Mexico's recent migratory reform efforts, including a new immigration law approved in 2011, aim to protect migrants' rights, simplify immigration procedures, promote family reunification, and improve migration management to prevent abuses by public officials. The 2011 immigration law in Mexico aims to protect migrants' rights, simplify procedures, promote family reunification, and prevent abuses by public officials and organized crime groups. Key provisions include access to education, healthcare, and justice for migrants, limiting detention to 15 days, legal status for government \"Beta Groups,\" and special treatment for vulnerable groups. The law also gives legal authority to the National Institute of Migration (INM) to enforce immigration policy and restricts document verification to federal officials. Since the mid-2000s, the Mexican government has supported comprehensive immigration reform in the United States, addressing border security, enforcement of immigration laws, employment verification, temporary worker programs, permanent admissions, and unauthorized aliens. Despite President Obama's commitment, immigration reform was not a priority for the 112th Congress. Bills like S. 1258 and DREAM Act bills were introduced but not considered. The 112th Congress did pass some measures on immigration-related topics. On June 15, 2012, the Obama Administration announced certain protections for individuals brought to the US as children. On June 15, 2012, the Obama Administration announced that certain individuals brought to the United States as children would be eligible for deferred action for two years, allowing them to apply for employment authorization. This action did not grant them legal immigration status. Former President Calder\u00f3n did not promise to affect immigration reform efforts in the U.S. Congress or reach a bilateral accord with the Obama Administration, learning from former President Vicente Fox's failed attempt in 2001. Incoming President Pe\u00f1a Nieto pledged his full support for President Obama. Incoming President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has pledged full support for President Obama's comprehensive reform efforts, including improving border security, enforcing migration policies humanely, creating jobs to discourage illegal emigration, and protesting excessive force by U.S. agents on the border. Mexico's oil and gas production is crucial for economic stability and U.S. energy security, with PEMEX struggling to counter declining oil production. Mexico's oil and gas production is vital for economic stability and U.S. energy security. PEMEX, the country's main source of government revenue, has been facing a decline in oil production since 2004. Policy experts recommend reducing fiscal burdens on PEMEX and allowing joint ventures with foreign oil companies. However, concerns about private involvement threatening Mexico's control over natural resources have hindered reform efforts. Limited reforms were enacted in 2008 under the Calder\u00f3n Administration. The 2008 reforms allowed PEMEX to create service contracts with private companies to increase production and reserves. However, experts believe further reforms are needed to attract foreign investment for deep-water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. While PEMEX is expected to increase production and reserves, it faces challenges in finding new wells and engineering capacity. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto aims to enact energy reforms in 2013, but may face opposition in the Mexican Congress. Some suggest he may first focus on making PEMEX's budget more independent and reducing its tax burden before pushing for greater private cooperation. The United States and Mexico have been collaborating on geothermal energy projects since the 1970s. President Obama and Mexican President Calder\u00f3n announced the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change in 2009 to jointly develop clean energy sources. The goals include enhancing renewable energy, combating climate change, and overseeing 10 new projects related to wind and solar energy. Meetings were held in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to advance the Framework. The United States and Mexico have collaborated on geothermal energy projects since the 1970s. President Obama and Mexican President Calder\u00f3n announced the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change in 2009 to develop clean energy sources. USAID and Mexico signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen cooperation on environmental issues, including reducing emissions from the energy sector. Discussions on managing exploration in a marine area straddling the U.S.-Mexico border have been ongoing since the 1970s. In 2001, the United States and Mexico agreed on a moratorium on exploration and drilling in a marine area along their border to study the geology and geophysical characteristics. In 2010, they announced plans to develop trans-boundary resources, leading to the Trans-boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement in 2012. The United States and Mexico announced the Trans-boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, a step towards managing resources in the Gulf of Mexico. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the agreement as a move towards a sustainable energy trading relationship. The Mexican Senate approved the agreement in April 2012, with the Mexican Presidency completing domestic requirements in May 2012. The Department of State is leading the U.S. review process. The United States is facing a procedural question on how to accept the Trans-boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement with Mexico. The 113th Congress needs to decide whether it should be treated as a treaty or a Congressional-Executive Agreement. Key questions include the potential legal and regulatory obligations for U.S. interests, the impact on existing environmental laws and lease terms in the Gulf of Mexico, and any fiscal implications. The United States and Mexico have a strong economic relationship through NAFTA, with trade quadrupling since its implementation in 1994. Mexico is the third-largest source of U.S. imports and the second-largest export market. U.S. foreign direct investment in Mexico has also significantly increased. The 113th Congress is considering the Trans-boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement with Mexico, which raises questions about legal obligations, environmental impact in the Gulf of Mexico, and fiscal implications. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico increased from $17 billion in 1994 to $91.4 billion in 2011, a 440% rise. Studies indicate that NAFTA had small but positive economic effects on the U.S. and Mexican economies. Congress has monitored NAFTA's implementation, economic effects, and trade dispute resolutions. Mexico's participation in TPP negotiations is expected to attract congressional attention. NAFTA institutions like the Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC) and the Commission for Labor Cooperation (CLC) have been operational since 1994. The Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank) were established to promote and finance environmental projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. NADBank's mandate was expanded in 2004 to provide grants and loans for environmental infrastructure, and in 2011 to include clean energy projects. There are discussions about further broadening NADBank's functions to include other types of infrastructure development. Since 2005, NAFTA trucking provisions have been disputed periodically. In 2009, Congress terminated a pilot program allowing Mexican trucks in the US, leading to Mexico imposing tariffs on US products worth $2.4 billion in exports. Subsequent appropriations acts did not include language prohibiting Mexican trucks from operating in the US. In 2011, a pilot project was established for Mexican trucks to operate in the United States, resolving the long-standing NAFTA trucking dispute. The Obama Administration released a concept document for the program, leading to a formal agreement with Mexico in July 2011. The first Mexican truck entered the US in October 2011, prompting Mexico to end all retaliatory tariffs on US exports. Some Members of Congress oppose Mexican trucks in the US due to safety concerns, while others argue that Mexico's tariffs harm US industries. The Clinton Administration lifted the embargo on Mexican tuna in 2000, but a court ruled the dolphin-safe label standards were not met. Under the Bush Administration, the Commerce Department allowed the dolphin-safe label with qualified observer certification. On December 31, 2002, the dolphin-safe label could be used if no dolphins were harmed during netting, leading to a lawsuit by environmental groups. The U.S. District Court blocked the Commerce Department's modification on April 10, 2003. In August 2004, the court ruled against the Bush Administration's changes, reinstating the original standards. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision in April 2007, citing a lack of scientific basis. Mexico then took the issue to the World Trade Organization in late October 2008. In late October 2008, Mexico initiated WTO dispute proceedings against the United States regarding dolphin-safe standards for Mexican tuna exporters. The WTO panel ruled in September 2011 that U.S. standards were not discriminatory but more trade restrictive than necessary. In September 2010, the U.S. requested a NAFTA dispute resolution panel for the same issue. Another trade issue emerged in 2012 over bilateral tomato trade. The U.S. Department of Commerce is considering ending a suspension agreement with Mexican tomato growers, which could lead to antidumping tariffs on Mexican tomato exports. Negotiators are working on a revised agreement to comply with U.S. antidumping laws. President Obama invited Mexico to join negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) invited Mexico and Canada to join negotiations for a regional free trade agreement. The TPP aims to liberalize trade in goods and services beyond WTO commitments. The agreement was outlined at the APEC ministerial in 2011 and could eliminate trade barriers among parties. The proposed TPP could enhance trade links between Mexico, the United States, and Canada under NAFTA by reducing barriers and addressing key issues like agriculture, intellectual property rights, and government procurement. Mexico agreed to high standards and conditions set by TPP countries for entry into negotiations. Mexico cannot reopen existing agreements made by TPP partners unless they agree to revisit them. TPP has closed one chapter out of 26. Legislation funded government programs, including foreign assistance to Mexico, at reduced levels. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) funds government programs, including foreign aid to Mexico, for FY2012. 15% of assistance to Mexican military and police is subject to human rights conditions, requiring investigation of abuses in civilian courts and prohibiting evidence from torture. Restrictions do not apply to promoting transparency, anti-corruption, and rule of law within military and police forces. Conferees express support for the Obama Administration's efforts. The conferees support the Obama Administration's request for Mexico, including funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative. They direct the Secretary of State to report on U.S. programs aiding judicial and police reform in Mexico and call for a border security strategy with Mexico. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes continued support for counter-drug activities in Mexico through FY2014. The Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act of 2012, Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2012, and Jaime Zapata Border Enforcement Security Task Force Act were signed into law in 2012 to address aviation smuggling, tighten regulations on smuggling tunnels, and enhance border enforcement security. The Security Task Force Act, signed into law in December 2012, provides statutory authority for the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program within ICE and authorizes funding for FY2012-FY2016. The Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 requires the State Department to submit a strategy to counter Iran's presence in the Western Hemisphere, including in Mexico and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, FY2013, introduced in September 2012, funds government programs through March 27, 2013."
