It hit Rangoon with winds up to 190 kph and affected the low-lying agricultural delta region. The disaster overwhelmed the authorities in Burma, prompting international assistance offers. The Cyclone Nargis struck Burma on May 2, 2008, causing widespread destruction. Despite offers of international assistance, aid agencies faced challenges in obtaining visas for relief workers, hindering immediate relief efforts. The death toll quickly rose to over 22,500, highlighting the urgent need for aid. The political situation in Burma, including controversy over a constitutional referendum and the extension of Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest, could potentially lead to significant political change. The death toll from Cyclone Nargis in Burma quickly rose to over 22,500, with 41,000 people reported as missing. Official figures were later revised to 84,537 dead and 53,836 missing. Most deaths were due to a storm surge. Information about the disaster was difficult to confirm due to damage to transportation and communication systems. The final death toll remains uncertain, with unofficial estimates exceeding government figures. The death toll from Cyclone Nargis in Burma rose to over 100,000, with some estimates exceeding 138,000. The United Nations reported 2.4 million people affected and significant damage in various regions of Burma. The State Peace and Development Council declared a state of emergency in five regions but later lifted it for most areas affected by the cyclone. The cyclone in Burma caused extensive damage, with only seven townships in Irrawaddy Division and 40 in Yangon Division declared emergency disaster zones. Loss of life, injuries, displacement, and destruction of houses, hospitals, and buildings were reported. Several hundred thousand people were left homeless, villages were destroyed, flooding was widespread, and infrastructure like electricity, water facilities, roads, and bridges were severely affected. The cyclone in Burma caused extensive damage, with telecommunications disrupted and a significant number of navy ships sunk. Speculation suggests that the removal of mangrove forests worsened the impact of the cyclone. The destruction of mangrove forests for shrimp and fish farms may have contributed to the severity of the damage. Experts believe that preserving mangrove forests could have mitigated the damage caused by Cyclone Nargis. The cyclone in Burma caused significant damage, impacting the nation's food sources such as rice, seafood, pork, and poultry. The U.N. FAO reported that the affected states provided a large portion of Burma's agricultural products. The SPDC accepted international assistance after the cyclone, allocating $5 million for relief efforts. Food shortages were anticipated in the coming months. The government in Burma allocated $5 million for relief efforts after the cyclone, but the military junta faced criticism for not issuing a warning about the approaching storm. Military and police units conducted rescue operations, but the scale of the disaster overwhelmed their capacity. The Emergency Committee coordinated national response efforts, with the Ministry of Social Welfare leading the relief response. Widespread criticism was directed at the junta for their management of the disaster. Meteorologists in India gave Burma 48 hours warning before Cyclone Nargis hit the country, but state media notices failed to indicate the severity of the approaching storm. The SPDC either underappreciated or intentionally downplayed the cyclone's impact. The SPDC underplayed the cyclone's impact, focusing relief efforts on areas where officials and military personnel lived. Local officials were accused of stealing relief supplies, and merchants engaged in disaster profiteering by raising prices significantly. Food prices, particularly for vegetables and eggs, increased by 100 percent after Cyclone Nargis. The SPDC faced criticism for hindering the entry of international relief organizations into Burma, viewing them as \"neocolonialist tools.\" The military junta was accused of not wanting a large influx of aid workers before a constitutional referendum. Challenges post-cyclone included transportation issues, blocked roads, and damaged infrastructure. The aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in Burma resulted in a general lack of transportation, blocked roads, poor communication systems, damaged infrastructure, and difficulties in reaching remote areas. Lack of electricity, clean water, and fuel shortages were major problems affecting 4.7 million people. The United Nations estimated that up to 2.4 million people were affected, with 2 million in need of prioritized assistance. In-depth assessments were delayed, hindering a detailed understanding of the situation on the ground. Immediate needs included food, clean water, and shelter. The relief effort in Burma post-Cyclone Nargis required plastic sheeting, water purification equipment, cooking sets, mosquito nets, emergency health kits, and food. Distribution challenges arose due to access issues with the Burmese government and local destruction. Recovery efforts were expected to last six months, with concerns about potential food shortages and a shift towards long-term needs by some agencies. International aid faced delays in visas and inadequate distribution nearly three weeks after the cyclone hit. Three weeks after Cyclone Nargis struck Burma, delays in visa issuance and inadequate aid distribution remained significant obstacles to relief efforts. The military junta insisted they could handle the situation without outside experts, despite offers of assistance from various countries. International aid agencies were still waiting for visas to enter Burma, while the United Nations and aid organizations were preparing staff in Bangkok for deployment. Initially, only a small number of foreign aid workers were allowed in, with plans to permit 160 more from neighboring Asian countries. The government of Burma promised to allow international aid relief staff into the country, including access to the Irrawaddy Delta area. Increased access has enabled a massive international relief effort to move ahead, albeit slowly. U.S. and British ships with relief supplies can enter the port of Rangoon to transfer supplies to local boats, but military ships are not permitted. Access has enabled a massive international relief effort to move ahead in Burma, with over 230 international staff granted visas and more than 200 UN staff in affected areas. Some report improved logistical arrangements, while others find access challenging. ASEAN's role in creating diplomatic links and access to Burma has been significant. ASEAN played a crucial role in coordinating international assistance for Burma after Cyclone Nargis, forming the Tripartite Core Group with the government of Burma and the United Nations. They deployed an Emergency Rapid Assessment Team and set up a field office in Rangoon to support humanitarian efforts. The Secretary-General of ASEAN, Dr. Surn Pitsuwan, chairs the Task Force overseeing the coordination of international assistance. The coordination effort for international assistance in Burma is working well, with ASEAN offering aid and establishing a fund for disaster assistance. New operating guidelines were issued for aid agencies, but Burmese authorities agreed to revert back to the old system for handling travel authorizations. Local authorities in Bogalay and Laputta are looking to relocate displaced individuals. Local authorities in the delta townships of Bogalay and Laputta are planning to relocate thousands of displaced individuals due to being on park land or for reconstruction efforts. Reports have emerged about restrictions on survivors fleeing to the Thai border. The TCG is conducting a comprehensive needs assessment in the cyclone-affected areas, focusing on humanitarian needs and damage assessment. Initial data confirms the need for continued relief assistance. The PONJA Report findings on relief assistance needs, including food and water shortages, housing damage, and psychological stress, will be published in mid-July. The data will inform the United Nations' revised Humanitarian Flash Appeal and a possible second pledging conference. Efforts by the government, Myanmar Red Cross Society, and NGOs have reached 1.3 million people, but only one third of the population in severely affected areas has been reached. Discussions will focus on managing the transition to reconstruction. The United Nations and various organizations are working to provide assistance in severely affected areas. Only about one third of the population has been reached, but efforts are ongoing to support communities. The United Nations deployed a Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team (UNDAC) and various U.N. agencies are providing assistance on the ground. The World Food Program (WFP) is operating helicopters for food delivery. The WFP is providing assistance with helicopters for food distribution. U.N. staff, including local Burmese, are not restricted by travel limitations. Relief supplies and food are being distributed from stockpiles in the country and Rangoon. UNHCR is also providing basic supplies and shelter materials from warehouses in Thailand. Various humanitarian relief sectors have been organized in clusters, addressing issues such as agriculture, child protection, education, shelter, telecommunications, food assistance, health, logistics, nutrition, and water/sanitation. The World Health Organization is particularly concerned about potential health problems like malaria and cholera following the cyclone's flooding. The first case of cholera post-cyclone was reported on May 9, 2008. Emergency health kits provided as part of a wide-ranging health care response, including immunization campaigns. No major disease outbreaks reported so far, but the threat remains serious. International NGOs continue to assist with relief efforts in affected areas. Former airport in Thailand used as a humanitarian staging area for extra warehousing. The humanitarian staging area at Don Muang in Thailand is facilitating relief flights to Rangoon. The IFRC is working with the MRCS to provide emergency shelter and clean water to cyclone survivors. An initial allocation of 200,000 Swiss francs is being used for relief efforts, with a revised emergency appeal for Burma totaling $50.8 million. Coordination efforts are in place with the ICRC, and as of June 20, 327,500 beneficiaries have received assistance. France's foreign minister suggested delivering aid without waiting for approval from Burma. The United Nations should deliver aid to Burma without waiting for approval, under the Responsibility to Protect resolution. Some argue that the Burmese government is failing to protect its citizens, while others question if international assistance should be forced upon them. The SPDC is currently in charge of aid efforts, and the UN should support their efforts. The UN is cautious about confronting the Burmese government, preferring constructive discussions over a confrontational approach. The UN Security Council has postponed discussing the humanitarian crisis. Activist monks called for charges against Burma's junta leader for obstructing relief supplies. The European Parliament warned of potential charges if aid delivery was obstructed further. The international community has pledged millions in aid for cyclone victims in Burma, with concerns about transparency in aid usage. The UN issued a Flash Appeal for $202 million to support over 1.5 million affected people, 65% funded as of June 16. As of June 16, the appeal for cyclone victims in Burma is 65% funded, with $131 million in contributions and $24 million in pledges. The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund has increased its initial $10 million to $22 million. A revised flash appeal will be released on July 10, covering the period from May 2008 to April 2009. The ASEAN-UN donor conference in Rangoon agreed on the need for increased relief efforts and support for coordination by ASEAN and the UN. The Burmese government stated that $11 billion is required for reconstruction and recovery efforts. The government of Burma stated that $11 billion is needed for reconstruction and recovery efforts. The U.S. Embassy in Burma provided $250,000 in humanitarian assistance, with an additional $3 million pledged by the White House. Contributions and pledges from the private sector and international community were also significant. The U.S. provided $16.25 million in aid for Burma, with a total of $41.17 million in humanitarian funding. The U.S. government airbridge completed 185 airlifts delivering relief supplies. Initial reports suggested aid was conditional on allowing a U.S. Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) into the country, which was later denied. The U.S. allocated funds for emergency materials in Burma, including shelter, food, and water. President Bush offered U.S. Navy personnel for search and rescue efforts. U.S. airlifts of relief materials have been flown from Thailand to Rangoon. A USAID-DART team has been assembled in Thailand. U.S. naval assets are on standby off the Burmese coast. General License No. 14 was issued to allow financial transactions for humanitarian activities. Under General License No. 14, the U.S. government and humanitarian organizations can legally transfer funds to Burma for cyclone disaster relief. The U.S. is a leader in providing relief efforts for humanitarian disasters, with the President having authority to offer emergency assistance. Humanitarian assistance is defined broadly to respond quickly and save lives during disasters. The U.S. government provides humanitarian assistance through various agencies like USAID and OFDA, coordinating with international organizations and governments to deliver relief materials and personnel for urgent needs during disasters. OFDA is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance and can quickly assemble DARTs to assess conditions. It has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel from other parts of USAID and other federal agencies. USAID also administers emergency food aid under FFP and provides relief and development food aid. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance, focusing on short-term peace and democratization projects. DoD's OHDACA funds three humanitarian programs. OHDACA funds humanitarian programs like HAP, HMA, and FDR/ER, providing support in emergency situations by offering food, shelter, medical evacuations, and defense equipment. The President can utilize the Denton program for transportation of humanitarian goods. OFDA and DoD provide emergency assistance for 30 to 90 days post-disaster, with ongoing support through USAID's country development programs. The State Department administers humanitarian relief programs for refugees and displaced populations through funds like ERMA and MRA. PRM bureau assists refugees globally, including conflict victims and IDPs. Humanitarian assistance covers basic needs and community services. A cyclone hit Burma before a significant political event. The cyclone in Burma before a major political event in 2008 led to conflicting reports on the referendum's turnout and voting irregularities. The SPDC announced a delay in voting for some townships, with opposition groups alleging voter intimidation and pre-marked ballots. On May 29, 2008, the SPDC announced that 98.12% of eligible voters had participated in the referendum, with 92.48% voting in favor of the new constitution. Opposition to holding the referendum as scheduled grew after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma, with calls for postponement due to the regime's inadequate response to the disaster. The National League for Democracy demanded a simultaneous referendum in all parts of Burma once conditions improved. The SPDC announced plans for a National Referendum in May 2008 and general elections in 2010. At least 50% of eligible voters must participate for the new constitution to pass. The SPDC in Burma released a new law governing the approval of the draft constitution, with over 27 million eligible voters. Certain groups were barred from voting, and provisions allowed for postponement or dissolution of a vote under certain circumstances. Opposition groups were concerned about potential suppression of anti-constitution campaigns. The SPDC in Burma conducted a pro-constitution campaign to suppress anti-constitution efforts. The military stated its aim to hand over power to the people, citing unavoidable circumstances for assuming state responsibilities. The referendum on the draft constitution aligned with the SPDC's roadmap for civilian rule. The SPDC urged citizens to vote 'Yes' in the national interest through slogans in newspapers. The SPDC in Burma actively suppressed anti-constitution efforts, with reports of harassment, violence, and assaults on opposition leaders. Access to the draft constitution was initially limited, with copies circulated secretly among journalists. The draft constitution in Burma was initially limited in access, but copies were later provided to the public for a fee. It creates a parliament with two chambers, with a quarter of the seats reserved for the military. The constitution also allows for a military takeover in emergencies and prohibits individuals with dual citizenship. The draft constitution in Burma prohibits individuals with dual citizenship from holding public office, affecting opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Opposition groups were unsure how to respond to the referendum announcement, with some debating whether to vote 'no' or boycott. The National League for Democracy called on the people to vote in the 2010 elections. The National League for Democracy (NLD) and United Nationalities League for Democracy (UNLD) urged people in Burma to vote \"no\" or boycott the constitutional referendum. Conflicting reports emerged about voting irregularities and turnout, with the junta claiming a fair process while opposition sources raised doubts. The New Light of Myanmar reported on the voting process on May 10, 2008, with foreign embassy representatives observing. The referendum was deemed successful with a high citizen turnout, but no specific voter participation percentage or results were provided. The military junta announced the outcome on May 14, 2008. The military junta announced the official results of the May 10 vote, claiming over 99% voter turnout with 92.4% in favor of the new constitution. The results were higher than rumored percentages, with over 20 million votes in favor. Rumors suggested the SPDC had already determined the outcome before the vote. The SPDC announced the final vote count for the constitutional referendum on May 29, 2008. The official results showed a decline in eligible voters and a high voter turnout of 98.12%, with 92.48% in favor of the new constitution. Opposition voices criticized the plebiscite, citing low turnout and voting irregularities on May 10. The NLD compiled a list of voting irregularities during the constitutional referendum, including distribution of pre-marked ballots, intimidation of voters, confiscation of identity cards, and denial of access to polling stations for opposition members. The NLD condemned the junta's decision to hold the constitutional referendum in cyclone-hit areas, calling for a postponement to focus on humanitarian work. The PILPG criticized the referendum as neither free nor fair in a report published on May 26, 2008. The PILPG report criticized Burma's constitutional referendum for not being free or fair, violating key conditions for a democratic election. President Bush expanded U.S. sanctions on Burma two days before Cyclone Nargis hit, in line with existing laws and Executive Orders. The U.S. sanctions on Burma include prohibiting imports, banning financial services exports, restricting investments, freezing assets of the Burmese government, and targeting specific enterprises and individuals. The U.S. sanctions on Burma include prohibiting imports, banning financial services exports, restricting investments, freezing assets of the Burmese government, and targeting specific enterprises and individuals. The U.S. policy under the Bush Administration has been to minimize contact with the military junta, isolate the SPDC, and support international pressure for human rights improvements in Burma. The U.S. actively opposes financial assistance to Burma and calls for a return to civilian rule. The State Department cited Burma for various human rights abuses in its 2008 report, including deprivation of life, torture, arbitrary arrest, denial of fair trial, detention of political prisoners, forced relocations, and restrictions on freedom of speech and religion. The Senate passed a resolution expressing support for the people of Burma and President Bush's decision to provide humanitarian aid after Cyclone Nargis. President Bush approved humanitarian aid for Burma after Cyclone Nargis, with a willingness to provide additional funds if needed. The House passed a resolution expressing sympathy for the Burmese people and demanding the cancellation of a referendum to focus on disaster relief. In 2007, both the House and Senate passed bills to ban the import of gemstones from Burma. The House and Senate passed bills to ban the import of gemstones from Burma, with additional provisions in the House version targeting payments to the Burmese government. Consultations are ongoing to reconcile differences between the two versions of the bill. Representative Rush D. Holt introduced a resolution condemning the Burmese regime's undemocratic constitution and scheduled referendum. The resolution denounces the SPDC's act to legalize military rule with the constitution in Burma and urges action through the UN Security Council and ASEAN. The House passed the resolution with overwhelming support, and there were calls for ASEAN to facilitate a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma. Legislation was introduced to award Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. The Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi, with the House and Senate passing the bill unanimously. The tightening of U.S. sanctions on Burma, coupled with Cyclone Nargis, increased pressure on the ruling military junta. Key issues for Congress included humanitarian aid, the constitutional referendum, potential food shortages, and political instability in Burma. Humanitarian emergencies in Burma can arise from natural disasters or conflict. U.S. and international assistance play a crucial role in relief operations and broader foreign policy issues. Natural disasters impact millions of people annually, requiring prolonged urgent aid. Responses to natural disasters are typically multilateral and less affected by politics. In contrast, responses to conflicts are intertwined with foreign policy developments and may lack a clear overall strategy. The situation in Burma highlights the complexities of humanitarian response in conflict-affected regions. The response to natural disasters in Burma is influenced by political developments, hindering relief operations. There are concerns that increased international assistance could challenge the authoritarian system in Burma. The SPDC is hesitant to accept offers of international humanitarian experts. Humanitarian assistance typically receives bipartisan support in the United States. The US is a major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters, but funding pledges may deplete disaster accounts, requiring replenishment to maintain capacity. Finding resources for aid pledges amid budget deficits and competing priorities may pose challenges. The Senate passed S.Res. 554 in 2008, calling for additional funds if necessary to address dire humanitarian needs. President Bush signed into law P.L. 110-252 on June 30, 2008, providing funding for urgent humanitarian assistance worldwide, including support for critical needs in Burma after Cyclone Nargis. The law also directs the Department of State and USAID to avoid providing assistance to or through the SPDC due to their failure to respond to the crisis. After Cyclone Nargis hit Burma in May 2008, the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the planned constitutional referendum and urging the SPDC to engage in political dialogue with opposition groups. The Senate did not pass any legislation related to the referendum. Experts predict a severe food shortage in the country for up to two years due to the destruction of important food-producing regions. It is uncertain if Burma can replace lost food production domestically or through imports. After Cyclone Nargis hit Burma in May 2008, causing severe destruction to food-producing regions, it is uncertain if Burma can import enough food to replace its lost domestic output. The country may require food assistance for months or even years, with reports of food prices increasing by 100% or more in the aftermath of the cyclone. The higher food prices, combined with the existing poverty levels in Burma, will likely place more strain on the population. The widespread protests in Burma in September 2007 started against fuel price increases. Congress may need to provide long-term food assistance and consider changes to sanctions laws. Public dissatisfaction with the government's response to the cyclone, rejection of the proposed constitution, and food shortages could threaten the ruling military junta's political survival. The constitutional plebiscite results are seen as fraudulent by opposition groups and the general population. The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi was extended by the SPDC, leading to increased political tensions and public demonstrations in Burma. International leaders, including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President Bush, expressed concern and called for an end to restrictions on political figures in the country. President Bush expressed deep concern over the extended detention of Aung San Suu Kyi by the SPDC in Burma. He urged the release of political prisoners and called for dialogue with democratic groups. There is a debate in Congress on increasing political pressure on the SPDC, with some advocating for ramping up sanctions and seeking UN involvement. Resolving differences in legislation could build upon existing measures like Executive Order 13464. Forwarding the legislation to the President would build upon Executive Order 13464. New congressional sanctions could hinder the SPDC from accepting U.S. aid and may be used to garner support through nationalist appeals. The effectiveness of changes in U.S. sanctions on Burma will depend on the SPDC's ability to withstand political challenges, including maintaining support among soldiers and relying on the paramilitary group USDA. The USDA, with nearly 23 million members, is known for violent acts against opposition groups in Burma. They have organized \"people's militias\" involved in attacks on opposition leaders. It remains to be seen if they will continue to support the military junta during post-Nargis civil unrest. Political changes within the SPDC have been observed since Cyclone Nargis and the constitutional referendum. The Minister of Immigration and Population has been replaced by Vice Admiral Soe Thien as Minister for Industry-2. Major General Nyan Tun is set to replace Soe Thien as the navy's commander in chief. Five top SPDC lieutenant generals were asked to retire, and junior officers were promoted in a restructuring. There are speculations of a power struggle for Than Shwe's successor between General Shwe Mann and Lieutenant General Myint Swe within the SPDC. Some analysts view the recent changes as a punishment for those who failed to act after the cyclone. The recent changes in Burma's government include the replacement of officials who failed to act after the cyclone, such as Vice Admiral Soe Thien being removed as head of the navy. Buddhist monks and nuns have played a significant role in organizing disaster relief efforts, despite attempts by the SPDC to prevent their involvement. Their popularity may have increased since Cyclone Nargis, as they were barred from voting on the constitutional referendum. Buddhist monks and nuns in Burma may use their strong popular support to oppose the oppressive military junta through political action in the constitutional referendum."
