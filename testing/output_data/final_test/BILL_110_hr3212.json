    "content": "SECTION 1. TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. The text chunk discusses the elimination of certain personnel management authorities under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. It states that section 111(d) of the Act will be repealed, any related personnel management systems will terminate, and TSA employees will be subject to a uniform personnel management system. The Secretary will ensure uniform treatment of all TSA employees under the personnel management system described in subsection (e)(1) of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. Section 9701(b) of title 5, United States Code, will be amended to provide for uniform treatment of TSA employees. The 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 mandates that measures for subsection (e)(1) and (e)(2) systems take effect 90 days after enactment. The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The report mandated by the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 requires a description and comparison of the pay systems for TSA employees, along with any proposed changes under regulations. The Government Accountability Office considers appropriate matters. The term \"TSA employee\" refers to individuals holding positions transferred from the Transportation Security Administration to the Department of Homeland Security. The personnel management system is described. Personnel Management System Described includes any system applying to TSA employees under section 114(n) of title 49, United States Code, and any human resources management system under chapter 97 of title 5, United States Code."
