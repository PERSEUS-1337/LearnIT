The proposed changes to the section include removing certain phrases and adding a rule of construction to clarify the authority of governmental entities in using subpoenas for electronic communication disclosure.

The term 'United States person' refers to a citizen or lawful permanent resident. The term 'Law Enforcement Cooperation Agreement' includes mutual legal assistance treaties or agreements for obtaining electronic communication contents. The Attorney General maintains a list of countries with which the US has agreements for communication under section 2703(a)(1)(A)(iii). The term 'Central Authority' refers to the agency responsible for administering Law Enforcement Cooperation Agreements. 'National of a foreign country' includes citizens, lawful residents, or entities organized under foreign laws. The Act does not expand the investigative authority of any governmental entity. SEC. 4. MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY REFORMS.

Annual statistics on the number of MLAT requests made by the Department of Justice must be published, including the average processing times for both foreign governments and the Department of Justice. The Attorney General is required to notify the Secretary of State within 7 days of disclosing electronic communications. The Attorney General may issue a request for disclosure of electronic communications content to a foreign government under an MLAT request. When obtaining information from a provider based on an MLAT request, the Attorney General must notify the provider in writing that the request is made under a mutual legal assistance treaty. Congress believes that data localization requirements imposed by foreign governments on data providers are incompatible with the borderless nature of the Internet, hinder online innovation, and are unnecessary for law enforcement needs. The Department of Justice, State Department, and U.S. Trade Representatives should advocate for open data flow policies with foreign nations."
