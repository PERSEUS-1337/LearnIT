    "content": "On December 16, 2014, the President signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 into law. The legislation had been passed by the House on December 11, 2014, and by the Senate on December 13, 2014. In November 2014, the Administration submitted amendments to its FY2015 budget request to address the Ebola crisis and the threat posed by the Islamic State (IS), requesting an additional $2.89 billion in emergency funding through international affairs accounts. The FY2015 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs request totaled $53.50 billion. A Continuing Resolution (CR) was passed due to the inability to pass regular appropriations bills before the fiscal year ended. The CR, signed into law on September 19, 2014, funded government agencies at a reduced rate through December 11, 2014, with exceptions for OCO funds. Anomalies included a provision allowing the Department of State to exceed operation rates in certain accounts. The FY2015 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs request totaled $53.50 billion. Two additional CRs\u2014P.L. 113-202 and H.J.Res. 131\u2014kept the government funded until the full-year appropriations bill was signed into law. An OCO Amendment in June requested an additional $1.35 billion for peacekeeping and counterterrorism activities. Senate and House Appropriations Committees introduced and passed SFOPS appropriations for FY2015. The Committee introduced and passed an FY2015 SFOPS appropriation, H.R. 5013, recommending total funding of $48.45 billion. Hearings were held with Secretary of State John Kerry and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah testifying before various committees. Deputy Secretary of State Heather Higginbottom also testified regarding the amended OCO request. The Obama Administration submitted its original FY2015 budget request for International Affairs to Congress on March 4, 2014. The request included $17.09 billion for State Department Operations, a 7.8% increase from FY2014. For Foreign Operations, $32.99 billion was requested, a 2.2% decrease from FY2014. These funds support various U.S. foreign affairs programs and activities. The amended FY2015 foreign affairs request aimed to increase overall SFOPS funding by 8.8%, with State Department activities increasing by 8.3% and foreign aid activities by 7.7%. The amended request also included a 14.6% OCO portion and 5% designated for emergency Ebola funding. Additionally, the Administration proposed a new Initiative for further funding opportunities in a budget-neutral manner. The FY2015 foreign affairs budget request included $7.785 billion for OCO, doubling the previous year's request. The Administration aimed to expand OCO use to support the Syrian opposition and refugees, as well as for a Peacekeeping Response Mechanism. The House committee bill included $5.9 billion in OCO funds with a plan to phase them out over time. The House Appropriations Committee and Senate proposed OCO funds beyond Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan for various purposes including counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and humanitarian crises in the Middle East and North Africa. The final FY2015 appropriation included $9.26 billion for OCO, with additional funding to counter the Islamic State. Congress had previously passed emergency supplemental appropriations for international affairs between FY2006 and FY2010. Between FY2006 and FY2010, emergency supplemental appropriations were provided for international affairs, primarily for civilian activities related to U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In FY2012, the Administration requested $8.7 billion for foreign affairs OCO funds for frontline states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress appropriated $11.2 billion for various uses including Peacekeeping Operations in Somalia and Economic Support Funds for Somalia and Yemen. The FY2015 OCO request was nearly 95% of the FY2012 enacted amount. The Administration's foreign affairs budget since FY2012 has distinguished between \"enduring\" or \"base\" funding and funding for overseas support. In recent years, Congress has provided significant funding for overseas contingency operations (OCO) in foreign affairs, surpassing the Obama Administration's requests. The OCO designation has budget implications and has been used for various countries and activities beyond Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Obama Administration proposed a $56 billion fund divided between defense and nondefense expenditures, offset by spending cuts and closed tax loopholes. The initiative aimed to provide additional funding for foreign affairs priorities restricted by sequestration, including $350 million for the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Obama Administration proposed a $56 billion fund divided between defense and nondefense expenditures, offset by spending cuts and closed tax loopholes. The fund covered $350 million for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, $300 million for Global Health Programs, funds for Maternal and Child Health activities, $80 million for Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, $29.9 million for the Board for International Broadcasting's satellite transmission program, and support for USAID's Global Development Lab. The Obama Administration proposed a $56 billion fund for defense and nondefense expenditures, including funding for USAID's Global Development Lab. However, neither bills in the House, the Senate, nor the enacted legislation included funding for this proposal. The SFOPS 10-year funding trend shows a 48% increase in total foreign affairs funding from FY2006 to FY2012, with the peak year for enduring funding being FY2009. Despite a decline in total foreign affairs funding after FY2012, enduring funds increased slightly in FY2014. The recent decline in foreign affairs funding can be attributed to the Budget Control Act (BCA) and reduced presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2015-enacted level saw a slight decrease in enduring funds but peak funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. The Administration's FY2015 request aimed to increase funding for the State Department by 8.3% over FY2014 levels, with both enduring and OCO funding growing under the proposal. The FY2015 request included a $41 million emergency funding increase. Diplomatic and Consular Programs would grow by 4.5%, while Embassy Security funding would decrease by 14.8%. The \"Related Programs\" category faced a 21% cut in funding. The FY2015 budget request proposed significant cuts to funding for the East-West Center, the Asia Foundation, and National Endowment for Democracy. The House and Senate bills aimed to fully fund the Administration's request, with the House providing a 3% increase in funds and the Senate reducing funds by 2%. Both bills rejected proposed reductions to the \"Related Programs\" category, with the House even considering zeroing out funding for the East-West Center. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 reduced funding for Diplomatic Engagement by less than 2%. The ESCM account saw a reduction of over 13% from 2014 levels, while international peacekeeping operations and contributions to international organizations received a 15.7% increase. The funding enacted for this category was $906 million less than the Administration requested. The State Operations account request aimed to shift operational funding for frontline states from OCO to enduring funding accounts. The Department of State requested increased funding for State operations in Iraq in FY2015, citing the need for predictable funding streams for planning and operational purposes. The request included $250 million for a new permanent consulate in Basrah, a key oil industry hub. The FY2015 budget request for State Operations included funding for a new permanent consulate in Basrah, Iraq, and assumed a continued civilian presence in various parts of Afghanistan. The overall request was for $961 million, with a 15% increase over FY2014 levels but a 40% drop from FY2013. Pakistan's funding levels for State Operations would decrease by 5% under the FY2015 proposal. The FY2015 budget proposal includes a decrease in funding for Pakistan from $140.4 million to $120 million, with a shift towards long-term diplomatic efforts. Operational funding for Pakistan is declining due to completed infrastructure projects. House appropriators did not specify funding recommendations for frontline states, directing the Administration to refine its plans in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations. Afghanistan funding in the bill prohibits the use of funds for undisclosed positions or additional contractors. The Senate's provisions in S. 2499 required prior consultation and notification to the Committees on Appropriations for funds spent on new diplomatic facilities in frontline states. The bill did not provide funds for a New Consulate Compound in Basrah, Iraq, allowing the $250 million requested to be used for general security purposes or operations in Iraq. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) showed congressional interest in frontline states without specifying funding levels. It directed consultation with Committees on Appropriations for operations and assistance in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Specific measures included a ban on funding for a permanent U.S. consulate in Iraq without a land-use agreement and funding limitations for additional federal assistance. The FY2015 request included a 54% increase in funding for International Organizations accounts, totaling $4.50 billion. This funding also supported the U.N. Mission for Emergency Ebola Response with $35 million. The U.S. share of assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget is 22%, with other members contributing the remaining 78%. The increase in funding was mainly for peacekeeping purposes, including operations in Mali. The FY2015 request sought a 13.2% increase in funding for International Organizations accounts, totaling $1.5 billion. This increase was intended for peacekeeping purposes in various regions, excluding funds for UNESCO due to their decision to admit \"Palestine\" as a member. Administration officials planned to seek a waiver from Congress to fund UNESCO. The Administration's FY2015 request for Contributions to International Organizations sought a 13.2% increase in funding, totaling $1.5 billion. The Senate recommended all but roughly $2.45 million of the original request, expressing concerns about the Organization of American States' personnel practices and cost-cutting measures. The request included funding for U.S. assessed contributions to 11 U.N. peacekeeping operations and three international war crimes tribunals, as well as a $428 million Peacekeeping Response Mechanism to support urgent peacekeeping needs. The OCO funds requested for the PKRM would have allowed State to support contingency operations without taking funds from other peacekeeping efforts in progress or returning to Congress for off-cycle budgetary requests. House appropriators recommended funding the CIPA account at the FY2014 estimated level of $1.77 billion, while the Senate measure fully funded the Administration's request for $2.52 billion for assessed contributions to peacekeeping operations. The Senate committee recommended additional funding for the Complex Crisis Fund (CCF) and transfer authority for unanticipated peacekeeping requirements. The 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $1.47 billion for Contributions to International Organizations, with $74 million designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. This fell short of the Administration's request by $79 million. The CIPA account also fell short by about $400 million in FY2015. The FY2015 appropriations increased by 20% over FY2014 levels, falling short of the Administration's request by about $400 million. Efforts to enhance security for U.S. diplomats and facilities abroad, following the Benghazi attack, continue with funding for security personnel, technical tools, training, and facility upgrades. The FY2015 budget request included approximately $3.1 billion for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and $1.5 billion for Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU). The $986.5 million ESCM request for the Department of State's Capital Security Cost Sharing program is down from the previous year due to higher contributions from other agencies. The funding would support new diplomatic facilities in Sri Lanka, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Papua New Guinea, with an additional $44 million allocated for recurring costs for Diplomatic Security. The Department of State's FY2015 request includes $44 million for recurring costs to hire additional Diplomatic Security personnel after the Benghazi attacks. The funding is allocated for security programs, upgrades, and diplomatic security measures, with a significant portion transferred to the Worldwide Security Protection account for greater flexibility. Under the FY2015 request, 42% of the Department of State's operational funding would go to security-related accounts, a significant increase from previous years. The House appropriators fully funded the Administration's WSP request and exceeded the WSU request by $50 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee also fully funded the WSP request but did not allocate $250 million of WSU OCO funds for a New Consulate Compound in Basrah, Iraq, as requested. Instead, the funds were designated for general security purposes or operations. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 met the Administration's $3.1 billion request for Worldwide Security Protection funds, increasing the account by 12.7% over FY2014 levels. However, there was a 7.7% reduction in the $1.47 billion request for Worldwide Security Upgrades. The Department of State has faced chronic personnel shortages, especially in frontline states, with mid-level Foreign Service officers being particularly scarce. The State Department has faced chronic personnel shortages, especially in frontline states, with mid-level Foreign Service officers being particularly scarce. To address these gaps and better train employees, hiring was increased with the support of Congress. However, hiring slowed significantly due to budget constraints in FY2011-FY2012. The Administration's FY2015 request for human resources initiatives was the same as in FY2014, totaling $2.60 billion\u2014a reduction of 5% from FY2014 estimated funding levels. The request planned 206 new positions at the Department of State, with 153 funded by consular fees for meeting visa demand. The State Department requested funding for 53 new positions, focusing on Economic Statecraft, Bureau of Energy Resources, Intelligence and Research, and Cyber Issues. Additionally, three Public Diplomacy positions were included to support the Administration's policy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region. The State Department's funding request included three Public Diplomacy positions in China, Indonesia, and Mongolia at a cost of $1.3 million. The request did not include additional funding for Overseas Comparability Pay, a priority for Foreign Service personnel. The State Department requested $81.4 million in FY2014 for a three-phase adjustment in Human Resources funding. Congress did not fully support the request, with H.R. 5013 providing $3 million less and S. 2499 allocating $64 million below the request. Senate appropriators rejected funding for new positions and favored reprogramming proposals based on savings. The 2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $2.27 billion for Human Resources activities without specific funds for new positions. In FY2015, $2.27 billion was allocated for Human Resources activities without specific funds for new non-security positions. Appropriators directed the Secretary to assign lower-priority positions to higher priority staffing requirements and signaled willingness to consider funding new positions on a case-by-case basis. The Foreign Operations budget funds traditional foreign aid programs, including bilateral economic aid, multilateral aid, security assistance, and export promotion programs. The FY2015-enacted appropriation for Foreign Operations accounts was $36.10 billion. The FY2015-enacted appropriation for Foreign Operations accounts was $36.10 billion, which was slightly less than the amended request of $36.32 billion. The Administration's request included a boost for USAID Operating Expenses, but it was meant to offset anticipated decreases in other funding sources. Proposed reductions in bilateral economic aid were driven by cuts in International Disaster Assistance and Migration and Refugee Assistance. The FY2015 bilateral economic aid request increased by 7% above FY2014, with a significant portion allocated to the IDA and USAID Global Health accounts to address the Ebola crisis. Security Assistance would have been reduced initially but increased by 8% due to additional funding proposed in amended requests to counter IS. Multilateral aid saw an increase from an IMF quota raise, offset by cuts to the International Development Association and no request for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. House appropriators maintained current year spending levels for most types of aid, except for a significant cut in multilateral assistance. Senate appropriators proposed an increase in USAID administrative funding and slightly less funding for bilateral economic aid, but more for multilateral aid. The Senate bill also included a notable increase in security assistance, mainly due to a shift in peacekeeping contributions from the State Operations to Foreign Operations section. Peacekeeping funds recommended totaled $2.86 billion. The Senate appropriators recommended $2.86 billion in total contributions, compared to the House's $2.25 billion proposal and the Administration's $3.35 billion request for FY2015. The enacted appropriation included an 8.6% increase in Administration of Foreign Assistance from FY2014 levels, with bilateral economic programs increasing by 12.2% driven by emergency funding for the Ebola crisis. Security assistance declined by 0.7% and multilateral assistance by 7.3% from FY2014 funding levels. Under the original FY2015 request, bilateral aid allocated by region would have varied. Aid to South and Central Asia would have increased by 13.2%, while East Asia Pacific and the Near East would have seen modest increases. Funding for Africa would have been reduced by about 1.6%. Europe and Eurasia would have seen a decrease, but the amended request for European security assistance would have provided an increase. The Western Hemisphere would have seen significant reductions in funding. The proportional allocation of aid among regions would not have changed significantly. The amended request includes a $1 billion Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, nearly $3 billion for Ebola virus, and additional funds to fight IS. Regional and country allocations for these funds have not been specified. House and Senate appropriators did not provide detailed information on country and regional allocation in their pending bills. The House committee rejected proposed cuts to Western Hemisphere countries and increased aid by $120 million to address needs related to undocumented migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate appropriators included an additional $100 million to address the migrant surge. The FY2015 foreign aid allocation included $3.1 billion for Israel, $1.3 million for Egypt, $120 million for Central America migration prevention, and $139.28 million for Ukraine. The top aid recipients remained consistent with previous years, including Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and global health focus countries. Iraq saw a notable change in ranking under the original request. The FY2015 foreign aid allocation included funding for Israel, Egypt, Central America migration prevention, and Ukraine. Iraq's ranking changed under the original request due to the security situation. Increased funds for fighting Ebola may impact top aid recipients. Political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa challenges U.S. national security goals. The Administration requested funding for a Middle East North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA-IF) in FY2013 and FY2014, but Congress did not authorize it. Instead, existing accounts were used to address needs in the region. The FY2014 appropriations bill also did not include funding for MENA-IF, but OCO funds could be used for stabilization efforts. The Administration estimated spending $3.62 billion on MENA response between January 2011 and February 2014. For FY2015, a separate MENA IF account was not requested. The Administration did not request a separate MENA IF account for FY2015 but instead included $1.53 billion for MENA response through various established accounts. This funding was designated for Syria regional response, reform activities, and contingencies. Additionally, a Counterterrorism Partnership Fund of $1 billion was added to address instability in the MENA region. The FY2015 funding, including an additional $520 million to counter IS, focused on the MENA region to address instability related to the crisis in Syria. The House and Senate committee reports recommended funding for various accounts to support evolving needs in the Middle East and North Africa, such as refugee assistance and security situations in Iraq and Libya. Senate appropriators also suggested $5 million for a multi-donor MENA Transition Fund. Funding for \"Middle East Response\" was provided through existing accounts. The FY2015 funding focused on the MENA region to address instability related to the crisis in Syria. Funding for \"Middle East Response\" was provided through existing accounts, including $400 million in ESF, $15 million under NADR, $5 million under INCLE, and $110 million under FMF. The legislation provided more funding than requested for IDA and MRA, with a significant portion allocated for humanitarian needs in the Middle East. The act allowed flexibility within OCO accounts to transfer funds between accounts if necessary. The Administration embraced the congressional approach to OCO in the FY2015 request, with a total foreign operations OCO funding request of $5.47 billion for Syria/MENA. The FY2015 OCO funding request totaled $5.47 billion, with funds allocated for Syria/MENA response, peacekeeping in Somalia and Central African Republic, and security assistance for European self-defense capabilities. The increase from FY2014 was largely due to activities to counter IS in Iraq and Syria. House and Senate appropriators had differing approaches to OCO designation, with the Senate committee designating $6.87 billion as OCO. The Senate committee applied the OCO designation to a larger portion of humanitarian assistance than the House committee and moved assessed contributions to peacekeeping operations. The enacted FY2015 appropriation included $7.49 billion in foreign operations funds designated as OCO, a 46% increase over FY2014. The legislation took a broad approach to the OCO designation for contingency operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The OCO funding for the MRA account increased by 66% from FY2014 to address humanitarian needs in Africa, the Near East, and South Asia. Significant increases were also provided in the ESF and IDA OCO accounts for unspecified purposes. Humanitarian assistance has increased as a portion of the foreign operations budget since FY2013, driven largely by the crisis in Syria. The United States had provided over $1.70 billion in Syria-related humanitarian assistance as of March 2014. The Administration requested $4.80 billion for humanitarian assistance in FY2015, including aid for Syria and other countries. This amount would have been a 24.8% decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The Administration requested $4.80 billion for humanitarian assistance in FY2015, anticipating carryover funds from FY2014 to meet needs. However, due to increased humanitarian needs from the Ebola epidemic and conflicts in Iraq and Syria, an additional $1.49 billion in IDA funds was requested in November 2014. The House and Senate committees recommended more funding than the Administration's original request, with P.L. 113-235 providing $7.91 billion for humanitarian accounts in FY2015. In FY2015, P.L. 113-235 allocated $7.91 billion for humanitarian accounts, with an increase in total IDA funding by nearly 85% to $3.33 billion. This included additional funding for the Ebola crisis and designated OCO funds. The International Affairs budget has long supported international food assistance through programs like Food for Peace. The Administration proposed food aid reforms in the FY2014 budget. The Administration proposed reforms to food aid in the FY2014 budget, aiming to increase flexibility in the Food for Peace program. The 2014 Farm Bill created a new local and regional purchase program with an $80 million annual budget for FY2014 through FY2018. In FY2015, the Administration requested $1.4 billion for Food for Peace, with $1.1 billion for emergency food needs and $270 million for development programs, representing a 4% reduction from the FY2014 estimate. The Administration requested an additional $80 million for development food aid and new authority to use 25% of the Food for Peace request for cash-based food assistance. The FY2015 House and Senate Agriculture appropriations bills included $1.466 billion for Food for Peace, matching the FY2014 funding level. The Obama Administration introduced three new Africa initiatives in 2013. The Administration introduced three major foreign assistance initiatives in 2009 and 2010, including the Global Health Initiative, Food Security Initiative (Feed the Future), and Global Climate Change Initiative. The FY2015 budget request prioritized these initiatives, with $114.3 million allocated for Africa initiatives such as Power Africa, Trade Africa, and the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). Power Africa aims to increase access to sustainable power with a total expected investment of $7.8 billion over five years. Trade Africa focuses on improving trade and investment in East Africa, while YALI aims to develop young African leaders. The Senate committee report recommended $15 million for YALI and included language supporting Power Africa. P.L. 113-235 allocated $15 million for YALI. The Global Health Initiative requested $8.05 billion for global health programs, with $1.35 billion for the Global Fund. The focus was on creating an AIDS-free generation and ending preventable diseases. The requested funds were focused on creating an AIDS-free generation, ending preventable maternal and child death, and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Compared to FY2014 allocations, there were modest increases in Family Planning (+2.7%) and Malaria (+1.4%) programs, while reductions were seen in HIV/AIDS (-5.0%), Nutrition (-12.2%), and Neglected Tropical Diseases (-13.5%) activities. Maternal and Child Health funding remained almost level, with a larger proportion going toward a proposed increase for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI). Significant reductions were proposed for Vulnerable Children (-34.1%), Tuberculosis (-19.1%), and Pandemic Influenza (-31.0%) activities. In November 2014, an additional $340 million was added for Ebola response, bringing the total Global Health Programs request to $8.39 billion. The total GHP request was $8.39 billion, with unclear allocation details. House and Senate appropriators recommended $8.31 billion and $8.14 billion for global health in FY2015, less than FY2014 funding. The Senate recommended $539 million for reproductive health, while the House recommended $461 million. The House recommended $300 million more than the Senate for global HIV/AIDS programs. P.L. 112-235 provided $8.77 billion for global health programs, including $312 million for emergency Ebola response, a 3.9% increase from FY2014. For FY2015, the Administration requested $1.00 billion for Feed the Future, a 4.5% increase over the FY2013 funding. This funding would be used for programs in 19 focus countries and 9 aligned countries to reduce poverty and malnutrition, in line with U.S. commitments made at G-8 summits in 2012 and 2013. The FY2015 House committee report did not specify funding levels for Feed the Future programs or food security and agricultural development. The Senate committee recommended $1 billion for this purpose, which was adopted in P.L. 113-235. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) aimed at promoting environmentally sustainable, climate resilient development would have received nearly level funding in FY2015 with a requested $839 million. Bilateral clean energy funding would have increased by 34.7%, adaptation programs by 3.8%, and sustainable landscapes funding reduced by 7.5%. In FY2015, U.S. contributions to World Bank climate accounts would have decreased by 12.5%, with no specific allocations for bilateral climate change activities or funding for multilateral programs. The Senate committee recommended funding for adaptation, mitigation, sustainable landscapes, and clean energy, in addition to multilateral climate change programs. P.L. 113-235 did not specify funding levels for bilateral climate change activities. The legislation included $184.6 million for the International Clean Technology Fund and $49.9 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, which was less than the Senate bill but more than the House bill. The funding levels for bilateral climate change activities were not specified in P.L. 113-235."
