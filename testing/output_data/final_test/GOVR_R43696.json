However, the trade surplus narrowed in recent years, with exports reaching a peak of $152.3 billion in FY2014. In FY2015, the agricultural trade surplus decreased from $43.1 billion to $25.7 billion. USDA projects a further decline in FY2016, with exports dropping to $125 billion and imports rising to $118.5 billion, resulting in a farm trade surplus of $6.5 billion, the smallest since FY2006. Agricultural exports accounted for 10-11% of total U.S. exports in recent years, while imports made up 5%. Exports also represented 20% of overall agricultural production in 2013. During the 2014/2015 marketing year, export markets absorbed a significant portion of U.S. farm commodities, including 69% of cotton production, 41% of wheat output, and 47% of soybean harvest. In the livestock sector, export shares for pork, broiler meat, and beef production in 2015 were 20%, 16%, and 10% respectively. Foreign markets also played a crucial role in specialty crops, with export markets absorbing a large percentage of walnuts, almonds, pecans, and pistachios production. China surpassed Canada as the top market for U.S. agricultural exports in FY2012. In FY2015, China remained the leading market for U.S. agricultural exports, with soybeans being the largest export commodity. High value products (HVPs) made up 67% of all agricultural exports, including live animals, fruits, vegetables, nuts, fats, hides, feeds, sugar products, meat, milk, grain products, and processed fruits. The USDA projects that high value products (HVPs) will continue to increase their share of U.S. farm exports, potentially reaching 74% by 2025. This growth is expected to be led by animal-based and horticultural products. Agricultural exports play a significant role in the U.S. economy, with each dollar of agricultural exports stimulating $1.27 in business activity and supporting 7,550 jobs per $1 billion in exports. Nearly every state contributes to agricultural exports, with the top 10 states accounting for 56% of total exports in 2014. In CY 2014, the top 10 states accounted for 56% of total U.S. agricultural exports. Global trade is influenced by world market growth, population changes, and trade agreements. Developing countries are expected to drive growth in demand for U.S. agricultural exports due to population growth and rising incomes. The outlook for faster population growth in developing countries and rising incomes linked to an expanding middle class is driving increased demand for meat, dairy products, and processed foods. Global economic growth is projected to rise to 3.1% in 2016, led by stronger growth in the United States and Europe, stable growth in Asia, and potential downturn in Brazil's economy impacting South America. The decline in U.S. agricultural exports in FY2015 was due to lower market prices for farm commodities like soybeans and corn. Prices for animal products also decreased, impacting export sales. The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies is another factor affecting agricultural trade. The stronger U.S. dollar in 2016, influenced by favorable economic prospects, impacted U.S. agriculture by making exports more expensive for foreign buyers. This led to lower farm exports in FY2015 and is expected to continue in FY2016. The stronger dollar also increased U.S. agricultural imports by making foreign products cheaper. Trade policy and geopolitical events also play a role in agricultural exports. Liberalization efforts aim to expand international commerce by lowering trade barriers and increasing access to foreign markets through agreements like GATT, WTO, NAFTA, and bilateral FTAs. Geopolitical events, such as economic sanctions, can impact trade in agricultural products, with effects often temporary as trade flows realign. An example is the U.S. embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union in response to the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The Soviet Union was a major importer of U.S. grain and feed, but in 1980, their imports dropped by 66%. Despite this, total U.S. grain and feed exports increased by 10% as other countries absorbed the displaced grain. In 2014, Russia banned imports of certain foods from Western countries, including the U.S., in retaliation for economic sanctions. This ban led to a decrease in U.S. agricultural exports to Russia from 712,697 metric tons in 2013 to 565,652 metric tons. Exports to Russia have declined from 712,697 metric tons in 2013 to 565,652 metric tons in 2015, with poultry meat shipments dropping to zero. The 2014 farm bill includes programs to promote agricultural exports, with the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service working to improve the competitive position of U.S. agriculture globally. The 2014 farm bill, the Agricultural Act of 2014, establishes policy for five years through FY2018, reauthorizing and amending USDA's foreign agricultural export programs. Budget authority for these programs is mandatory and provided by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The law made changes to Title III, including alterations to the Export Credit Guarantee Program to align with WTO rulings and the elimination of the Dairy Export program. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized USDA's foreign agricultural export programs, including the elimination of the Dairy Export Incentive Program. It also established the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and International Affairs. FAS supports U.S. industry efforts to expand overseas markets through various market development programs. FAS supports U.S. industry in expanding overseas markets through market development programs funded by the CCC. These programs include MAP, FMDP, EMP, and TASC, with MAP aiding in creating, expanding, and maintaining foreign markets for U.S. agricultural products. The Market Access Program (MAP) is funded by FAS and supports U.S. agricultural trade associations, cooperatives, state-regional trade groups, and small businesses for overseas marketing activities. MAP funds are used for trade shows, market research, consumer promotions, technical capacity building, and seminars. The program focuses on value-added products like cotton, fruits, dairy, meat, nuts, wood products, wine, and seafood. Funds can be used for generic or brand-name promotions. Since FY1998, USDA policy prohibits allocating MAP funds to large U.S. companies. Agricultural cooperatives and small U.S. companies can receive assistance for brand promotion activities, requiring a 50% funding match. Trade associations and others must meet a 10% match requirement for generic promotion activities. Agriculture appropriations acts have occasionally imposed restrictions on MAP spending. The FY1996 Agriculture Appropriations Act imposed restrictions on MAP spending to promote mink pelts or garments and tobacco exports. MAP funding increased from $90 million in FY2000 to $200 million in FY2006 and has remained at that level. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized CCC funding for MAP at $200 million annually through FY2018. FMDP, established in 1955, aims to assist industry organizations in expanding export opportunities and received $34.5 million annually from FY2014-FY2018. The Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) has received $34.5 million in funding since 2002. FMDP funds industry groups for activities like consumer promotions, technical assistance, and market research. Unlike the Market Access Program (MAP), which promotes consumer goods, FMDP focuses on generic commodities. The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) provides partial funding for technical assistance to promote U.S. agricultural exports in developing markets. The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) aims to support export market development efforts in countries with populations over 1 million and low per-capita income levels. It provides technical assistance for activities like feasibility studies, market research, and specialized training to promote U.S. agricultural exports. The program is funded through the CCC and was extended through FY2018 with an annual budget of up to $10 million. The Quality Samples Program (QSP) promotes U.S. agricultural exports by providing small samples of products to industrial users in emerging markets. Priority is given to projects targeting developing nations with low per-capita income and populations over 1 million. FAS used CCC funds totaling $1.06 million in FY2013, $1.29 million in 2014, and $1.57 million in FY2015 for the program. The USDA estimated net expenditures of $2.55 million. The Trade Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program received funding of $2.55 million in FY2016 and is estimated to receive $2.56 million in FY2017. TASC aims to assist U.S. exporters by addressing technical barriers to specialty crop exports. Activities covered include seminars, workshops, research, and preclearance programs. The 2014 farm bill expanded TASC's scope to fund projects that address technical barriers to trade. The 2014 farm bill authorizes TASC funding of $9 million annually from FY2014 through FY2018 for activities such as economic studies and export credit guarantee programs to facilitate sales of U.S. agricultural exports. The CCC guarantees repayment of loans for U.S. agricultural exports to foreign buyers through programs like GSM-102 and FGP, aiming to encourage commercial exports on competitive credit terms in countries where financing is needed. Eligible countries are determined by USDA's ability to service the debt backed by guarantees. The CCC selects agricultural commodities and products based on market potential and eligibility. All products must be entirely produced in the United States. Major recipients of export credit guarantees include Mexico, South Korea, Iraq, Algeria, and the former Soviet Union. In FY2015, top beneficiary countries were Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey. Regional allocations in FY2015 included South America, the Caribbean, Central America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Under the 2014 farm bill, funding for the GSM-102 program is reauthorized, with Central America, Southeast Asia, and Africa/Middle East being major recipients of export credit guarantees. Top commodities funded include wheat, soybeans, and soybean meal. The program generates revenue for the government, with net federal outlays mostly negative since the mid-1990s. The GSM-102 program under the 2014 farm bill has had minimal costs to the government, with an exception in FY2010. The program allows flexibility for changes to comply with the WTO cotton case won by Brazil. Amendments to the program include reducing the maximum loan guarantee term to two years and requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to maximize the amount of guarantees provided. The 2014 farm bill amended the GSM-102 program to reduce the maximum loan guarantee term to 24 months, with a repayment limit of 18 months. The Secretary of Agriculture is no longer required to maximize credit guarantees, and program fees can now cover operational costs without implicit subsidies. This change was influenced by a 2014 agreement with Brazil following a WTO complaint about U.S. cotton support programs. The 2008 farm bill repealed the GSM-103 program, impacting cotton prices in Brazil. The GSM-102 program provides financing for the FGP to support agriculture-related projects in emerging markets. Funding of at least $1 billion was authorized through FY2018 for promoting U.S. agricultural exports. As of April 2016, the FGP program was inactive. The DEIP program, established in 1985 to assist in the export of U.S. dairy products, was repealed in the 2014 farm bill due to WTO commitments. Despite being inactive, the program was estimated to reach $100 million in FY2016 and $500 million in FY2017. The DEIP program was established in 1985 to counter foreign dairy product subsidies, primarily from the European Union. Eligible commodities included milk powder, butterfat, and various cheeses. The program level varied over the years depending on dairy prices. USDA reactivated the program in 2009 to support milk producers. DEIP subsidies have not been provided since 2010. USDA's agricultural export programs are funded through the CCC, with spending limits sometimes amended by annual appropriations acts. The 2014 farm bill required the reorganization of USDA's international trade functions, including the establishment of the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs. The Secretary of Agriculture was directed to propose a plan within 180 days of the bill's enactment and implement it within one year. The 2014 farm bill mandated the reorganization of USDA's international trade functions, including creating the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs. This position coordinates sanitary and phytosanitary issues in agricultural trade and addresses non-tariff barriers. The timeline for establishing this role is within one year of the Secretary's report to Congress. The new Under Secretary would separate domestic and export-oriented programs. As of April 2016, the required report to Congress had not been submitted. The USDA Office of Chief Economist was directed by Congress in December 2015 to propose a reorganization plan and establish the new Under Secretary position. Congress provided $1 million to fund this effort as part of the FY2016 Agricultural Appropriations Act. U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $152 billion in FY2014 but declined to $139 billion in FY2015. USDA projects further decline to $125 billion in FY2016, the lowest since FY2010. The downturn in export sales in FY2015 was due to lower unit prices for major commodities like wheat, corn, broiler meat, and pork, compounded by a reduction in export quantities. Export sales are crucial for U.S. agricultural prices, farm income, and the financial well-being of the agribusiness sector. With a sharp decline in net cash farm income, Congress may need to consider actions to address the situation. In 2016, U.S. agricultural exports were forecasted to reach $91 billion, down from a peak of $135 billion in 2012 and 2013. Congress should consider the benefits and drawbacks of addressing opportunities to increase exports, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which could provide improved market access for agricultural products. Japan and Vietnam are seen as attractive markets for U.S. agricultural exports within the TPP. The TPP agreement has drawn broad support within U.S. agriculture and agribusiness sectors, but also has detractors who believe the terms are unbalanced. Critics include the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, National Farmers Union, and elements of the U.S. rice and tobacco industries. The TPP agreement has support within U.S. agriculture and agribusiness sectors, but some producers object to specific provisions. Congress would need to enact implementing legislation for TPP to have the force of law. Farm groups see Cuba as a potential market for U.S. farm products due to its heavy dependence on agricultural imports and advantages U.S. exporters have over competitors. Title IX of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 opened a window in the U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba by permitting exports of agricultural products. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed exports of agricultural products to Cuba, leading to a significant increase in U.S. farm exports to the country. However, restrictions on financing limit sales to Cuba to cash transactions, resulting in lower annual imports compared to other markets like the Dominican Republic. The restrictions on financing, limiting sales to Cuba to cash transactions, hinder the expansion of U.S. farm exports by making terms less competitive. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported in March 2016 that removing trade restrictions could significantly boost U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The inability to offer credit and travel to Cuba for transactions is seen as a major obstacle by U.S. agricultural suppliers. Despite some policy changes by the Obama Administration in 2015 and 2016, agricultural products are still excluded from private U.S. financing due to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. Critics argue that Cuba's one-party communist regime and poor human rights record should prompt reforms before relaxing U.S. sanctions. U.S. agricultural exports face displacement by competitors benefiting from government support, leading to surplus disposal challenges. Foreign surpluses from high government support levels can distort trade patterns and impact international market prices. Generous price supports and subsidies insulate producers from price signals, leading to exports below domestic prices. The House Agriculture Committee held hearings in 2015 on this issue, focusing on support provided by advanced developing countries like Brazil, China, and India. Countries like Brazil, China, India, Thailand, and Turkey provide excessive support beyond WTO obligations, distorting trade to the detriment of U.S. agriculture. WTO handles disciplines on agricultural support programs, with the option to lodge complaints against violators. The Doha Round of trade negotiations aimed to address agricultural trade issues but stalled in 2009, making little progress since then. Negotiations reached an impasse in 2009 and have made little progress since. Congressional oversight is ongoing regarding the reorganization of trade functions at USDA as required by the 2014 farm bill. The reorganization plan submission to Congress has been delayed multiple times, with a revised deadline set for mid-June 2016. The 2014 farm bill calls for a reorganization plan to be submitted to Congress, including the creation of the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Affairs. This implies separating domestic farm programs from export-oriented programs. Congress may be interested in overseeing this reorganization effort, especially considering the importance of these program activities to the agricultural sector. Many Members of Congress have historically supported the Market Access Program (MAP) for its benefits to U.S. agricultural industries. The 2014 farm bill emphasizes the importance of export-oriented programs like the Market Access Program (MAP) for U.S. agricultural industries. Despite some opposition, Congress has consistently rejected proposals to reduce MAP funding, showing strong support for export market development. The elimination of the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) was due to changes in federal support programs for milk producers and a commitment to end direct export subsidies. Some Members of Congress question the role of federal government in supporting agricultural export programs like MAP and FMDP, citing concerns of corporate welfare. Critics argue funds could be better spent on instructing U.S. firms on exporting, while supporters highlight the need to stay competitive in foreign markets. Despite criticism, Congress continues to support programs promoting farm exports. In 2013, the House rejected amendments to eliminate farm export promotion programs MAP and EMP, arguing that taxpayer money should not fund activities that could be supported by private interests. The Senate Agriculture Committee also did not consider any amendments to reduce farm export programs in their markup of the farm bill. In 2013, the Senate Agriculture Committee did not consider amendments to curtail agricultural export programs, despite concerns raised in the early 1990s about the cost-effectiveness and impact of MAP operations. Congress directed USDA to make significant changes to MAP in response to these concerns, giving priority to small businesses in the program. In response to concerns about the cost-effectiveness of MAP operations, Congress directed USDA to prioritize small businesses in the program. This led to a substantial increase in small business share of MAP assistance for brand-name promotion by 1997. FAS established a five-year limit on the use of MAP funds for promoting specific branded products in a single market, with a certification requirement that funds supplement rather than supplant foreign market development expenditures. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed studies on the effectiveness of export programs like MAP, finding unclear economic benefits. In 2009, GAO testified that U.S. export promotion activities needed improved performance management. A 2010 report by IHS Global Insight sponsored by FAS showed that USDA's market development spending under MAP and FMD significantly increased U.S. agricultural trade. The U.S. market development spending under MAP and FMDP increased agricultural exports by 6% to $96.1 billion in FY2009, compared to $90.5 billion under lower spending levels."
