    "content": "The \"Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2005\" allows for special tax treatment of certain S Corporation conversions under section 1364 of the Internal Revenue Code. A qualified electing S corporation can elect special tax treatment for an eligible corporate conversion, including no gain or loss recognition for transfers to a partnership and treating other distributions as payment for stock. A qualified electing S corporation can make an election for an eligible corporate conversion, which involves transferring assets to a partnership for at least 80% of the partnership's capital and profits in a taxable year before December 31, 2009. A qualified electing S corporation can make an election for an eligible corporate conversion by transferring assets to a partnership for at least 80% of the partnership's capital and profits in a taxable year ending on or before December 31, 2009. The partnership must meet the continuity of business requirement by maintaining the qualified S corporation's business for 5 consecutive taxable years following the corporate conversion or by paying a corporate conversion. The continuity of the qualified electing S corporation's business is defined as either the continuation of historic lines of business or the use of a significant portion of historic business assets in an active trade. The corporate conversion recapture tax is a recomputation of the tax for a partnership and its partners as if the S corporation's stock was owned in the same manner as the partnership's capital. The S corporation's assets were distributed to shareholders in complete liquidation on the last day of the taxable year, subject to basis rules for an eligible corporate conversion recapture tax. In an eligible corporate conversion, property in the partnership will have the same basis as in the qualified electing S corporation before the conversion. The S corporation must file a written election for special tax treatment with its information return for the year of the conversion. The amendments for special tax treatment of certain S corporation conversions under Sec 1363 will apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
