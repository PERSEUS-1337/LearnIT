These weapons were removed at the end of the Cold War but the U.S. remains committed to defending South Korea under the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty. Recent advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have sparked discussions about the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Recent discussions have emerged regarding the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Opposition leaders in South Korea have called for the country to develop its own nuclear weapons. Representatives of the largest opposition party have urged the government to request the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons and are considering pushing for approval in the South Korean legislature. South Korea's Defense Minister has suggested that the redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons should be fully reviewed. However, President Moon Jae-in has not supported these proposals and continues to advocate for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. government is considering the redeployment of nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, with some officials and analysts supporting the idea. Despite opposition, President Moon Jae-in continues to advocate for denuclearization. Senator John McCain also suggested the U.S. should consider redeploying nuclear weapons to the peninsula. The U.S. government is considering redeploying nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula to enhance its capabilities without the need for nuclear weapons to deter North Korean aggression. There are debates on the necessity of redeployment if North Korea expands its nuclear arsenal. Congress may need to weigh the costs and benefits, along with implications for regional security and U.S.-allied relations. This report provides background information and explores available options. During the Cold War, the U.S. deployed various strategic nuclear weapons to deter aggression against itself and its allies. These weapons included ICBMs, SLBMs, heavy bombers, and shorter-range systems deployed on allies' territories, naval vessels, and with troops in the field. During the Cold War, the U.S. deployed strategic nuclear weapons to deter aggression. Nonstrategic nuclear weapons were used with launchers for shorter ranges on the battlefield. The U.S. and South Korea signed a Mutual Defense Treaty for protection against third-party attacks. The U.S. maintains a military presence on the Korean Peninsula to help defend South Korea. The United States deployed various types of nuclear weapons in South Korea between 1958 and 1991, including nuclear landmines, shells for howitzers, missiles, and bombs for fighter-bombers. The total number of nuclear warheads on the peninsula reached nearly 950 in the mid-1960s, with some weapons staying for decades. The United States deployed various types of nuclear weapons in South Korea between 1958 and 1991, including landmines, shells, missiles, and bombs. The weapons were intended to deter a ground invasion from North Korea and were gradually reduced starting in the mid-1970s due to security concerns and exceeding war plan requirements. By 1977, the nuclear weapons storage facility at Osan Air Base was deactivated, leaving weapons only at Kunsan Air Base. The United States reduced its nuclear weapons in South Korea from around 540 in 1976 to approximately 150 artillery shells and bombs in 1985. By 1991, only around 100 warheads remained, including shells for nuclear artillery and B61 bombs for fighter-bombers. President George H. W. Bush announced the withdrawal of all land-based and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons in response to changes in the international security environment. The military utility of land-based weapons declined as the Soviet Union moved its forces eastward in Europe and the US and ROK conventional capabilities grew in Asia. North Korea's nuclear program was a concern, but they had not yet developed functional nuclear weapons. The US relied on longer-range strategic nuclear weapons to deter North Korean aggression and removed all remaining nuclear weapons from bases in South Korea by the end of 1991. The United States dismantled all warheads for land-based shorter-range missiles and artillery, no longer maintaining the capability to deploy or employ nuclear weapons. The only warheads left in the U.S. stockpile for deployment on the Korean Peninsula are B61 bombs, deliverable by B-2 bombers, F-15, F-16, and potentially F-35 fighters. To redeploy B61 bombs to South Korea, the U.S. would need to recreate infrastructure with secure vaults and security perimeters. The United States may need to add resources and training to certify personnel at bases in Europe for maintaining and operating nuclear weapons. This could lead to initial and ongoing costs, potentially requiring the Air Force to shift resources from conventional missions in Korea. Alternatively, the U.S. could reacquire and redeploy shorter-range nuclear-armed land-based missiles or artillery, but this option would take years to implement.

Alternatively, the U.S. could reacquire and redeploy shorter-range nuclear-armed land-based missiles or artillery, but this option would take years to implement. Recreating such a system would likely be expensive and indicate a shift in the view of nuclear weapons as a complement to conventional forces rather than a deterrent to attack. Discussions about the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea focus on the challenges and implications of such a move. The discussions on possibly redeploying U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea focus on deterring North Korean attacks and reassuring South Korea of U.S. defense commitment. The U.S. currently maintains nuclear weapons on land-based missiles, bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles for this purpose. Additionally, strategic assets like B-1, B-2, and B-52 bombers are rotated through Andersen Air Force Base in Guam for exercises with Japanese and South Korean aircraft. The U.S. conducted a mission with South Korean F-15K fighters in response to North Korea's missile launch. The presence of U.S. strategic bombers signifies support for South Korea. Discussions between U.S. and South Korean defense officials aim to strengthen South Korea's confidence in U.S. defense commitment. Meetings have taken place at the ministerial level to address extended deterrence issues. The United States and South Korea have been holding meetings at the ministerial level to address extended deterrence issues. The U.S. State Department announced more regular routine meetings of the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultative Group. Analysts emphasize the importance of these meetings in addressing South Korea's concerns about military capabilities and the U.S. commitment. Some have raised doubts due to President Trump's comments about South Korea. Some question the U.S. commitment to South Korea in the face of a potential nuclear attack from North Korea, known as \"decoupling.\" The debate centers on whether deploying B61 bombs on the peninsula or delivering them from the U.S. is more effective in deterring aggression and reassuring South Korea. Supporters of redeployment argue it would visibly demonstrate U.S. commitment. Some argue that redeploying weapons to the peninsula would send a strong deterrent message to North Korea and demonstrate commitment to South Korea. They believe having weapons on the peninsula could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations and allow for a quicker nuclear response to an attack. However, opponents believe the costs and risks of deployment outweigh the benefits and could undermine deterrence. Some argue that deploying nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula could undermine deterrence and make them a target for North Korea. The time needed to deliver weapons to target would be shorter, but some believe this is unnecessary unless the goal is to disrupt an ongoing attack. The Pentagon could increase readiness during a crisis to shorten response time. Some argue that deploying nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula could drain funding and undermine readiness for other military missions. The United States could pursue sea-based options for quicker delivery to North Korea without the associated costs and risks. Reacquiring sea-launched capabilities could add to its options in the Pacific, albeit with financial and operational costs for the Navy. Deploying nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not violate agreements with South Korea or existing limitations on U.S. nuclear weapons. Land-based systems with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers are prohibited by the 1987 INF Treaty, but air-delivered weapons and sea-based missiles within that range are not restricted. The NPT does not prohibit the U.S. from basing its nuclear weapons in other countries. President Moon has advocated for more defense options, including reversing the delay of a U.S. missile defense battery. The Liberty Korea Party has called for the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea, which is relatively popular among South Koreans. In a recent survey, 68.4% of South Koreans believe the country should have tactical nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered submarines. The decision to reintroduce nuclear weapons into South Korea poses political and strategic challenges, especially in light of North Korea's nuclear capabilities. The potential redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea could complicate efforts to pressure North Korea on denuclearization. Some argue that South Korea could use the presence of these weapons as leverage for North Korea to make concessions. The move would be met with mixed reactions in South Korea, with some seeing it as a reinforcement of U.S. commitment to defend against North Korea's threats. Older South Koreans, who fear abandonment, may welcome the presence of nuclear weapons at the Osan base. Korea's escalating threats involve the potential stationing of nuclear weapons at the Osan base south of Seoul. This move may reassure some South Koreans but could alarm Pyongyang and unsettle the delicate security situation. President Moon aims to reduce tensions with the North, and positioning nuclear weapons could undermine this goal. The U.S.-ROK alliance is already strained under the Moon and Trump Administrations, with concerns about the alliance's strength. Candidate Trump suggested that countries defended by the U.S. should pay for their defense or defend themselves. He also hinted at South Korea and Japan acquiring nuclear weapons, going against U.S. policy. President Moon criticized the acceptance of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. Trump insisted that South Korea pay for the system, causing suspicion. Despite some tensions, the two leaders reaffirmed their alliance commitments in a cordial summit in June 2017. Despite reaffirming alliance commitments in a cordial summit in June 2017, concerns remain about potential weakening of the partnership due to unresolved issues such as cost-sharing and President Trump's mention of a possible military strike against North Korea. South Korea's President Moon emphasized the need for military decisions on the Korean Peninsula to be made by South Korea, hinting at potential contention in alliance coordination. The reintroduction of tactical nuclear weapons by the U.S. could further strain relations with Seoul if not carefully coordinated. The redeployment of nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula could have security repercussions for the region, especially concerning China's perception of escalating tensions. China strongly criticized the deployment of THAAD in March 2017, leading to retaliatory measures such as boycotting South Korean companies and tourism. This move could strain relations between the U.S. and South Korea if not carefully coordinated. Some analysts believe that demonstrating U.S. resolve could pressure China to influence North Korea's behavior. China's response to U.S. actions in the region could vary, potentially leading to increased support for North Korea or bolstering its own nuclear weapons arsenal. The U.S.-China bilateral relationship could be affected, impacting trade, maritime disputes, Taiwan, and human rights concerns. Japan's reaction to these developments could be mixed. Japan is debating upgrading its defense capabilities due to the North Korean threat. The U.S. has a defense treaty with Japan, but no U.S. nuclear weapons are stationed there. Japan is unlikely to seek U.S. nuclear weapons on its soil due to its sensitivity to nuclear power. The U.S. military is conducting a Nuclear Posture Review to examine the role of nuclear weapons in national security policy. There is a debate in South Korea about the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons, which could impact the review's recommendations. This could create security concerns for Tokyo if it perceives the moves as bolstering South Korea's military capabilities. The review suggests changes in U.S. force posture in Asia, including deploying new weapons or developing new types of weapons for deterrence. Congress should review the implications and costs of these decisions, as well as consider bolstering South Korea's confidence in U.S. defense commitment through increased deployments of nonnuclear strategic assets, changes in military exercises, and expanding strategic consultations with South Korea."
