    "title": "AB 1523",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 6213 of the Business and Professions Code in California is amended to define a \"qualified legal services project\" as a nonprofit project or program that provides free legal services to indigent persons and meets specific criteria approved by the State Bar of California. The program must have quality control procedures approved by the State Bar of California. A \"qualified support center\" is a nonprofit legal services center that provides legal training, assistance, or advocacy support without charge in California. A \"recipient\" is a legal services project or support center receiving financial assistance under this article. An \"indigent person\" is defined as someone whose income is 125% or less of the poverty threshold, eligible for certain government assistance programs, or has income 75% or less of the maximum for lower income households. Income for disabled individuals is calculated after deducting disability-related expenses. (e) A \"fee generating case\" is a case that could result in payment for legal services, either from a client, public funds, or the opposing party. It is not considered fee generating if adequate representation is unavailable and certain circumstances exist, such as rejection by lawyer referral services or attorneys unwilling to take the case without payment. Emergency circumstances may require immediate action before referral, with the client being informed that a referral will be attempted later if appropriate. Recovery of damages is not the main focus of the case, and a request for damages may be secondary to seeking equitable relief or as part of a necessary defense. A court-appointed recipient or employee may be involved in the case, and it may concern the rights of a claimant under a publicly supported benefit program based on need. The Legal Services Corporation, Older Americans Act, Developmentally Disabled Assistance Act, Supplemental security income recipient, and IOLTA account are defined under specific federal laws. The curr_chunk describes different types of investment products, including an interest-bearing checking account, an investment sweep product, and an investment product authorized by California Supreme Court rule or order. An investment product authorized by California Supreme Court rule or order must be fully collateralized by conservative debt securities and can only be established with eligible institutions that are \"well-capitalized\" or \"adequately capitalized\" according to federal statutes. An open-end money market fund must be invested solely in government securities or collateralized repurchase agreements, hold itself out as a \"money market fund,\" and have total assets of at least $250,000,000. Eligible institutions for IOLTA accounts include banks, savings and loans, or other financial institutions regulated by federal or state agencies with deposit insurance. Additionally, any financial institution authorized by the California Supreme Court can also be considered eligible."
