    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Enforcement for Local Lands Act of 2016\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The \"Local Enforcement for Local Lands Act of 2016\" defines terms such as covered law enforcement agency, Federal land, and Secretary concerned. The \"Local Enforcement for Local Lands Act of 2016\" defines terms such as State, unit of local government, and the responsibilities of the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior for Federal lands. SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF FOREST SERVICE AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND FUNCTIONS. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior are required to terminate their respective law enforcement units on Federal land by September 30, 2017. Appropriations for these agencies for law enforcement functions on Federal land are not authorized starting from fiscal year 2018. This does not affect the authority to carry firearms. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior must disband their law enforcement units on Federal land by September 30, 2017. Starting from fiscal year 2018, appropriations for law enforcement functions on Federal land for these agencies are not authorized. However, this does not limit the authority of the Secretary concerned to authorize Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management employees to carry firearms for protection in the field. SEC. 4. BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL LAW ON FEDERAL LAND. For fiscal year 2018 and beyond, the Secretary of the Interior will provide grants to States for law enforcement on Federal land. The grant amount is based on the percentage of Federal land in each State compared to all States. Grant funds can only be used for law enforcement purposes on Federal land. The Secretary of the Interior will modify the grant formula to consider visitation levels at Federal land units, with high-traffic states receiving additional law enforcement funds. States receiving grants must submit annual reports certifying funds were used for specified law enforcement functions. Authorization of Appropriations: For fiscal year 2018 and beyond, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to appropriate funds for grants to support law enforcement functions on Federal land. The amount will be at least the total appropriated for all covered law enforcement agencies in fiscal year 2016, with additional funds as deemed necessary by the Secretary. States must report on expenditures and whether grant funds were sufficient. SEC. 5. State and local agreements for law enforcement functions on federal land. State or local governments receiving grants for law enforcement on Federal land must enter into an agreement with the Secretary concerned. This agreement allows designated officers to carry firearms and make arrests for offenses against the United States. Law enforcement officers can make arrests for felonies on Federal land or within their jurisdiction, execute warrants for Federal offenses, and investigate offenses against the United States on Federal land. States can commit offenses on Federal land without investigation by other Federal agencies, or with their agreement. The Secretary can waive civil claims against States or local governments and indemnify them for property damage or personal injury claims arising from law enforcement functions. Law enforcement officers of States are not considered Federal employees, except as specified. Law enforcement officers of a State or local government, under an agreement, are not considered Federal employees for most purposes but are deemed as such for specific sections of the United States Code. The definition of \"employee\" under section 8101 of title 5, United States Code, applies to compensation for work injuries. Federal investigative jurisdiction and state civil and criminal jurisdiction are not preempted. Repeal of Forest Service section 15003 of the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986 and amendment of Bureau of Land Management section 303(c)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
