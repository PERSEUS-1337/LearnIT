In 1984, Congress mandated competition, leading to state involvement in franchising to allow telcos to offer video services. This shifted authority from municipalities to streamline the process. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has limited local regulatory authority over cable and telco video service providers, causing controversy with local governments. This report examines the evolving relationship between federal, state, and local regulators in the telecommunications industry. Cable television began in the 1940s to receive broadcast signals in areas with signal interference. The evolving relationship between federal, state, and local regulators in the telecommunications industry involves municipalities initially making decisions on cable franchises, with some states starting to regulate franchise terms. Local franchising authorities negotiate agreements with video service providers, covering PEG programming, franchise fees, and subscriber rates. The FCC's authority to regulate cable was established by the U.S. Supreme Court despite not being explicitly stated in the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC's authority to regulate cable was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968. In 1972, the FCC issued regulations for cable systems and franchising authorities, requiring cable operators to offer PEG services and LFAs while capping franchise fees. Municipalities would outline requirements for cable operators to win a franchise through a bidding process. The FCC also mandated cable operators to dedicate channels for public access, educational use, and local government use. The FCC mandated cable operators to offer PEG services, LFAs, and dedicate channels for public access, educational use, and local government use. However, the commission later expressed concerns about excessive demands for free equipment, programming, and personnel, stating that these demands may hinder efforts to foster cable technology nationwide. The commission emphasized the importance of community responsibility in making public access successful. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down FCC rules for cable operators to set aside channels for PEGs, but PEG access requirements became common in local franchise agreements by the early 1980s. Public access channels serve as a platform for groups and individuals without access to electronic media, promoting an informed citizenry by showcasing local schools and government activities. Municipalities also required cable system owners to obtain a franchise before operating. The FCC capped franchise fees at 3%-5% of a cable operator's revenues to balance federal goals with local regulation costs. High franchise fees were seen as a burden on cable television and a regressive tax on subscribers. The FCC capped franchise fees at 3%-5% of a cable operator's revenues from subscribers, requiring franchising authorities to justify fees exceeding 3%. Initially, municipalities regulated cable rates to prevent operators from charging excessively for what was considered an essential service. In 1976, the FCC repealed rules requiring LFAs to regulate cable television rates, making it optional. The 1984 Cable Act gave the FCC authority to regulate cable TV and established local franchising as the primary regulation method, while still allowing state and local authorities to regulate public health, safety, system construction, and consumer protection. The 1984 Cable Act prohibited telcos from providing video services in regions where they offered voice services, preventing competition with cable operators. It also confirmed state and municipal governments' power to include requirements for PEGs and franchise agreements, while limiting federal franchise fees and FCC regulation. The 1984 Cable Act allows franchising authorities to charge franchise fees up to 5% of cable operators' gross revenues from \"cable services,\" including advertising and home shopping commissions. Controversy arose over defining costs subject to the fee limit. Local authorities can enforce PEG access requirements, such as providing video production facilities and equipment, beyond the fee cap. The 1984 Cable Act allows franchising authorities to charge franchise fees up to 5% of cable operators' gross revenues from \"cable services.\" Section 623 of the Act prohibits regulating rates of cable operators subject to effective competition. The FCC periodically reviews standards for determining effective competition, considering technology developments. In 1985, the FCC defined cable systems as subject to effective competition in areas with three or more broadcast television signals significantly viewed by residents or transmitted with acceptable signal quality. The 1984 Cable Act deregulated cable prices in most communities by implementing the \"effective competition\" rule in 1986. The FCC defined effective competition in 1991 as having six broadcast signals available via over-the-air reception or another multichannel video service subscribed to by 10% of homes passed. This more restrictive definition meant that most systems were still not subject to rate regulation. The 1992 Cable Act aimed to rely on market forces to promote diversity of views and protect consumer interests in cable television. It revised regulations on local franchise authorities' licensing activities to prevent exclusive franchises and undue market power for cable operators. The 1992 Cable Act aimed to prevent exclusive franchises and undue market power for cable operators. It allowed potential entrants to seek judicial remedy within 120 days of a local authority's refusal to grant a franchise. Congress also made it easier for local authorities to regulate cable rates by setting stricter criteria for \"effective competition.\" Local authorities may not regulate rates if certain conditions are met, such as low subscriber numbers or the presence of multiple comparable video programming distributors in the area. The 1992 Cable Act aimed to prevent exclusive franchises and undue market power for cable operators. It allowed potential entrants to seek judicial remedy within 120 days of a local authority's refusal to grant a franchise. Congress also made it easier for local authorities to regulate cable rates by setting stricter criteria for \"effective competition.\" The Act required the FCC to publish a survey of cable rates annually, coinciding with technological advancements enabling convergence of telephone, cable, and satellite industries. The 1992 Cable Act aimed to prevent exclusive franchises and undue market power for cable operators, allowing potential entrants to seek judicial remedy within 120 days of a local authority's refusal to grant a franchise. Digital technology enabled direct broadcast satellite services and cable operators to offer multiple channels. In 1993, Bell Atlantic successfully challenged the ban on cross-ownership of telephone and cable companies. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted LECs to offer video services and cable operators to offer voice services, leading to a revisit of video market regulation by Congress. The 1996 Telecommunications Act allowed LECs and cable operators to offer each other's services, leading to a revisit of video market regulation by Congress. Section 601 rescinded the 1982 consent decree on AT&T, allowing LECs to merge further. Cable operators were not required to obtain local approval for offering telecommunications services. The act emphasized that local governments should regulate telecommunications services provided by cable companies in a nondiscriminatory manner. Congress introduced the term \"open video systems\" to describe LECs in the Act. The 1996 Telecommunications Act introduced the term \"open video systems\" (OVS) for LECs competing with cable operators, exempting them from franchise fees. In 1999, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that while federal government couldn't require OVS operators to get a local franchise, state and local authorities could. AT&T and Verizon started building fiber networks in 2003 for advanced digital services, branding them as \"U-Verse\" and \"FiOS.\" They didn't launch video services under OVS rules due to cost concerns. In 2006, a federal court in California dismissed AT&T's claims about municipalities violating federal law by trying to regulate the company's video services. Two bills in Congress aimed to declare internet protocol video services subject only to federal regulation, but were not voted on. Local exchange carriers (LECs) sought statewide reforms for video distribution entry, bypassing individual municipal franchises. Cable operators argued state-level franchising would give new entrants fewer obligations. State-level franchising was introduced in Texas in 2005 to facilitate entry by new competitors in the video service market. Many other states have since adopted state-level franchising or offered providers a choice. The FCC has limited state and local authority over video service providers, with two orders issued in 2019. The FCC's 2019 Effective Competition Order determined that AT&T's streaming service, AT&T TV NOW, provides effective competition to local cable operators. The FCC also addressed state-level franchising laws, preempting local laws but not state laws regarding video franchises. The FCC found that LFAs demanding fees beyond the 5% franchise fee cap for new entrants are unreasonable. LFAs requiring unrelated \"in-kind\" contributions are also subject to the cap. Disputes over PEG service support costs could lead to LFAs unreasonably refusing competitive franchises. The FCC determined that costs related to supporting PEG access facilities are subject to a 5% cap, excluding capital costs for construction. LFAs cannot regulate LECs beyond video services and must not unreasonably refuse competitive franchises. In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the FCC's rules regarding cable operators' franchises. The FCC extended rules on franchise fees, PEG and institutional network obligations to incumbent operators, but exempted them from time limits on franchising decisions and build-out requirements. LFAs petitioned the FCC for clarification on these rules. The FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration in 2015 to clarify rules on franchising for city and county LFAs only, not state-level laws. They also included in-kind contributions within the 5% franchise fee cap and requested evidence to revisit state-level franchising in the future. The FCC clarified that payments for PEG access facilities are subject to a 5% franchise fee cap, unless they are considered \"capital costs.\" LFAs can only regulate incumbent cable operators' video services, not voice or data services. Certain LFA actions do not automatically constitute an unreasonable refusal to award video franchises. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit addressed challenges by LFAs to the FCC's rules on franchise fees. The court found that the FCC's rules only apply to city and county LFAs, not state franchising authorities. It determined that noncash contributions could be included in franchise fees subject to a 5% limit, but the FCC had not explained the inclusion of in-kind cable-related contributions within this cap. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit challenged the FCC's rules on franchise fees in 2017, finding that the rules only apply to city and county LFAs, not state franchising authorities. The court directed the FCC to provide a valid statutory basis for applying its rule to cable incumbents. In response, the FCC adopted its Third Report and Order in 2019, aiming to create a level playing field between new entrants and incumbent cable operators by preempting local regulations that impose an undue economic burden. The FCC's new regulations aim to create a level playing field between new entrants and incumbent cable operators by preempting local regulations that impose an undue economic burden. The rules state that franchise fees are capped at 5% and only ongoing and future in-kind contributions count towards this cap. The FCC encourages parties to negotiate franchise modifications within 120 days if agreements conflict with the new rules. Cable-related in-kind contributions are now considered franchise fees subject to the cap, with limited exceptions. The FCC's new regulations cap franchise fees at 5% and only ongoing and future in-kind contributions count towards this cap. Video providers must assign fair market value to cable-related in-kind contributions for calculating contributions. PEG \"capital costs\" subject to the cap include equipment purchases and construction costs, but not installation costs for delivering PEG services. Cable operators are required to build out their systems within the franchise area. Cable operators are required to build out their systems within the franchise area. Franchise authorities cannot regulate nonvideo services like broadband internet, business data services, and VoIP offered by cable operators. LFAs are preempted from charging more than 5% of gross revenue from cable services. Communities like Los Angeles, Portland, and Eugene have challenged FCC's rules in court. The FCC granted a motion to transfer consolidated appellate court challenges to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit in November 2019. The FCC's franchising rules will now cover states issuing franchises at the state-level and those overseeing municipal franchises. This expansion will impact more video service providers, viewers, and municipal governments. The inclusion of cable-related in-kind contributions in the definition of franchise fees subject to the 5% cap will affect some states. Some states and municipalities may need to reevaluate the trade-off between in-kind cable-related contributions and general fund revenues. Certain states define \"gross revenues\" more narrowly than the FCC, excluding revenues from advertising and home shopping commissions. This could impact the ability of PEGs to receive funding. LFAs define gross revenues more narrowly than the FCC, allowing PEGs to receive cable-related in-kind contributions without reducing monetary contributions within the 5% cap. Some states exclude advertising and home shopping commissions from gross revenues, affecting PEG funding. States vary in their definitions of gross revenues, impacting the amount of franchise fees charged by LFAs. Some states have more flexibility in evaluating video franchise terms and conditions, as they may exclude certain fees and contributions from revenue calculations. New York includes \"carrier service revenue\" in its gross revenue definition for franchise fees, leading to a dispute with Charter Communications. The FCC's new rules may impact a dispute in Brooklyn over whether \"carrier service revenue\" from \"additional provided services\" is subject to franchise fees. In July 2019, the New York State Public Service Commission settled a complaint against Charter for not expanding high-speed internet service as required. Charter must now expand to 145,000 residents in Upstate New York and invest $12 million in high-speed internet services. If Charter argues that FCC rules preempt these requirements, it could seek to renegotiate the settlement. The FCC referenced a case in Oregon where local authorities imposed fees beyond their authority. The court upheld a local government's 7% license fee on revenue from broadband services provided over a franchised cable system. States and municipalities may regulate video and voice services of telcos, but only video services of cable operators. The total number of U.S. households subscribing to cable and telco video services has declined over the past 10 years, with more households relying on video provided over broadband connections or broadcast transmission. The shift towards alternative sources of programming has led cable operators to focus on nonvideo services like voice and high-speed data to generate revenue. Video services accounted for 63% of cable industry revenue in 2010, but decreased to 46% in 2019. Other revenue sources are not under LFAs' jurisdiction according to FCC rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that cable operator's voice services are not subject to state regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the Minnesota Public Utility Commission's petition regarding this matter. In Missouri, a class action lawsuit was filed against satellite operators DIRECTV and DISH Network. A class action lawsuit has been filed against satellite operators DIRECTV, DISH Network, Netflix, and Hulu in Missouri for not paying required amounts to municipalities under the Video Services Providers Act. Other localities may also take legal action. Illinois and Massachusetts are considering bills to impose a 5% tax on video service revenues. Illinois and Massachusetts are considering bills to impose a 5% fee on streaming video services. The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act directed the FCC to develop a streamlined process for small cable operators to prove effective competition for their video services. In 2015, the FCC adopted a rebuttable presumption that cable operators are subject to effective competition, prohibiting franchising authorities from regulating basic cable rates unless they can prove otherwise. The FCC justified this change due to the availability of direct broadcast satellite service as an alternative video services provider. In 2015, LFAs in Massachusetts and Hawaii were allowed to regulate cable rates after demonstrating lack of effective competition. In 2018, Charter Communications asked the FCC to find that AT&T's DIRECTV NOW was not subject to effective competition. The FCC agreed that AT&T's DIRECTV NOW, now rebranded as AT&T TV NOW, competes effectively with cable systems in Kauai, HI, and 32 Massachusetts communities. The FCC's order granted Charter's petition, recognizing an online streaming service affiliated with a LEC as meeting the LEC test for effective competition. The FCC clarified that AT&T TV NOW does not need to be a LEC or offer telephone exchange service in the franchise areas to be considered a competitor to Charter in distributing video programming. The FCC adopted the LEC test for video programming distribution, not focused on facilities-based competition. Some localities have laws to reduce video service prices, like Maine's a la carte requirement. Cable operators and content providers sued to overturn the law, blocked by a federal judge in January 2020. These developments raise potential issues for Congress to consider regarding the FCC's interpretation of the Communications Act. Congress could consider whether the FCC's interpretation of the Communications Act aligns with policy goals and explore the impact of state and local regulations on PEG programming and I-Nets. Additionally, Congress could assess regulatory parity for cable and telcos' nonvideo services and address the inclusion of online video providers in definitions of video providers. Congress could clarify definitions of video providers for competition and franchise fees. They may need to specify regulations for online video services and address rate regulation for cable services. Maine's law allows consumers to pay for selected video programming instead of bundles. Congress could consider revisiting the issue of requiring video programming distributors to offer individual channels to consumers instead of bundles, or clarifying that states and local governments lack authority to enact such laws."
