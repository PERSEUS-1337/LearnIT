It includes provisions for the Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, judiciary, District of Columbia, and mandatory retirement accounts. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, except for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). President Obama's FY2017 budget request allocated $3.19 billion for independent agencies funded through the FSGG bill, including $330 million for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2017 on June 15, 2016.

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate consumer financial products. CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve and can request additional funding. The FSGG appropriations bill provided funding for independent agencies like GSA, SEC, CFTC, and USPS. The CFPB, funded by the Federal Reserve, may request additional funding. H.R. 5485 aimed to change CFPB's structure and funding, while S. 3067 did not include similar language. P.L. 115-31 did not alter the CFPB's structure or funding. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, including futures exchanges and swaps markets. The CFTC oversees futures exchanges, swaps markets, and industry personnel. Congressional jurisdiction remains with the Agriculture Committees. Dodd-Frank Act reforms addressed concerns over unregulated swaps markets after the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act led to reforms bringing previously unregulated swaps markets under CFTC oversight. The CFTC now regulates swaps markets with an estimated $240 trillion notional value in the US, in addition to the $34 trillion notional value in futures and options markets. Funding for the CFTC in FY2017 was $250 million, as enacted in FY2016. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is a regulatory agency focused on reducing consumer harm from various products. They create safety standards, work on voluntary standards with industries, ban unsafe products, monitor recalls, educate consumers, conduct research, and collaborate with governments. The Obama Administration requested $130.5 million in appropriations for the CPSC in FY2017, an increase from the previous year. The CPSC's budget for FY2017 could have totaled $135 million, including unobligated balances and reimbursements. The budget request included decreases for third-party testing costs and increases for data collection on product-related injuries, expansion of the Import Surveillance pilot program, and research on potential harm from nanotechnology. The CPSC's budget request for FY2017 included funding for research on potential harm from nanotechnology in consumer products and crumb rubber used in playgrounds and athletic fields. The request also sought authorization for an import surveillance user fee to cover part of the program's costs. The House passed a bill providing $121.3 million for the CPSC, $9.2 million less than the budget request, with allocations for specific programs and advisory committees. The CPSC's budget request for FY2017 included funding for research on potential harm from nanotechnology in consumer products and crumb rubber used in playgrounds and athletic fields. The House passed a bill providing $121.3 million for the CPSC, $9.2 million less than the budget request, with allocations for specific programs and advisory committees. Costs associated with creating advisory committees for imported products, consumer product recalls, and public disclosures of recalled products were discussed. No action could be taken on proposed rules until a study by the National Academy of Sciences was completed. The House Appropriations Committee directed the CPSC to continue efforts to reduce testing costs for children's products. S. 3067 would have provided $124 million for FY2017, with no restrictions on fund use. The Senate committee requested a report on developing better ROV safety standards through voluntary consultations. The CPSC is directed to develop better ROV safety standards through voluntary consultations with stakeholders and manufacturers. The Senate committee also requested a report on the commission's intentions for using mandatory processes to establish new rules for safe ROV design. Additionally, the CPSC is receiving $126.0 million in appropriations for FY2017, with $1.3 million allocated for the pool and spa safety program grants program. Section 501 of the administrative provisions bars the commission from finalizing or implementing the proposed rule on safety standards for ROVs until the National Academy of Sciences completes its study. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) to provide grant funding to states for election reform programs and testing voting machines. The EAC also publishes studies on election issues and promulgates voluntary guidelines for voting systems standards. The EAC was given rule-making authority under HAVA, transferring responsibilities from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to the EAC. President Obama's budget request for FY2017 included $9.6 million for the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), with $1.5 million allocated to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for voting system testing guidelines. H.R. 5485 proposed $4.9 million for the EAC, but the House Committee on Appropriations recommended transferring its functions to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The committee noted a vacant commissioner seat, most HAVA grants distributed, and no additional funds requested by President Obama. The committee recommended legislation to eliminate the EAC and transfer its functions to the FEC. P.L. 115-31 appropriated $9.6 million for the EAC, with $1.4 million transferred to NIST. The FCC regulates interstate and international communications. The FCC's budget is funded through regulatory fees collected from license holders and other entities, with the agency having the authority to adjust fees annually. For FY2017, the FCC requested $358 million, but P.L. 115-31 appropriated $356.7 million from regulatory fees.

The majority of the FEC budget is expected to be spent on three major expenses. The FEC budget for FY2017 was $80.5 million, with $8 million allocated for lease expenses. More than 90% of the budget was expected to be accounted for by salaries and benefits, rent, and information technology. Provisions related to campaign finance policy were included in the FSGG legislation. The House-passed version of H.R. 5485 would have prohibited spending appropriated funds to enforce a FECA provision known as the \"prior approval\" rule, which limits trade associations from soliciting member-companies' employees. P.L. 115-31 maintains the same funding amount as reported in S. 3067, includes an $8 million lease provision, and imposes restrictions on SEC and contractor disclosure. For more information on FEC and campaign finance issues, refer to CRS Report R41542 by R. Sam Garrett. The FTC's primary responsibilities are consumer protection and maintaining fair business practices. The FTC's main objectives are to protect consumers from deceptive practices and promote competition. Its funding sources include direct appropriations, HSR filing fees, and DNC registry fees. In FY2016, direct appropriations accounted for 55% of the budget. The FTC's FY2017 budget request totaled $342 million, with $35.1 million more than FY2016. 54% would go to protecting consumers and 46% to promoting competition. The $35.1 million increase would be used for maintaining operations, hiring new employees, and various programs. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about deceptive online advertising leading consumers to provide credit card information to fraudulent websites. H.R. 5485 would have provided $317 million in funding for the FTC in FY2017, with $177 million from direct appropriations, $125 million from HSR filing fees, and $15 million from DNC registry fees. In 2014, an estimated 15 million hotel bookings were made through fake websites, leading to the directive for the FTC to investigate deceptive activities in the online hotel booking market. The committee also highlighted the need for consumers to have access to legitimate credit education products and tools, expressing concern about the Credit Repair Organizations Act hindering such services. The FTC is required to submit a report on the benefits of unimpeded access to credit education services within 120 days of the bill's enactment. The bill would have provided $306.9 million in appropriations for the FTC in FY2017, with funds coming from various sources. The Senate committee also addressed issues related to sports concussions and the contact lens rule within the FTC's jurisdiction. The committee directed the FTC to review studies on sports-related concussions in youth and to prioritize safety in contact lens rules. They also urged for stronger enforcement against the sale of contact lenses with expired prescriptions and to distribute safety information. $313.0 million in funding was appropriated for FY2017, with $173 million for direct use. The FY2017 funding includes $173 million from direct appropriation, $125 million from HSR filing fees, and $25 million from DNC registry fees. The FTC is restricted from using funds to complete a draft report on food marketing to children without meeting specific requirements. The General Services Administration oversees federal procurement policies, property disposal, and management, funded through the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) from rental payments. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) receives revenue from rental payments for GSA space, which is used for construction, repairs, rental payments, and other building expenses. Congress sets limitations on FBF funds, and debts can be paid with these funds. A negative total occurs when available funds are less than expected revenue. GSA's operating accounts are funded separately from the FBF. President Obama proposed a limit of $10.2 billion from the FBF's available revenue for GSA's real property activities for FY2017, with an additional $362 million requested for GSA's operating accounts. H.R. 5485 as passed by the House would make $9.2 billion from the FBF available to GSA for FY2017, with $19.9 million redirected to other accounts. The House-passed bill would provide $9.2 billion from the FBF to GSA for FY2017, $954 million less than the request and $971 million below FY2016. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill would allocate $9.4 billion to GSA, $800 million less than Obama's request and $818 million below FY2016. P.L. 115-31 makes $8.8 billion available to GSA for FY2017, $1.3 billion less than Obama's request. The FSGG appropriations bill provides $254 million for GSA's operating accounts, $108 million less than the President's request and the same as the FY2016-enacted level. It includes funding for four agencies with personnel management functions: FLRA, MSPB, OPM, and OSC. FLRA administers and enforces the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, giving federal employees the right to join or form a union. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants federal employees the right to join or form a union and bargain collectively over employment terms. Certain agencies, like the FBI and CIA, are excluded from this statute. The FLRA, composed of a three-member authority and the FSIP, oversees the enforcement of the FSLMRS. Members of the FLRA and FSIP are appointed by the President with Senate approval for five-year terms. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants federal employees the right to join or form a union and bargain collectively over employment terms. The FLRA, composed of a three-member authority and the FSIP, oversees the enforcement of the FSLMRS. The FSIP resolves disputes over bargaining units, unfair labor practices, and representation elections. The General Counsel's office conducts representation elections, investigates unfair labor practices, and manages regional offices. The FSIP also resolves labor negotiation impasses between federal agencies and labor organizations. President Obama requested $27.1 million for the FLRA in FY2017, but appropriations were set at $26.2 million under P.L. 115-31. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) received $26.2 million in appropriations, $862,000 less than requested. The MSPB adjudicates appeals related to personnel actions, federal employee complaints, and retirement benefits. The Obama Administration requested $47.4 million for the MSPB in FY2017, including $45.1 million for salaries and expenses. This would fund 235 FTEs, a decrease of 13 FTEs from the previous year. The request aimed to fund pay raises and IT infrastructure projects. The House-passed bill would have provided $47.1 million for MSPB's IT infrastructure needs, $297,000 less than President Obama's request. The Senate-reported bill allocated $46.8 million for MSPB, $593,000 less than the request. P.L. 115-31 appropriated $47.1 million as in the House-passed bill. The Obama Administration requested almost $145 million for OPM salaries and expenses, including $37 million for IT infrastructure modernization. The budget requested $391,000 for acquisition workforce capacity and IT support, $145 million for trust fund transfers, $5.1 million for OIG salaries, and $26.9 million for OIG trust fund transfers for FY2017. OPM requested an increase in employment level to 6,191 FTEs for FY2017 to prioritize activities in support of the OPM strategic plan and implement network upgrades for security. The OIG budget will support audits and investigations of OPM programs, including cybersecurity defense and ongoing updates. The House-passed bill allocated funds for OPM salaries, trust fund transfers, OIG expenses, and IT infrastructure projects. The bill allocated funds for OPM salaries, trust fund transfers, and OIG expenses. It also requires a report on OPM's cybersecurity measures and improvements that could be made. The Senate-reported bill allocated funds for OPM salaries, trust fund transfers, and OIG expenses. It included directives for OPM to modernize the federal retirement process and improve cybersecurity measures. The allocated amounts were less than President Obama's request. The Senate committee directed OPM to provide monthly reports on modernization efforts, strategic technology plans, and IT security upgrades. Significant concerns remain regarding OPM's capital planning practices, contract procurement, and total cost of the IT infrastructure modernization project. The House committee directed OPM to provide quarterly progress reports on the NBIB implementation plan, costs, governance, and staffing needs. OPM OIG must report on NBIB implementation, transition of staff, costs, and recommendations within 12 months. The Senate report expressed concerns about the creation of NBIB, stating it is essentially a rebranding of FIS without comprehensive reforms. The House committee directed OPM to focus on critical functions like recruitment, retention, and workforce development, including seeking feedback to improve the recruitment process and reduce barriers to federal employment. The House committee directed OPM to report on steps to improve hiring of CyberCorps graduates and the impact of its Guidance for Agency-Specific Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking on federal agency leave policies. The report must include a summary of agency leave policies, safety precautions for survivors, and identify agencies not complying with OPM guidance. P.L. 115-31 provides appropriations for OPM salaries and expenses, trust fund transfers, and OIG salaries and expenses. The amounts allocated are lower than President Obama's request. The law does not include the requirement for a Comptroller General Report on OPM cybersecurity, but directs OPM to provide quarterly briefings on IT security improvements. The OPM is working on an infrastructure improvement project to enhance network security and upgrade legacy systems. Before using funds, they must consult with various agencies on the expenditure plan. The OPM IG will review the plan. Additionally, OPM is required to report on customer service staff increases for Retirement Services within 180 days. Mandatory appropriations for health benefits, life insurance, and retirement accounts are provided in the legislation. The Explanatory Statement details mandatory appropriations for health benefits, life insurance, and retirement accounts. Costs estimated by the Congressional Budget Office include $12.7 billion for Employee Health Benefits, $47.0 million for Employee Life Insurance, and $8.469 billion for the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The Senate-reported bill includes a provision on conflicts of interest for contractors conducting security clearance background investigations. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an independent federal agency focused on safeguarding the merit system. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an agency focused on safeguarding the merit system by protecting federal employees from prohibited personnel practices. The requested FY2017 appropriations for OSC were $26.5 million with an estimated FTE employment level of 155, an increase from the previous year. The funding was intended to address the rising demand for services, protect whistleblowers, and manage increasing case levels. The Senate-reported bill for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) would have appropriated $24.1 million, $2.4 million less than President Obama's request. The Senate committee expressed concerns about OSC's lack of investment in IT equipment and staffing, directing the agency to prioritize information security and report on its plan within 90 days. The committee also emphasized the need for OSC to allocate its budget proportionally to its caseload. P.L. 115-31 provides appropriations of $24.8 million for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), almost $1.8 million less than President Obama's request. The Senate bill matched the FY2017 request for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), while the House-passed bill would have appropriated an additional $1 million for the National Historic Publication and Records Commission (NHPRC). The Senate committee directed NARA officials to improve inventory controls and security in their facilities and urged efficient preservation of electronic records. The Senate report included requirements for NARA to manage email records in an accessible electronic format by December 31, 2016. NARA was also required to report on progress in digitizing and preserving archival records relocated between FY2014 and FY2016. The House committee added provisions for NARA to study private-sector records storage facilities and report to appropriations committees. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) manages the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF) to assist low-income credit unions in providing financial services to low-income communities. Loans, deposits, and technical assistance grants are available for these credit unions. The Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF) offers technical assistance grants to low-income credit unions for improving operations and addressing safety issues. The Obama Administration requested $2 million for the CDRLF, which was included in P.L. 115-31.

President Obama's FY2017 request for OGE was $16.1 million, which was appropriated in P.L. 115-31. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was reconstituted as an independent agency within the executive branch in 2007. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was reconstituted as an independent agency in 2007 and received its first funding in FY2009. The board's role includes ensuring privacy and civil liberties are considered in anti-terrorism efforts, reviewing implementation of related laws and policies, advising the President and executive branch on these issues, and providing annual reports to Congress on its activities. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) ensures privacy and civil liberties in anti-terrorism efforts, advises the President, and provides annual reports to Congress. The PCLOB's FY2017 budget was $10.1 million, with the SEC enforcing securities laws to protect investors and maintain fair markets. The Dodd-Frank Act offsets the SEC's appropriations with fees collected from securities exchanges. The agency's budget for FY2017 was $1.605 billion, including funds from a reserve fund established by the act for long-term expenses. The SEC reserve fund, funded by registration fees, has a cap of $100 million. In FY2016, $25 million was rescinded from the fund. H.R. 5485 proposed rescinding $75 million in FY2017, while S. 3067 did not. P.L. 115-31 rescinded $25 million. The Selective Service System is an independent agency for military manpower needs. The Selective Service System is an independent agency that serves the emergency manpower needs of the military by conscripting personnel when directed by Congress and the President. Most males aged 18 through 25 in the United States are required to register with the SSS. The draft was terminated in 1973, but there have been discussions about standby draft registration for both men and women. The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service was established to review the Selective Service System and determine if it should continue to exist. Women are now allowed to serve in combat units, which may lead to modifications in registration to include women. The Selective Service System (SSS) funding has remained stable in absolute dollars but decreased in inflation-adjusted funding. The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs to assist small businesses, including loan guarantees, low-interest loans for disaster victims, training programs, and advocacy within the federal government. The Small Business Administration (SBA) requested $877.9 million for FY2017, including funds for salaries, entrepreneurial development, business loan administration, disaster assistance, and other programs. The Obama Administration also requested authorization levels for various loan guaranty programs. H.R. 5485 proposed $883.4 million for the SBA, slightly more than the Obama Administration's request. The House bill proposed $5.5 million more than the Obama Administration's request for the Small Business Administration (SBA) budget. It included authorization levels for various loan guaranty programs. S. 3067 as reported would have appropriated $871.2 million for the SBA for FY2017, $6.7 million less than the Obama Administration's request. The P.L. 115-31 appropriates $886.8 million for the SBA for FY2017, including funding for entrepreneurial development, administrative expenses, loan programs, disaster assistance, and other initiatives. Authorization levels are set for various loan guaranty programs, with rescinded unobligated balances for the 504/CDC loan guaranty program. The U.S. Postal Service generates funding through mail user charges, with Congress providing appropriations for revenue forgone in providing free mailing privileges. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act authorized appropriations for this purpose and a $29 million annual reimbursement until 2035 for lost revenue during the phase-in period. Appropriated funds are deposited in the Postal Service Fund for operating expenses. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) affects the postal appropriations process, requiring USPSOIG and PRC to submit budget requests to Congress and OMB. Funding for these agencies comes from the Postal Service Fund. In FY2017, USPS requested $63.6 million, $8.5 million more than FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $41.2 million, nearly $14 million below the request. The House-passed bill would have provided $41.2 million, nearly $14 million below USPS's FY2016 appropriation, while the Senate committee bill would have provided $48.4 million, about $6.7 million below the appropriation. P.L. 115-31 provides USPS $34.7 million, $29 million less than the request and $20.4 million less than FY2016 appropriation. USPSOIG requested $258.8 million for FY2017, $10.2 million more than FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $258 million for USPSOIG, $9.4 million more than FY2016, and $0.8 million below its FY2017 request. The Senate committee bill would have provided USPSOIG with $258.6 million, $4 million more than FY2016, and $6.2 million below its FY2017 request. P.L. 115-31 provides USPSOIG $253.6 million, $5.2 million less than its request and $5 million more than FY2016. The PRC's FY2017 request was $17.7 million, $2.5 million more than FY2016. The House-passed bill allocated $16.2 million, $1 million above FY2016, while the Senate committee bill allocated $15.2 million, the same as FY2016. P.L. 115-31 provided $16.2 million, $1.5 million less than the request. It also renewed postal policy provisions such as six-day mail delivery and free mail for overseas voting and the blind. The Senate committee report recommended preserving key postal policies, such as free mail for overseas voting and the blind, prohibiting fees for child support agencies seeking addresses, and preventing the consolidation of small post offices. Additionally, the USPS was directed to conduct area impact analyses before resuming processing plant consolidations. The FY2017 budget proposed extending appropriations policies, except for six-day mail delivery, and the Obama Administration suggested operational reforms to enhance efficiency and revenue. The Obama Administration proposed reforms to improve USPS efficiencies, reduce expenses, and increase revenue. This includes moving to five-day delivery under certain conditions, changing mail delivery methods, and extending price increases. Additionally, changes were suggested for USPS's retirement and health benefit liabilities. The Obama Administration proposed reforms to improve USPS efficiencies, reduce expenses, and increase revenue, including codifying missed RHBF payments and reducing repayment during the 40-year amortization to 80% of the total liability. This would save USPS $18.6 billion through 2026, with continued payments required after the amortization period. President Obama's FY2017 budget aimed to provide USPS with over $27 billion in cash relief, operational savings, and revenue through 2020. The United States Tax Court (USTC) is an independent judicial body with jurisdiction over various tax matters, receiving $51 million in FY2016 and a requested $54 million for FY2017. President Obama requested $54 million for FY2017, $3 million more than FY2016. H.R. 5485 proposed $51 million for FY2017, $3 million less than the request.

The FY2017 budget proposal includes new provisions such as adjustments to discretionary spending limits and amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act to protect active duty military members. The FY2017 budget proposal includes new provisions to protect active duty military members by defining appropriate proof of identity. The provision will be effective on October 1, 2018. The House and Senate bills had provisions on U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba, but these were not included in the final law. The House bill aimed to block aspects of the Obama Administration's Cuba policy, while the Senate bill sought to lift some U.S. sanctions on Cuba. Bill strongly objected to four provisions tightening sanctions on Cuba, stating they would undermine the President's policy of improving the lives of the Cuban people. The provisions in the House bill would have restricted travel, commerce, and trademarks related to Cuba. Section 132 would have banned educational travel to Cuba, Section 133 would have prohibited dealing with confiscated Cuban government property, and Section 134 would have banned financial transactions with Cuban military entities. The House bill included provisions tightening sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on travel, commerce, and trademarks. Section 135 would have prohibited Treasury Department licensing for trademarks related to confiscated Cuban assets, specifically in a dispute over the Havana Club trademark. In January 2016, OFAC issued a specific license for a Cuban company to make payments related to trademark renewal. OFAC issued a specific license for the Cuban company to make payments for the renewal of the Havana Club trademark, which was subsequently renewed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office until 2026. The Senate bill aimed to ease sanctions on U.S. agricultural exports, travel, telecommunications services, and services for foreign air carriers flying to and from Cuba.
