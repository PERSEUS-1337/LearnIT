    "content": "The report provides background information on the San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ship program and issues for Congress in 2011. Congress needed to decide on funding for the 11th LPD-17 ship, whether to use its design for the LSD(X) class, and whether to procure a 12th LPD-17. These decisions could impact Navy and Marine Corps capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. The primary function of Navy amphibious ships is to transport U.S. Marines and their equipment to distant areas for expeditionary operations. These ships have large storage spaces and can use helicopters and landing craft for transferring supplies without port facilities. Some Navy amphibious ships are forward-deployed in overseas areas and organized into amphibious ready groups. Navy amphibious ships are often organized into three-ship formations called amphibious ready groups (ARGs) for expeditionary operations. The Navy's planned 313-ship fleet includes a 33-ship amphibious force to meet the Marine Corps' goal of having enough capacity to lift two Marine Expeditionary Brigades (MEBs). The Navy's planned 313-ship fleet includes a 33-ship amphibious force to meet the Marine Corps' goal of having enough capacity to lift two Marine Expeditionary Brigades (MEBs). Marine Corps and Navy officials agree that a 38-ship amphibious force would more fully meet the Marine Corps' 2.0 MEB AE amphibious lift requirement, but they have accepted the operational risks associated with having a 33-ship force instead. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes various classes of amphibious ships, such as the Tarawa class, San Antonio class, Austin class, and Whidbey Island/Harpers Ferry class. The LPD-17 program was initiated to replace older amphibious ships, with LPD-17s primarily built by Huntington Ingalls Industries. The LPD-17 program, primarily built by Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), experienced cost growth, schedule delays, and construction problems. The first ship in the program had a 70% cost growth and delays of about two years in design and construction. The first two ships were delivered to the Navy incomplete with numerous construction problems identified. The Navy has been working to overcome construction problems on LPD-17 ships and is reporting success. Plans for a new class of amphibious ship called LSD(X) starting in FY2017 to replace aging ships. Some suggest using LPD-17 design for LSD(X), but Navy officials lean towards developing a new design. Consideration for procuring a 12th LPD-17 in FY2014 or FY2015 to keep production line open. The Navy is considering funding for the procurement of an 11th LPD-17 amphibious ship in FY2012. Congress is debating whether to approve the funding request and whether to use the LPD-17 design for the new LSD(X) ship. There is also discussion about funding a 12th LPD-17 in FY2014 or FY2015 to keep the production line open. Supporters argue that using the LPD-17 design as the basis for the LSD(X) could reduce design costs and production risks. They suggest procuring a 12th LPD-17 to keep the production line open until LSD(X) production starts in FY2017. An amphibious force with 12 LPD-17s and 10 LSD(X)s could meet the amphibious lift goal, with features optimized for this configuration. The potential cost-reduction advantages of using the existing LPD-17 production learning curve for the LSD(X) outweigh the benefits of staging a competition between shipyards. Skeptics argue that it is too early to determine if an LPD-17-based LSD(X) would meet operational requirements, and that it could be bigger and more expensive than necessary. They suggest that a new LSD(X) design could incorporate newer technologies more effectively. Skeptics argue that an all-new LSD(X) design could better incorporate newer technologies and reduce crew size compared to an LPD-17 based design. They believe that staging a competition for the all-new LSD(X) design would be more cost-effective and prevent any shipbuilder from having a bidding advantage. This was discussed at a May 6, 2010, hearing on Navy shipbuilding programs. The 2011-2015 shipbuilding plan includes procuring the final San Antonio class amphibious ship in 2012. The 30-year shipbuilding plan for 2017 involves starting procurement for a replacement for aging amphibious ships. The Navy aims to reuse design and hull forms for affordability in new programs. The timing for the LSD(X) replacement is ahead of need, with concerns about the industrial base. The Navy is looking at replacing the LSD(X) ship earlier than planned to address concerns with the industrial base. They are determining the requirements for the replacement ship and considering if the LPD 17 hull form is sufficient. Affordability and capability will be evaluated to decide between a new start or reusing existing designs. The Navy's proposed FY2012 budget includes funding for the final San Antonio (LPD-17) class ship procurement. The Navy's proposed FY2012 budget includes funding for the final San Antonio (LPD-17) class ship procurement, with $1,847.4 million needed to complete the ship's estimated procurement cost of $2,031.4 million. The House Armed Services Committee recommended approval of the Navy's request for FY2012 procurement funding for the LPD-17 program, emphasizing the need for a minimum of 33 amphibious ships. S. 1867 recommended approval of Navy's FY2012 procurement funding for the LPD-17 program, superseding S. 1253. The conference report on H.R. 1540 recommended reducing Navy's funding by $10 million. The Navy's FY2012 procurement funding for the LPD-17 program was recommended to be reduced by $10 million for \"Excess ECO funding\" in H.R. 2055. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended approving the Navy's FY2012 request for procurement funding for the LPD-17 program. The committee also noted the budget request for preliminary design efforts for the LHA 8 amphibious assault ship, which is planned for procurement in fiscal year 2016. The Department of the Navy plans to reintroduce a well deck and optimize the aviation capability of LHA 8 to meet increasing demands for amphibious assault ships. The Committee directs the Department of the Navy to fully fund advance planning and design of LHA 8 for cost-effective construction of a large deck amphibious assault ship to meet combatant commander needs. Marine Corps' goal for amphibious lift is to have enough lift capacity for two assault echelons. The Marine Corps aims to have enough lift capacity for two Marine Expeditionary Brigades (MEBs) to land simultaneously, reflecting their responsibilities in U.S. regional war plans. A MEB is a Marine air-ground task force of 14,484 Marines and their equipment. The assault echelon (AE) of a MEB is the initial part to go ashore, while the assault follow-on echelon (AFOE) follows later. Marine Corps doctrine dictates that the AE goes ashore from amphibious ships, while the AFOE goes ashore from less-survivable sealift ships controlled by the Military Sealift Command. The Department of Defense has changed its amphibious lift goals multiple times since the Korean War, with the most recent reduction occurring in 2006 to 2.0 MEB AEs. This reduction is deemed acceptable by Marine Corps officials due to plans to field a new squadron of 14 next-generation maritime prepositioning force ships called the Maritime Prepositioning Force of the Future (MPF(F)). The MPF(F) squadron, consisting of sealift ships, is designed to support an additional MEB ashore. These ships are not intended for assault operations but are cost-effective and prepositioned at sea for extended periods. The Navy's amphibious ship force and MPF(F) squadron together provide 3.0 MEB AEs of lift, equivalent to 30,165 troops. The Marine Corps aims for a force of 33 amphibious ships to meet the 2.0 MEB AE amphibious lift goal. The Marine Corps aims for a force of 33 amphibious ships, including 11 LHAs/LHDs, 11 LSD-41/49 class ships, and 11 LPD-17s. To meet the 2.0 MEB AE amphibious lift goal, the 33-ship requirement was derived from the lift capabilities of the Navy's current amphibious ships. Initially, a 19-ship total was reduced to 17 operational ships, then further reduced to 15 operational ships in mid-2007, with 5 of each kind. This 15-ship force requires about 20% of the MEB AE's vehicles to be shifted to the AFOE, creating operational risk. The Marine Corps aims for a force of 33 amphibious ships, including 11 LHAs/LHDs, 11 LSD-41/49 class ships, and 11 LPD-17s. Initially, a 19-ship total was reduced to 15 operational ships\u20145 of each kind. This reduction creates operational risk as it requires shifting about 20% of the MEB AE's vehicles and cargo to the AFOE. Maintaining a force of 30 operational ships would be necessary to provide lift for 2.0 MEB AEs. The Marine Corps aims to maintain a force of 33 amphibious ships, including 11 of each kind. To lift 2.0 MEB AEs, a total of 30 operational ships would be needed, requiring an additional 15% in total inventory. This figure was rounded down to 33 ships. Table A-3 outlines the number of amphibious ships needed for different MEB goals, with 37 ships required for 2.0 MEB AEs using 17 operational ships per MEB. In April 2009, the Navy revised the number of amphibious ships needed to meet the 2.0 MEB AE to 38 ships, including 17 ships for each MEB plus four additional ships to account for maintenance. Marine Corps testimony in 2008 highlighted the reduction in amphibious lift from 3.0 MEB AE to 2.0 MEB AE due to strategic guidance. The Navy and Marine Corps have determined the need for thirty-four amphibious warfare ships to meet the Nation's requirements, with each Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) requiring seventeen ships. Despite fiscal constraints, they have agreed on this ship requirement. Given fiscal constraints, the Navy and Marine Corps have agreed to limit the assault echelon of each Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) to fifteen ships, totaling thirty operationally available amphibious warfare ships. This includes ten aviation-capable big deck ships, ten LPD 17 class ships, and ten LSD class ships to accommodate Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) capabilities. A minimum of eleven ships of each type is required to meet the thirty-ship availability rate, totaling thirty-three ships. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) has approved the requirement for thirty-three amphibious warfare ships, which are essential for meeting maritime demands in harsh environments. The LPD 17 San Antonio class of amphibious warfare ships is crucial for the Navy's modern expeditionary power projection fleet. It replaces older ship classes and is essential for meeting the 2.0 MEB AE amphibious lift requirement. The procurement of the tenth and eleventh LPDs is a priority to fulfill the minimum ship requirement. The SAN ANTONIO Class LPD (LPD 17) is a crucial part of the Navy's modern expeditionary fleet, replacing older ship classes. Lessons learned from early ships are being applied to improve quality in construction. Five ships have been delivered, with four more under construction. The tenth ship's construction contract was recently awarded, and the eleventh is planned for procurement in FY 2012. Ships of the class have deployed seven times, with two currently on deployment. The SAN ANTONIO Class LPD (LPD 17) has deployed seven times, with two ships currently on deployment. USS NEW ORLEANS LPD 18 has completed two successful overseas deployments, while USS MESA VERDE (LPD 19) has also completed two successful overseas deployments. LPD 19 is currently deployed overseas, and USS GREEN BAY (LPD 20) is on her first overseas deployment. LPD 18 and USS NEW YORK (LPD 21) are operational in their homeport areas. LPD 17 is undergoing post-deployment repairs, and LPD 21 received praise for its performance during an inspection by the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV). The Navy and Industry have made significant progress in correcting early design and construction issues on the LPD 17 Class ships. Initial problems with pipe welding quality, engine alignment, lube oil cleanliness, and bearing wear led to unplanned repairs and overhauls. These issues, along with crew size and training methods, decreased reliability and operational availability. The ships were rated as not operationally suitable during initial testing in 2007-2008. Follow-on testing started in July 2010. The Navy and shipbuilder have implemented initiatives to address quality issues in ship construction. The shipbuilder revised welding, quality, and production processes, re-trained their workforce, and improved oil flushing procedures to ensure consistency and quality across all shipbuilding facilities. The shipyard has made improvements to the oil system, lube oil filters, and strainers to remove contaminants. They have also implemented stricter flushing procedures and enhanced pipe cleaning processes to maintain cleanliness. The Navy has improved lube oil sampling and analysis processes, which are now part of the ship construction process. The shipbuilder is responsible for ensuring overall quality through quality management practices. The shipbuilder utilizes a Quality Management System (QMS) for overall quality control, including Quality Control and Quality Assurance. The Ship Wide Area Network (SWAN) design, based on 1990's ATM technology, experienced failures and is being replaced by Gigabit Ethernet technology. LPD 17, 18, and 21 have successfully implemented the Gig-E SWAN with no reported failures. LPD 19, 20, and future ships will receive the upgrade. Initial reliability issues with engine controls, ship controls, and interior communications systems have been addressed. The ship controls and interior communications systems have undergone major software upgrades and replacement of obsolete parts with current technology hardware. Government oversight by the Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Gulf Coast has been increased, with a focus on Quality Assurance. QA weld inspectors have been re-trained and re-certified, and QA oversight has been enhanced across all production phases. The QA organization has been restructured to include more surveillance of work in progress and compliance with ship construction procedures. A new training program has been implemented for QA specialists. SSGC has implemented critical process pulse audits to ensure production quality in shipbuilding areas. Navy metrics aligned with shipbuilder for performance assessment. NAVSEA sent QA expert teams to assess QA oversight and production quality. Focus is on sustaining performance and strengthening crew training for critical systems. The LPD 17 Class crew training has evolved to include traditional shore-based schoolhouses for critical systems, resulting in a blended approach of classroom, on-ship, and computer-based training. The Ship Manning Document approved an increase in crew size to 381 from the original 360. The LPD 17 Class System Sustainability Strike Team was established in FY 2009 to address system design, production/quality, and maintenance issues identified in recent reports and shipboard operations. Lessons learned from this initiative are being implemented. The Navy is addressing quality and reliability issues on early ships of the LPD 17 Class through ship construction improvements, increased manning, and crew training. Recent success on LPD 21 shows progress in addressing these issues. Quality problems with repairs on various ships are being addressed with additional oversight to ensure compliance with maintenance and repair specifications. The LPD-17 program experienced significant cost growth, with the first ship seeing a 70% increase in costs. Follow-on ships were initially estimated at $750 million each but ended up costing between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The Navy estimates the procurement cost of the 11th ship at $2.04 billion. The decision to reduce the program's sustaining procurement rate contributed to some of the cost growth. The LPD-17 program experienced significant cost growth, with the first ship seeing a 70% increase in costs. Construction problems led to delays in the delivery of ships, with significant construction deficiencies found during Navy inspections. Delivery of ships was accepted with a significant amount of construction work still remaining. The Navy accepted delivery of LPD-19 with 45,000 hours of construction work remaining, which was 0.4% of the total hours needed to build the ship. This decision was made to allow for operational evaluation, post-delivery tests, and to avoid delays in the construction of other ships at the shipyard. The Navy reduced costs by having repair shipyards perform remaining construction work on LPD-17, saving $108 million. This work was funded through the post-delivery part of the outfitting/post-delivery line item in the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account. The reported end cost of LPD-17 will understate the ship's actual construction cost by $108 million. The Navy saved $108 million by having repair shipyards complete construction work on LPD-17. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported challenges in stabilizing designs for LPD 17 and the Littoral Combat Ship, leading to construction delays and rework. The Navy's reliance on an immature design tool caused problems affecting the lead ship's design in the LPD 17 program. The lead ship in the LPD class was delivered incomplete with mechanical failures, resulting in lower capability. Recent sea trials revealed problems with steering system, reverse osmosis units, computing network, and electrical system. Navy inspectors found unfinished ship spaces and safety concerns. Over $1.75 billion invested in LPD 17 construction. Commissioned in 2006, with ongoing issues reported in 2007. The first LPD-17 ship had thousands of construction deficiencies reported in April 2007. Secretary of the Navy expressed deep concerns about Northrop Grumman's performance in a letter dated June 22, 2007, regarding the construction of LPD 17 Class vessels. NGSS's inefficiency and mismanagement of LPD 17 and LPD 18 have caused significant delays and quality problems for the Navy, leading to unacceptable delays in obtaining deployable assets. The Navy has been forced to take delivery of ships with serious deficiencies, resulting in the need for work to be completed or redone by other shipyards. The persistent shortcomings at NGSS yards are troubling and have put the Navy in an untenable position. LPD-17.\" The Navy is concerned about the persistent shortcomings at NGSS yards, especially with LPD 17 & 18, and aims for future ships to be free of quality problems. Management focus is crucial for successful delivery of the remaining class. Dr. Etter will closely monitor metrics with NGSS and the acquisition team. Sugar expressed agreement with the need to improve shipyards and produce high-quality LPD 17 class vessels. Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC) faces challenges in meeting U.S. Navy needs, with CEO Ron Sugar acknowledging performance issues in a $13.6-billion amphibious ship program. Changes in acquisition strategy, funding instability, and design team issues contributed to the problems. Hurricane Katrina also impacted Northrop's performance. The Navy emphasizes the importance of improving shipyards and delivering high-quality LPD 17 class vessels. Northrop Grumman Corp faced challenges meeting U.S. Navy needs, with CEO Ron Sugar acknowledging performance issues in a $13.6-billion amphibious ship program. Hurricane Katrina severely damaged Northrop's shipyards in the Gulf region in 2005, exacerbating the situation. Sugar vowed to invest in training and managing operations to produce high-quality Navy ships efficiently. Despite the challenges, Northrop is committed to incorporating lessons learned into operational plans for new ships. The Navy praised Northrop's work on a destroyer damaged by Hurricane Katrina, calling it one of the best ships ever delivered. Sugar highlighted ongoing efforts to improve training and quality. Northrop officials promised substantial investment to improve training, quality, processes, productivity, and facilities at Gulf Coast shipyards. They are aggressively reworking schedules for ship deliveries affected by the hurricane. Navy officials are cautiously optimistic about the LPD-17 construction effort stabilizing, with the third ship, Mesa Verde, commissioned without significant problems. The San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock program is on track for deployment. The San Antonio class ship faced difficulties during construction, with costs doubling from initial forecasts. Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding acquired Avondale Industries in an attempt to fix design issues caused by a new computer program. Northrop Grumman later acquired the shipyards. Multiple managers struggled to control design changes and costs, leading to major delays. The San Antonio class ship faced construction difficulties with costs doubling from initial forecasts. The first two ships had numerous defects, requiring extra costs for fixes. The New Orleans ship was also incomplete due to Hurricane Katrina's impact on the shipyard. However, the Mesa Verde was built smoothly at Northrop Grumman's Ingalls shipyard, setting a new standard for the LPD class. Captain Beth Dexter praised the Mesa Verde as a complete ship. In 2008, the LPD 17 program showed signs of improvement with ships meeting new milestones after Hurricane Katrina. The program is seen as getting back on track, with the first ship entering the fleet soon. Despite historical difficulties with lead ships, the program is aiming to surpass expectations in the future. The maiden deployment of LPD-17 was delayed by two days due to problems with the hydraulic system. The amphibious transport dock New Orleans (LPD-18) was reported to be incomplete and unable to carry Marines into battle, with various operational issues. The New Orleans (LPD-18) was reported to have serious deficiencies in its well deck and vehicle stowage areas, unreliable propulsion system, communication equipment issues, and problems with its missile launchers during testing. The ship's maiden deployment was imminent despite these operational issues. The New Orleans (LPD-18) had ship-wide electrical problems similar to the San Antonio, with deficiencies in cable installation. This adds to the issues found in three ships built at Northrop Grumman's shipyards, including the Makin Island (LHD-8) which had delivery delays due to wiring problems. Northrop Grumman agreed to cover the $360 million cost for fixing the issues. Northrop Grumman did not comment on ships already delivered to the Navy but stated that the San Antonio class is constantly improving, with significant enhancements in all areas including electrical systems. The latest LPD, Green Bay, was more complete than previous ships at acceptance trials, showcasing the benefits of series ship production. The Navy is transitioning to serial production to address previous survey results indicating incomplete work on the first two LPD-17-class ships. The Navy faced challenges with incomplete work on the USS San Antonio (LPD-17) and USS New Orleans (LPD-18), leading to early deliveries due to financial constraints. The Navy is transitioning to serial production to address these issues and improve ship quality. The Navy and Northrop Grumman faced challenges with incomplete deliveries on LPD-17 and LPD-18, but successfully completed LPD-19 (USS Mesa Verde). LPD-19 completed shock trials without surprises, while LPD-20 (USS Green Bay) was just delivered. Despite challenges, the Navy is in serial production and ships are being delivered. In October 2008, the U.S. Navy's third and fourth San Antonio-class amphibious transport docks showed improvement over the first two ships. The third ship, Mesa Verde [LPD-19], was more complete when accepted in 2007. The fourth ship, Green Bay [LPD-20], received high praise for being a well-built and capable ship. The third and fourth San Antonio-class amphibious transport docks, Mesa Verde and Green Bay, showed improvement over the first two ships. Despite some problems, the overall build quality and performance of the new ships were much better, with fewer issues in shipwide networks and electrical systems. Both new ships also had no major problems with their propulsion systems. The San Antonio and New Orleans had major problems with berthing spaces, broken gear, and nonfunctioning weapons, but Mesa Verde and Green Bay did not. San Antonio has improved over the years and had no major issues during its recent deployment with the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group. In November 2008, San Antonio underwent maintenance in Bahrain due to leaks in its lube oil piping system. The amphibious transport dock San Antonio underwent maintenance in Bahrain for two weeks due to lube oil deficiencies in the diesel generators. Leaks in the system were discovered during maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf. Experts confirmed the issue was limited to LPD-17 only. Experts have criticized the workmanship on the amphibious transport dock San Antonio, calling it \"sloppy,\" \"unacceptable,\" and \"criminal.\" Despite finger-pointing, the Navy is facing a serious problem with the ship's major oil leaks. The Navy Secretary has been briefed on the issue, and the shipbuilder is defending its work while promising to make fixes. Questions remain about how this was allowed to happen and if other problems are present. Shipbuilder Northrop Grumman is taking corrective actions in response to the criticism. The shipbuilder defended their performance on the amphibious transport dock San Antonio, stating they take quality seriously and are implementing corrective actions for oil leaks. They are conducting a comprehensive review of procedures to ensure conformance with Navy requirements. The Navy is working to fully determine the cause of issues on the San Antonio ship and is seeking long-term corrective actions. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are also monitoring the situation, with concerns raised about systemic problems with the ship's construction. Rep. Joe Sestak expressed worry about the impact on sailors, while naval analyst Norman Polmar criticized the Navy for accepting the ship. Norman Polmar criticized the Navy for accepting the San Antonio ship, calling it criminal. He believes the ship should be towed back to the shipyard. Those familiar with the situation do not blame the crew or Navy engineers, comparing the issue to discovering a flaw in a car's chassis during a road trip. Even the Board of Inspection and Survey would not have found faulty welds, according to a Navy source. The Navy source mentioned that even the Board of Inspection and Survey would not have found the faulty welds on the ship. Cmdr. Jensin Sommer explained that their command certifies units for deployment and integrated training with carrier and expeditionary strike groups. Pat Dolan, a spokeswoman for Naval Sea Systems Command, confirmed the damage but declined to provide details on the photos that were leaked. She mentioned that a team of engineers, pipefitters, and welders were flown to Bahrain to assist with repairs, which are expected to be completed by mid- to late November. No cost estimates or progress reports were available as of November 13. Engineers are still working on repairs for the faulty welds on the ship, with some sections of pipe needing replacement. Concerns are raised about other potential problems due to the welding issues. Retired captain Jan van Tol is surprised by the oil leaks from major points on the ship, as leaks are usually associated with moving parts. Repair team size and the nature of the casualty are notable. Van Tol is surprised by the oil leaks on the ship and questions the craftsmanship and oversight that allowed the ship to reach this point. He emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation into how the Navy accepted the ship despite potential systemic problems. Sestak, a former three-star, emphasizes the need for a harsh examination of the defense acquisition process and believes the issues on the San Antonio reflect a larger breakdown in the defense industry. He questions how the ship was allowed to deploy with systemic problems that would take weeks to fix. Sestak, a former three-star, emphasizes the need for a harsh examination of the defense acquisition process and believes the issues on the San Antonio reflect a larger breakdown in the defense industry. He questions how the ship was allowed to deploy with systemic problems that would take weeks to fix, highlighting the need for institutional processes to be reevaluated for better outcomes. The Navy's experience with the San Antonio is deemed scandalous and worthy of investigation by naval analyst Polmar. He compares it to the infamous Air Force tanker deal that resulted in jail time for individuals involved. Polmar highlights the risks to sailors' lives due to the problematic ship and emphasizes the need for accountability similar to the tanker deal. The repeated issues with such a new warship are particularly concerning, with visible leaks through welds raising safety concerns. The Navy's experience with the San Antonio is concerning, with visible oil leaks through welds on a relatively new ship. Naval historian compares it to other problematic Navy programs like the littoral combat ship and DDG 1000. Navy Secretary expresses dissatisfaction with the ship's performance and calls for accountability in Navy acquisitions. The Navy is addressing issues with the lube oil system on the USS San Antonio, with maintenance personnel in Bahrain working on repairs. Problems include improperly installed pipe hangers and weld issues. The Navy is taking steps to prevent similar issues on other amphibious ships in the class. Repairs to the USS San Antonio are 50 percent complete due to improperly installed pipe hangers and weld issues. The lube oil system problem has prompted a class-wide review, including inspection of weld quality and pipe supports on other ships in the class. Engineering analysis and shipboard inspections are ongoing to address the issue. The inspections on the USS San Antonio revealed lube oil leaks in the machinery spaces. Weld inspections in one machinery room have been completed and deemed good. Pipe hanger inspections have also been completed, with necessary repairs to be done before the ship's deployment next year. The Navy is also reviewing weld inspection techniques used in shipyards for training purposes. Northrop Grumman Ship Systems is focusing on improving the quality of work in the shipyard, particularly in the fabrication and installation of pipes and weld joints. The company is reviewing processes from material receipt to testing and inspection to identify areas for improvement. This initiative is taken seriously by the company. Northrop Grumman Ship Systems is committed to ensuring quality work in the shipyard, with a rigorous program in place to meet Navy requirements. Immediate action is taken when issues arise, including addressing lube oil leaks on LPD-17 and conducting a comprehensive review of procedures. The company is proactively assisting the Navy and implementing corrective actions while determining the cause of the problem. Northrop Grumman is working with the Navy to determine the cause of lube oil leaks on LPD-17 and implement corrective actions. The company builds San Antonio-class amphibious ships at its shipyards in Pascagoula, Miss., and New Orleans. LPD-20 has been delivered, with LPD-21 through -25 under construction. Lessons learned from LPD-17 have been applied to LPD-21, which is currently undergoing a lube oil system flush. The Navy has funded LPD-26 in the FY '09 defense bill. LPD-21 is undergoing a lube oil system flush, with lessons learned from LPD-17 being applied. LPD-18 is on the West Coast preparing for deployment next year, LPD-19 is in Norfolk for maintenance, and LPD-20 is currently being inspected by the Navy. The Navy is currently inspecting LPD-20 after completing an engineering certification. The inspection results look promising, with a significant reduction in trial cards compared to previous ships in the San Antonio-class program. The LPD-17 and LPD-18 ships underwent inspections by INSURV, resulting in over 16,000 and just under 14,000 trial cards, respectively. The USS San Antonio required $36 million for Post Shakedown Authority. LPD-19 showed a significant decrease in trial cards compared to previous ships in the program. The USS Mesa Verde (LPD-20) saw a 90 percent decrease in Part 1 cards during its INSURV inspection, credited to the builder and Navy team's efforts. The Navy's Supervisor of Ships conducts the first trial, incorporating lessons from previous inspections to address deficiencies. The shipyard also plays a role in rolling in these lessons during the trial process. The LPD-17 class ships are being built in two different yards, making it challenging to incorporate lessons learned from previous ships. Lessons from LPD-17 and -18 have been applied out of sequence on follow-on ships, impacting the efficiency of the process. The LPD-17 class ships are being built in two different yards, making it challenging to incorporate lessons learned from previous ships. Earlier INSURV trials were rolled into these follow ships, affecting the efficiency of the process due to the close construction sequence. This impacts the number of changes that can be made and increases the cost of work as the ship gets closer to delivery. The three, two, one rule applies, where tasks take longer to complete as the ship progresses towards completion. The USS New York (LPD-21) and follow ships are improving efficiency by doing work in sequence and increasing pre-outfitting on units. This allows for more learning and leverage, reducing the cost of work as the ship nears completion. The efficiency of work on the USS New York (LPD-21) and subsequent ships is increasing by conducting more pre-outfitting work upfront, reducing installation work later on. This approach allows for improved learning and cost reduction as the ships near completion. Pentagon acquisition czar John Young criticized the welds on the Northrop Grumman-built San Antonio. Pentagon acquisition czar John Young criticized the welds on the Northrop Grumman-built San Antonio (LPD-17) due to issues with the ship's lube oil piping system during its first deployment in Bahrain. The Navy is investigating the problems, with concerns whether they are specific to the San Antonio or the entire class of ships. Allison Stiller, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for shipbuilding, stated that the issues are believed to be isolated to the lead ship. The issues with the lube oil piping system on the lead ship [LPD-17] are believed to be isolated to that ship. The investigation is ongoing to determine the extent of the problem, with concerns raised about the welds and pipe hangers. Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, is under scrutiny for potential higher defect rates on the ship's welds. \"In the past, Northrop Grumman had high defect rates on welding, including high-temperature, high-pressure welds and drain pipe welds. The government should not bear the cost of inadequate inspections leading to leaks, and a different approach to business with industry is needed to avoid excessive defect rates.\" Northrop Grumman has launched an investigation into anomalies on LPD-17, working cooperatively with the Navy to diagnose issues and provide assistance. The shipyard is conducting reviews at Gulf Coast facilities. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding is conducting reviews at Gulf Coast facilities, including inspections of piping systems and weld standards on LPD-17 and LPD-20 to ensure compliance with quality standards. The company is also reviewing documentation and procedures to improve quality assurance efforts. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding pledged to improve quality assurance for new LPD-17 amphibious assault ships after setbacks. A report highlighted reliability issues with well deck ramps, ventilation, and other systems, affecting mission readiness. The engineering plant met mobility requirements, but improvements are needed for amphibious warfare suitability. The LPD-17 amphibious assault ship faced reliability problems with the Engineering Control System and electrical distribution system, revealing deficiencies in manning and training. Similar issues were identified by the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey across multiple ships in the class. Catastrophic casualties and production deficiencies were also noted. The ship is capable of supporting Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence requirements. The LPD-17 amphibious assault ship faces reliability issues with the SWAN and Interior Voice Communications System, impacting command and control operations. The Navy needs to validate Information Exchange Requirements and pursue a formal Information Support Plan for Joint Interoperability Certification. LPD-17 struggles to defend against various threats due to system engineering deficiencies, limited air defense capabilities, radar performance issues, and situational awareness degradation. The LPD-17 amphibious assault ship faces reliability issues with critical systems like electrical distribution, chilled water, SWAN, and ECS. The survivability of San Antonio class ships is improved but problems with critical systems highlight serious reliability shortcomings. In 2010, the amphibious transport dock New York experienced mechanical failure, raising concerns about its impact on other San Antonio-class ships. Inspectors found issues with the bearings on the New York's diesel engines while at sea, but the ship was able to return to Naval Station Norfolk under its own power. The broken bearings are still under warranty and will be repaired by Northrop Grumman, the ship's builder. Northrop Grumman is assisting the Navy in analyzing the situation, but defers further comments to the Navy. The New York, known for incorporating steel from the World Trade Center, was commissioned with national fanfare in November. The LPD 17 San Antonio-class amphibious ship, commissioned in its namesake city, has faced issues with failed bearings during at-sea tests. This has raised concerns about Northrop Grumman's quality work and the Navy's oversight. The LPD 17 San Antonio-class amphibious ship is facing issues with failed bearings in its diesel engines, potentially shortening the service lives of all ships in the class. Northrop Grumman and the Navy are working to address the problem of contaminants in the lube oil that is causing excessive wear on bearings. The Navy's LPD 17 ships are experiencing issues with contaminated lube oil causing excessive wear on bearings in the diesel engines. This problem has led to a bent crankshaft in the USS New York, potentially causing serious damage to the engine. The issue first appeared a year ago and resurfaced recently, requiring further investigation and maintenance. The USS New York is experiencing issues with contaminated lube oil causing excessive wear on bearings in the diesel engines. Particles between 20 and 40 microns wide are causing scratches on the bearings, potentially leading to a bent crankshaft. These particles are believed to be from shipyard work, such as slag from welding waste and grit from sand blasting. The ship, commissioned on Nov. 7, holds symbolism from the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Similar issues were previously discovered on the Mesa Verde (LPD 19). The USS New York is experiencing contaminated lube oil issues causing wear on diesel engine bearings. Similar problems were found on other ships in the past, leading to changes in engine flushing processes and piping. San Antonio also found contaminants in engines, requiring repairs. The USS New York and San Antonio are both in Norfolk for repairs due to contaminated lube oil causing engine issues. Engineers are investigating the problem, with a design review meeting scheduled to find a permanent solution. Rear Adm. Michelle Howard is leading a JAGMAN investigation focused on the San Antonio. The Navy's chief engineer is investigating lube oil problems on the San Antonio, part of the troubled LPD 17 program. The issue has caused delays and repairs, affecting the ship's deployment. Charges of shipyard issues and engine modifications are being discussed. The investigation into lube oil problems on the San Antonio, a ship in the LPD 17 program, is ongoing. Charges of shipyard sloppiness, inadequate sailor training, and ongoing fixes are being discussed. Contaminants in diesel engines are a common issue, with dirty lube oil being a prime suspect for bearing failures. Lee Graeber, a vice president of engineering at Fairbanks Morse, suggests turning off the engine to avoid damage during bearing failures. The investigation into lube oil problems on the San Antonio ship is ongoing, with concerns about contaminants in diesel engines. Issues with dirty lube oil are being addressed, including the need for sufficient lube oil purifiers. The design review will examine all aspects of the engine and oil lubrication system. Repairs on the New York are underway, while work on the San Antonio is on hold pending the conclusion of the investigation. The 2008 Bahrain repairs on the San Antonio revealed substandard welds on pipe joints of ships from Northrop's Gulf Coast yards. Thin welds, inadequate hangars causing excessive pipe vibration, and subsequent weld failures were identified. Changes were made to the ship's design to address the issue, with more hangars added. All Navy ships under construction at Northrop Grumman were reinspected for weld problems, revealing a higher-than-expected failure rate in weld thickness quality. Northrop Grumman found a higher failure rate in weld thickness quality, affecting shock survivability and service life of ships. All welds were reinspected, welders were retrained, and delivery of the destroyer Dewey was delayed. Delivery of the destroyer Dewey was delayed for fixes, and Northrop sent engineers to ensure repair quality. Coast Guard's National Security Cutters had fewer piping issues. Northrop and SUPSHIP retrained welders for proper inspections. The ability of Northrop Grumman and SU-SHIP to conduct weld inspections has been questioned due to pipe weld problems. Navy officials have pledged to address the shortage of oversight personnel. Despite issues with faulty welds on Northrop's warships, the Navy remains confident in the shipbuilder's commitment to delivering quality ships. Sean Stackley, the assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development, and acquisition, reassured that existing welds on Navy ships are safe and satisfactory. Plans are in place for inspections and repairs to address the weld problems discovered by Naval Sea Systems Command. Secretary Ray Mabus referred questions to Stackley's office regarding the Navy's announcement about faulty welds on warships. Key questions remain unanswered about the number of affected ships, how out-of-spec welds were approved, and the recertification of workers. NavSea and Navy leadership have not provided a response yet. The San Antonio class of amphibious ships also faced related issues due to high labor turnover. The Navy released a report blaming high labor turnover after Hurricane Katrina for issues on the San Antonio class of amphibious ships, including the amphibious assault ship Makin Island. The report identified inadequate workmanship and lack of quality control during new construction as major causes of the damage. The investigation identified shortcomings in ship design, systems integration, training, and ship's force management as causes of engineering problems on USS SAN ANTONIO. Inadequate Government oversight during construction led to cleanliness and quality assurance issues, impacting Fleet operations. Actions have been taken to address system design and process improvement. The investigation into engineering problems on USS SAN ANTONIO identified shortcomings in ship design, systems integration, and training. Actions have been taken to address deficiencies, including changes to system design, process improvement, and greater government oversight during construction. The ship is currently undergoing repairs in a dry dock in Norfolk, Va., with engineers working on repairing its lube oil systems and a bent crankshaft. Northrop Grumman issued a statement in support of the investigation's findings. Northrop Grumman supports investigation findings on USS SAN ANTONIO's engineering problems. Repairs ongoing in Norfolk, Va. Rear Adm. Dave Thomas unsure of impact on fleet deployments. Engineers using lessons for repairs on other ships. Review of Gulf Coast quality control process deferred to Naval Sea Systems Command. NAVSEA had no response. The Navy has full confidence in the Supervisors of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIPs) following the release of the JAGMAN report on LPD-17. Deficient welds on piping systems produced by Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB) were identified by SUPSHIP Gulf Coast (SSGC) after delivery. The Navy has requested NGSB to address and correct their process problems associated with each specific defect. NGSB is correcting their welding processes, and SSGC has increased surveillances of critical processes. The Navy has increased oversight of shipbuilders' processes, including welding, to ensure compliance with contract requirements. Vice Admiral Kevin McCoy addressed issues with engine contaminants on the fourth LPD-17 class ship, Green Bay, during a post shake down availability. System modifications were made based on findings from the San Antonio investigation. The main propulsion diesel engines on LP[D]-17 class underwent modifications to the filtering system and piping to eliminate contaminants and improve system integrity. Piping inspections and repairs were also conducted due to inadequate welds. Foreign material in the steering system caused delays in the post-shakedown availability, but the issues have been resolved, and the ship has completed final contract trials. The USS San Antonio, first of a large class of amphibious transport ships, faced ongoing issues with its engines and main reduction gears due to improper installation. Adm. John Harvey highlighted that the foundation bolts and reduction gear were not aligned or tightened correctly, leading to vibrations that could potentially damage the vessel. The USS San Antonio experienced alignment problems within the drive train and diesel engines, leading to ongoing issues with the engines and main reduction gears. Adm. John Harvey ordered an investigation into the situation, attributing the problems to inadequate workmanship and poor quality control during construction. The shipyard period in Norfolk has extended from a planned four or five months to eleven or more, with costs rising from $5 million to $39 million. The USS San Antonio experienced alignment problems with the drive train and diesel engines, attributed to inadequate workmanship and poor quality control during construction. Ongoing issues with the engines and main reduction gears have led to extended shipyard periods in Norfolk, with costs rising significantly. Problems with electrical wiring, welds, and lubrication oil system have been discovered, prompting continued efforts by Naval Sea Systems Command to fix the ship. Rear Adm. Jim McManamon, NAVSEA's vice commander of the surface warfare directorate, mentioned a deliberate approach to inspect and replace bolts in the San Antonio's engines and reduction gears due to alignment issues. Tight tolerances and small deviations in bolt measurements can cause significant problems, similar to those found in the New Orleans ship. The San Antonio, New Orleans, and other ships in the class are experiencing bolt alignment issues. The New Orleans is scheduled for a 12-week overhaul in San Diego, while the San Antonio is undergoing repairs in Norfolk. The Navy hopes to complete machinery trials in November, with the overhaul expected to finish after the new year. The cause of the problems on the San Antonio, built by Northrop Grumman, remains unclear. The San Antonio, a ship built by Northrop Grumman, has been undergoing continuous repairs since December 2009, costing the Navy at least $39 million. The ship was commissioned in 2005 and has experienced bolt alignment issues, with the latest round of repairs exceeding the initial $7 million estimate. The San Antonio ship, built by Northrop Grumman, has been undergoing continuous repairs since December 2009, costing the Navy at least $39 million. The repair timeline has been extended to spring 2011 to address all root causes before sea trials. The Navy has solved 16 out of 30 material problems on LPD-17 class ships, with efforts ongoing to resolve the remaining 14. The Navy faced problems with training funding being cut due to financial pressures. The San Antonio ship, plagued with issues since 2005, will miss a deployment for repairs, with its sister ship Mesa Verde taking its place. The San Antonio ship, delivered in August 2005, has been plagued with various issues including poor electrical wiring, bad welds, and faulty hydraulics. The Navy and Northrop have struggled to manage these problems, with a recent discovery of bolts issues during an overhaul in Norfolk, Va. The San Antonio ship, delivered in August 2005, has faced numerous issues including improperly installed bolts in the foundations of diesel engines and main reduction gears. Navy inspectors have also criticized the crew for poor maintenance procedures and insufficient training programs. Adm. John Harvey ordered a JAGMAN investigation which found inadequate workmanship, poor quality control during construction, design shortcomings, and crew management issues contributing to the ship's problems. The USS San Antonio faced engineering troubles during its fleet deployment in March 2009. An overhaul at Norfolk initially estimated to cost $5 million and take 4-5 months has now increased to at least $39 million and 11 months due to engine foundation problems. The Navy is determined to fix as many issues as possible during the current work package to ensure the ship returns to the fleet fully operational. The Navy is working to ensure USS San Antonio returns to the fleet fully operational after a year-long overhaul. The ship is currently at Naval Station Norfolk for continued repair work, expected to be finished by mid-January. Once completed, the ship will undergo recertifications and crew training before deployment. Mesa Verde, the third ship in the San Antonio class, was delivered in better shape than its predecessors. Commissioned in late 2007, it conducted a deployment with the Nassau Amphibious Ready Group, including disaster relief in Haiti. However, a press report in 2010 raised concerns about the ship's combat effectiveness and reliability after enemy fire. The Defense Department's director of operational test and evaluation, Gilmore, stated that the ship's armaments are not effective against modern anti-ship weapons. The vessel is deemed not effective, suitable, or survivable in combat situations. The Navy is aware of the reported deficiencies and is implementing corrective actions for testing next year. \"Survivability\" for the San Antonio refers to its ability to avoid threats. The San Antonio vessel's survivability in combat situations is questioned by Gilmore, who found it to be \"not survivable\" due to poor reliability and an inability to defend against threats. Despite having improved hull construction, the ship's armaments are not effective against modern anti-ship weapons. This assessment is based on data from combat testing and previous reports. The Navy test data showed an inability of the San Antonio class of amphibious ships to maintain mission capability after being hit by various weapons. Raytheon Co. was criticized for engineering deficiencies in the electronics and anti-missile system. The Navy is working to correct combat ineffectiveness issues, but details of the study are classified. The Navy acknowledged issues with the San Antonio-class amphibious ships' survivability in combat situations. Corrective actions are in progress, but details are classified. The ships are considered warfare-capable, but there are concerns about their combat effectiveness. The Navy is addressing issues with the San Antonio-class amphibious ships' combat survivability. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation's report highlighted concerns about the LPD-17 program's operational effectiveness and reliability, especially in hostile environments. The LPD-17 program's reliability and availability of critical ship systems, including control systems, support equipment, and combat systems, have been identified as areas of concern. The Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey found deficiencies in self-defense systems across the first ships in the class. Severe casualties were recorded prior to the Full Ship Shock Trial in LPD-19 and during LPD-17's trials. The LPD-17 class ships have shown serious fabrication and production deficiencies, with problems in critical systems and mission capability. Combat systems deficiencies were revealed during PRA and Self-Defense Test Ship events in 2011. The Navy's LPD-17 class ships have met most performance objectives but still need validation for one information exchange requirement. The first three ships completed successful deployments, addressing operational needs and emergent missions. However, the class was deemed not operationally effective, suitable, or survivable in hostile environments due to reliability, self-defense, and recoverability issues. The Program Office has developed corrective action plans to address these concerns. The LPD 17 Class ships have resolved reliability issues with upgrades to the Ship Wide Area Network and Engineering Control System. Main engine reliability problems were traced back to lube oil cleanliness on four ships. New ECS software has been installed to address deficiencies and enhance monitoring capabilities. The LPD 17 Class ships experienced reliability issues due to lube oil cleanliness, leading to steering problems. A redesign of the lube oil filtration system was completed in 2010, with damaged bearings and piping segments replaced. New filters and strainers have been installed on delivered ships, along with upgraded IVCS components and UPS batteries. New flushing procedures have been implemented, and all follow ships will be delivered with the new designs and components. Revised preventive maintenance procedures and a new UPS monitoring system have been installed on all LPD 17 Class ships. Improvements in air warfare system performance and reduced mast interference with the SPS 48 air search radar have been achieved. New hardware and software have corrected SPQ-9B surface search reliability issues on LPD 20 and follow ships. Back-fits are planned for LPDs 17-19. Gun systems onboard LPD 17 Class ships meet surface warfare requirements outlined in the LPD 17 Class ORD. Software installations to enhance operator situational awareness are also being implemented. Software installations to increase operator situational awareness are being developed for future implementation on LPD 17 Class ships. Recoverability, which refers to the ability to prevent loss and restore mission essential functions after a casualty, is a key focus. Systems impacting recoverability include UPS, SWAN, ECS, damage control equipment, shipboard damage control features, and crew training. Additional isolation valves in the chill water system and corrections to fire detection system software deficiencies have been planned to improve recoverability. Follow-On Test & Evaluation (FOT&E) is being conducted by the Navy's COMOPTEVFOR and the Marine Corps Operational Test. The Navy and Marine Corps are conducting an evaluation to confirm corrective actions on LPD-17 ships. Admiral Roughead stated progress on quality issues during a budget hearing. Lessons learned include ensuring ship quality early in construction. The Navy is addressing material reliability concerns in the LPD-17 program by applying lessons learned to ships currently under construction. Quality is improving with each ship delivered as the Navy works closely with the shipbuilder. The San Antonio (LPD 17) has been undergoing repairs at Norfolk, Va., with documentation issues reported. The Navy is addressing material reliability concerns in the LPD-17 program by applying lessons learned to ships currently under construction. The San Antonio (LPD 17) has been undergoing repairs at Norfolk, Va., with documentation issues reported on the ship's main propulsion diesels. NAVSEA found unacceptable documentation in overhaul reports by contractors, leading to an ongoing Navy investigation. The Navy is conducting an investigation into documentation issues with repairs on the San Antonio ship's main propulsion diesels. The investigation has not affected the ship's scheduled sea trials in late April. Personnel actions are being taken due to improper documentation, but NAVSEA declined to provide further details citing privacy policies. Another investigation was launched after audits revealed serious problems with records kept by private contractors who overhauled the engines. So far, there is no indication of improper engine work. The Navy is investigating documentation issues with repairs on the San Antonio ship's main propulsion diesels. The problem lies in the lack of clarity in the documents provided by civilian contractors, making it difficult to determine the work that was done. Earl Industries and Fairbanks Morse are the contractors involved. Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting independent checks on the engines, and personnel changes have been made at Norfolk Ship Support Activity. Thomas J. Murphy, the civilian executive director, was replaced, and other officials were also removed. The Navy is investigating documentation issues with repairs on the San Antonio ship's main propulsion diesels. Civilian officials at the command were removed, and the ship is nearly ready for sea tests. Contractors are being held accountable for failing to document engine repairs coherently. Insufficient government oversight is also being looked into. Earl Industries President Jerry Miller emphasized that the issues found so far are related to record-keeping, not quality. The Navy's investigation into documentation issues with repairs on the San Antonio ship's main propulsion diesels has led to the suspension of oversight authority of the local command responsible for supervising ship repairs by private contractors. Earl Industries President Jerry Miller stated that the issues uncovered so far are related to record-keeping, not the quality of the company's repair work. Fairbanks Morse, the contractor involved, is cooperating with the investigation to resolve the matter satisfactorily. The Navy has suspended the oversight authority of the local command responsible for supervising ship repairs by private contractors at Norfolk Ship Support Activity. A senior Naval Sea Systems Command officer will now oversee technical authority duties until confidence is restored. This action was taken in response to documentation issues with repairs on the San Antonio ship's main propulsion diesels. The Navy has suspended the oversight authority of Norfolk Ship Support Activity due to documentation issues with ship repairs. Top officials, including Thomas J. Murphy, have been removed. The Navy is reviewing quality assurance practices at all regional maintenance centers. The USS San Antonio was pulled from service for major repairs due to ongoing issues since its delivery in 2005. The repair period was extended multiple times, with problems including improperly installed engines and main reduction gears. Adm. John Harvey made fixing the ship a top priority, causing the ship to miss a scheduled deployment and requiring the fleet to adjust to its absence. The USS San Antonio underwent major repairs after ongoing issues since its delivery in 2005. Cmdr. Thomas Kait expressed satisfaction with the ship's performance during engineering trials. Further trials and training are needed before the ship can deploy again. Navy leadership showed concern over the ship's performance, with reporters restricted from discussing it with crew members. Some senior leaders faced questioning from Congress regarding the acceptance of the ship from Northrop Grumman in 2005 despite known construction deficiencies. The Navy was not obligated to take delivery, but a conscious decision was made. The first ships in the class had material problems, with more recent ships having less severe issues. McCoy noted improvements in recent ships of the class, with successful trials on the New York receiving praise from Navy inspectors. Despite issues like grit in the lube oil system, McCoy acknowledged mobility concerns but expressed hope that the problem has been resolved. The San Antonio ship successfully completed sea trials after being offline for two years, showing significant improvements in maintenance. Captain Scovill expressed confidence in the ship's readiness for future operations. After maintenance availability and self-training, San Antonio will start predeployment work-ups on Aug. 1. Chief engineer confirms previous issues fixed, ship ready for next month's operations. Sea trials validated diesel engines and combat systems performance. The ship San Antonio underwent sea trials focusing on combat systems and amphibious craft operations in the well deck. Despite minor engine problems, all issues are expected to be resolved by the end of the month. The San Antonio had engine problems serious enough to shut down one engine, leading to the Navy canceling training plans. The ship returned to Norfolk Naval Station 10 days early for engineers to assess issues with the engines' intercoolers and leak-off boxes. All four diesels had leaks in the intercoolers, requiring gasket replacements, while the leak-off boxes also leaked, affecting fuel recapture. The San Antonio experienced engine leaks, with one engine shut down. Repairs will be done at Norfolk Naval Station, expected to be completed in time for a 20-week training set for August. Adm. John C. Harvey expects the ship to begin training on time and deploy next year. The issues are not related to lube oil systems or alignment, but maintenance was done on intercoolers and leak-off boxes during engine overhaul. The San Antonio ship experienced engine leaks during an overhaul by Earl Industries LLC. The Navy is investigating if this contributed to current issues. The ship's ballast system was damaged during sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico due to an improperly-installed relief valve. The incident occurred on the new U.S. amphibious ship San Diego [LPD-22]. The LPD ship built at Ingalls shipyard is undergoing trials to test systems. Acceptance trials by Navy officials are scheduled for November. The ship's ballast system had issues during sea trials, with a ballast tank being over-pressurized. The ballasting and de-ballasting test on the LPD ship built at Ingalls shipyard encountered issues when a relief valve was installed backward, causing over-pressurization. Despite this, the tests were successful, and there was no damage to the ship's hull or side shell. Repairs will be made, and the system will be retested during acceptance trials in November. The ship is still expected to be delivered to the Navy before Christmas, with Huntington Ingalls deeming the trials successful.
