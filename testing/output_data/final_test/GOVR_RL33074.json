    "content": "Mandatory spending, controlled by laws other than appropriation acts, includes federal spending on entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Other programs such as Supplemental Security Income, unemployment insurance, and SNAP also fall under mandatory spending. Congress sets eligibility requirements for these programs, and if met, outlays are made automatically. In FY2014, mandatory spending exceeded discretionary spending, totaling 12.2% of GDP. In FY2014, total federal spending represented 20.3% of GDP, with discretionary spending at 6.8% and federal net interest payments at 1.3%. Mandatory spending, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, made up nearly 60% of all federal spending. During economic downturns, mandatory programs like unemployment insurance act as automatic stabilizers, increasing deficits or shrinking surpluses without new legislative action. Mandatory spending as a percentage of GDP has been relatively constant around 12% since FY2011. The Congressional Budget Office projects a slight increase to around 13% by FY2020, reaching nearly 14% by 2025. However, these projections do not fully account for the long-term impact of an aging population and rising healthcare costs on the federal budget. The text chunk discusses mandatory spending, which is controlled by laws other than appropriations acts and is typically provided in permanent or multi-year appropriations. This type of spending is projected to increase slightly in the future, reaching nearly 14% of GDP by 2025. Entitlement spending, like Medicaid and veterans' programs, is funded through annual appropriations acts. This spending is referred to as appropriated entitlements and is based on benefit and eligibility criteria established in law. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 classified appropriated entitlement spending as mandatory, with budget authority determined by authorizing legislation. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 classified appropriated entitlement spending as mandatory, with some exceptions like Forest Service payments to states. \"Backdoor\" spending authority allows agencies to create obligations that become part of mandatory spending. Salaries of Members of Congress and the President are also considered mandatory but not entitlements. CBO baseline projections show mandatory spending from FY2014 to FY2025, partially offset by offsetting receipts like Medicare Part A deductibles and Part B premiums. Offsetting receipts, such as Medicare Part A deductibles and Part B premiums, are a significant component of mandatory spending. Federal student loan programs are accounted for under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, which requires reporting on a net subsidy basis rather than cash basis. This ensures that the reported budgetary cost of a credit or loan program equals the estimated subsidy costs at the time the credit is provided. The subsidy cost is the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs. Mandatory spending has grown over time, with Social Security and Medicare Acts contributing to its increase. In the mid-1970s, growth of mandatory spending slowed, and in the 1980s, it declined as a share of total federal spending. Since then, mandatory spending has increased its share. Mandatory spending has increased its share of federal spending over time, reaching nearly 60% in FY2014. This growth was influenced by the Social Security and Medicare Acts. Mandatory spending has been increasing as a share of GDP, peaking at nearly 14% in 2025 according to CBO projections. This rise was influenced by federal financial interventions and the economic downturn. In FY2009, total mandatory spending increased by 31% in dollar terms over FY2008, mainly due to the economic downturn and federal financial interventions such as TARP and GSE assistance. Outlays for income security programs also rose in FY2009 and remained high through FY2013, returning to pre-recession levels by FY2014 as the economy recovered. Mandatory spending is projected to rise due to higher federal health spending, with Medicare and Medicaid programs playing a significant role. Since 1970, health care spending has been a key driver of mandatory spending trends, increasing from 4.9% to 25.7% of total federal outlays by FY2014. CBO baseline projections indicate further growth in federal health spending, leading to continued increases in the Medicaid and Medicare share of total spending. Federal health spending, including Medicaid and Medicare, is projected to continue rising, with other health-related programs also expected to increase due to the Affordable Care Act. By FY2025, Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs are estimated to account for 31.1% of total federal spending. Meanwhile, spending on mandatory programs outside of health care is expected to remain flat or decline over the next decade. Social Security's share of federal spending is projected to remain steady between 24% and 26%. Mandatory spending levels are projected to decline over the next decade due to the Budget Control Act of 2011. The act included measures to reduce the budget deficit through spending reductions, with mandatory spending being reduced by $17 billion in FY2013 and $18 billion. Mandatory spending was reduced by $17 billion in FY2013, $18 billion in FY2014, and $18 billion in FY2015, with an additional projected reduction of $164 billion over FY2016-FY2025. Despite these reductions, rising health care costs are expected to lead to continued growth in mandatory spending as a percentage of GDP. Outlays for mandatory programs can be influenced by various factors such as cost increases, program changes, economic conditions, and eligibility criteria adjustments. Mandatory spending relative to GDP grew rapidly in the late 1960s and 1970s, with Medicare and Medicaid playing significant roles. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the size of the economy grew rapidly. In the 1980s, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security continued to grow, while other mandatory spending fluctuated with the business cycle. Social Security spending increased from 2.9% of GDP in FY1970 to 4.8% in FY1983 and is projected to reach 5.7% of GDP in FY2025. Medicare and Medicaid spending also grew faster than the economy, reaching 5.4% of GDP in FY2011 and projected to increase to 6.4% of GDP in FY2025. Spending on income security programs is projected to increase to 6.4% of GDP in FY2025, with growth from 0.1% to 0.5% for other federal health programs. Income security spending is more volatile than Social Security and Medicare due to its ties to economic fluctuations. In the 1960s, income security programs accounted for about 1% of GDP, rising to over 2% after the 1974 recession. Recent years have seen income security spending around 1.5% of GDP. Income security spending has fluctuated in recent years, reaching 3.0% of GDP in FY2010 before decreasing to 1.8% in FY2013. Projections show a further decrease to 1.3% of GDP by FY2025. Mandatory spending has increased while discretionary spending has fallen, with discretionary spending making up a larger share of total federal spending in the past. Mandatory spending has been increasing steadily, reaching 12.2% of GDP in FY2014 and projected to reach 14.2% by the next decade. Discretionary spending, on the other hand, has been decreasing and is projected to fall to 5.1% of GDP by FY2022, its lowest level ever. By that year, discretionary spending is expected to be equal to or less than spending on Social Security and Major Health Programs, with each totaling 5.4% and 6.7% of GDP respectively. Projected spending on major health programs is expected to total 6.7% of GDP, while spending on other mandatory programs is projected to be less than spending on net interest payments starting in FY2024. CBO baseline projections do not fully account for the impact of the impending retirement of the baby boom generation on the federal budget. Social Security spending could reach 6.8% of GDP by FY2085. Social Security spending is projected to reach 6.8% of GDP by FY2085, an increase of 1.9 percentage points from FY2014. Federal mandatory spending on health care is expected to reach 13.4% of GDP by FY2085, up from 5.4% in FY2014. Fiscal experts suggest that addressing unsustainable debts will require cuts in entitlement benefits, increased federal revenues, reduced discretionary spending, or a combination of these measures to avoid adverse economic consequences. Mandatory spending has grown significantly over the past half century, with projections showing it will account for over three-fifths of federal spending by the end of the decade. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid now make up a larger portion of mandatory spending, with Medicare and Medicaid surpassing Social Security in outlays. Federal health spending, including Medicare, Medicaid, and subsidies, could reach nearly 50% of mandatory spending by FY2025. Cutting spending without reducing entitlements would be challenging. Targeting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for budget cuts may harm the elderly and poor. Reforming smaller mandatory programs like TANF, SSI, and SNAP would not significantly reduce the deficit due to the rising costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Further health program reforms may be necessary to address long-term fiscal challenges. Further health program reforms may be necessary to address long-term fiscal strains while preserving program goals."
