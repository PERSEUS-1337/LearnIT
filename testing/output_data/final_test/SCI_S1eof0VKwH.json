    "content": "The paper introduces a novel FSL model, $\\textrm{D}^2$GAN, which synthesizes diverse and discriminative features using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). $\\textrm{D}^2$GAN ensures that the synthesized features are discriminable by correlating them highly with real features of the same class and low with different classes. $\\textrm{D}^2$GAN introduces an anti-collapse regularization term to promote feature diversity by penalizing the similarity ratio of synthesized features. Experiments validate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. The paper discusses the importance of few-shot learning (FSL) in scenarios with limited labeled data, proposing data augmentation through synthesizing additional samples while ensuring discriminability and diversity. The paper introduces D2GAN, a novel Few-Shot Learning model that synthesizes diverse and discriminative features using Generative Adversarial Networks. D2GAN ensures discriminability by correlating synthesized features with real features of the same class and penalizing similarity with different classes. An anti-collapse regularization term promotes feature diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm D2GAN's effectiveness compared to existing methods."
