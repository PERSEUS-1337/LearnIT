The \"Keep Children Covered Act of 2006\" amends the Social Security Act to redistribute unspent fiscal year 2004 allotments to eliminate funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007. The \"Keep Children Covered Act of 2006\" redistributes unspent fiscal year 2004 allotments to address funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 by allocating specific amounts to States and territories based on specified ratios. The \"Keep Children Covered Act of 2006\" redistributes unspent fiscal year 2004 allotments to address funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 by allocating specific amounts to States and territories based on specified ratios. An initial shortfall State is defined as a State with a State child health plan approved under this title for which the Secretary estimates projected Federal expenditures under such plan exceed available funds. Federal expenditures for fiscal year 2007 in a State will exceed the sum of unspent allotments from fiscal years 2005 and 2006, along with the allotment for fiscal year 2007. Amounts from fiscal year 2004 allotments are also considered for redistribution. The Secretary determines the amount to eliminate estimated shortfalls for initial shortfall States. Additional allotments are provided to eliminate fiscal year 2007 funding shortfalls after redistributing unspent fiscal year 2004 allotments. The Secretary determines the amount to eliminate estimated shortfalls for initial shortfall States, including States with approved State child health plans where projected federal expenditures exceed the State's allotments for fiscal year 2007. The Secretary determines the unspent allotments for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the allotment for fiscal year 2007, and any unspent allotments from fiscal year 2004 to be redistributed to the State in fiscal year 2007. The remaining shortfall State allotments must be spent by September 30, 2007, any unexpended amounts revert to the Treasury on October 1, 2007. Additional allotments are appropriated for fiscal year 2007. Qualifying States can use certain funds for Medicaid expenditures. The amendments to the Social Security Act regarding Medicaid expenditures apply from October 1, 2006. The provision added in subsection (a) will end on September 30, 2007, despite the Balanced Budget Act."
