The Chinese Communist Party engages in economic warfare against the United States through the use of resources from the People's Liberation Army and Chinese State, including economic espionage, cyber espionage, unfair trade practices, unfair labor practices, and currency manipulation. State-owned enterprises and the PLA benefit from the CCP's theft campaign, with the Chinese government retaining at least half of equity in listed SOEs. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission appoints members of SOEs' boards and senior management in consultation with the Communist Party. Corruption within the CCP is widespread, with officials using their positions to enrich themselves. The majority of Chinese people do not benefit from this corruption.

On May 21, 2014, Assistant Attorney General John Carlin stated that criminal charges can lead to economic sanctions against members of Unit 61398, a Shanghai-based cyber unit of the PLA known as APT1.

George Kurts of CrowdStrike mentioned that the indictments against Chinese cyber groups are just the tip of the iceberg, with at least 20 cyber threat groups in China stealing valuable information from the United States. Multiple experts believe that Units 61398 and 61486 are among those responsible for the theft.

Congressman Mike Rogers, Chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, called for action against China's economic espionage, stating that the US and its allies should pressure Beijing to stop. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse also highlighted the threat of Chinese espionage. The Cyber Task Force of the Select Committee on Intelligence described massive cyber and economic espionage by the CCP and PLA as the largest transfer of wealth in history, contributing to a $318 billion US trade deficit with China in 2013.
