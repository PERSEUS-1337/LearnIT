    "content": "The United States and Russia signed the New START treaty on April 8, 2010, replacing the expired START treaty. The U.S. Senate ratified it on December 22, 2010, and the Russian parliament followed in January 2011. The treaty came into force on February 5, 2011, superseding the Moscow Treaty. It allowed for a 7-year reduction period and will be in force for a total of 10 years, with a possible 5-year extension. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, allowed for a 7-year reduction period with a possible 5-year extension. Both the US and Russia completed required reductions by February 5, 2018. Discussions about extending the treaty have been ongoing, with reports of President Trump rejecting a proposal from President Putin in 2017. The issue was also discussed during a summit in 2018, but no agreement was reached. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, allowed for a 7-year reduction period with a possible 5-year extension. The Trump Administration is reviewing the treaty and assessing its impact on U.S. national security interests before deciding on a potential extension beyond 2021. Officials have not provided details on the review or speculated on the implications of allowing the treaty to lapse. The New START Treaty may not be enough to address new threats to U.S. national security, as Russia is developing strategic arms not covered by the treaty, expanding its nonstrategic nuclear weapons stockpile, and China is modernizing its nuclear arsenal outside the treaty. President Trump is considering a new arms control agreement that includes all types of nuclear weapons and involves China, but it's unclear why China would participate given its smaller arsenal compared to the U.S. and Russia. The United States and Russia possess thousands of warheads. Under Secretary Thompson explained why the U.S. wants China to join arms control talks, citing China's desire to be a responsible global player. General Hyten highlighted the importance of the New START Treaty for U.S. national security but also expressed concerns about potential new Russian nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia have thousands of warheads, with concerns about potential new Russian nuclear weapons emerging. Talks about expanding the New START Treaty to address these new weapons are ongoing, with discussions at the technical expert level between the two countries. Russian officials argue that some of their new systems should not be included under the treaty's limits. Some experts suggest extending the New START Treaty before 2021 to discuss including new systems under treaty limits. Others argue the US should only extend if Russia agrees to count its new systems or negotiate a new treaty. The New START Treaty may need to be extended before it expires in 2021, but Russia is hesitant to do so unless the United States addresses their concerns with the treaty's implementation. Russia is not interested in expanding the treaty to include new strategic systems and would insist on addressing U.S. systems of concern to them in any new negotiations. In early April 2009, President Obama and Russia's President Medvedev outlined their goals for the negotiations on a new START Treaty, focusing on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. The new treaty would not address missile defenses, nonstrategic nuclear weapons, or nondeployed stockpiles of nuclear weapons. They aimed to reduce forces to levels below those in the 2002 Moscow Treaty, enhancing security and stability in strategic offensive forces with effective verification measures. The Presidents outlined goals for the New START Treaty in a Joint Understanding signed in July 2009, setting limits on strategic delivery vehicles and associated warheads. The treaty includes provisions on definitions, data exchanges, notifications, eliminations, inspections, and verification procedures, following conventions of the 1991 START Treaty. The New START Treaty sets limits on strategic weapons and requires parties to maintain a database describing weapon locations and characteristics. It includes provisions for exhibitions, inspections, and verification procedures. Unlike the original START Treaty from the Cold War era, the New START Treaty reflects a different relationship between the United States and Russia. The New START Treaty between the United States and Russia aims to provide predictability and transparency in their nuclear forces. The treaty simplifies limits and verification provisions, allowing each side flexibility in their mix of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. The focus is on cooperation and openness rather than evasion schemes. The treaty sets three central limits on strategic offensive nuclear forces. The New START Treaty limits each side to 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM and SLBM launchers and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. It also restricts each side to 700 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, as well as 1,550 deployed warheads. Comparisons to previous treaties are shown in Table 1. A deployed SLBM or ICBM launcher is installed on an operational submarine and contains the missile. Nondeployed launchers are used for testing or training, located at space launch facilities, or on submarines without the missile. The New START Treaty does not limit nondeployed missiles but requires them to be at known facilities supporting ICBMs and SLBMs. The New START Treaty regulates the locations and movements of nondeployed ICBMs and SLBMs, including facilities for maintenance, storage, and testing. Parties share information on missile locations and notify each other of movements to prevent hidden stockpiling. Violations occur if missiles are found at unlisted facilities or if transit exceeds 30 days. According to the Protocol to New START, a deployed heavy bomber must be equipped for nuclear armaments and located at designated air bases. Test heavy bombers can only be based at specific facilities. The Protocol to New START specifies that heavy bombers must be equipped for nuclear armaments and located at designated air bases. Test heavy bombers can only be based at specific facilities, with a limit of 10 per party. Bombers not equipped for nuclear weapons do not count towards treaty limits, but if converted, nuclear and non-nuclear bombers cannot be based at the same air base without agreement. The United States can reduce the number of bombers counted under the New START treaty by converting some B-52 bombers to no longer carry nuclear weapons and basing them separately. Converting all bombers of a certain type to be unable to carry nuclear weapons would exclude them from treaty limits. This provision allows the removal of B-1 bombers from treaty accountability. Table 1 compares warhead limits in START, the Moscow Treaty, and New START, showing differences in treaty provisions. The original START Treaty had sublimits on warheads for different types of strategic weapons, aiming to limit specific elements of the Soviet force. In contrast, the Moscow Treaty and New START only have a single limit on deployed warheads, allowing each nation flexibility in their force structure. This shift reflects a reduced concern with Cold War models of stability and the U.S. desire for flexibility in its nuclear forces. The New START Treaty aims to reduce the number of warheads in the U.S. and Russian strategic forces by more than 80%. The treaty uses different definitions and counting rules to determine the number of deployed warheads, with each party counting launchers instead of actual warheads. The New START Treaty reduced the number of warheads in U.S. and Russian strategic forces by over 80%. Each operational missile carried an \"attributed\" number of warheads listed in an agreed database. Parties multiplied these numbers by deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers to determine warheads under treaty limits. START allowed reducing warheads through \"downloading\" by removing reentry vehicles from ICBMs. The New START Treaty allowed nations to reduce the number of warheads by removing reentry vehicles from ICBMs and bombers. Bombers were counted differently based on their capabilities, with those equipped for long-range nuclear-armed cruise missiles counted as more warheads. The Moscow Treaty did not have specific counting rules for warheads, allowing the US and Russia to define \"deployed strategic warheads\" differently. The US counted warheads on deployed ballistic missiles and bomber weapons near deployed bombers, while Russia did not count bomber weapons. There were no sublimits on warheads deployed on different delivery vehicles. The New START Treaty, like its predecessor the Moscow Treaty, does not have sublimits on warheads deployed on different delivery vehicles. Parties only need to report the total number of deployed warheads. Definitions and counting rules in the treaty help calculate the number of warheads that count under the limits. For ballistic missiles, the rules follow the Moscow Treaty, counting only actual warheads on deployed vehicles. For bombers, the rules follow START, attributing a fixed number of warheads to each heavy bomber. Reporting is done once at the end of the treaty's implementation period. The New START Treaty states that the number of warheads on ICBMs and SLBMs will be based on the number of reentry vehicles deployed. Each missile will have its own warhead number, which can change over time. Inspections will be conducted 10 times a year, where one missile or three bombers will be randomly selected for inspection. The parties will not physically count each missile, but the total number of warheads deployed on all launchers will be listed in the New START database. Before inspections, the inspected party will provide a list of warheads on each missile or bomber at the base. The New START Treaty involves inspections to verify the number of warheads on missiles or bombers at the base. Inspections are random to deter extra warhead deployment. Parties declare total deployed warheads every six months in the treaty database, unlike the Moscow Treaty where it was done only once. Under the New START Treaty, each deployed heavy bomber with nuclear armaments counts as one warhead, even if not deployed daily. Inspections confirm actual warhead numbers on delivery vehicles, with bombers assigned an arbitrary count of one. According to New START, ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments will continue to count under treaty limits until converted or eliminated as per the treaty's Protocol. The provisions are less strict than the original START Treaty, giving the US and Russia more flexibility in reducing their forces. Silo launchers can be eliminated in three ways according to New START. The parties to the treaty have the option to eliminate ICBM silo launchers by destroying them to a certain depth or filling them with debris. They can also develop alternative procedures for elimination, which do not require blowing up or digging out the silos. This could be a less costly and destructive way to disable the silos from launching missiles. The United States plans to eliminate 50 silos that held Peacekeeper missiles until 2005 and 50 silos that held Minuteman III missiles until 2008 under the New START Treaty. The Air Force Global Strike Command started preparations in March 2011 to fill these silos with gravel, expecting to complete the process by 2017. This process involves removing the erector-launcher mechanism and leveling supports from the launcher chassis. Under the New START Treaty, the elimination process for launchers for road mobile ICBMs involves cutting off various components from the launcher chassis and removing the missile. This process is simpler and less destructive compared to previous treaties like START. The elimination process for launchers of road mobile ICBMs under the New START Treaty involves removing components from the launcher chassis and the missile without cutting the framework or chassis into pieces. Additionally, if the chassis is to be used for other purposes, it must be painted differently to distinguish it from a deployed mobile ICBM launcher. The New START Treaty allows for the removal of specific components from submarine missile launch tubes to render them incapable of launching ballistic missiles, thus exempting them from treaty limits. This process involves cutting the launch tubes into two pieces and removing certain structures. The New START Treaty allows for the conversion of submarine missile launch tubes to render them incapable of launching ballistic missiles, exempting them from treaty limits. The United States plans to reduce the number of launch tubes on each SSBN from 24 to 20 by 2015, with a goal of having no more than 240 operational launchers for SLBMs by February 2018. This process eliminates the need to destroy entire submarines to remove launch tubes, allowing for the conversion of ballistic missile submarines to other uses. Under New START, the United States can convert ballistic missile submarines to carry conventional weapons instead of nuclear-armed SLBMs, providing flexibility in structuring its nuclear forces. Four Trident submarines have already been converted to SSGNs, but they will not count under the New START Treaty due to the retention of missile compartments. The United States can convert ballistic missile submarines to carry conventional weapons under the New START Treaty. Four Trident submarines have been converted to SSGNs, which will not be counted under the treaty. Inspections will be conducted to confirm that the launchers on these submarines are incapable of launching SLBMs. The START treaty allows for the modification and elimination of heavy bombers to remove them from treaty accountability. This involves cutting sections of the fuselage and modifying weapon bays to ensure they are not equipped to carry nuclear armaments. The New START treaty has simplified the elimination procedure for heavy bombers. The New START treaty simplifies the process of converting heavy bombers to remove them from treaty accountability. This involves cutting sections of the fuselage or modifying weapon bays to ensure they cannot carry nuclear armaments. The United States no longer equips its B-1 bombers with nuclear weapons and has no plans to do so in the future. The United States no longer equips its B-1 bombers with nuclear weapons and has no plans to do so in the future. These bombers will be converted to nonnuclear heavy bombers, but will still count as one delivery vehicle and one warhead under the START counting rules. To address this issue, the US will conduct a \"one-time exhibition\" to demonstrate to Russia that these bombers are no longer nuclear-capable. Once all B-1 bombers have been converted, they will no longer be counted under the New START Treaty. The United States no longer equips its B-1 bombers with nuclear weapons. After conversion, they will not count against the limits in the New START Treaty. Mobile ICBMs were a concern in the original START negotiations due to difficulties in locating and targeting them during conflicts. The Soviet Union refused to ban mobile ICBMs, leading to limitations in the START treaty. The START treaty limited the United States and Soviet Union to 1,100 warheads on mobile ICBMs, with restrictions on nondeployed missiles and launchers. It aimed to reduce the risk of \"breakout\" by limiting the number of missiles that could be added to the deployed force during a conflict. Monitoring mechanisms were put in place to track permitted missiles. The START treaty required monitoring of final assembly facilities for missiles, recording serial numbers for mobile ICBMs, providing notifications for movements between facilities, and outlining procedures for eliminating missiles and launchers removed from the force. The New START Treaty outlines procedures for eliminating missiles to maintain accurate counts and deter hiding extra missiles. Russia pushed for easing restrictions on mobile ICBMs to enhance survivability and strengthen strategic stability. The United States agreed to relax restrictions as it is less concerned about Russia breaking out of the treaty. The United States is less concerned about Russia's ability to break out of the New START Treaty limits on mobile ICBMs due to increased confidence in monitoring Russian missile numbers. Russia's production of new missiles has decreased significantly, making it unlikely for them to stockpile extra missiles. This reduces the need for the United States to worry about Russia reloading mobile launchers. The United States is no longer concerned about Russia's ability to reload mobile launchers with spare missiles during a conflict. Russia has not practiced this capability, and it is unlikely they would attempt it during a nuclear war. The New START Treaty does not have sublimits on mobile ICBMs or their warheads, but they will count towards the overall limits set by the treaty. The New START Treaty does not have sublimits on mobile ICBMs or their warheads, but they will count towards the overall limits set by the treaty. Perimeter and portal monitoring at missile assembly facilities is not permitted, but notification is required before solid-fuel ICBMs and SLBMs leave production facilities. Mobile ICBMs and their launchers must be located only at ICBM bases to help track missiles and deter Russian efforts to hide extra missiles. Nondeployed mobile ICBMs must be located at specific facilities such as production, loading, repair, storage, conversion, training, test ranges, and space launch facilities. Movement of missiles or launchers between facilities requires updating a database with a complete list of items and unique identifiers. Deployed or nondeployed missiles cannot be located in deployment areas and must remain in designated facilities. According to the Protocol to the Treaty, inspectors have the right to read unique identifiers on designated deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, non-deployed missiles, and heavy bombers at inspection sites. This ensures transparency, prevents hiding extra missiles, and confirms compliance with treaty limits. The treaty provides continuous information on the locations of nondeployed missiles and allows on-site inspections to verify they are not mixed into the deployed force. The New START Treaty limits the number of nondeployed launchers for missiles, preventing Russia from quickly adding them to its force. Concerns have been raised about Russia using stored mobile ICBMs to deploy on rail-mobile launchers not covered by the treaty, potentially gaining a military advantage over the United States. The New START Treaty limits the number of nondeployed launchers for missiles, preventing Russia from quickly adding them to its force. Concerns have been raised about Russia using stored mobile ICBMs to deploy on rail-mobile launchers not covered by the treaty, potentially gaining a military advantage over the United States. The definition of an ICBM launcher includes devices intended or used to contain, prepare for launch, and launch an ICBM, regardless of whether it is deployed on a fixed site or a road-mobile transporter. The New START Treaty limits the number of nondeployed launchers for missiles, preventing Russia from quickly adding them to its force. Concerns have been raised about Russia using stored mobile ICBMs to deploy on rail-mobile launchers not covered by the treaty. The treaty does not define rail-mobile launchers as Russia no longer deploys missiles on them. Russia had deployed SS-24 missiles on rail-mobile launchers in the past but all were retired in the last decade. The treaty would not prohibit Russia from deploying these systems again in the future. Article V of the New START Treaty allows for modernization and replacement of strategic offensive arms. Parties can raise questions about new types of arms in the Bilateral Consultative Commission. The BCC resolves issues related to the treaty's applicability to new arms. Changes to the Protocol can be made without amending the treaty if they don't affect substantive rights or obligations. Russia could potentially deploy previously retired SS-24 missiles on rail-mobile launchers in the future. The BCC can make changes to the New START Treaty without amending it, such as modifying the definition of \"mobile launcher\" to include ICBMs on rail-mobile launchers. If a party deploys an erector-launcher for an ICBM on a rail car, it would count under the treaty limits. The BCC would determine the monitoring provisions and rules for this new type of strategic arm. The START Treaty included provisions for data collection on forces and activities, including national technical means of verification. It also required data exchange, on-site inspections, notifications, and continuous monitoring. Telemetry from missile flight tests was not to be encrypted. The New START Treaty continues these verification measures. The New START Treaty contains a monitoring and verification regime similar to the one in START, focusing on transparency, cooperation, and deterring and detecting capabilities of missile systems. The regime includes detailed definitions of limited items, provisions for data gathering, an extensive database, notifications, and inspections to confirm information shared during data exchanges. It has been streamlined to be less costly and complex, reflecting the limits in New START and the current US-Russia relationship. The New START Treaty emphasizes transparency, cooperation, and deterring violations. The US and Russia rely on National Technical Means (NTM) to collect information on strategic forces, exchange telemetry data, and share details about their forces and locations. They notify each other of any movements between declared facilities and participate in exhibitions to confirm information. New START allows for up to 18 short-notice on-site inspections each year, divided into Type One and Type Two inspections. Each side can conduct 10 Type One inspections and 8 Type Two inspections, with various activities conducted during each Type One inspection. These inspections are similar to those permitted under the original START Treaty. New START allows for up to 18 short-notice on-site inspections each year, divided into Type One and Type Two inspections. Type One inspections confirm the accuracy of declared data on strategic arms, including warhead numbers on deployed missiles and bombers. Inspections under New START differ from START due to changes in counting rules for ballistic missiles. The treaty database in New START lists the aggregate number of warheads deployed on all missiles at a base. During Type One inspections, the team receives a briefing on the actual number of warheads on each missile before confirming the count. Inspected parties can designate one ICBM or SLBM for inspection, counting the actual number of reentry vehicles to match the provided data. Type Two inspections occur at facilities housing nondeployed or converted launchers and missiles, including ICBM and SLBM loading facilities, storage facilities, repair facilities, test ranges, and training facilities. These inspections provide added transparency by allowing parties to count the actual number of deployed warheads. Inspections are random and occur on short notice, deterring efforts to conceal extra warheads on deployed forces. Type Two inspections involve inspecting facilities such as ICBM and SLBM loading, storage, repair, test ranges, and training facilities to confirm technical characteristics and data accuracy. These inspections also verify that facilities are not being used inconsistently with the treaty and ensure the elimination of solid-fueled ICBMs, SLBMs, or mobile launchers according to treaty procedures. During the negotiations on the New START Treaty, Presidents Obama and Medvedev agreed on the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms. Both countries issued unilateral statements clarifying their positions on the treaty's relationship with missile defenses. Russia emphasized that the Treaty's viability depends on the United States' cooperation. Russia emphasized that the New START Treaty's viability depends on the United States refraining from developing its missile defense capabilities in a way that threatens Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The United States, on the other hand, stated that its missile defense systems are meant to defend against limited missile launches and regional threats, not to affect the strategic balance with Russia. Russia emphasized that the New START Treaty's viability depends on the United States refraining from developing its missile defense capabilities in a way that threatens Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The United States clarified that its missile defense systems are for defending against limited attacks and regional threats, not to impact the strategic balance with Russia. These statements do not impose obligations on either country and do not give Russia veto power over U.S. missile defense systems. Russia's unilateral statement on missile defenses is not legally binding and won't constrain U.S. missile defense programs. The New START Treaty allows Russia to determine if US missile defenses threaten its strategic nuclear forces. The treaty prohibits converting ICBM launchers to missile defense interceptors, except for those already converted at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The New START Treaty addresses Russian concerns about the U.S. converting ICBM silos to missile interceptor silos to add offensive missiles with little warning. Russia initially wanted to reverse this conversion or count the silos under the treaty limits. The U.S. agreed not to convert additional silos in exchange for Russia accepting that the five converted silos would not count under New START. This provision also protects U.S. missile defense interceptors from the START inspection regime. The provision in the New START Treaty bans the conversion of missile defense silos to ICBM silos, protecting U.S. missile defense interceptors from the START inspection regime. This ban eliminates the need for inspections to confirm the absence of limited missiles. The treaty does not limit the numbers or capabilities of U.S. ballistic missile defense systems, as the U.S. is constructing new launchers for its missile defense systems. Some have questioned whether the ban on silo conversion in the New START Treaty may limit future missile defenses. General Jim Jones stated that while it is a theoretical limit, in reality, the US has no plans to convert ICBM silos to missile defense interceptor silos. It would be quicker and less expensive to build new silos for missile defense interceptors than to convert existing ones. Additionally, launching interceptors from US ICBM silos could result in debris falling on US territory. The United States may consider locating missile defense interceptors in new launchers near the U.S. coast instead of converting ICBM silos at Vandenberg. General Patrick O'Reilly stated that building new silos for interceptors would be quicker and less expensive than converting existing ones. He also mentioned that launching interceptors from submarines was deemed unattractive and costly. The New START Treaty includes a provision on the impact of conventionally armed ICBMs and SLBMs on strategic stability, addressing concerns raised by Russia during negotiations. Deploying defense interceptors in SLBM launchers could compromise the primary mission of submarines to patrol quietly and remain undetectable. Russian officials have expressed concerns about the deployment of conventional warheads on strategic ballistic missiles, fearing it could lead to instability. They worry about the ambiguity of whether a missile carries a nuclear or conventional warhead, the potential for the U.S. to target Russia without warning, and the possibility of exceeding treaty limits by replacing conventional warheads with nuclear ones. Russia proposed banning conventional warheads in the New START Treaty, but the U.S. rejected this idea. This capability was seen as a means for the U.S. to quickly attack global targets. The U.S. considered deploying conventional warheads on missiles for global targets, not against Russia. The New START Treaty does not restrict U.S. long-range conventional strike capabilities. Deploying conventional warheads on covered missiles would count towards treaty limits, but expected small numbers would not significantly impact U.S. nuclear capabilities. New types of long-range strike systems with conventional warheads may not be affected by treaty limits. The United States may consider new types of strategic offensive arms as exceeding limits in New START. Russia can raise concerns within the Bilateral Consultative Commission, but the US is not obligated to accept Russia's interpretation. Both countries can address concerns about new strategic offensive arms, whether nuclear or conventional, in the BCC. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review planned to maintain a triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers under New START. The 2010 NPR outlined plans for the US nuclear forces under New START, including deploying ICBMs with one warhead each, retaining 14 Trident submarines initially, possibly reducing to 12 after 2015, and converting some B-52 bombers to conventional-only role. The Obama Administration's 1251 plan indicated the US would eliminate at least 30 deployed ICBMs, maintaining up to 420 deployed launchers. The 2010 NPR outlined plans for US nuclear forces under New START, including deploying ICBMs with one warhead each, retaining 14 Trident submarines initially, possibly reducing to 12 after 2015, and converting some B-52 bombers to conventional-only role. The Obama Administration's 1251 plan would eliminate at least 30 deployed ICBMs, maintaining up to 420 deployed launchers. Additionally, the US would retain up to 60 deployed bombers equipped for nuclear weapons, exceeding the treaty limits. The Obama Administration's plans for the New START treaty included deploying 14 submarines with 20 launchers each, totaling 280 deployed and nondeployed launchers. The final force structure would be determined based on the international security environment and Russia's force structure in the treaty's later years. The Obama Administration's plans for the New START treaty included reducing the number of deployed ICBMs from 450 to 400, retaining 50 empty launchers, and counting 4 ICBM test launchers as nondeployed. The Air Force will also have 60 deployed bombers and 6 nondeployed bombers in the force structure. The Pentagon had requested funding for activities to enable these reductions, such as an environmental assessment for eliminating ICBM silos. The Obama Administration planned to reduce deployed ICBMs from 450 to 400, with 50 empty launchers and 4 test launchers counted as nondeployed. The Pentagon requested funding for an environmental assessment to eliminate ICBM silos. Some Members supported retaining all 450 ICBM silos, even if nondeployed, to meet New START limits. Congress included a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2014 to address concerns about force structure decisions. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2014 limited the Pentagon's ability to reduce U.S. forces under New START. The legislation required a plan for force structure options, and the Pentagon has now submitted the plan. It is unclear if the reductions will proceed as outlined in Table 2. The United States has reached the reduced force level required by the New START treaty, maintaining a triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. It has converted many B-52 bombers to conventional missions, reduced launchers on Trident submarines, and retains 400 Minuteman III missiles. An additional 54 Minuteman III launchers do not hold ICBMs and do not count towards the deployed launcher limit. The US will adjust the number of warheads on deployed SLBMs to meet the treaty limit of 1,550 warheads when two additional Trident submarines return to the fleet. The United States reached the limits in New START by deactivating ICBM and SLBM launchers instead of destroying them. They exempted nondeployed launchers and reduced deployed forces by deploying missiles with fewer warheads. The Air Force deactivated 50 Minuteman III missiles, and the Navy eliminated four launch tubes on all Trident submarines. Russia completed the elimination of four launch tubes on all 14 Trident submarines as part of the New START treaty. By February 5, 2018, Russia reduced its forces to 1,444 warheads on 527 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, within a total of 779 deployed and nondeployed launchers. Concerns were raised about Russia's compliance with the treaty as the number of warheads deployed on Russian missiles exceeded the New START limits due to modernization efforts. Russia replaced older missiles with new multiple-warhead ballistic missiles and retired older ballistic missile submarines in favor of new Borey-class submarines. Russia replaced older missiles with new multiple-warhead ballistic missiles and retired older ballistic missile submarines in favor of new Borey-class submarines. The new Borey-class submarines are equipped with the new Bulava missile, which initially had some failed tests but has shown success since late 2010. Estimates of Russia's force structure in 2010 and potential forces under the New START Treaty are presented in Table 3, with the assumption that the RS-24 missile would carry four warheads, although reports suggest it could carry more. Russia plans to deploy a new heavy, liquid-fueled multiple-warhead missile to replace the SS-18, aiming to retain the 1,550 warheads permitted by the treaty. Data from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows that Russia may deploy fewer than the allowed number of launchers under New START. Despite eliminating older missiles with significant warheads, there are concerns about Russia's ability to stay within the treaty limits until 2021. The Obama Administration submitted the New START Treaty to the Senate in 2010. The New START Treaty was submitted to the Senate in 2010, including treaty text, Protocol, Annexes, Article-by-Article analysis, and future plans for U.S. nuclear weapons. The Senate offered advice and consent through a Resolution of Ratification, requiring a two-thirds majority vote. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held 12 hearings on the treaty, receiving testimony from various officials and experts. The Senate Armed Services Committee completed eight hearings and briefings on the New START Treaty, hearing testimony from senior officials and experts. The Intelligence Committee also discussed U.S. monitoring capabilities and treaty verifiability in a closed hearing. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a business meeting to mark up the Resolution of Ratification. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Resolution of Ratification for New START treaty, addressing concerns with U.S. missile defense programs, global strike capabilities, monitoring, and verification. The committee modified and incorporated some amendments into the resolution before sending it to the full Senate for debate during the lame-duck session of Congress in December 2010. During the lame-duck session of Congress in December 2010, the Senate debated the New START treaty. Some Senators proposed amendments related to ballistic missile defenses and nonstrategic nuclear weapons, but these were rejected. Amendments to the Resolution of Ratification emphasizing the U.S. commitment to modernizing its nuclear weapons infrastructure were accepted. During the lame-duck session of Congress in December 2010, the Senate debated and approved the New START Treaty, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to modernizing its nuclear weapons infrastructure and deploying ballistic missile defenses. President Obama confirmed that the treaty does not limit missile defense programs and proceeded with the deployment of the missile defense system in Europe. The Senate ratified the treaty with a vote of 71-26, and President Obama signed the instruments of ratification in early February 2011. Russia's President Medvedev submitted the New START Treaty to the Russian Parliament on May 28, 2010. Both houses of the Russian Parliament will vote on the treaty, with a majority vote required for ratification. President Medvedev aims to synchronize ratification with the U.S. to avoid delays seen with the previous START II Treaty. Experts believe approval in the Russian Parliament will be smooth. The Russian Parliament should be able to win approval for the New START Treaty with little difficulty. The Foreign Affairs Committee initially supported the treaty but reconsidered due to delays in the U.S. Senate. After receiving documents from the Senate, the Duma promptly ratified the treaty with amendments and declarations. The Russian Parliament ratified the New START Treaty on January 25, 2011, with the Federation Council also approving it unanimously on January 26, 2011. President Medvedev signed the ratification on January 28, 2011, with declarations highlighting concerns on modernization and sustainment of Russia's strategic capabilities. Russia ratified the New START Treaty, emphasizing the need for funding to modernize and sustain its strategic nuclear forces. The treaty includes provisions on offensive and defense forces, with Russia reserving the right to withdraw if US defenses threaten its deterrent. The law also addresses the inclusion of new strategic offensive weapons, like potential US prompt global strike weapons, under treaty limits, requiring agreement on counting these systems before deployment. The New START Treaty was ratified by Russia, with provisions on offensive and defense forces. The treaty raised concerns about the deployment of US prompt global strike weapons and the need for agreement on counting these systems under treaty limits. Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov exchanged ratification instruments on February 5, 2011, bringing the treaty into force and initiating early activities outlined in the treaty. The New START Treaty was ratified by Russia and the United States, bringing it into force on February 5, 2011. Early activities included displays of military equipment and meetings in Geneva to discuss procedures for on-site inspections. The parties also exchanged telemetry data on missile test launches during subsequent meetings of the Bilateral Consultative Commission. The Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) met multiple times between 2012 and 2016 to discuss the exchange of telemetric data during missile test launches. They agreed on procedures for on-site inspections and the use of tamper detection equipment. Additionally, they signed agreements to exchange telemetry on the launch of ICBMs or SLBMs during specific timeframes. The Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) met several times between 2012 and 2018 to discuss various issues related to implementation of the treaty, including data exchanges and inspections at SSBN bases. The State Department did not provide public details about the meetings in 2016 and 2017, but a total of 14 meetings were conducted by February 2018. The U.S. State Department noted in a data exchange in February 2011 that the United States had 1,800. The U.S. State Department reported reductions in the number of warheads and launchers under the treaty. As of April 1, 2014, the United States had 778 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers within a total of 952 deployed and nondeployed launchers. The United States reported reductions in the number of warheads and launchers under the treaty. As of January 1, 2015, the U.S. had 794 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers within a total of 912 deployed and nondeployed launchers, carrying a total of 1,642 warheads. The increase in deployed forces reflected the return to service of one SSBN, but numbers declined by October 2015 due to another SSBN overhaul and the Air Force completing the \"de-MIRVing\" of the ICBM force. Each Minuteman III missile now carries a single warhead. In 2015, the Air Force converted a portion of the B-52H bomber force from nuclear to conventional-only capability, removing 30 operational bombers from New START accountability. The United States had 1,367 warheads on 681 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers as of September 1, 2016. This included 416 deployed ICBM launchers, 209 deployed SLBM launchers, 10 deployed B-2 bombers, and 46 deployed B-52 bombers. The United States has continued to convert B-52 bombers from nuclear to conventional-only capability, reduce the number of launchers on ballistic missile submarines, and meet the New START limits with 1,393 warheads on 673 deployed launchers. The United States has met the New START limits with 1,393 warheads on 660 deployed launchers, within a total of 800 deployed and nondeployed launchers. Some analysts questioned if the U.S. reductions below the New START limits indicated a unilateral decision to reduce nuclear forces, but these reductions were temporary. The number of deployed launchers and warheads is expected to reach treaty levels by 2018. Launch tubes on deployed submarines were reduced, with missiles removed from launchers, not counting in the deployed force. Each submarine now counts as 20. The United States continues to have fewer than the permitted number of deployed missiles and warheads, with reductions being temporary. In September 2018, it reported 1,398 warheads deployed on 659 ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, within a total of 800 launchers. In March 2019, it reported 1,365 warheads deployed on 656 ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, within the same total of 800 launchers. In February 2011, Russia reported having 1,537 warheads on 521 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, with a total of 865 delivery vehicles. Analysts were surprised that Russian forces were already below treaty limits in New START. Some argued the treaty represented unilateral concessions by the United States. In September 2011, Russia reported 1,566 warheads. In September 2011, Russia reported 1,566 deployed warheads on 516 delivery vehicles, exceeding the treaty limit of 1,550 warheads. The increase in warheads could be due to new MIRVed RS-24 missiles or variations in warheads on SLBMs. The number of delivery vehicles had slightly increased to 871, possibly reflecting the retirement of older missiles. In April 2014, Russia reported 498 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers with 1,512 warheads. By September 2014, the numbers increased to 528 deployed units with 1,643 warheads. In March 2016, Russia had 521 deployed units with 1,735 warheads, showing a trend of new deployments outpacing retirements. In September 2017, Russia reported having 1,561 warheads on 503 deployed launchers, slightly exceeding the limit of 1,550 deployed warheads. This indicates a trend of reducing older systems with larger numbers of warheads. Russia reduced older systems with larger warheads and deployed new missiles with fewer warheads to meet New START limits by February 2018. In 2018 and 2019, Russia continued to comply with the limits, reporting 1,420-1,461 warheads deployed on 517-524 launchers. Some analysts questioned the increase in Russian deployment. Some analysts questioned Russia's increase in warheads in 2016, speculating on its compliance with New START limits. However, Russia retired older systems and deployed new missiles to reduce its forces below the 1,550 warhead limit by February 2018. Concerns remain about Russia's ongoing deployment of new missile systems and modernization plans, suggesting a potential for exceeding the limits under New START. Some analysts speculate on Russia's potential to exceed New START limits, suggesting the US should modernize its nuclear forces in response. Others propose pressing Russia to extend New START through 2026 to maintain limits on Russian forces. The US has not publicly questioned Russia's compliance with the treaty, certifying them as compliant in the January 2016 report. The US and Russia have raised implementation-related questions through diplomatic channels and in the context of the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC). Russia expressed concerns about the US conversion procedures for eliminating missile launchers and B-52 bombers, stating that it could not verify the elimination had been done in a way that permanently rules out the use of certain weapons. The Protocol to New START requires parties to demonstrate their elimination procedures if there are questions, but does not allow for objections or changes to be made by the other party. Russia continues to question the sufficiency of the United States' procedures for New START implementation. They have requested that their concerns be addressed before agreeing to extend the treaty. Both parties have exchanged notifications and conducted demonstrations as part of the treaty implementation process. The United States and Russia conducted all 18 permitted inspections at various facilities under the New START treaty, including ICBM, SLBM, and heavy bomber bases. Both nations completed their inspections before the end of the second year of implementation. Despite tensions following Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine, they continued to conduct these inspections annually. The United States and Russia conducted all 18 permitted inspections at various facilities under the New START treaty, including ICBM, SLBM, and heavy bomber bases. These monitoring activities will continue through 2021, or 2026 if New START is extended, to maintain strategic stability. The Trump Administration reaffirmed support for the nuclear triad in the 2018 NPR, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a second-strike capability with survivable ballistic missile submarines. The rationale for the triad includes hedging against unexpected technological problems or vulnerabilities while promoting deterrence and stability. President Reagan advocated for deep reductions in ballistic missiles due to their destabilizing nature. In his START proposals, President Reagan aimed for significant cuts in ballistic missile warheads but less in heavy bomber weapons. New START's counting rules reflect this, prioritizing reductions in missile warheads for strategic stability. The treaty may enhance stability by removing limits on mobile ICBMs for Russia, which lacks a strong second-strike capability at sea. The New START Treaty aims to improve the survivability of forces by deploying ICBMs on mobile launchers, prioritizing transparency and openness over limiting numbers and operations. Critics question its impact on U.S. security interests despite promoting strategic stability. The United States does not need a new treaty to maintain its triad, arguing that reductions in Russia's forces will occur naturally. Some question the relevance of arms control in the U.S.-Russian relationship, suggesting Cold War-era measures are outdated. The value of arms control is now debated in the evolving U.S.-Russian relationship. The debate over the value of arms control in the U.S.-Russian relationship has intensified due to the return of major-power rivalry. Critics argue that the presence of New START has not prevented the escalation of tensions, highlighting the treaty's failure to address Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Monitoring and verification measures in the treaty have been scrutinized for their effectiveness in ensuring strategic stability. Critics of New START questioned the effectiveness of the monitoring provisions in the treaty compared to the original START Treaty. They raised concerns about the reduced monitoring presence outside Russia's Votkinsk facility for assembling mobile ICBMs, which could impact the U.S.'s ability to track these missiles entering Russia's forces. The United States and Russia will no longer exchange telemetry data on ballistic missile flight tests, potentially reducing the U.S.'s ability to evaluate Russian missile capabilities. Supporters of the New START treaty argue that the verification regime is sufficient for ensuring Russian compliance, citing improvements in U.S.-Russia relations and differences in treaty limits. The monitoring regime in New START is streamlined to reduce costs and disruptions for both countries' military forces. The Obama Administration highlighted the importance of the New START treaty for monitoring U.S. and Russian military forces, emphasizing the need for cooperation to build confidence and reduce suspicions. They warned that delays in Senate consideration could lead to reduced confidence and potential instabilities. Additionally, they argued that without the treaty, there would be no monitoring or verification regime in place. The New START Treaty has different limits and restrictions compared to the original treaty. U.S. officials, including Admiral Mullen and General Chilton, expressed concerns about the lack of monitoring in the new treaty. Experts agree that both parties cannot be certain of each other's compliance due to ambiguities in the treaty language and gaps in knowledge. The New START Treaty raises concerns about monitoring and verification due to uncertainties in both parties' knowledge. Experts question if the US will have high confidence in Russia's compliance and the ability to detect potential violations. The Obama Administration believed the treaty met the standard for detecting cheating. The United States' ability to respond to any potential cheating by Russia under the New START Treaty is deemed minimal due to the triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that Russia would not be able to achieve \"militarily significant cheating\" without undermining its relationship with the US. The verification regime in New START is discussed in CRS Report R41201, highlighting differences from the original START Treaty. During the debate over New START, the Obama Administration reassured that the treaty does not limit US ballistic missile defense programs. Critics suggested the US might self-impose limits to prevent Russia from withdrawing from the treaty. However, officials argued this concern was unfounded, citing Russia's continued participation in negotiations after the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002. The Obama Administration reassured during the New START debate that the treaty does not restrict US ballistic missile defense programs. Critics suggested self-imposed limits to prevent Russia from withdrawing, but officials argued this was unfounded, citing Russia's continued participation in negotiations post-US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002. Historical data shows little reason to expect the US to restrain its missile defense programs, as highlighted by the Obama Administration's support for continuing these programs in various reviews and budgets. Critics claim Russia might seek new limits on US missile defense capabilities in the Bilateral Consultative Commission established by the treaty. The Protocol to New START establishes a commission to promote treaty implementation, resolve compliance issues, and discuss additional measures. Some speculate that Russia may raise concerns about U.S. missile defenses in the commission, but the Obama Administration has stated that new limits on missile defenses will not be negotiated. The State Department fact sheet indicates that the commission will be used to reach agreement on changes to the Protocol. The parties will use the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) to discuss changes to the Protocol of the New START Treaty that do not impact substantive rights or obligations. The BCC can address concerns related to implementing existing limits and restrictions but cannot impose new ones without amending the treaty, which would require Senate ratification. The Obama Administration did not agree to limitations on U.S. missile defenses during discussions with Russia. The Obama Administration did not accept limitations on U.S. missile defense programs during discussions with Russia. Russia has continued to question U.S. intentions and press for limits on ballistic missile defenses, insisting on including discussions about limits on missile defenses in negotiations for further reductions in nuclear weapons. Senator Barrasso raised concerns about the possibility of the United States accepting limits on missile defenses in exchange for limits on offensive nuclear forces during a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 18, 2018. The New START Treaty does not restrict the US or Russia from modernizing their strategic offensive nuclear forces. Both nations are upgrading their forces by replacing aging missiles, submarines, and bombers. Some Senators link their support for modernization programs to the ongoing implementation of the treaty. The United States is currently modernizing its nuclear triad, including bombers, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and submarines over the next 20 years. There is bipartisan support for nuclear modernization tied to maintaining an arms-control process and reducing Russian nuclear forces. Senator Corker emphasized the connection between modernization and arms reduction when the Senate ratified New START. The Obama Administration is pursuing life extension programs for warheads in the U.S. stockpile to ensure safety and effectiveness. The 1251 Report outlined a $180 billion plan over 10 years to enhance nuclear weapons stockpile safety, modernize the complex, and maintain delivery platforms. The United States has allocated $100 billion to the Navy and Air Force for the maintenance and modernization of their nuclear delivery systems. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that $350 billion will be spent over 10 years and $1.2 trillion over 30 years to modernize the nuclear arsenal. The Trump Administration supports the modernization of the U.S. nuclear triad and added two new systems to the plan. Some questioned the Obama Administration's commitment to modernizing the nuclear forces and warheads. The U.S. has allocated $100 billion for maintaining and modernizing its nuclear delivery systems. Concerns arise about the funding sufficiency to sustain the nuclear arsenal and expand capabilities. Fiscal constraints from the Budget Control Act have led to delays in modernization programs, raising doubts about long-term commitment. However, some argue that the Administration's budget demonstrates a strong commitment to recapitalizing the nuclear weapons complex. The U.S. has shown a strong commitment to recapitalizing its nuclear weapons complex, with a nearly 10% increase in the DOE budget for nuclear weapons in FY2011. Despite delays in modernization programs due to budget constraints, both the Obama and Trump Administrations have proposed budget increases above pre-New START levels. Russia is also modernizing its nuclear arsenal within New START limits. Russian President Putin announced the development of new nuclear delivery vehicles that may not be covered by the New START Treaty, including a long-range nuclear-powered cruise missile, a nuclear-armed underwater drone, and an air-delivered hypersonic cruise missile. The treaty addresses the emergence of new strategic offensive arms but may not cover these new systems. The New START Treaty does not specify how parties will address concerns about new weapons, such as those announced by Russian President Putin. The United States had not questioned Russia about these systems as of September 2018. Analysts doubt these weapons will be deployed before the treaty expires, as they are still in early development stages. The treaty only covers strategic nuclear forces, not shorter-range weapons. The existing START Treaty only covers strategic nuclear weapons, not shorter-range nonstrategic nuclear weapons. There is a consensus among Congress, the Obama Administration, and the arms control community to negotiate a treaty that increases transparency and possibly imposes limits on nonstrategic nuclear weapons, but it is acknowledged that this would be extremely difficult due to the complexity of the issues involved. Negotiating a treaty on nonstrategic nuclear weapons is challenging due to Russia's larger stockpile compared to the US. Some analysts question further reductions in US strategic nuclear weapons without limits on Russian nonstrategic weapons, highlighting Russia's significant arsenal of over 2,000 compared to the US's 200 in Europe. Some analysts argue that Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons do not pose a threat to the US or NATO unless there is an attack on Russian territory. Senator Lugar mentioned that most of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons have limited ranges and are not a missile threat to Europe. Many experts support negotiations on a treaty for nonstrategic nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia, but Russia may be unwilling to participate unless the New START Treaty is ratified and implemented first. Former Secretaries of Defense James Schlesinger and William Perry suggested including nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the next treaty, with the US ratifying New START as a step towards reducing them. The Trump Administration also expressed concerns about Russia's stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the Nuclear Posture Review released on February 2, 2018. The Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, expressed concerns about Russia's stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons. While not advocating for a treaty specifically limiting these weapons, it indicated that Russia would need to address these concerns before further negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons reductions with the United States. The Obama Administration believed that U.S.-Russian cooperation on arms control, including the New START Treaty, could advance nuclear nonproliferation goals. Some argue that such cooperation could also enhance collaboration on other issues, stating that \"cooperation is a prerequisite for moving forward.\" Some believe that U.S.-Russian cooperation on arms control is essential for imposing tough sanctions on Iran and demonstrating compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Calls have been made for the completion of negotiations on a New START Treaty to show commitment to reducing nuclear weapons. At the NPT review conference, the absence of an agreement would complicate U.S. efforts and reduce chances for a successful conference. Some argue the New START Treaty may not advance U.S. nonproliferation goals, as parties' positions reflect their own national security interests. Critics suggest New START could undermine U.S. nonproliferation goals by questioning security commitments and the relevance of U.S. nuclear weapons. The State Department announced the U.S. met its obligations under New START, demonstrating commitment to arms control obligations. The Obama Administration aimed to renew arms control with Russia through the New START Treaty, hoping for further reductions in nuclear arsenals. President Obama expressed intentions to engage Russia in discussions on strategic and tactical weapons cuts, including nondeployed weapons. This was reiterated in his State of the Union Address and a speech in Berlin. Obama announced plans to reduce deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third and seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures. Analysts supported further reductions beyond New START, hoping for limits on nonstrategic and nondeployed nuclear weapons. Suggestions were made for a comprehensive treaty to limit all types of warheads. Some suggested accelerating reductions under New START or amending the treaty to reduce permitted weapons, enhancing stability and reducing nuclear dangers. Increasing transparency on nonstrategic nuclear weapons was also proposed, while others disagreed on New START being the first step for further reductions. Some supported modest reductions under New START but opposed deeper reductions on deployed nuclear weapons or limits on nondeployed nuclear weapons. They also objected to President Obama's broader arms control agenda, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and his vision of a nuclear-free world. The defeat of the New START Treaty was seen as closing the door on further arms control efforts, as Russia showed little interest in negotiating another treaty. Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia would not pursue further negotiations until New START was implemented. Russia insists on including limits on U.S. ballistic missile defenses and nonnuclear strategic strike systems in any new treaty. Negotiating reductions in nonstrategic nuclear weapons and verifiable limits on nondeployed warheads in storage is challenging. The United States rejects Russia's proposals on ballistic missile defense and is unwilling to include conventional-armed cruise missiles in nuclear arms control. The prospects for a follow-on treaty in nuclear arms control negotiations dimmed in 2014 after Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The Obama Administration accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty by possessing a ground-launched cruise missile. Russia has not shown willingness to participate in U.S.-Russian arms control, and other nuclear weapons states like Britain, France, and China have also not joined the process. Russia is complying with New START, but further negotiations are seen as unwise. Some suggest the US should suspend New START until Russia complies with the INF Treaty. Others argue for continuing New START to limit Russia's strategic forces. Without an extension, the treaty will lapse in 2021. President Trump and President Putin discussed extending the treaty in 2018. President Trump discussed extending the New START Treaty with President Putin in 2018, but no agreement was reached. The Trump Administration stated that the US had met the treaty's limits and would continue to implement it, but did not indicate if an extension would be sought. The administration emphasized the importance of arms control efforts that enhance security and include responsible partners, while also highlighting Russian noncompliance with other agreements and actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The Trump Administration is reviewing the New START Treaty to determine its impact on U.S. national security interests. Key considerations include Russia's violation of the INF Treaty, the treaty's limits, the value of monitoring Russian nuclear forces, and potential linkage to Russia's development of new strategic offensive arms. Administration officials discussed this review before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 18. During testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 18, 2018, Under Secretary of State Andrea Thompson and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense David Trachtenberg highlighted how Russia's violation of the INF Treaty and its approach to arms control have eroded U.S. confidence in the process. They emphasized the importance of treaty partners maintaining compliance to avoid mistrust and miscalculation. Russia's noncompliance has created a trust deficit, leading the U.S. to question Russia's commitment to arms control for strategic stability, transparency, and predictability. The Deputy Under Secretary highlighted concerns about Russia's selective adherence to arms control agreements, posing a risk to the credibility of international agreements. Senators questioned the review's consideration of New START's impact on U.S. national security, emphasizing the benefits of limits on nuclear forces and transparency provided by monitoring and verification. Deputy Under Secretary Trachtenberg acknowledged the value of transparency in the agreement for the U.S. and its allies. The Deputy Under Secretary and Senators discussed concerns about Russia's arms control behavior and the need for a realistic assessment of the New START treaty's impact on national security. They also addressed Russia's development of new strategic offensive arms, nonstrategic nuclear weapons, and China's nuclear modernization programs. Analysts outside government have offered reasons why the United States should support the extension of New START, citing the maintenance of limits on Russian nuclear weapons, predictability, monitoring, and verification benefits. Some argue for extending the New START Treaty to maintain limits on Russian nuclear weapons and avoid misperceptions that could lead to a costly arms race. Others believe letting the treaty lapse would relieve the U.S. of obligations and provide leverage in negotiations for a new treaty. The New START Treaty extension may not constrain the U.S. nuclear modernization program, which plans to recapitalize its nuclear triad within treaty limits. However, concerns about Russia and China could lead the U.S. to expand its forces beyond these limits in the future. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review suggests the possibility of a larger program, but the pace of modernization may not be affected by New START even if extended for five years. The U.S. modernization program may not be affected by extending the New START Treaty for five years. Most new U.S. systems are scheduled to replace older systems after 2026, keeping the force within treaty limits. However, if the treaty expires in 2021, the U.S. might accelerate and expand its modernization programs in response to potential Russian nuclear program expansions. President Trump's National Security Advisor, John Bolton, discussed the New START extension in 2018, suggesting a need for more than just a simple extension. Nikolai Patrushev suggested renegotiating or replacing the New START treaty with a broader agreement. President Trump proposed including China in a new treaty. Renegotiating New START could press Russia for limits on new nuclear delivery systems, while reverting to the Moscow Treaty offers a simpler approach without detailed restrictions. The Moscow Treaty, supported by Bolton during his time in the Bush Administration, involved a pledge to reduce deployed warheads over 10 years. However, it may not be sufficient for the expiration of New START. Russia's reluctance to limit nonstrategic nuclear delivery vehicles could require the U.S. to eliminate nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia prioritizes limits on U.S. ballistic missile defense programs in the next arms control agreement. The agreement should include limits on U.S. ballistic missile defense programs, nonnuclear strategic-range delivery systems, and other nations' nuclear forces. Russia has not rejected U.S. proposals but wants to discuss new long-range delivery systems separately. Russia may produce only a small number of these weapons between 2021 and 2026. The Trump Administration has not provided details on how China could participate in arms control discussions, including whether China would agree to limits closer to the size of its arsenal or expand its forces to align with New START limits. China's nuclear force size remains undisclosed, but the Pentagon's 2019 report mentions China's missiles with a range exceeding 5,500 kilometers. China's nuclear arsenal currently consists of around 90 ICBMs on land and 48 missiles on submarines, totaling an estimated 130 warheads. China has around 280 nuclear warheads in total and has rejected joining nuclear arms control discussions in the past. China reiterated its objections to joining arms control discussions with the US and Russia in May 2019, stating that its nuclear forces were at the \"lowest level\" of its national security needs. China believes that countries with the largest nuclear arsenals should take responsibility for nuclear disarmament and continue reducing weapons to create conditions for others to participate. Ambassador Bolton and supporters suggest a return to the 2002 Moscow Treaty for arms control. The treaty provided the US flexibility in sizing its nuclear forces, with limits consistent with force levels already decided. It was set to expire in 2012 without imposing real restrictions on US force levels. However, the treaty lacked agreed definitions and monitoring provisions for forces covered by the limits. The 1994 START Treaty had provisions for monitoring forces, but the lack of verification in a potential replacement treaty could pose challenges. The monitoring regime under New START would expire, leading to a lack of transparency in US and Russian forces."
