    "content": "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was a major rewrite of the nation's telecommunications policy, addressing competition in previously monopolistic markets. However, there is a growing consensus that the Act does not adequately address current technological changes. Efforts to revise telecommunications law may go beyond the 1996 Act and modify the underlying 1934 Act. The 110th Congress is focusing on incremental revisions to telecommunications laws, including broadband deployment, digital television transition, media ownership, universal service fund reform, FCC oversight, and public safety communications. Unlike the previous Congress, which aimed for a comprehensive reform measure, the current Congress is considering targeted revisions that may be passed individually or with other legislation. The 110th Congress is actively examining issues related to possible revisions of telecommunications law, including broadband Internet regulation, broadcast indecency, digital television transition, FCC structure reform, media ownership rules, and spectrum auctions. Other important issues like taxation, privacy, and copyright are beyond the scope of this report. Broadband Internet access allows for high-speed data transmission through various technologies like cable modem, DSL, fiber, satellite, and wireless. While the number of subscribers is increasing, rural and low-income areas still lack sufficient access. The 110th Congress is considering ways to address this issue. The 110th Congress is examining federal broadband financial assistance programs and the impact of telecommunications regulation on broadband deployment. Some policymakers advocate for more government involvement to prevent a \"digital divide,\" while others question the need for intervention in the broadband marketplace. The regulatory treatment of broadband technologies, whether by traditional or emerging providers, has become a major focal point in the debate. The policy debate focuses on legacy regulations for providers entering new markets, new entrants competing with traditional providers, and the treatment of new technologies. The role of regulators in ensuring an open Internet is also a key issue. The debate over the regulatory treatment of broadband technologies, including open access requirements and net neutrality, is contentious. Emerging broadband technologies like fiber, wireless, and broadband over power lines are being developed and deployed, potentially impacting regulatory and market landscapes. Congress and the FCC may consider policies to address these new technologies. Two television events increased attention on the FCC and broadcast indecency enforcement. The FCC enforces an indecency statute that penalizes the use of obscene language on radio. Recent incidents like Bono's expletive at the Golden Globe Awards and the Super Bowl \"wardrobe malfunction\" led to increased penalties under P.L. 109-235. Violators face fines and imprisonment, and the FCC can revoke licenses. Indecent material must depict sexual or excretory activities and be offensive by community standards. The government regulates broadcast content to uphold decency standards. The FCC enforces indecency regulations on broadcast media, with fines of up to $325,000 for violations. Performers may also be fined for indecent material, but not broadcast networks. The government's authority to regulate indecent content was upheld by the Supreme Court in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. The FCC enforces indecency regulations on broadcast media, with fines of up to $32,500 per incident. The responsibility for compliance lies with the station airing the programming, not the performers. The federal restriction on indecent material applies only to broadcast media due to their uniquely pervasive presence and accessibility to children. Despite the rise of cable and satellite media, the Supreme Court continues to uphold the government's authority to regulate broadcast media, citing the landmark case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. The Supreme Court upholds First Amendment protection for cable television, requiring strict scrutiny for any governmental restrictions on content. It may be unconstitutional for Congress to limit indecent material on cable or satellite media. The FCC's application of the indecency restriction to Bono's expletive is uncertain, as the Supreme Court left open the question of occasional expletives justifying sanctions. In 2006, the FCC took action against television broadcasts with fleeting expletives, but in 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals found issues with the FCC's new regulations. In Stations, Inc. v. FCC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the FCC's new policy on 'fleeting expletives' as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court expressed skepticism about the policy passing constitutional muster. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit invalidated the FCC's fine in a unanimous decision on July 21, 2008. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit invalidated the FCC's fine against CBS affiliates for Janet Jackson's Super Bowl incident, citing arbitrary and capricious actions by the FCC. The court did not address the First Amendment question. Digital television (DTV) offers improved picture quality, sound, color, and new services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 limited initial eligibility for DTV licenses to existing broadcasters. The FCC phased in DTV over years to allow consumers time to transition to digital television sets or converters. Broadcasters were given new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing spectrum for analog transmission. The target date for broadcasters to cease analog signals was December 31, 2006. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allowed stations to delay returning analog spectrum if 15% of households didn't have digital services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 set a digital transition deadline of February 17, 2009, and allocated funds for converter box subsidies. The Congress is overseeing federal agencies like the FCC and NTIA to ensure American households are prepared for the February 17, 2009 DTV transition deadline. Private sector stakeholders are also being monitored for their efforts in educating the public. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL34165, The Transition to Digital Television: Is America Ready? The FCC, responsible for regulating communications, has faced calls for reform. Suggestions range from reorganization to abolishment, as some believe it has not kept up with industry changes. Congress may consider revising telecommunications law to address FCC's structure and duties. Proposals for FCC reform range from reorganization to abolishment. Suggestions include replacing commissioners with a single \"telecommunications czar\" and transforming the agency into an enforcement agency. Recent reform proposals focus on procedural and policy changes, with experts recommending limiting the time between order adoption and public release. Critics are concerned about delays in releasing FCC orders, leading to confusion in affected industries. Policymakers are considering implementing a \"shot clock\" to ensure timely order issuance. Proposed procedural changes include amending the Sunshine Act to allow more commissioners to meet outside official meetings, and limiting time for license transfers and renewals. The FCC is facing challenges in completing actions on license transfers, renewals, and enforcement mechanisms. Congressional interest in FCC reform is strong, but substantive changes may be difficult to achieve without a mandate. Potential revisions to the 1934 Act may be necessary for the FCC to regulate the telecommunications industry effectively. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL32589. The FCC's media ownership rules aim to promote competition, diversity of voices, and localism by setting restrictions on ownership of broadcast stations. In 2003, the FCC relaxed some ownership restrictions, but the 108th Congress modified the national television ownership rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stayed and remanded other FCC rules. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider an industry appeal of a case that overturned the FCC's rules. In 2007, the FCC modified its media ownership rules, allowing major daily newspapers to own a single television or radio station in the 20 largest markets under certain conditions. Critics argue that exceptions in the rule could lead to cross-ownership combinations in all markets. The FCC's new rule on cross-ownership combinations is being appealed by opposing parties. The rule cannot take effect until approved by the Court. The FCC also implemented 12 proposals to increase minority ownership of broadcast stations, open to all small businesses. There are discussions on improving data collection on gender, race, and ethnicity of broadcast licensees. Some argue that current rules block beneficial mergers, such as small-market television stations unable to provide in-depth news. Opposing parties are appealing the FCC's new rule on cross-ownership combinations, which cannot take effect until approved by the Court. Some argue that current rules hinder beneficial mergers, like small-market television stations unable to provide in-depth news coverage on their own. Proponents of greater consolidation claim it would lead to a more financially stable media sector, while opponents argue that loosening ownership restrictions would reduce independent voices and competition. They believe that new technologies like the Internet, cable, and satellite TV already provide enough diversity and localism. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition among providers of telecommunications services by prohibiting states from restricting entities from offering interstate or intrastate services. Some states have laws limiting local governments from providing telecommunications services, leading to legal challenges. In a 2004 Supreme Court case, it was ruled that state political divisions were not included in the definition of \"entity.\" The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition among providers of telecommunications services by prohibiting states from restricting entities from offering interstate or intrastate services. In a 2004 Supreme Court case, it was ruled that state political divisions were not included in the definition of \"entity,\" which has fueled a policy debate about municipal broadband services and their impact on the marketplace. The spread of wireless access to the Internet, known as Wi-Fi, and advances in wireless technology are changing the business case for broadband. Fiber-optic networks are profitable in urban areas, while rural communities are installing fiber-optic broadband due to lack of interest from for-profit companies. Wi-Fi technology is cost-effective and has a wider reach, expanding potential markets for broadband services. Municipal provision of broadband applies to all types of services, but the focus is on the market potential of Wi-Fi and its future technologies driving commercial interest. The market potential of Wi-Fi and its successor technologies is prompting commercial wireless service providers to oppose municipal competition. Urban areas are setting up Wi-Fi networks, offering free access to Hot Spots, which is seen as unfair competition by commercial companies. Municipalities argue that widespread Internet access through wireless connections is essential for the local economy and social services, especially in disadvantaged communities. The debate over public vs. private sector provision of wireless services is ongoing. Since September 11, 2001, Congress has passed legislation addressing technology, funding, and spectrum access for emergency communications. Advocates are pressuring Congress to clarify Section 243 or take action on the issue. The pace of technological convergence and its impact on emergency communication policies are key considerations for Congress when reviewing legislation. The convergence of technologies in emergency communications is reshaping policies for first responders and emergency workers. Core technologies like two-way radios, 911 call switches, and broadcasting are now being interconnected through advances in information technology, allowing for more efficient communication and coordination during emergencies. The functions of communications for emergency responders, 911 call centers, and public alerts involve using digital broadcasting and Internet Protocols for information delivery. Interoperable radio networks enable real-time participation by operators in 911 call centers, generating local alerts across various communication media. Developing common communications technologies benefits both providers and users, but federal policy and congressional action often address these areas separately. Cross-agency coordination and cross-jurisdiction cooperation are cited as areas needing improvement. Encouraging cooperation at federal and congressional levels is crucial for homeland security, with a focus on local, state, and regional participation. The 110th Congress aims to strike a balance between cooperative policy and federal leadership to support daily operations and national response in emergencies. Implications include exploring the Department of Homeland Security's response to legislation. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33747 on Emergency Communications Legislation. The 1996 Telecommunications Act includes an antitrust \"savings clause\" to preserve the applicability of antitrust laws. In Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, the Supreme Court denied an antitrust claim against Verizon for breaching its duty to share its network with telecommunications companies. Verizon had been subject to regulatory discipline by the FCC and the New York Public Service Commission. The Supreme Court ruled in Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko that the 1996 Telecommunications Act's antitrust savings clause does not create new claims beyond existing antitrust standards. The decision raised concerns about the impact on antitrust laws' prohibition against monopolization and the essential facilities doctrine in the telecommunications industry. The Supreme Court's decision in Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko clarified that the 1996 Telecommunications Act's antitrust savings clause does not create new claims beyond existing antitrust standards. This ruling raised concerns about monopolization and the essential facilities doctrine in the telecommunications industry. The Supreme Court's decision in Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko clarified that the 1996 Telecommunications Act's antitrust savings clause does not create new claims beyond existing antitrust standards. The Department of Justice emphasized the importance of preserving the distinction between violations of the Telecommunications Act and the Sherman Act. Congress has four options to address this issue, including leaving the current law unchanged, amending the savings clause, amending enforcement provisions, or characterizing violations of mandatory competitive obligations as prima facie. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 amended the Communications Act of 1934 with provisions affecting spectrum licenses, including requirements for competitive bidding methodology. The law prohibited the FCC from making spectrum allocation decisions based solely on certain criteria. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) included spectrum management provisions that directed the FCC to assign licenses for newly released frequencies over a 10-year period, ensure availability for new technologies, stimulate wireless technology development, and consider reallocating spectrum for more efficient use and innovation. The Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) expanded the FCC's auction authority and planned for the auction of spectrum licenses. Proceeds from spectrum sales are attributed to general revenue, with the creation of a Spectrum Relocation Fund in the 108th Congress to compensate federal agencies for relocation costs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171) established a Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund for certain auction proceeds. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund was established to assist in the transition from analog to digital broadcasting and for public safety programs. Over $7 billion from spectrum auctions was used for deficit reduction. Auction 73, which grossed almost $19.6 billion, concluded in March 2008. In 2007, companies petitioned the FCC for airwave licenses for a national broadband network. Opposition to the proposal includes concerns about the new network. The proposal for a national broadband network faced opposition due to concerns about harmful interference to nearby frequencies. Despite this, the concept of lifeline broadband service has significant support from policy makers. The universal service concept, established by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, aims to ensure telecommunications services are available to all Americans, including those in rural and high-cost areas, at reasonable rates. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established to provide funding for telecommunications services to all Americans, including rural healthcare providers and eligible telecommunications carriers. However, there is a growing consensus that the current design of the USF is no longer sustainable, threatening universal service policies. The FCC is required to ensure specific mechanisms for universal service, but competition and technological advances have negatively impacted the USF's viability. The current policy debate surrounding the Universal Service Fund (USF) focuses on concerns such as the scope of the program, funding methodology, eligibility criteria, and program integrity. There is also a specific issue regarding the application of the Antideficiency Act (ADA) to the USF program, which conflicts with some current USF commitments. The debate revolves around defining universal service, funding policies, recipient selection, and proper management. The FCC has taken action to sustain the USF, but legislation may be needed for full reform. Members in Congress are looking to address USF reform, which will likely be a key part of telecommunications policy debates."
