    "content": "The President signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 on August 2, 2011, containing multiple components that will impact subsequent legislation. This report provides an overview of the BCA's essential features, explaining its different components and terminology. Detailed information on each component is included to assist Members and staff in applying the new procedures. The appendices offer tools for quick reference, such as FAQs and timelines for actions related to the bill proposed by the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 outlines procedures for automatic spending reductions, with interpretations and implementation to be determined by the House, Senate, and Office of Management and Budget. Congressional Members and staff are advised to consult with the Parliamentarian for guidance on the legislative procedures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 authorized debt limit increases up to $2.1 trillion in three installments, with Congress having the ability to prevent future increases through a joint resolution. The act also outlines procedures to prevent Senate filibusters that could delay or prevent the resolution from passing. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for debt limit increases up to $2.1 trillion in three installments, with procedures in place to prevent Senate filibusters. The President may veto a disapproval resolution, requiring two-thirds support in both chambers to override. A resolution disapproving a $500 billion increase to the debt limit may be considered in September. Reaching agreement on the debt ceiling increase in the BCA depended on enacting necessary measures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established caps on federal spending through annual appropriations for 10 years, aiming to reduce spending by $917 billion. The adjustable caps are broad limits on discretionary spending, with separate categories for security and nonsecurity in the first two years. Congress will decide how these caps impact specific agencies and programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps for 10 years to reduce spending by $917 billion. Congress determines how these caps affect agencies and programs. The caps cannot be unilaterally waived and exceeding them triggers automatic budget cuts through sequestration. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was also created to develop legislation to further reduce the federal deficit. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, created under the Budget Control Act of 2011, has the authority to develop proposals to reduce the federal deficit without specific policy restrictions. The committee, consisting of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, can recommend changes to revenue, spending, or budget enforcement mechanisms. If approved by the committee, the proposal can be considered under special procedures in Congress, allowing for a simple majority vote without indefinite delay. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, established under the Budget Control Act of 2011, has the authority to propose deficit reduction measures without specific policy constraints. The committee must have its proposal approved by the joint committee by November 23, 2011, and passed by both chambers by December 23, 2011. Failure to enact a bill reducing the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion by January 15, 2012, will trigger automatic spending cuts, including sequestration. The automatic process for deficit reduction involves steps and calculations. Spending reductions are to be made equally from defense and nondefense spending, divided proportionally between discretionary and mandatory spending. Reductions are achieved through sequestration each year (FY2013 to FY2021) for direct spending and through a downward adjustment of statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2013-FY2021. The automatic spending reduction process involves adjusting statutory limits on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense categories. Some programs like Social Security and Medicaid are exempt, and Medicare spending cuts are capped at 2%. The exact implications of the reductions cannot be determined yet, as they depend on various factors including the joint committee bill's effectiveness and future spending estimates by the OMB. Starting in FY2014, part of the reductions will come from adjusting discretionary spending limits, not across-the-board cuts. The automatic spending reduction process involves Congress and the President determining reductions in discretionary spending through the annual appropriations process. Lawmakers are encouraged to work towards an agreement on deficit reduction to avoid across-the-board cuts. Lawmakers have an incentive to prevent automatic spending reductions by enacting a joint committee bill reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion or more. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a reduction process through a joint committee bill to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. Congress and the President could modify or terminate the process by passing a law altering the BCA. Automatic spending reduction actions will not take place until 2013. The BCA also requires a vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution between September 30 and December 31, 2011, potentially needing support from 60 Senators in the Senate. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a reduction process to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. If Congress does not approve a constitutional amendment, one avenue for increasing the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion will not be available. The BCA provides an expedited procedure for considering a balanced budget amendment if approved by either chamber. The BCA also makes changes to the DL program and the Federal Pell Grant. The Budget Control Act of 2011 makes changes to the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program and the Federal Pell Grant program. It eliminates Subsidized Stafford Loans for graduate and professional students starting July 1, 2012, and removes a repayment incentive on DL program loans. These changes are estimated to reduce direct spending by $9.6 billion over FY2012-FY2016 and $21.6 billion over FY2012-FY2021, with $17 billion directed to the Pell Grant program. The Budget Control Act of 2011 provides $10 billion in mandatory funding for FY2012 and $7 billion for FY2013 for the Pell Grant program. Additional funding may still be needed to maintain current eligibility parameters. The Act establishes procedures for expedited consideration of legislative proposals related to debt increase, joint committee bill, and balanced budget amendment. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows either chamber to modify or disregard the established procedures. This does not mean individual members can deviate without consequences, but rather that the House or Senate can modify the process under their regular rules without the other chamber's permission. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows chambers to modify procedures. In the Senate, unanimous consent agreements can change the BCA's application. Expedited procedures alter the right of Senators to unlimited debate. Senate rules require unanimous consent or 60 Senators' support for a vote. Procedures for joint committee bills and debt limit resolutions allow Senate to consider legislation without debate. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows the Senate to consider legislation without debate through expedited procedures, which include time limits on floor consideration and a prohibition on amendments. In contrast to the House, the Senate's procedures prevent amendments and require a supermajority vote for cloture. The House may bring up the legislation through a special rule, preserving key elements of the expedited procedures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows expedited procedures in the Senate for considering legislation without debate or amendments. This enables a numerical majority to bring up legislation even if the leadership does not seek its consideration. The Act authorizes increases to the debt limit in installments, with the first increase of $400 billion upon certification by the President. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for increases to the debt limit in installments. Upon certification by the President, the debt limit is increased by $500 billion. If Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval, the debt limit will not be increased, and budgetary resources will be sequestered. If the debt limit has been increased by $900 billion and is within $100 billion of the limit, Congress has 15 days to enact a resolution to prevent another increase. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for increases to the debt limit in installments. If Congress does not enact a resolution, the debt limit is increased by $1.2 trillion, $1.5 trillion, or an amount between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion. Initial increase of $400 billion is immediate, subsequent increases are subject to congressional disapproval. A joint resolution disapproving a debt limit increase can be considered under expedited procedures outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The resolution must meet specific criteria and be introduced by certain dates to qualify for expedited consideration. The exact language of the disapproval resolution is mandated by the BCA, and it cannot contain a preamble. The first opportunity to disapprove the increase must be introduced on September 6, 7, 8, or 9, 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 outlines procedures for introducing a joint resolution to disapprove a debt limit increase. The resolution must be introduced within specific dates after receiving certification from the President. If a chamber is not in session, the House Speaker and Senate majority leader must reconvene within two days. Each chamber can consider its own joint resolution of disapproval. The Budget Control Act of 2011 outlines procedures for introducing a joint resolution to disapprove a debt limit increase in both chambers. Each chamber could consider its own joint resolution, but ultimately the House would need to pass the Senate joint resolution or vice versa to meet the constitutional requirement of passing the same text. The act also allows for consideration of a resolution received from the other chamber before final passage vote. After a Senator introduces the joint resolution, it is placed directly on the Senate calendar without committee referral. The joint resolution can be brought before the Senate without debate if offered shortly after certification from the President. A non-debatable motion to proceed to a House-passed joint resolution of disapproval can also be made, expediting the process. If the motion to proceed is disagreed to, another may be offered within the provided time frame. The Budget Control Act waives points of order against consideration. The Budget Control Act waives points of order against consideration of the joint resolution and precludes motions that could delay its consideration. If a majority of Senators agree to the motion to proceed, the resolution will be the unfinished business until disposed of, requiring unanimous consent to turn to other business. Total consideration time is limited to 10 hours, divided between the majority and minority leaders. Senators wishing to speak will need to be yielded time from a Leader or floor manager. Time spent on requests, motions, quorum calls, and votes is included in the limited time. The Senate can consider a measure for less than 10 hours by unanimous consent, if time is yielded back, or with a non-debatable motion to limit debate. Certain motions are precluded by the Budget Control Act, and appeals from the Chair's decisions are not debatable. The Senate must vote on passage of a joint resolution immediately after 10 hours of consideration, with the option for a live quorum call before the vote. If the House version of the resolution is received, the same procedures apply. The House version of the disapproval resolution is received by the Senate, triggering a final passage vote in the House. The BCA outlines a special procedure for the House to debate and vote on the joint resolution within two hours, without allowing amendments or motions to recommit. The House can use statutory procedures or a special rule from the Rules Committee to consider the resolution. Under the BCA procedures, any Member can move for the House to take up a joint resolution within six days of its introduction. The motion is not debatable, and if agreed upon, the resolution will be debated for up to two hours without amendments or motions to recommit. The House can amend a bill through a motion, but this option is not available under statutory provisions. If the House receives a joint resolution of disapproval from the Senate before voting on its own version, the final vote will be on the Senate's version. A supermajority may be needed to prevent an increase in the debt limit if the President vetoes the resolution. Congress can override a veto with two-thirds support in each chamber. The BCA limits debate on veto messages in the Senate to one hour, divided between majority and minority leaders. The House follows regular procedures for veto message consideration, typically limiting debate to one hour. This allows a quicker vote on overriding the veto compared to regular Senate rules. The BCA limits the time for enacting disapproval resolutions in response to the President's certifications. Successful enactment may require passage by both chambers, presentment to the President, and a timely veto override vote. The President has up to 10 days to sign or veto a measure sent by Congress. The Budget Control Act of 2011 establishes 10-year statutory limits on discretionary spending, enforced through a sequestration process. The President's time holding a measure could impact Congress's ability to act on a possible veto before the deadline for enactment. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established 10-year statutory limits on discretionary spending, enforced through a sequestration process. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 previously set limits on discretionary spending, which were extended in 1993 and 1997 but expired in FY2002. Section 104 of the BCA repealed the expiration date, restoring many features of the previous limits for FY2012-FY2021. Spending limits for FY2012 and FY2013 are divided into security and nonsecurity categories. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established 10-year statutory limits on discretionary spending, enforced through a sequestration process. For FY2014-FY2021, the limits cap spending in a single category (specified as the discretionary category), which includes all discretionary spending in all budget accounts. The BCA allows for adjustments to exempt certain discretionary spending from the statutory caps for various purposes. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established 10-year statutory limits on discretionary spending, enforced through a sequestration process. Adjustments can be made to exempt certain discretionary spending from the caps for specific purposes, such as controlling health care fraud and abuse, disaster relief, emergency requirements, and Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. Adjustments are made annually by the Office of Management and Budget in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations and Budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established 10-year statutory limits on discretionary spending, enforced through a sequestration process. Adjustments can be made to exempt certain discretionary spending from the caps for specific purposes, such as controlling health care fraud and abuse, disaster relief, emergency requirements, and Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. Adjustments are made annually by the Office of Management and Budget in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations and Budget. The adjustments include additional appropriations for program integrity initiatives and relief activities associated with unexpected natural disasters. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011 include provisions for health care fraud and abuse programs, disaster relief, and Overseas Contingency Operations. These adjustments allow for additional appropriations over a 10-year period, with specific annual caps and maximum adjustments. For example, appropriations for disaster relief cannot exceed the average funding level over the previous 10 years, excluding the highest and lowest years, plus any shortfall from the preceding year. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011 include provisions for health care fraud and abuse programs, disaster relief, and Overseas Contingency Operations. The discretionary spending limits are enforced through a sequestration process, which involves across-the-board spending cuts in nonexempt accounts if appropriations exceed the limit. The President is required to issue a sequestration order to eliminate any breaches in spending limits. Sequestration is used to eliminate breaches in spending limits, with security spending being targeted if breached in FY2012 or FY2013. For FY2014-FY2021, sequestration would occur in the total discretionary appropriations category. Nonexempt accounts are reduced uniformly, with health and medical care accounts limited to a 2% reduction. A within-session sequester is required if a breach occurs due to additional appropriations during the fiscal year. The Budget Control Act (BCA) enforces discretionary spending limits through sequestration if breached, with reductions in the following fiscal year if breached in the last quarter. Points of order are used during appropriations legislation consideration to enforce the limits. The order of considering appropriations bills affects whether they are subject to the point of order, likely applying to the last appropriations act considered in each House. The Budget Control Act enforces spending limits through sequestration if breached, with reductions in the following fiscal year. Points of order are used during appropriations legislation consideration to enforce the limits. OMB and CBO issue reports to assist Congress in complying with spending limits and trigger sequestration if limits are exceeded. Reports include cost estimates of legislation and sequestration reports. The Budget Control Act enforces spending limits through sequestration if breached. OMB and CBO issue reports to assist Congress in complying with limits and trigger sequestration if exceeded. Reports include cost estimates of legislation and sequestration updates. Sequestration reports are required at specific times during the year to provide the status of discretionary spending limits. OMB's final sequestration report is crucial as it triggers a sequester by detailing the percentage reduction and amount of budgetary resources to be sequestered. Section 105(a)(3) of the BCA amends the Congressional Budget Act to establish procedural rules for emergency requirements. The rules allow the House to exempt provisions designated as emergency requirements from budget constraints. Members can strike designations and propose offsets for budgetary effects. New discretionary appropriations designated as emergency requirements will not count towards certain budget purposes. The House can adjust limits to accommodate emergency appropriations, exempting them from spending constraints. A new rule allows Members to strike emergency designations without facing a point of order. This change avoids budgetary effects counting towards certain budget purposes. The new rule allows for amendments to strike emergency designations and reduce appropriations to stay within spending limits, preventing budgetary effects from exceeding allocations. The new rule allows for amendments to strike emergency designations and reduce appropriations to stay within spending limits, preventing budgetary effects from exceeding allocations. Additionally, Section 106 of the Budget Control Act establishes procedural provisions for budget enforcement in the Senate for FY2012 and FY2013, which expire if Congress adopts a budget resolution for each fiscal year. These provisions set budget levels enforceable in the Senate, including constraints on spending in appropriations acts if a budget resolution is not agreed upon by the House and Senate. The Budget Control Act includes procedural provisions for budget enforcement in the Senate for FY2012 and FY2013. The chair of the Senate Budget Committee must file budget levels consistent with statutory discretionary spending limits and CBO's baseline levels. These levels have the same force as if they were included in a budget resolution adopted by Congress. The Senate Budget Committee chair must file budget levels for FY2012-FY2022 by April 15, 2012, in line with statutory limits. The chair must also reduce the Senate PAYGO ledger to zero, ensuring legislation doesn't increase the deficit over specified periods. Title IV of the Budget Control Act establishes a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with developing a proposal to reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over FY2012 to FY2021. The proposal, if reported by a majority of the joint committee by November 23, 2011, could be considered by each chamber under special procedures that prevent amendment and limit debate. The expedited procedures under the Budget Control Act apply to a joint committee bill passed before December 23, 2011. If a bill reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion is not signed into law by January 15, 2012, automatic spending cuts will begin in January 2013. The Act outlines specific actions and deadlines for the joint committee and Congress to follow. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was appointed by party leaders by the target date of August 16, 2011. If a seat on the committee becomes vacant, a replacement must be appointed within 14 days. If the joint committee bill does not become law, automatic spending cuts will be triggered in January 2013. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction members must comply with ethics rules, appoint replacements within 14 days, hire staff, and follow funding guidelines. Staff must also comply with Senate ethics rules and can request technical assistance from federal agencies. Funding is split equally between House and Senate appropriations accounts. The Budget Control Act requires the Joint Economic Committee to hold its first meeting by September 16, 2011. Committees of the House and Senate can submit deficit reduction recommendations to the joint committee by October 14, 2011. The joint committee is expected to develop a report with findings, recommendations, and legislative language, supported by a numerical majority in both chambers. The report must include a cost estimate from CBO and a \"statement of the\" for the legislation. The Budget Control Act requires the Joint Economic Committee to develop a report with deficit reduction recommendations and legislative language by November 23, 2011. The report must include a cost estimate from CBO and a statement of deficit reduction achieved from 2012 to 2021. If the committee does not vote by the deadline, no legislation will be eligible for expedited procedures under the BCA. The Budget Control Act requires the Joint Economic Committee to develop a report with deficit reduction recommendations and legislative language by November 23, 2011. The report must be approved by a majority of the joint committee and transmitted to key officials by December 2, 2011. Title IV of the BCA establishes rules for joint committee meetings, including a quorum of seven members required for voting and conducting business. The Budget Control Act sets a quorum of seven members for joint committee meetings. Lower quorum requirements apply for receiving testimony and conducting business meetings. Proxy voting is not allowed, and agendas must be shared 48 hours in advance. The joint committee has the authority to conduct hearings and call witnesses. The joint committee has the authority to conduct hearings and call witnesses, similar to House and Senate committees. Witness statements must be submitted in writing two days prior to the hearing, and hearings must be announced seven days in advance unless there is good cause for less notice. The joint committee, like House and Senate committees, can conduct hearings and call witnesses. Witness statements must be submitted in writing two days before the hearing, and hearings must be announced seven days in advance unless there is good cause for less notice. The joint committee cannot vote on approving reports or legislative language without CBO cost estimates available to members for at least 48 hours. After a vote, the information must be promptly made public. The committee will establish its own internal regulations, including adopting written rules of procedure. The joint committee, following its rules, transmits its report and proposed legislative language to be introduced as bills in both the House and Senate with identical text but different bill numbers. Each chamber then considers its own bill before a final vote to ensure both chambers agree on the same legislative measure. The joint committee transmits its report and proposed legislative language to be introduced in both the House and Senate with identical text but different bill numbers. The Senate majority leader introduces the joint committee bill on the first day the Senate is in session. The BCA allows for joint referral of the legislation to all committees of jurisdiction, unlike regular Senate practice. The BCA mandates referral of bills to committees without amendment by a certain deadline, ensuring they are placed on the legislative calendar for full chamber consideration. In the House, the majority leader introduces the joint committee bill, which is then referred to all relevant committees for review and potential reporting. The Budget Control Act mandates that bills be referred to committees without amendment by a deadline for full chamber consideration. The House can discharge committees that fail to report by a certain date, and the Senate has special procedures for considering bills. Senate decision-making can be influenced by filibustering, which can delay or prevent a vote on a question. The cloture process in the Senate can be time-consuming, requiring a vote of three-fifths of Senators to invoke cloture and allowing up to 30 additional hours for consideration of a question. Special procedures in the Budget Control Act expedite the Senate floor process by limiting debate and imposing time limits on bill consideration, avoiding the need for cloture. The Budget Control Act allows for prompt consideration of a joint committee bill in the Senate, bypassing the need for cloture. Once a qualifying bill is on the Senate calendar, a simple majority vote is all that is needed to take up the bill. Multiple opportunities exist for proponents to propose taking up the bill, even if the Senate disagrees initially. The Budget Control Act allows for prompt consideration of a joint committee bill in the Senate without the need for cloture. Additional motions to proceed can be offered without debate, precluding time-consuming roll call votes and ensuring a swift decision on taking up the bill. The Budget Control Act allows for swift consideration of a joint committee bill in the Senate without cloture, ensuring a prompt decision on taking up the bill. If the motion to proceed to the joint committee bill is agreed to, it becomes the unfinished business until disposed of, preventing the Senate from turning to other legislative or executive matters. Under the Budget Control Act, consideration of a joint committee bill in the Senate is expedited without the ability to propose amendments. Debate is allowed, but no changes can be made to the bill. The process is limited to a maximum of 30 hours, including time for debate, voting, and quorum calls. This procedure is similar to the time cap after cloture is invoked on a bill. Under the Budget Control Act, consideration of a joint committee bill in the Senate is expedited without the ability to propose amendments. Debate is allowed, but no changes can be made to the bill. The process is limited to a maximum of 30 hours, including time for debate, voting, and quorum calls. Time is controlled by party leaders, who decide speaking order and duration. This streamlines Senate procedures compared to regular rules where there is no time limit on speaking. Under the Budget Control Act (BCA), Senate procedures are streamlined for consideration of a joint committee bill. Provisions restrict motions like amendments, postponements, or recommittals. Appeals on Senate rules decisions are non-debatable. Other motions are limited to one hour of debate each. After 30 hours, the Senate must vote on the bill, requiring a simple majority for passage. The Budget Control Act (BCA) streamlines Senate procedures for considering a joint committee bill. A live quorum call can be requested before the final passage vote, with a simple majority needed for passage. Special procedures allow the House to bring the bill to the floor if committees do not act by December 9, 2011. If a motion to discharge the committee is agreed to, the measure would be pending before the House. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for streamlined House procedures to consider a joint committee bill. If committees do not act by a certain deadline, a motion to discharge the committee can bring the bill to the House floor for consideration. Once on the floor, the House has two hours to consider the bill without amendments before a final vote. Minority party's opportunity to offer a motion to recommit the bill is not guaranteed under the statutory procedures. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for streamlined House procedures to consider a joint committee bill. Once a motion to discharge a committee is disposed of, further motions on the same issue are not allowed. No motions to reconsider votes are permitted. The House must pass the bill by December 23, 2011, or it cannot be considered under the expedited procedures of the BCA. The House can consider the joint committee bill under a special rule reported by the Rules Committee. The House can consider the joint committee bill under a special rule reported by the Rules Committee, allowing for customization of terms of consideration and avoiding procedural steps created by the BCA. Amendments to the bill are unlikely to be made unless there is a specific reason to do so. The House can consider the joint committee bill under a special rule reported by the Rules Committee, allowing for customization of terms of consideration. Amendments to the bill are unlikely to be made unless there is a specific reason to do so, as it could affect the bill's eligibility for expedited consideration in the Senate. Under the Budget Control Act, bills introduced in each chamber must consist of the legislative text proposed by the joint committee, with no amendments allowed. If both chambers pass their bills, they must be identical. The House and Senate must pass the same measure, even if they pass their own numbered bills. The joint committee bill that passes a chamber first will be the one sent to the President. Amendments to the bill are unlikely unless necessary for expedited consideration in the Senate. The Budget Control Act specifies the process for considering joint committee bills in the Senate. If the Senate receives the House bill first, it will consider its own bill until final passage, then vote on the identical House bill. If the Senate passes its bill first, it will send it to the House for a vote. If the bill affects revenue, the Senate will vote on the House bill regardless of which chamber passed first. A presidential veto can be overridden with a two-thirds vote in each chamber, with limited debate in the Senate. The deadline for enactment to prevent automatic spending reduction process is January 15, 2012 under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The process includes overriding the veto with limited debate in the Senate. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set a deadline of January 15, 2012 for enacting legislation to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the period of FY2012-FY2021. If Congress and the President fail to act, automatic spending reductions will be triggered unless they agree to repeal or modify the process. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set a deadline for reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. If a joint committee bill only reduces the deficit by $900 billion, automatic spending reductions will be triggered. The process involves revising spending limits, calculating required reductions, dividing them between defense and nondefense, and achieving reductions through sequestration and adjustments. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set a deadline for reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. If a joint committee bill only reduces the deficit by $900 billion, automatic spending reductions will be triggered. The process involves revising spending limits, calculating required reductions, dividing them between defense and nondefense, and achieving reductions through sequestration and adjustments. The revised discretionary spending limits for FY2013-FY2021 redefine security and nonsecurity categories, setting annual limits for each through FY2021. The security category now includes discretionary appropriations classified as budget function 050. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set a deadline for reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. The revised discretionary spending limits for FY2013-FY2021 redefine security and nonsecurity categories, setting annual limits for each through FY2021. The security category now includes discretionary appropriations classified as budget function 050 (national defense) only, while the nonsecurity category includes all other discretionary appropriations. Annual limits for the revised categories extend the \"firewall\" between spending categories beyond the original two-year firewalls. These changes aim to achieve equal spending reductions between defense and nondefense accounts over the nine years through FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set a deadline for reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. The calculation involves five steps to allocate spending reductions equally across defense and nondefense functions for each fiscal year covering FY2013-FY2021. Table 3 provides hypothetical illustrations of the calculations required if the automatic process is triggered. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aims to achieve $900 billion in deficit reduction through a joint committee bill. This involves annual spending reductions in defense and nondefense functions, divided proportionally between discretionary and nonexempt direct spending. The required reductions are achieved through a combination of sequestration and adjusting discretionary spending limits from FY2013-FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates a sequestration process and downward adjustment of discretionary spending limits. This involves budget cuts for FY2013, adjustments for FY2014-FY2021, and sequestration for direct spending until FY2021. Certain programs like Social Security and Medicaid are exempt from cuts. The sequestration process follows specific rules outlined in the legislation. The sequestration process, governed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, includes specific rules for budget cuts on discretionary spending for FY2013 and direct spending until FY2021. The process involves a 2% limit on reductions for Medicare and certain health care programs, with OMB calculating and the President ordering sequestrations. Nonexempt accounts are uniformly reduced to achieve required spending cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates specific rules for budget cuts on discretionary spending for FY2013 and direct spending until FY2021. Reductions are required in defense discretionary appropriations, with nonexempt accounts within the defense function reduced by 9.9%. OMB must adjust downward the revised statutory limits on discretionary spending for each category by the amount of spending reduction required within each category for that year. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates specific rules for budget cuts on discretionary spending for FY2013 and direct spending until FY2021. Reductions are required in defense discretionary appropriations, with nonexempt accounts within the defense function reduced by 9.9%. The spending reductions in discretionary appropriations for FY2014-FY2021 are achieved by further limiting the maximum amount that may be appropriated in each category for each year. Congress and the President have the opportunity to determine the manner in which the reductions are made to each account through the annual appropriations process each year. These newly revised spending limits for each category would be enforced through a sequestration process. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets rules for budget cuts on discretionary spending until FY2021. It allows for a vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution between September 30 and December 31, 2011, without specifying the content or requiring both chambers to vote on the same amendment. The Act does not impose consequences for not voting on a balanced budget amendment, but successful passage in both chambers could increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for a vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which could increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion if approved by both chambers. The Act does not establish expedited procedures for considering a Constitutional amendment, and the House and Senate would follow their regular rules for the process. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for a vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which could increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion if approved by both chambers. The amendment would be brought to the floor by unanimous consent or a motion to proceed, requiring a three-fifths vote to limit debate. The joint resolution could be agreed to by two-thirds of Senators present and voting, with expedited procedures in place if approved. The Budget Control Act of 2011 outlines procedures for the Senate to consider a House-passed joint resolution, which must be reported by the committee of jurisdiction within five session days. If the committee does not report, the resolution is automatically discharged and placed on the calendar for the full Senate to consider. The Senate can take up the joint resolution by unanimous consent or a motion to proceed, with cloture possibly needed to reach a vote on the balanced budget amendment. The Senate must invoke cloture with the support of three-fifths of Senators to vote on a House-passed balanced budget amendment. The constitutional amendment requires two-thirds approval, which is likely to be met if the Senate approves the balanced budget amendment. Special expedited procedures under the Budget Control Act allow for 20 hours of consideration for the joint resolution. The Budget Control Act allows for 20 hours of consideration for a joint resolution on a balanced budget amendment in the Senate. No amendments can be offered, and certain motions are precluded. The final passage vote must occur within seven session days after the resolution is placed on the calendar. The House has special procedures to consider a Senate joint resolution on a balanced budget amendment. The Budget Control Act (BCA) outlines special procedures for House consideration of a Senate-passed joint resolution, allowing for two hours of debate with no amendments or motion to recommit. The BCA also impacts federal student aid programs, specifically the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) program and the Federal Pell Grant program, providing loans to students and parents to finance postsecondary education costs. The DL program offers various types of loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, including Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Subsidized Stafford Loans have the government pay the interest during certain periods, while borrowers are responsible for interest with Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. Subsidy costs are funded with mandatory appropriations, and administrative costs with discretionary appropriations. The Budget Control Act eliminates the availability of Subsidized Stafford Loans. The Budget Control Act eliminates Subsidized Stafford Loans for graduate and professional students starting in 2012. They can now use Unsubsidized Stafford Loans instead. The Act also removes a repayment incentive for Direct Loans disbursed after July 1, 2012. The Budget Control Act eliminates the Secretary of Education's authority to offer repayment incentives for borrowers of DL program loans. Borrowers currently receive interest rebates that offset origination fees, but the Act removes this benefit. However, borrowers who use automatic electronic debit will still receive a reduced interest rate. CBO estimates changes in the DL program would reduce spending by $9.6 billion over FY2012-FY2016 and $21.6 billion over FY2012-FY2021. $17 billion would go to Pell Grant program, $4.6 billion towards deficit reduction. Pell Grant program is largest federal grant aid for students, providing $34.7 billion to 9.5 million undergraduates in FY2010. Funding for Pell Grant program comes from discretionary appropriations bills and mandatory appropriations. The Budget Control Act (BCA) provides additional mandatory funding of $17 billion for the Pell Grant program in FY2012 and FY2013, reducing the need for discretionary appropriations in those years. The Budget Control Act (BCA) provides additional mandatory funding of $17 billion for the Pell Grant program in FY2012 and FY2013. Congress may need to provide an additional $1.3 billion over the FY2011 discretionary funding amount to maintain current award levels and eligibility parameters in FY2012. Congress could revise the program's award rules, eligibility parameters, and aid levels to reduce costs and the amount of additional appropriations needed in FY2012. The BCA does not make any other changes to the Pell Grant program. The Budget Control Act (BCA) sets spending limits for FY2012 and FY2013 in two categories (\"security\" and \"nonsecurity\") and for FY2014 through FY2021 in an overall discretionary category. The BCA allows an immediate increase in the federal debt ceiling up to $2.1 trillion without further action. To raise it further to $2.4 trillion, Congress must pass a bill reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion or a balanced budget amendment. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for an immediate increase in the federal debt ceiling up to $2.1 trillion without further action. Congress can prevent subsequent debt limit increases by enacting a \"joint resolution of disapproval,\" requiring two-thirds support in each chamber. To qualify as a joint committee bill under the BCA, the legislative language must include a statement of deficit reduction achieved from FY2012 to FY2021. Other requirements include majority approval by joint committee members and introduction by the House Speaker. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for an immediate increase in the federal debt ceiling up to $2.1 trillion without further action. A joint committee bill must be passed by both chambers by December 23, 2011, and can contain provisions affecting revenue. If a joint committee bill reducing the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021 is not enacted by January 15, 2012, an automatic process to reduce will be triggered. If the joint committee bill reducing the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021 is not enacted by January 15, 2012, an automatic process to reduce spending will begin on January 2, 2013. Spending reductions are achieved through sequestration for direct spending each year (FY2013 to FY2021) and for discretionary spending in the first year (FY2013). For FY2014-FY2021, discretionary spending reductions are achieved through adjusting statutory limits on discretionary spending. Some programs like Social Security and Medicaid are exempt from sequestration, and Medicare spending cuts are capped at 2%. The exact amounts of spending reductions required each year are not yet known. The exact amounts of spending reductions required each year cannot yet be known, depending on the joint committee bill's shortfall and future spending estimates by the OMB. Starting in FY2014, part of the reductions will come from adjusting discretionary spending limits, determined by Congress and the President annually. Exempt programs from sequestration can be found in Section 255 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act exempts programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and federal retirement from sequestration. If a balanced budget constitutional amendment is not sent to the states, there is no procedural consequence. However, if both chambers pass the amendment, the debt ceiling could be increased by $1.5 trillion. Both chambers are required to vote on a balanced budget amendment according to the Budget Control Act. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act requires both chambers to vote on a balanced budget amendment. If passed, the debt ceiling could be increased by $1.5 trillion. There are no procedural consequences if the amendment is not sent to the states. Additional information can be obtained by contacting the authors or CRS analysts listed in the report."
