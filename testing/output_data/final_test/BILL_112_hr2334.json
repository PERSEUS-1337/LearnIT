    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Comprehensive Problem Gambling Act of 2011\" and includes findings related to problem gambling. The \"Comprehensive Problem Gambling Act of 2011\" includes findings on problem gambling, such as its public health impact, social costs, and associations with bankruptcy, domestic abuse, and substance abuse. Over 6,000,000 adults met criteria for a gambling problem last year, with a social cost of $6,700,000,000. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is the lead Federal agency for substance abuse and mental health services, while there are no agencies or individuals in the Federal Government with formal responsibility for problem gambling. Many States are considering expanding legal gambling activities to raise State revenues due to budget shortfalls. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include programs for the prevention, treatment, and research of pathological and other problem gambling. Additionally, there are programs established to research, prevent, and address problem gambling. Title V of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include programs for researching, preventing, and addressing problem gambling. Part K is added for this purpose, including a section on public awareness (SEC. 597). The Secretary will conduct a national campaign to raise awareness about problem gambling, including supporting existing campaigns and creating public service announcements. Additionally, voluntary donations may be coordinated to fund new programs and support national campaigns through various media channels. The Secretary will target various media outlets and professional sports organizations to provide information aimed at preventing problem gambling. The focus will be on radio and television audiences of sporting and gambling events. The effectiveness of these activities will be evaluated, and a report will be submitted to the President and Congress. The Secretary will establish a national research program on problem gambling, develop a treatment improvement protocol, and integrate problem gambling into existing prevention programs."
