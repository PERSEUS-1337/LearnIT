    "content": "The Obama Administration requested $94.5 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2017, with significant increases in funding for highway, transit, and rail programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $76.9 billion in new budget authority for DOT for FY2017, rejecting the request to reclassify some expenditures as \"mandatory.\" The Senate began consideration of FY2017 appropriations for Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies. The Senate substituted the text of the Senate-reported FY2017 THUD bill for the text of H.R. 2577. The House Committee on Appropriations reported out H.R. 5394. The Trump Administration requested changes to the Essential Air Service program and the TIGER grant program. The Senate considered FY2017 appropriations for Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies. The Trump Administration proposed eliminating the Essential Air Service program and the TIGER grant program, and reducing the transit New Starts program by $400 million for FY2017. The Department of Transportation's funding mainly comes from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with 91% of its budget authority sourced from these funds. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget primarily focused on operations. Most DOT funding comes from trust funds supported by taxes, requiring periodic reauthorizations. The current authorization for federal aviation programs is set to expire in FY2017, potentially impacting structure and funding levels. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has fluctuated, with inflation-adjusted funding peaking in FY2010. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for DOT was $96.9 billion in new budget resources. The Obama Administration's budget request for the Department of Transportation (DOT) totaled $96.9 billion, with significant increases for highways, transit, and intercity rail. The Trump Administration has requested $1 billion in reductions from FY2016 levels, including cuts to the Essential Air Services program, the TIGER grant program, and the transit New Starts program. Federal highway and transit funding mainly come from the Highway Trust Fund, which has been experiencing deficits in recent years. The Highway Trust Fund is facing a shortfall due to the federal gas tax not being raised since 1993. The fund receives a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, leading to a decrease in revenue due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency. Congress transferred $143 billion to the fund from FY2008-FY2016 to maintain solvency. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts a deficit, with authorized outlays at $56 billion and projected revenues at $42 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increased fuel efficiency offsetting more miles driven. Highway Trust Fund revenues are expected to be $40-42 billion annually from FY2017 to FY2026, falling short of projected expenditures. The Administration requested $1.25 billion for TIGER grants in FY2017, while the Senate bill proposed $525 million with a focus on increasing funding for rural projects. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $450 million for transportation investments. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $450 million for the Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, which aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution and mode division. The TIGER program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance in various modes on a competitive basis. Funding has primarily gone towards regional and metropolitan projects due to congressional intent for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes. Congress continues to support the program through annual DOT appropriations, despite it being heavily oversubscribed. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the Department of Transportation (DOT) received $10.1 billion in applications for $500 million in FY2015 TIGER grants. DOT has faced criticism for awarding grants to lower-ranked projects over higher-ranked ones without clear explanations, citing the need to balance transportation criteria with other selection criteria like geographic balance. Critics argue that TIGER grants disproportionately favor urban areas, despite Congress directing at least 20% of funding to rural projects. The TIGER funding allocation process follows a consistent pattern each year, with the Administration requesting funding, the House proposing cuts, and the Senate usually providing the requested amount. In FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $150 million for the EAS program, with the Senate bill also proposing $254 million. This amount was reduced by $29 million from the previous year, based on expected cost savings. The EAS program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by the FAA. The program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The cost of the program has doubled since FY2008, partly due to route reductions by airlines resulting in new communities being added. The EAS program, funded through a combination of budget authority and overflight fees, aims to preserve airline service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Changes in 2012 included capping subsidies per passenger and allowing smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. Supporters argue it fulfills a commitment made during airline deregulation in 1978, while critics highlight high subsidy costs and low passenger numbers at many airports in the program. In 2008, Congress mandated railroads to install positive train control (PTC) by 2015 to prevent incidents caused by operator error. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most tracks were not compliant by 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020. $50 million grants were provided in FY2010 and FY2016 to help cover PTC installation expenses. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget included $875 million for PTC implementation on commuter railroad routes. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and changed the structure of its federal grants. The Administration's FY2017 budget for intercity rail development requested $6 billion in two new programs. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget included $6 billion for intercity rail development, with $1.42 billion allocated for Amtrak. The funding would come from a new transportation trust fund instead of discretionary funding. The Senate bill acknowledged Amtrak's $28 billion backlog for state of good repair on the Northeast Corridor. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.42 billion for Amtrak and $85 million in the Senate bill and $50 million in the House bill for intercity passenger rail grants in FY2017. This would be the first funding for intercity passenger rail since the 111th Congress. The Federal Transit Administration funnels most of its $12 billion funding to state and local transit agencies through various programs, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary transit grant program. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as the New Starts and Small Starts program, funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has four components: New Starts for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million, Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity, and the Expedited Project Delivery Pilot Program for projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. Funding for projects is disbursed over several years. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as the New Starts and Small Starts program, funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. Funding for projects is disbursed over several years. For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $3.5 billion for the program, with the Senate bill proposing $2.338 billion and the House Committee on Appropriations recommending $2.5 billion. Provisions in the bills varied regarding the federal share for New Starts projects. Critics argue that the federal share for New Starts projects should not be lowered, as it is currently more than 50%, compared to the 80% federal share for highway projects. They believe that this higher federal share makes highway projects more appealing than public transportation projects. On the other hand, advocates of the provision argue that a higher local match requirement allows the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to support more projects with limited funding. They also claim that a higher local match encourages communities to carefully assess the costs and benefits of transit projects, reducing the risk of cost overruns. Additionally, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion in grants over 10 years to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for preventive measures. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has received $150 million in grants annually for the past six years for maintenance and capital projects, with funding matched by DC, Maryland, and Virginia. WMATA faces challenges including a maintenance backlog and safety concerns, leading to restrictions on federal funding. An FTA audit in 2015 resulted in recommendations for safety improvements, with FTA assuming oversight of WMATA's safety compliance practices in October 2015. The Tri-State Oversight Committee, created by DC, Maryland, and Virginia, oversees WMATA's safety compliance practices. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends assigning oversight of WMATA's rail operations to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) instead of the FTA. Congress would need to act to give FRA authority. The Senate bill for FY2017 would have provided $150 million for WMATA, expressing frustration at the lack of safety progress despite additional funding. The Senate bill for FY2017 recommended $150 million in funding for WMATA and proposed changes to the hours-of-service rule for commercial drivers. The FY2016 THUD act suspended portions of the rule pending a study of costs and benefits, with the 2013 rules requiring a 34-hour off-duty period covering two consecutive 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods. Drivers were limited to taking this 34-hour \"restart\" once in a 168-hour span. The 2013 change in the hours-of-service rules aimed to reduce driver fatigue by requiring a 34-hour restart after working 60 hours in a week. This change prevented drivers from working up to 82 hours over a seven-day period, allowing for sufficient rest to promote highway safety. The 2012 rule aimed to prevent driver fatigue by requiring a 34-hour restart period covering two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods. The FY2016 THUD appropriations act temporarily suspended enforcement of the rule until a study shows significant safety improvements. The FY2015 DOT appropriations act, P.L. 113-235, set a standard based on a study's net benefit for operational, safety, health, and fatigue impacts of restart provisions. The Senate bill proposed a technical correction to the FY2016 THUD bill, limiting a driver's maximum work time to 73 hours in a seven-day period if the 2013 rule changes are rolled back. A cost-benefit analysis by FMCSA found the 2013 changes cost-beneficial, but a new study in March 2017 showed no significant safety benefits from the rule changes."
