    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007\". Congress finds that violence motivated by race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability is a serious national problem that disrupts communities and is inadequately addressed by existing federal law. State and local authorities prosecute the majority of violent crimes but could benefit from greater federal assistance. Violent crimes motivated by bias devastate victims, their families, and communities. This violence impacts interstate commerce by impeding movement, hindering purchases, employment, and commercial activities of targeted groups, and prompting perpetrators to cross state lines. Violent crimes motivated by bias impact interstate commerce by impeding movement, hindering purchases, employment, and commercial activities of targeted groups. Perpetrators cross state lines to commit such violence, using channels of interstate commerce and articles that have traveled in interstate commerce. Slavery and involuntary servitude were historically enforced through public and private violence based on race, color, or ancestry. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States were adopted to eliminate racially motivated violence and the relics of slavery and involuntary servitude. Members of certain religious and national origin groups were perceived as distinct races, so prohibiting assaults based on real or perceived religions or national origins is necessary to eradicate the remnants of slavery. Federal jurisdiction over violent crimes motivated by bias allows authorities at different levels to collaborate in investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The seriousness and widespread nature of bias-motivated crimes justify federal assistance to states, local jurisdictions, and Indian tribes. SEC. 3 defines \"crime of violence\" and \"hate crime\" according to specific laws. SEC. 4 provides support for criminal investigations by state, local, and tribal law enforcement officials. The Attorney General may provide various forms of assistance to law enforcement agencies in investigating and prosecuting crimes of violence or hate crimes motivated by prejudice. Priority is given to crimes committed based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim. The Attorney General prioritizes crimes committed by offenders in multiple states and rural jurisdictions facing financial challenges in investigating or prosecuting crimes. Grants may be awarded to law enforcement agencies for extraordinary expenses related to hate crime investigations and prosecutions, with a focus on addressing the concerns of all affected parties. Each State, local, and Indian law enforcement agency must submit an application to the Attorney General for a grant under this subsection, describing the extraordinary purposes for which the grant is needed. The application must be submitted within a 60-day period specified by the Attorney General. To apply for a grant under this subsection, the State, local, or Indian law enforcement agency must describe the need for the grant, certify lack of resources for investigating hate crimes, consult victim services programs, and ensure Federal funds are used appropriately. The Attorney General must approve or deny grant applications within 30 business days. Grants under this subsection cannot exceed $100,000 for a single jurisdiction in a year. A report on grant applications, awards, and expenditures must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2008. Authorization of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 to fund grants and report on expenditures.

Additionally, there is authorization for additional personnel to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement.
