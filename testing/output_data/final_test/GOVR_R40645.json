    "content": "In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, Congress is debating the extent of the outer continental shelf (OCS) available for oil and gas development. Industry advocates for full OCS access for energy security, while environmental groups push for moratoria to protect coastal areas. The issue remains contentious, with industry hesitant to invest without long-term leasing assurances. Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, the Obama Administration implemented new safety rules for offshore oil and gas development, leading to a suspension of drilling operations and a revised leasing program. The industry argued that the suspension caused significant disruption. The 2010 moratorium on offshore drilling caused disruption and economic losses in the short term. Despite this, crude oil production in the lower 48 offshore region was projected to increase. New safety measures were implemented, including separating functions of the Minerals Management Service to improve efficiency. The Minerals Management Service was divided into three new entities: BOEM, BSEE, and ONRR, each with specific functions related to offshore resource management. The transition was completed in 2011, with BOEM managing offshore development, BSEE enforcing safety regulations, and ONRR handling revenue collection and disbursement. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) previously handled activities now performed by BOEM and BSEE. Oil and gas development moratoria in the OCS were in place since 1982, but were lifted in 2008 by President Bush. Some areas in the Gulf of Mexico remain under a moratorium. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 placed most of the eastern Gulf of Mexico under a leasing and drilling moratorium until 2022. The Obama Administration's Revised Program for the OCS Leasing Program eliminated five Alaskan lease sales and cancelled Lease sale 219 in the Cook Inlet due to lack of industry interest. The Obama Administration withdrew the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area from oil and gas leasing activity until June 30, 2017. Public hearings began in 2010 for the 2012-2017 OCS oil and gas leasing program, excluding certain planning areas. President Obama cancelled lease sales after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, but held lease sale 218 in the Western Gulf of Mexico in December 2011. The first lease sale in the Western Gulf of Mexico since the oil spill took place. A combined lease sale in the Central Gulf of Mexico is scheduled for June 20, 2012, marking the final sale of the 2007-2012 leasing program. Recent high oil and gasoline prices have prompted calls for increased domestic oil development and discussions on lifting the moratoria on OCS exploration and production. Legislative proposals are being considered to include more of the OCS in the next five-year leasing program and ensure scheduled lease sales proceed. This report examines the impact of these changes on U.S. oil and natural gas supplies and markets, addressing resource assessments, the leasing system, and environmental and social issues associated with offshore oil. The 112th Congress is unlikely to reinstate a blanket moratorium on the OCS, with some Members of Congress advocating for open but restricted access. The President has the authority to place areas of the OCS under leasing and development moratoria, while legislated moratoria require the President's signature. Congress and the Administration will carefully consider which parts of the OCS to keep open and which to protect through leasing moratoria. The Revised Program plans to conduct a programmatic environmental impact statement to determine if seismic studies should be conducted in the Mid and South Atlantic Planning Areas, potentially generating more interest in those areas. The OCS generates interest in lease sales with the potential for higher revenue through bonus bids and royalty rates. There is debate over revenue sharing with coastal states. Industry seeks certainty for investment in exploration and production. Various bills aim to restructure OCS management and enhance safety standards. Legislation introduced in the House aims to restructure OCS management, improve safety standards, and increase efficiency in permitting. The Energy Security and Transportation Jobs Act combines language from previous bills and requires BOEM to offer lease sales in the most prospective areas in the OCS. Increased production goals are set at 3 million barrels per day of oil. The bill introduced in the House aims to establish production goals of 3 million barrels per day of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2027. It requires BOEM to offer lease sales in specific areas, including southern California and the North Aleutian Basin. The bill also amends OCSLA to allow lease sales in areas with high oil and gas potential, repeals the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and extends the boundaries of the EGoM moratorium until 2025. Limited leasing would be allowed in certain exempt areas in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Limited leasing in years 2013, 2014, and 2015 in certain exempt areas with high oil and gas potential. Provisions for revenue sharing with coastal states phased in for new leasing revenue. OCSLA would apply to U.S. Territories. Title XV of H.R. 7 appropriates federal revenues from offshore and onshore energy leasing to the Highway Trust Fund. H.R. 1230 requires four lease sales within a year of enactment. Administration's Revised Program scheduled to hold lease sales. The Administration's Revised Program plans to hold three more lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico. H.R. 1230 passed the House to reinstate lease sale 220. H.R. 1229 aims to expedite the drill permitting process. H.R. 1231 requires BOEM to offer lease sales. The House passed a bill requiring BOEM to offer lease sales in the most prospective areas for the 5-Year Leasing Program, aiming for increased production goals by 2027. Petroleum consumption in the US has averaged over 20 million barrels per day, with a significant portion used for motor gasoline. In the third quarters of 2008, oil prices soared to over $145 per barrel, leading to gasoline prices exceeding $4 per gallon. High prices, coupled with the recession in 2008 and 2009, reduced consumer demand for petroleum products. Political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 further drove up oil and gasoline prices. The U.S. oil industry relies on domestic production, imports, natural gas condensates, and refinery expansion to meet demand. The U.S. oil industry relies on domestic production, imports, natural gas condensates, and refinery expansion to meet demand. Domestic production of crude oil declined through 2008 but has increased in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken Formation in North Dakota in recent years. Access to oil supply is sequential, starting with domestic production, followed by non-OPEC imports, and finally OPEC to meet residual demand. Increasing domestic production of crude oil and natural gas condensates would likely result in a decrease in imports. The U.S. oil industry relies on domestic production, imports, and refinery expansion to meet demand. Despite a decline in domestic crude oil production through 2008, there has been an increase in production in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken Formation in North Dakota. Increasing domestic production of crude oil and natural gas condensates would likely lead to a decrease in imports. Offshore production of crude oil accounted for approximately 31% of total U.S. production in 2010, with the majority coming from the Gulf of Mexico. The state offshore production in Alaska accounted for 51% of the total crude oil production in 2010. The decline in proved reserves in federal offshore areas by 17% from 2004 to 2009 occurred despite high oil prices, indicating potential constraints on exploration and development. Declining reserve bases lead to decreased crude oil output, which can be mitigated through various methods. The decline in crude oil production from decreasing reserve bases can be offset with enhanced recovery methods, leading to higher production costs. In the United States, natural gas consumption has been over 22 trillion cubic feet in the last six years, with varying usage across residential, commercial, industrial, and electric power sectors. Consumption patterns remained relatively stable for residential and commercial sectors, while industrial usage declined but rebounded in 2010. Electric power generation saw a 26% increase in natural gas usage from 2005 to 2010. In the period 2005-2010, natural gas consumption in the United States varied across different sectors. Residential, commercial, and electric power generation sources showed low price sensitivity due to the necessity of natural gas for heating, lighting, and production. Industrial consumption was more price sensitive, especially in industries like fertilizer production facing international competition. In 2010, the US produced 85% of its consumed natural gas, with most imports coming from Canada. LNG accounted for 10% of imports. LNG imports accounted for about 10% of total U.S. consumption in 2010, mainly from Trinidad. U.S. natural gas production has increased since 2005, with shale gas playing a significant role. Despite forecasts, LNG remains a minor component in the natural gas supply at 1%-2%. U.S. proved natural gas reserves have increased by 42% from 2004-2009 due to new non-conventional deposits like shale gas. The global oil market is influenced by changes in demand and supply worldwide, impacting consumers globally. Price volatility is high in response to demand increases due to short-run inelasticity. During high oil prices from 2004-2008, actual demand exceeded forecasts due to unexpected world growth rates. The demand for oil exceeded forecasts due to higher-than-expected world GDP growth rates, leading to minimal excess capacity and substantial price increases. The economic recession moderated GDP growth and stabilized petroleum demand, but it is rising again as the global economy recovers. The emergence of oil contracts as financial assets and the role of expectations in oil prices are debated. The short-run inelasticity of demand and increased market sensitivity to expectations will influence the impact of opening offshore areas for oil exploration. Opening offshore areas with potential resource deposits may impact the price of oil, but the effect is uncertain due to existing reserve estimates being speculative. Even with modern technology, it would take 5 to 10 years before significant production reaches the market. Rigorous quantitative estimates on the price effect are not possible, but qualitative observations can be made. If oil markets have excess capacity when key decision points are reached, the impact may be limited. If oil markets have excess capacity when key decision points are reached, the impact on oil prices will likely be minimal. However, in tight markets, lower prices could result from increased reserves and production. Lower oil prices may lead to higher consumption and carbon emissions, but if new domestic supplies are used, energy dependence may not increase. Developing offshore areas may not reduce U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources. The development of new offshore oil sources may only replace lost output from older fields, potentially reducing foreign energy dependence. Construction costs for petroleum projects have risen due to high oil prices, impacting economic viability. Natural gas markets are regional, not global. The natural gas market is regional, with most consumption coming from U.S. or Canadian sources. LNG plays a role in balancing demand and supply, but its predicted growth has not materialized. As shale gas production increases, the role of LNG in the U.S. market will likely be small. New offshore U.S. supplies could impact domestic gas prices and contribute to energy independence. The United States has high natural gas prices compared to other regions, leading to increased home heating expenses and potential loss of industrial production. Offshore natural gas development may hinder the growth of LNG terminals in the U.S. due to difficulties in siting and permitting. Domestic gas resources in the Gulf of Mexico could make LNG terminals redundant depending on the volume of gas recovered. Offshore natural gas development in the U.S. may face challenges in a market dominated by onshore shale gas production. The Energy Information Administration projects an increase in oil production with complete access to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), mainly from the OCS reserves. Offshore crude oil production is expected to rise, particularly from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Eastern Gulf of Mexico planning areas, adding 500,000 barrels per day to U.S. supply. The EIA estimates uncertain increase in natural gas production from formerly restricted areas. Estimates range from 286,000 to 900,000 barrels per day in 2030. NPC study suggests potential addition of 1 million barrels of oil and 3.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2025 from areas previously off limits. The BOEM projects a potential increase in U.S. oil and gas supply by 2025 from areas previously off limits, with a cumulative investment of up to $98 billion in exploration and development projects. Deepwater offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to contribute significantly to this growth, with deepwater oil already accounting for over 70% of offshore production and 18.5% of total U.S. crude oil production. Shallow water lease sales have decreased while deepwater lease sales have increased, especially after the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act of 1995. Exploration activity and reported finds in ultra-deep areas of the Gulf of Mexico have also been on the rise. The Gulf of Mexico has seen increased activity and reported finds in ultra-deep waters since 2003. Development of deepwater leases is more expensive but offers greater reserve potential. The Gulf oil spill in 2010 and changes in regulations have slowed offshore development in the short term, with uncertain long-term impacts. Projections for offshore oil and gas production from previously restricted areas rely on technical estimates of resources. The quality of assessments of unexplored offshore areas and uncertainties associated with estimates are crucial as exploration and production progress in stages. Undiscovered resources are estimated before drilling, while reserves are measured after discovery. Reserves in developed U.S. OCS areas like the Gulf of Mexico are reported to the SEC by well owners. In undeveloped offshore areas, estimates of undiscovered oil and gas resources rely on geological data availability and comparisons to similar regions. The number and size of fields vary based on geological characteristics. The Secretary of the Interior instructed scientists to update estimates on offshore energy resources, highlighting gaps in environmental and energy data. Undiscovered oil and gas resources in new areas are estimated based on historical production in known areas, leading to uncertainty in estimates. Estimates of undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR) and undiscovered economically recoverable resources (UERR) are based on current technology and economic conditions. UTRR are volumes of oil or gas likely to be recovered with existing technology, while UERR are volumes that could be profitably recovered based on current prices. UTRR changes with technology advancements, while UERR varies with oil or gas prices. Three values for UTRR are reported based on probabilistic methods. The 95% probability represents the smallest volume, the 5% probability the largest, and a mean value is also provided. Users often rely on the mean value, but it's important to consider all three values to assess uncertainty. Assessments of UTRR on the U.S. OCS by the BOEM vary in statistical certainty by region due to differing geologic data availability. The central and western Gulf of Mexico and Southern California have more data, while other regions have less exploration and production history. Estimates of UTRR along the Atlantic Coast, much of the Pacific Coast, and coastal Alaska carry significant uncertainties. BOEM attempts to acquire geophysical exploration data along these coasts, but good data are difficult to acquire and much of the existing data are old. Initial estimates of UTRR change as exploration progresses, and no estimate of UERR has been attempted for U.S. OCS outside currently producing areas. Caution must be exercised when forecasting future production and revenues from the OCS. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) estimated offshore oil reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to be 8.55 billion barrels, with 6.88 billion barrels categorized as reserve appreciation. Natural gas reserves in the OCS were estimated to be 29.26 trillion cubic feet (tcf), with an additional 30.91 tcf in reserve appreciation. In the Unproven, Undiscovered, and Technically Recoverable Resources (UTRR) category, BOEM estimated nearly 86 billion barrels of oil resources, with 66.4 billion barrels available for leasing. Newly available oil reserves were estimated at around 13.9 billion barrels. The BOEM estimates a total of 420 tcf of natural gas reserves, with 55 tcf newly available post-moratoria. Newly available areas could be included in the next five-year leasing program. About 3.88 Bbbl of oil and 21.51 tcf in the eastern Gulf of Mexico would remain off limits. 131 million acres are available for leasing in the current program, with 76% of total acreage previously unavailable under the moratoria. 1,600 leases in production out of 8,124 leases administered by the BOEM in the OCS. Additional offshore reserves are likely to come from deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico have seen a 44% increase in proved reserves since 2006. However, many deepwater leases remain undrilled, with only a small percentage of ultra-deepwater leases being explored between 1996-2007. If the oil and gas industry continues investing in OCS exploration, the decline in offshore reserves could be slowed or reversed. The BOEM has divided the OCS into 26 planning areas within four regions (Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific, and Alaska). The central and western Gulf of Mexico have the greatest resource potential, accounting for 48% of UTRR oil and 50% of UTRR natural gas. Alaska contributes about 31% of the estimated oil and natural gas potential. Economically recoverable resources are provided based on an oil price of $80 per barrel. BOEM Planning Areas vary in water depth and distance from shore. Based on BOEM maps, potential oil and gas resources vary in water depth and distance from shore across different regions. In the North Atlantic, over half of the resources are in water depths of 200 meters or less, while in the South Atlantic, over 70% are located between 200-800 meters and more than 50 miles from the coast. The eastern Gulf of Mexico has the majority of resources beyond 2,400 meters of water depth and 100 miles from the coast. California's resources are likely within 50 miles of the coast and in water depths between 0-800 meters. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA) allows for leasing of OCS lands to extract oil and natural gas, with revenues generated through bonus bids, rents, and royalties. Lease sales are competitive, with successful bidders making upfront cash payments. Annual bonus revenues have ranged from $85 million to $1.4 billion. Bidding on deepwater tracts in the mid-1990s led to a surge in revenue, with offshore bonus bids totaling $374 million in FY2007. In March 2008, record-setting bonus bids of $3.7 billion were accepted by BOEM/ONRR at a lease sale due to high oil and natural gas prices. Royalty rates of 12.5% or 16.7% are imposed on production value, with potential for higher rates depending on location factors. Lease sales 224 and 213 required a royalty rate of 18.75% in all water depths. The Secretary of the Interior may adjust royalties to promote increased recovery, with annual rents ranging from $5-$9.50 per acre. The leasing process for offshore areas involves lease sizes ranging from 2,500-5,760 acres, with rental rates starting at $11 per acre for water depths over 200 meters. Bonding requirements range from $50,000 per lease to $3 million for an entire area. The Secretary of the Interior submits five-year leasing programs specifying time, location, and size of areas. Lease terms are 5, 8, or 10 years depending on water depth, with new terms for blocks between 400 meters and 1,599 meters. Leases for offshore blocks between 400 meters and 1,599 meters water depth were introduced in March 2010, with leases continuing as long as hydrocarbons are being produced. If no commercial production occurs by the end of the primary term, the lease reverts to the government unless an extension is granted. The regulations for offshore extensions do not specify length or conditions. It is unclear how often extensions are granted by BOEM. Many leases expire before production, and data on lease development status is not readily available. Nineteen lease sales were scheduled for the 2007-2012 leasing program, with nine lease sales having occurred to date. The most recent sale, lease sale 213, took place in March 2010. Lease sale 215 in August 2011 was cancelled. Revenues from lease sale 224 will be shared with coastal states as required by GOMESA. Thirteen of the 348 tracts bid on in lease sale 207 fall under the revenue-sharing agreement in GOMESA. The Obama Administration supported BOEM efforts for oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaskan OCS. Leasing in newly opened areas may take up to five years. Production could start 5-10 years after lease sales if commercial quantities are found. New infrastructure like pipelines and roads may be needed, especially along the East Coast. Concerns in the leasing process can delay or prevent development, leading to a large number of non-producing leases. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue estimated federal revenues from offshore leases at $6.5 billion in FY2011. Revenue from federal OCS leases varied from $4.1 billion in FY2002 to $18 billion in FY2008, with changing oil and gas prices being significant factors. In FY2008, $8.3 billion came from royalties and $9.5 billion from bonus bids. Overall, federal energy and mineral leases generated $11.2 billion in revenue in FY2011. In FY2011, federal energy and mineral leases generated $11.2 billion in revenue, with offshore receipts accounting for 55% to 75% of total leasing revenues. OCS leasing revenues are divided among various government accounts, including coastal states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the National Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. States receive 27% of OCS receipts closest to state offshore lands, totaling about $42.0 million in FY2011. States have argued for a greater share of OCS revenues to mitigate environmental impacts and support offshore oil and gas industry. Gulf producing states receive 37.5% of certain lease revenues under GOMESA. Land and Water Conservation Fund receives 12.5% of qualified revenues for state programs. BOEM/ONRR estimated that states would receive $3.1 billion through 2022 and $59.6 billion through 2067 from OCS revenues. Revenue sharing from lease sales and CIAP funds are allocated for coastal conservation and restoration efforts. The curr_chunk discusses revenue sharing agreements with states for onshore public domain leases, with Alaska receiving 90% of revenues collected. The proposed draft five-year lease program aimed to expand revenue sharing agreements with states. Opening the OCS to production could increase federal revenues by $360 billion to $1.4 trillion, representing a 15% to 60% increase over projected revenues. The Draft Proposed Leasing Program (DPP), 2010-2015, projected leasing revenues of $368 million based on 30 lease sales, with an additional $1.1 billion generated from taxes. However, these estimates are uncertain due to factors such as recoverable resource estimates, oil price projections, and potential future legislation changes. The environmental risks of offshore oil and gas development are evident in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is currently experiencing environmental risks from offshore oil and gas development, highlighted by a recent oil spill. Past events like the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill have led to debates on the risks versus benefits of offshore development. Despite advancements in drilling technology, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill showed that catastrophic accidents can still occur, especially in deep water drilling. The curr_chunk discusses general environmental risks associated with offshore oil and gas development, including how these risks have evolved over time. It references various CRS reports on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and highlights potential impacts on coastal wetlands and wildlife. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impact of offshore oil and gas development on various marine habitats and wildlife. It mentions restrictions on development in certain offshore U.S. waters, including areas designated as marine sanctuaries under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act of 1992. The National Marine Sanctuary System consists of 14 sanctuaries, with some potentially located in areas attractive for oil and gas exploration. While oil and gas activities are not allowed within sanctuary boundaries, they may be permitted nearby under specific provisions. Ongoing monitoring is conducted to assess the effects of nearby oil and gas development on sanctuary habitats. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico has been monitored for over 25 years in partnership with NOAA. Oil and gas activities are increasing in the surrounding area, but a buffer zone is maintained to protect the coral reefs. Industry is required to dispose of wastes away from the banks to prevent contact with the coral. Environmental regulations govern all aspects of offshore exploration and development. Several environmental laws and executive orders have been enacted or amended since 1982 for offshore areas, including the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments transferring air quality jurisdiction to EPA for OCS areas outside the Gulf of Mexico, emission limits on diesel engines and marine vessels, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 expanding federal spill-response authority and increasing penalties. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 in 1994, directing federal agencies to assess environmental effects on minority and low-income populations. The National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 establishes standards for artificial reef development to enhance fishery resources. BOEM supports the reuse of oil and gas structures for offshore artificial reef developments, providing habitat for fish in areas lacking natural hard bottom. BOEM supports the reuse of oil and gas structures for offshore artificial reef developments, providing habitat for fish in areas lacking natural hard bottom. Approximately 10% of OCS platforms installed are expected to become rigs-to-reef after decommissioning. Various acts, such as Executive Order 13089 on Coral Reef Protection and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, emphasize the protection of marine ecosystems and fisheries habitat. BOEM has issued notices to lessees on marine trash and debris containment to protect marine animals. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act emphasizes protecting fisheries habitat for long-term conservation. Fishery Management Plans designate essential fish habitat for managed species, requiring consultation with NOAA on actions that could damage EFH. The National Environmental Policy Act mandates a systematic approach to assess impacts of proposed actions on the environment. Thousands of environmental assessments have evaluated potential impacts of OCS oil activities. The OCS oil and gas exploration and development undergo assessments and environmental impact statements to evaluate potential impacts on environmental and socioeconomic resources. The process follows a tiered approach as mandated by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, analyzing environmental consequences for each management decision. The 5-Year Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement focuses on the proposed leasing schedule for the 5-year period. The Programmatic EIS evaluates the size, timing, and location of lease sales for a 5-year period. Detailed environmental analysis is conducted for each proposed lease sale, including identifying protective lease stipulations. A Multisale EIS may be prepared for multiple lease sales in a program area, with subsequent environmental reviews conducted for each sale. The MMS conducts environmental assessments for each proposed lease sale, consulting with various agencies and stakeholders. They also review exploratory and development plans to ensure proper environmental protections are in place, including site-specific mitigation measures. The MMS identifies site-specific mitigation measures in the form of conditions of approval, including avoidance of sensitive biological communities and archaeological resources. The greatest environmental concern with offshore oil production is oil spills or blowouts, like the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010. The risk of oil leakage or spillage during drilling and production offshore poses serious damage to wildlife and habitats. Since the Santa Barbara Channel OCS oil spill in 1969, measures have been continuously taken to improve offshore operations technology and implement stricter regulations. OCS facilities undergo annual announced inspections for compliance with environmental and safety regulations, with periodic unscheduled inspections by MMS. Federal OCS operators produced 7.49 billion barrels of oil between 1993 and 2007, with a strong safety record documented in previous analyses and MMS publications. Between 1993 and 2007, federal OCS operators produced 7.49 billion barrels of oil, with only about 47,800 barrels spilled during that time period. Despite advancements in offshore technologies, oil spills can still occur due to equipment failures or human error, especially during hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The impact of individual spills, such as the Deepwater Horizon incident, can be significant. The BOEM regulations require producers to have oil spill contingency plans in place, including equipment staging on dedicated vessels at drilling rigs and onshore bases. The MMS conducts frequent inspections of OCS activities and mandates the use of subsurface safety valves to shut-in oil flow during emergencies like rig loss. Seismic data collected using air guns towed by ships provide images of subsurface rock structures for oil and gas exploration. The impact on marine life is mixed, with some studies showing a temporary reduction in cod catch after surveys. Seismic surveys have mixed effects on marine life, with some studies showing temporary reduction in cod catch. Studies on fish species show little to no permanent damage. Research on whales and marine mammals found no unusual effects from controlled exposure to seismic exploration. More information on environmental issues related to offshore oil and gas exploration can be found in OCS Report MMS 2009-015. Estimates of proved reserves do not include reserves appreciation. Reserves are quantities of hydrocarbon resources anticipated to be recovered from known accumulations. Reserves appreciation is the observed incremental increase in estimates of reserves of an oil and/or natural gas field. Resources are concentrations of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons in the earth's crust that can be discovered and recovered. Undiscovered resources are postulated to exist outside of known fields or accumulations based on geological knowledge and theory. Undiscovered resources are postulated to exist outside of known fields based on geological knowledge and theory. Undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR) refer to oil and gas that may be produced without considering economic viability, primarily located outside of known fields. Undiscovered economically recoverable resources (UERR) are economically recoverable portions of UTRR. Unproved reserves are quantities of hydrocarbon resources assessed similarly to proved reserves but with uncertainties preventing classification as proved."
