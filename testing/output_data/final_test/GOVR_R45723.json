    "content": "Fiscal policy is how the government adjusts its budget through spending and revenue changes to influence economic conditions. It can impact economic activity by changing spending and tax revenue. Expansionary fiscal policy boosts economic activity, while contractionary fiscal policy slows it down. A deficit indicates expansionary policy, while a surplus indicates contractionary policy. Expansionary fiscal policy is used to boost GDP growth and economic indicators. Expansionary fiscal policy is used to boost GDP growth and economic indicators, but it can also affect interest rates, investment, exchange rates, trade balance, and inflation. Contractionary fiscal policy can slow economic activity to prevent overheating and recession. The impact of fiscal policy on GDP varies based on the business cycle, with recessions leading to lower spending, wage growth, employment, business revenue, and investment. During recessions, government can use fiscal stimulus to replace lost aggregate demand and mitigate negative impacts on individuals and businesses. This can be done through increasing government spending, decreasing tax revenue, or a combination of both. Government spending directly boosts economic activity through purchases of goods and services, while transfers to individuals indirectly stimulate economic activity. Tax cuts can also indirectly increase aggregate demand by providing individuals with more disposable income to spend on goods and services. Fiscal stimulus can help individuals buy more goods and services in the short term to lessen recession impacts. However, its effectiveness may be limited due to factors like interest rates, investment, exchange rates, and inflation. Implementing fiscal stimulus involves increasing deficit and borrowing money, which can lead to higher interest rates and lower investment. This can offset the economic activity boost from fiscal stimulus. When the government borrows a larger portion of available loanable funds, it increases demand and raises interest rates. This can lead to decreased economic activity as businesses find it more expensive to borrow money for investments. Individuals also reduce spending on items that require loans, like cars and homes, when interest rates are high. This phenomenon is known as crowding out. During a recession, crowding out is smaller than in a healthy economic expansion due to already depressed demand for investment and interest-sensitive spending. Government borrowing does not increase interest rates as much during a recession, leading to less crowding out of private spending. The Federal Reserve can influence the business cycle through monetary policy to maintain stable prices and maximum employment. The Federal Reserve influences interest rates through monetary policy, adjusting the federal funds rate to impact borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. It can complement or offset fiscal policy by lowering or raising the federal funds rate. Government fiscal stimulus may lead to a stronger U.S. dollar and increased trade deficit, partially offsetting economic activity. The fiscal stimulus can lead to an increase in interest rates, but the demand for investment in the United States may temper this rise. This increased demand for U.S. dollars can also boost the value of the dollar, leading to higher demand for imported goods. The fiscal stimulus can lead to an increase in interest rates, but the demand for investment in the United States may temper this rise. This can also boost the value of the dollar, leading to higher demand for imported goods and an increase in the U.S. trade deficit. If the Federal Reserve implements stimulative monetary policy, it can help offset the expected trade deficit increase by preventing a rise in interest rates. Fiscal stimulus aims to boost aggregate demand, but if done excessively, it can lead to inflation. Rising inflation can disrupt the economy and add costs, although low and stable inflation is seen positively. Inflation can reduce the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus on the economy. Rising inflation rates can hinder fiscal stimulus effectiveness by imposing additional costs and interfering with resource allocation. The Federal Reserve can counteract inflation by increasing interest rates, slowing economic activity and neutralizing stimulus. Economists use fiscal multipliers to evaluate the impact of government spending on the economy. The fiscal multiplier measures the impact of government spending on the economy. A multiplier larger than one suggests that for each dollar spent, the economy grows by more than one dollar, while a multiplier less than one indicates growth of less than one dollar. The multiplier can vary depending on the form of the stimulus and the economic model used. The fiscal multiplier measures the impact of government spending on the economy, with varying estimates for different forms of stimulus. Increasing government spending on consumption by 1% of GDP could result in a 1.55% increase in GDP, while decreasing labor income taxes by 1% of GDP could lead to a 0.23% increase in GDP. Persistently applying fiscal stimulus can have varying effects on the economy depending on the business cycle. During a recession, fiscal stimulus is more likely to result in a larger increase in economic activity, with fiscal multipliers ranging between 1.0 and 1.5. However, persistently applying fiscal stimulus can lead to negative consequences such as rising debt-to-GDP ratios and unsustainable levels of debt. Persistent fiscal stimulus can limit long-term economic growth by crowding out private investment and increasing public debt. Research suggests that a 10-percentage-point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a decrease in per capita real GDP growth. A rising debt-to-GDP ratio can lead to unsustainable levels of debt and increase the risk of government default. The perceived risk of government default rises as public debt increases, leading investors to demand higher interest rates. The tipping point for debt sustainability is unpredictable, influenced by factors like debt denomination, political circumstances, and economic conditions. The US currently shows no immediate concern for unsustainability, but its debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise continuously under current policy. Persistent fiscal stimulus and budget deficits can decrease the economy in the long term by lowering business investment in physical capital, leading to lower productive capacity. The increase in interest rates and decline in domestic investment from fiscal stimulus may be offset by foreign investment in the US economy. However, this results in sending a portion of national income abroad through interest payments. Rising public debt leads to increased interest payments, potentially displacing government spending on important programs. Interest payments on the debt are projected to increase significantly, reaching about 3.0% of GDP or $921 billion by 2029. As the economy improves, policymakers may reduce fiscal stimulus to prevent negative consequences like decreasing investment and rising trade deficits. The negative consequences of fiscal stimulus include decreasing investment, rising trade deficits, and accelerating inflation. The government can withdraw fiscal stimulus by increasing taxes, decreasing spending, or a combination of the two, which temporarily slows economic growth. Regardless of the mix of fiscal policy choices used, withdrawing fiscal stimulus is expected to decrease aggregate demand in the near term. Withdrawing fiscal stimulus is expected to result in lower interest rates, a depreciation of the U.S. dollar, and a shrinking trade deficit, which can spur additional economic activity. Decreasing the budget deficit reduces the demand for loanable funds, leading to lower interest rates and encouraging more spending and investment. The decline in interest rates due to withdrawing fiscal stimulus encourages increased business investment and consumer spending. This is expected to result in a depreciation of the U.S. dollar and an improved trade balance. Individuals may shift investments outside the U.S. to benefit from higher interest rates abroad, leading to a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. When fiscal stimulus is withdrawn, U.S. goods become more expensive for residents while foreign goods become cheaper. This leads to an improved trade balance as exports increase and imports decrease. Withdrawal of fiscal stimulus also shrinks aggregate demand, slowing inflation and promoting economic growth. The impact depends on effects on demand, interest rates, investment, exchange rates, trade deficit, and inflation. When fiscal stimulus is withdrawn, U.S. goods become more expensive for residents while foreign goods become cheaper, improving the trade balance. This also shrinks aggregate demand, slowing inflation and promoting economic growth. Fiscal multipliers can estimate the impact of withdrawing fiscal stimulus, with decreasing government spending on consumption by 1% of GDP expected to reduce real GDP by 1.55% after the first year. Monetary policy can be used alongside fiscal policy to offset the decline in aggregate demand resulting from the shrinking deficit. The federal government has been running a budget deficit for much of the past 30 years, indicating ongoing fiscal stimulus to the economy. However, judging the level of stimulus based solely on the budget deficit can be misleading due to changes in federal spending and revenue driven by economic conditions. During economic expansions, rising incomes lead to higher tax revenues and lower spending on income support programs, improving the government's budget deficit. Conversely, during recessions, federal spending increases and revenue decreases. These cyclical fluctuations, known as automatic stabilizers, should be excluded when estimating the structural deficit to understand Congress's fiscal policy decisions. The federal budget deficit tends to increase during and after recessions as policymakers apply fiscal stimulus. The structural deficit peaked in 2009 at 7.5% of GDP, declined to 2.0% by 2014, but started rising again in 2016, reaching 4.0% in 2018 despite strong economic conditions. This increase in fiscal stimulus is notable given the current full employment levels. The increase in fiscal stimulus since 2016 is notable, even with full employment. Expanding fiscal stimulus when the economy is not depressed can lead to rising interest rates, a growing trade deficit, and higher inflation. However, as of the publication of this report, interest rates and inflation have not been affected, remaining low, and there are no signs of accelerated inflation. The trade deficit has been growing, but it is unclear if this is directly linked to the increased fiscal stimulus."
