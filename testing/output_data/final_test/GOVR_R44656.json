    "content": "The USDA provides support to the U.S. farm economy through federal farm programs, with billions of dollars transferred annually. Program payments vary by commodities, regions, and farm sizes, sparking interest in program eligibility and payment limits. Payment limits and eligibility requirements are crucial for U.S. farm programs, determining who receives federal support and how much. To qualify for major farm revenue programs, individuals must be \"actively engaged in farming\" by contributing labor or management to the operation. Not all programs have the same criteria, and eligibility can vary based on the farm's legal entity. This report focuses on the current requirements for determining eligibility as \"actively engaged in farming.\" The report discusses the historical development of eligibility criteria for farm program payments and key terms for defining a farm business. It also covers current requirements for determining if a person or entity is \"actively engaged in farming\" by legal entity type, including a 2015 USDA rule. The 2015 USDA rule clarifies what constitutes AEF for nonfamily members of a farming operation, how multiple nonfamily persons can qualify as active farm managers (up to three), and the recordkeeping requirements. The report also addresses potential issues for Congress regarding regulations on AEF criteria and farm program payment limit and eligibility issues. The Farm Program Payments Integrity Act of 1987 was enacted to restrict payments to actual farmers after concerns about farm payments going to individuals not involved in farming. The law required individuals or entities to meet AEF criteria to receive farm commodity payments. Since the enactment of the Farm Program Payments Integrity Act of 1987, AEF criteria have been essential for farm commodity payment eligibility. Approximately $9 billion per year in farm support program payments have been subject to these criteria since 1996. However, defining what qualifies as AEF has been challenging, with criticisms from the GAO in 2004 regarding the lack of a measurable standard for \"significant contribution of active personal management.\" This has led to the evolution of the AEF definition over the years. The definition of AEF has evolved over the years as Congress and USDA have tightened payment eligibility criteria. The 2008 farm bill added specificity to the definition of person and legal entity, limiting qualifying payments and expanding payment limits. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to add more specificity to the role of nonfamily producers in legal entities to qualify for farm program benefits. Family farms receive special treatment in these criteria. Family farms receive special treatment in farm program eligibility criteria, with every adult family member 18 years or older deemed to meet the AEF requirements. The 2018 farm bill expanded the definition of family member to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews, leading to scrutiny and criticism from rural and farm advocacy groups and certain Members of Congress. Critics argue that the current USDA eligibility criteria for active personal management are broad and subjective, potentially allowing for easy qualification for payments. The farm program eligibility criteria have a low threshold for payments, allowing family farms to increase their payment limit by adding adult family members. Sole proprietorships and family farms make up the majority of U.S. farm operations. Family farm or sole proprietorships comprised nearly 87% of U.S. farm operations in 2012. Joint operations and corporations make up the majority of U.S. farm operations, with special rules for evaluating eligibility and payment limits for different types of legal entities. To be eligible for farm program payments, participants must provide personal or entity information, such as name, address, and either a social security number (SSN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or Employee Identification Number (EIN). Each person with ownership interest in a legal entity must have a TIN or EIN and declare their interest share using USDA forms. Participants in farm programs must submit two USDA forms: CCC-901 (Members' Information) and CCC-902 (Farm Operating Plan) to identify participating persons/entities and their stake in the operation. These forms need to be kept current for any changes in the farming operation, such as adding new family members or altering capital shares. The AEF criteria are essential for determining active engagement in farming operations and eligibility for various farm programs and payments under the 2018 farm bill. This includes programs like ARC, PLC, MAL, Cotton Ginning Cost-Share, Market Facilitation, and Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers. Meeting AEF requirements is necessary to receive payments. The AEF requirements are crucial for determining active engagement in farming operations and eligibility for various farm programs and payments under the 2018 farm bill. These criteria apply to U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and foreign entities. To qualify as AEF, individuals and legal entities must meet specific requirements regarding their participation in the farming operation. The 2014 and 2018 farm bills define a producer as an owner, operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper who shares in the risk of producing a crop and is entitled to a share of the crop produced on the farm. The 2018 farm bill defines a producer as someone who meets specific AEF criteria, including making a significant contribution to the farming operation, sharing in profits or losses, and sharing in the risk of loss. USDA interprets these criteria as met if a person receives income based on the farm's operating results. The 2018 farm bill defines a producer as someone who meets specific AEF criteria, including making a significant contribution to the farming operation and sharing in profits or losses from the crop. Ownership or rental control of farm assets criteria are straightforward, while active personal labor involves physically providing necessary activities in farming operations. This includes land preparation, planting, cultivating, harvesting, marketing agricultural commodities, establishing conserving cover crops, and livestock operations. Individual labor contribution must be at least 1,000 hours annually or 50% of total hours needed for a comparable farming operation. The 2018 farm bill defines a producer as someone who meets specific AEF criteria, including making a significant contribution to the farming operation and sharing in profits or losses from the crop. Ownership or rental control of farm assets criteria are straightforward, while active personal management involves providing critical activities for the profitability of the farming operation, such as capital, labor, and agronomics/marketing. The GAO noted in a 2013 report that this broad definition of active personal management made it challenging for USDA to determine eligibility. The 2018 farm bill defines a producer as someone meeting specific AEF criteria, including significant contribution to the farming operation and sharing profits or losses. GAO noted the challenge for USDA in determining eligibility due to the broad definition of active personal management. The \"active\" personal labor requirement implies physical presence for farming activities, while the management requirement is less clear on location, potentially allowing remote contributions. Special treatment is allowed for a spouse actively engaged in farming. The 2018 farm bill defines a producer as meeting specific AEF criteria, including significant contribution to the farming operation and sharing profits or losses. Special treatment is given to a spouse actively engaged in farming, allowing for a doubling of the individual payment limit. Family membership in a farm business is defined broadly, and every adult family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm's operating results is deemed to meet the AEF requirements. Landowners can forgo the AEF labor and management requirement if they receive income based on the farm's operating results. The 2018 farm bill defines a producer as meeting specific AEF criteria, including significant contribution to the farming operation and sharing profits or losses. Landowners who do not bear any risk or potential loss from the farming operation would not be eligible for farm program benefits. This includes landowners who rent farmland under fixed cash-rental arrangements or receive a guaranteed share of the crop independent of actual harvest results. In a joint operation, farm payments depend on qualifying members' ownership share and their active contribution to the farming operation. Each partner must meet AEF criteria individually, with identifiable and critical contributions to profitability. The partnership's payment limit is determined by the number of qualifying members, potentially expanding with each new member added. The partnership's total limit can be reduced by one individual payment limit for each member failing to meet AEF requirements. An exception exists for partnerships owning all farming land they use, where members are automatically deemed actively engaged in farming. Nonfamily joint venture members must log labor and management contributions to satisfy AEF criteria. In the case of a corporation with multiple owners, each member must make significant contributions of labor or management to be considered actively engaged in farming. Contributions must be regular, identifiable, and separate from others, with the collective contribution being significant. The corporation must also meet AEF criteria for profit sharing. The AEF criteria for profit sharing in a corporation with multiple owners require significant contributions of labor or management from each member. If any member fails to meet these requirements, program payments or benefits will be reduced proportionally to their ownership share. Exceptions apply if a majority of stockholders are actively engaged in farming and total farm program payments are below a certain limit. Additionally, a corporation owning all its farmland automatically meets AEF criteria. The USDA data for 2015 shows 95,417 qualifying institutional arrangements meeting AEF criteria for farm payments. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to define \"significant contribution of active personal management\" for nonfamily producers in legal entities to qualify for benefits. The USDA rule, published on December 16, 2015, specifies how legal entities comprised of nonfamily members may be eligible for payments based on active personal management contributions. It considers limits on the number of persons per farming operation and excludes operations solely of family members. Monitoring compliance reviews is also included in the plan. Based on 2012 evidence, nonfamily farm operations make up less than 9% of total farm operations. The USDA rule limits the number of farm managers, affecting around 1,400 partnerships and joint ventures, reducing USDA outlays by $50 million for crop years 2016-2018. Additional requirements now apply to nonfamily farming operations seeking multiple farm managers, including limits on nonfamily members qualifying as farm managers. The USDA rule limits nonfamily farm operations to one farm manager, with exceptions for two or three farm managers based on operation size and complexity. No more than three nonfamily members can qualify as farm managers. Nonfamily farming operations can have more than three persons qualify as farm managers if they maintain activity logs of their management activities. The contributions of each manager must be identifiable, documentable, and critical to the profitability of the operation. The new definition for a significant contribution of active personal management (for nonfamily members only) requires an annual contribution of 500 hours of management or at least 25% of the total management required for that operation. Eligible management activities must be performed under one or more of the management categories listed earlier in the report section entitled \"Active Personal Management.\" Passive management activities such as attendance at board meetings or on conference calls, or watching commodity markets or input markets (without making trades), are not considered as making a significant contribution of active personal management. The final rule expanded the measurable standard for a significant contribution in farming operations to include a combination of active personal labor and management. A minimum hourly requirement of 1,000 hours for labor and 500 hours for management was established. USDA published a table with five minimum thresholds of combined hours, ranging from 550 to 950 hours. This rule has been in place since 1987. Since the term \"actively engaged in farming\" was introduced and AEF criteria were required for farm program payments, U.S. legislators have aimed to limit payments to actual farmers. Concerns persist that some farm operations are structured to bypass payment limits and maximize payments. Advocacy groups argue that the USDA's new rule on AEF criteria does not sufficiently tighten eligibility requirements, allowing for multiple nonfamily farm managers to qualify for full payment limits. Critics raise concerns about the lack of specificity in the 2014 farm bill provision allowing exceptions for farm operation partners claiming AEF compliance. GAO identified hindrances to USDA oversight of AEF regulations for both family and nonfamily members of farming operations. The 2014 farm bill provision allows partners in farm operations to claim AEF compliance through active personal management, but there are concerns about the broad definition and subjective requirements for significant contributions. The lack of specificity hinders USDA oversight, allowing large farm operations to distribute management activities among partners to increase eligibility for payments without physical presence on the farm. The federal government risks distributing payments to individuals who may have little actual involvement in farming operations due to the broad definition and subjective requirements for significant contributions in farm operations. USDA has the authority to tighten eligibility criteria but is unlikely to do so without explicit direction from Congress. The current regulatory definition of a significant contribution of active personal management lacks specificity and a measurable standard. The current regulatory definition of a significant contribution of active personal management has been in effect for over 20 years. USDA data from 2015 showed that partnerships with more members relied heavily on active personal management criteria. Congress directed USDA to design new regulations for AEF criteria for nonfamily members without adding to the paperwork burden of family farm operations. Under the 2014 farm bill and 2015 USDA rule, a large nonfamily farming operation could have a payment limit over $1 million per year. Members of Congress may consider establishing an explicit limit on the number of farm managers allowed in a farming operation. Family-managed farm operations have no limit on potential qualifying members and overall payment limit. Under the 2014 farm bill and 2015 USDA rule, a restriction may be developed where only a single farm manager can qualify without providing farm labor. The subjective assessment of a \"significant contribution\" of managerial activity could impact the long-term viability of farming operations. This could potentially affect nonfamily farm operations as well. The 2015 USDA regulation imposes restrictions on nonfamily members of farming operations, while the 2014 farm bill exempts family members from new restrictions. Family members are considered actively engaged in farming if they receive income based on the farm's results. Congress is likely interested in monitoring USDA's efforts to impose payment disciplines on nonfamily participants without burdening family farms. Large farm operations may be able to avoid eligibility requirements. Large farm operations may be able to avoid eligibility and payment requirements, which Congress is interested in monitoring."
