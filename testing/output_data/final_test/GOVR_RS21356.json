    "content": "Unemployment benefits, including various types like UC, EB, TAA, DUA, and railroad benefits, are subject to federal income tax since 1987. These benefits are treated similarly to wages for tax purposes but are not subject to employment taxes like Social Security and Medicare. Most states also tax unemployment benefits, and this practice is common in other industrial nations as well. Industrial nations tax unemployment benefits. State UC agencies must offer federal income tax withholding to UC beneficiaries. Beneficiaries can elect to have 10% of their gross UC benefits payment withheld for federal income tax. While federal law does not require state income tax withholding, some states offer this service. Beneficiaries can choose to pay quarterly estimated taxes if state withholding is not available. The number of tax returns reporting unemployment benefits as income increased from 2001 to 2003. The increase in tax returns reporting unemployment benefits as income from 2001 to 2003 was due to the 2001 economic recession and policy responses like the Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. The recession starting in 2007 led to a significant rise in tax returns claiming unemployment benefits as income in 2009, with additional benefits provided through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 excluded the first $2,400 from income taxes for that year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 excluded the first $2,400 from income taxes, leading to fewer persons reporting unemployment insurance income. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of unemployment benefits reported as income for tax purposes in 2009. In 2010, there was a significant increase in the number of taxpayers reporting UC income, attributed to the increase in potential weeks of EUC08 benefits and the termination of the income tax exclusion. The number of unemployed persons began to decrease in 2011, triggering a decrease in the number of weeks available for some extended benefits. In 2011, a decrease in the number of weeks available for extended unemployment benefits triggered a reduction in the number of persons receiving benefits. This led to a decrease in the number of returns reporting unemployment benefits and the reported amount. By 2013, the number of returns containing UC income had decreased to 9.3 million, the lowest level since 2007. Unemployment benefits are not considered earned income for tax purposes, impacting the earned income tax credit eligibility. Before 1979, unemployment compensation (UC) benefits were not subject to federal income tax. The Revenue Act of 1978 made UC benefits partially taxable for those with an adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding $20,000 for single filers or $25,000 for joint filers. Taxation was applied to the lesser of UC benefits or one-half of AGI. Families with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 received $7.3 billion in UC benefits and paid $1.2 billion in taxes on those benefits. In the 1970s, UC benefits were partially taxed for those with AGI exceeding certain thresholds. The taxation aimed to reduce the work disincentive effect by lowering after-tax wage replacement. Lower-income claimants were not taxed due to their income being under the threshold. In 1982, Congress lowered the AGI thresholds for taxation of UC benefits to $12,000 for single filers and $18,000 for joint filers under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 made UC benefits fully taxable, reversing the previous policy of taxing benefits only above an AGI threshold. This change aimed to treat UC benefits the same as wages and eliminate the work disincentive. Concerns about cash flow problems for claimants arose during the 1990-1991 recession, leading to the requirement for states to inform new claimants about tax withholding. During the 1990-1991 recession, UC benefits became fully taxable under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. P.L. 102-318 mandated states to inform new claimants about their tax responsibilities. Subsequent legislation required federal income tax withholding from UC benefits, with rates changing over time. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided a temporary exclusion on the first $2,400 of UC benefits for federal income tax purposes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided a temporary exclusion on the first $2,400 of UC benefits for federal income tax purposes, reducing federal receipts by approximately $4.7 billion for the 2009 tax year. No relevant legislation in the current Congress has been introduced regarding this exclusion."
