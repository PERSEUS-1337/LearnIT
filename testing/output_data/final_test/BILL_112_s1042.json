    "content": "The \"Medicare Patient Empowerment Act\" guarantees freedom of choice and contracting for patients under Section 1802 of the Social Security Act. Section 1802 of the Social Security Act ensures that Medicare beneficiaries have the freedom to choose any qualified provider for health services and to enter into contracts with participating or non-participating physicians for covered items or services. Medicare beneficiaries can submit claims for payment under this title when they enter into such contracts. Payment under this title for items or services provided under a contract does not affect the physician's participating or non-participating status. Requirements that apply to participating or non-participating physicians do not apply to items or services furnished under the contract unless the contract is in writing and signed. The contract must be in writing, signed by the Medicare beneficiary and physician, establish all terms including payment, and protect the beneficiary from excess charges. The contract for providing items and services to a Medicare beneficiary must clearly state the beneficiary's responsibility for payment and submitting claims under the contract. The contract must state the beneficiary's responsibility for submitting claims to the Secretary and any supplemental insurance plan for covered items or services, without limits or payment incentives under Medicare applying. The contract for Medicare beneficiaries must clearly indicate if the physician is excluded from the program. Beneficiaries can negotiate to have the physician file claims on their behalf for items or services. The contract for Medicare beneficiaries must specify if the physician is excluded. Beneficiaries can assign payment to the physician for claims filed with the Secretary and supplemental insurance plans for covered items or services. Dual eligible individuals are excluded from this provision. Section 1848(g) limitations on charges and claim submission do not apply. The contract for Medicare beneficiaries must specify if the physician is excluded. Beneficiaries can assign payment to the physician for claims filed with the Secretary and supplemental insurance plans for covered items or services. Dual eligible individuals are excluded from this provision. Section 1848(g) limitations on charges and claim submission do not apply. Section 1848(g) shall not apply with respect to any item or service provided to a Medicare beneficiary under a contract described in paragraph (1). Nothing in this section prohibits physicians from maintaining an election and acting as participating or non-participating physicians with respect to patients not covered under a contract established under this section. Definitions include 'Medicare beneficiary' as an individual entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B, and 'physician' as defined in section 1861(r). The term 'practitioner' refers to a practitioner as described in section 1842(b)(18)(C). An 'emergency medical condition' is a medical condition with acute symptoms severe enough that a layperson would expect serious health jeopardy or impairment without immediate medical attention. The term 'urgent health care situation' refers to services needed within 12 hours to prevent the likely onset of an emergency medical condition. No State can limit charges for physician and practitioner services under section 1848 of the Social Security Act, preempting any such limits. The term \"State\" includes various regions like the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico."
