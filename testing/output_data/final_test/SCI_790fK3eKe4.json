    "content": "Our research on user perception of data breaches found that many individuals feel personally responsible due to weak understanding of the issues. By comparing organizational communication strategies with news media, we discovered that organizations use crisis communication methods to minimize reputational damage. A quantitative study confirmed that organizational texts influence users' perception of victimization. A data breach is a successful malicious attack leading to the compromise or loss of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stored in organization databases. The potential consequences can be significant, including identity theft through fraudulent use of accounts like credit cards and online accounts. Despite increased awareness and emphasis on security mechanisms, many organizations still lack sufficient security practices, leading to data breaches and misuse of data. Recent incidents, such as the Equifax breach, highlight the risks of inadequate security measures. Data breaches, like the one at Equifax, have exposed a large number of consumer records. Despite this, consumers often continue doing business with companies after breaches, leading to a sense of complacency. Companies face significant financial and reputational damage from data breaches, prompting them to try to minimize the impact. Companies facing financial loss and reputational damage from data breaches use communication strategies to reduce the impact. Crisis response strategies aim to shift the level of responsibility, such as framing themselves as victims to minimize blame. Understanding data breach incidents is crucial for developing mental models to support reasoning about behavior and accountability. The research explores how breached companies and news media communicate with users, and how this affects users' perception of data breach incidents. Image Repair Theory and narrative-semiotics methods are applied to analyze Equifax crisis communications. The study analyzed Equifax crisis communications using Image Repair Theory and narrative-semiotics method. It involved a communication study with 58 stories on the security breach crisis and a questionnaire study with 100 participants. The research highlighted the influence of companies' notifications and news on the public's perception of data breaches, emphasizing the need for improved software design and careful attention to communication strategies during and after a breach. Data breaches are a severe threat to organizations and consumers, becoming increasingly common. When a breach occurs, legal authorities must be informed, and affected consumers notified. Communication strategies during crises are crucial, with Image Repair Theory (IRT) and narrative semiotics being effective methods. IRT helps in designing and evaluating crisis messages by understanding the nature of attacks. Image repair strategies, according to Benoit, include denial, evasion of responsibility, reducing offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification. Denial involves rejecting responsibility, while evasion of responsibility includes sub-strategies like provocation, defeasibility, accident, and good intention. Reducing offensiveness includes bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, and attacking the accuser. The narrative-semiotic method analyzes storytelling patterns to understand conflicts and changes during a crisis. Media and organizations use different features to frame crises, and narrative semiotics can help differentiate these framings. This method is valuable for understanding data breach situations and motivations. The narrative-semiotic approach is valuable for understanding data breach situations and motivations. It can help researchers study organizational failures and assess decision-making. The approach involves analyzing storytelling patterns, including the narrative trajectory and narrative schema with the actantial model. The narrative-semiotic approach is used to identify agents, their actions, and discourses in different texts. Narrators play a crucial role in interpreting actions and highlighting interaction patterns. Comparing narrative structures of texts can reveal how companies narrate crises like data breaches. The study analyzes how companies narrate crises like data breaches, focusing on the Equifax data breach in 2017. Communication strategies and changing the role of agents in the story can influence readers' perception of the reality and the company's role in the breach. Equifax's data breach in 2017 highlighted the importance of data security and the company's responsibility. A comprehensive analysis of the causes was conducted, focusing on the period from September 2017 to March 2019. The study used Image Repair Theory to examine the language and discourse patterns in the company's communication regarding the breach. In the context of a data breach, companies can be blamed for actions that harm consumers or neglect like poor security practices. Perception of responsibility is crucial, and businesses use strategies like shifting blame, defensibility, and corrective actions to manage it. NVivo12 was used for qualitative analysis to code data on image repair strategies. The study utilized the narrative-semiotic method of analysis to examine how agents' positioning changes with different narrators. The actantial model was applied to analyze documents, categorizing roles into sender, subject, object, receiver, helper, and opponent. IRT and Narrative-semiotics were used to explore Equifax's story, with one researcher coding and two others reviewing the results. The Equifax story was divided into narrative episodes to analyze major events and actions. Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency, experienced a cybersecurity incident in September 2017, affecting 143 million U.S. consumers. Hackers exploited a website vulnerability to access personal information such as names, Social Security numbers, and addresses. The Equifax data breach in September 2017 compromised personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers, including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and credit card numbers. Hackers accessed the online dispute portal and extracted PII using encrypted web protocols. Limited personal information of UK and Canadian residents was also compromised. The Equifax data breach involved exfiltrating data using encrypted web protocols over 76 days before being detected. A misconfiguration with an expired digital certificate allowed the intrusion to go unnoticed. The attack exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework. Equifax responded to the data breach by taking their website offline, identifying stolen data, and determining the number of affected individuals. They addressed the vulnerability that allowed attackers access to their databases and set up a website for individuals to check if their information was exposed. Equifax offered free services to all U.S. consumers for one year, regardless of whether their information was compromised. Equifax notified U.S. state attorneys general about the data breach affecting 2.4 million consumers. The GAO report criticized Equifax for failing to protect personal data and highlighted the need for legislation to safeguard consumer information. Legislation is needed to protect consumers from data breaches, such as Senator Warren's and Senator Mark Warner's bill holding Equifax accountable for a breach. Equifax would have faced $1.5 billion in penalties. The company used image repair strategies to downplay the breach, blaming IT staff and technology failures. Other strategies included bolstering, compensation, and corrective actions. The CEO of Equifax implemented corrective actions to reduce the offensiveness of the data breach and apologized to victims. The Narrative-Semiotic approach was used to analyze the roles of agents in the sequence of actions. The initial document for analysis was the prepared testimony of Richard F. Smith before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection. The narrative story began with the CEO discussing the company's history and services offered. Equifax, founded 118 years ago, is a major source of consumer and commercial information globally, aiding financial decisions. Under CEO Richard F. Smith, the company expanded and focused on data security and privacy. Notably, efforts were made to provide credit access to unbanked Americans. Equifax took data security and privacy seriously, enhancing vulnerability scanning and patch management processes. The company is committed to preventing future breaches and apologizes for the harm caused to consumers. Equifax, as a helper to consumers wanting to make financial decisions, faced a complication when attackers targeted their consumer dispute website. The security department detected and blocked suspicious network traffic, ultimately taking the website offline to prevent further activity. The company remains committed to enhancing data security and preventing future breaches. The web application was offline due to a criminal hack, with the company beginning the investigation to determine the impact. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts and Equifax's security tools failed to detect the illegal access. The security department took actions to block suspicious traffic and monitor the network. The company's CEO emphasized corrective actions to hinder the attacker. Equifax had 5 days to patch the vulnerability before attackers accessed sensitive information. The attackers accessed sensitive information after exploiting a vulnerability in Apache Struts. CERT notification aided the attacker. Equifax's CEO admitted failure to protect consumer data and described actions taken. Investigation ongoing to determine the cause of the breach. The Equifax breach occurred due to human error and technology failures, allowing criminals to access data of over 140 million Americans. Equifax worked with experts to understand the breach and developed a package of remedial protections for all consumers, including credit file monitoring and access to Equifax credit files. Equifax offered consumers monitoring of credit files, access to Equifax credit files, the ability to lock the credit file, insurance for identity theft costs, and dark web scans for social security numbers. Equifax played multiple roles in addressing the breach, acting as a sender, receiver, and helper. The actantial model shows Equifax as the helper to customers in achieving their goals. Equifax played multiple roles in addressing the breach, acting as a sender, receiver, and helper. Equifax is a helper to achieve the goal of solving the data breach incident, with human error, computer failure, and attackers as opponents. Attackers want to access personal information, with human error and computer failure as helpers, and Equifax protection as an opponent. The narrative components revealed common mini-narratives focusing on the attack and response stages. In the first narrative episode, the attacker aims to access information. Equifax's failure to patch an expired certificate led to malicious activity being undetected, with no restrictions on the database. The opponent category includes locking down the system and hiring a security team. In a second narrative, Equifax aims to solve the incident with log files and new regulations as helpers. Data security failures and lack of prompt action on flaws are opponents in this scenario. Equifax executives failed to notify data breach victims promptly, keeping the public in the dark for over a month. The attack went undetected for 76 days, revealing a lack of cybersecurity investment by Equifax. Congressman Frank Pallone criticized Equifax for its ongoing lax attitude towards data protection. Equifax's inadequate response to a data breach in 2017, affecting up to 143 million Americans, was criticized by Congressman Frank Pallone. The breach, which occurred in mid-May, was not disclosed until early September, giving attackers two months to exploit a vulnerability in Apache Struts. Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed frustration over Equifax's lack of transparency regarding the extent of the breach. Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed frustration over Equifax's inadequate response to the 2017 data breach, criticizing the lack of transparency in disclosing the breach's extent. Key issues included inadequate assistance for victims, top executives betraying stakeholders, an overwhelmed call center, and a poorly constructed customer response site. Examples of evidence highlighted company responsibility, insider trading, arbitration clauses, and failure to protect consumers from identity theft. The analysis shows differences in how organizations and others described data breach incidents, potentially influencing users' understanding and organizational accountability. More details on participants' demographics and consumer complaints will be discussed later. The study conducted a questionnaire to explore how data breach descriptions influence users' understanding and organizational accountability. 100 participants from the US and Canada read descriptions of data breaches and responded to follow-up statements. The study was reviewed by a Research Ethics Board. Participants in the study were shown pairs of extracts about the Equifax data breach from different sources. They then responded to statements using a Likert scale to gauge their perceptions. Responses were analyzed to see if they differed based on the source of the text. Participants in the study responded to statements about the Equifax data breach from different sources using a Likert scale. Results were analyzed by calculating the median and spread of the data distribution, and Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare responses based on the source of the text. Participants strongly agreed that customers of the company are the victims, but responses differed when asked if the company itself is the victim of the data breach. Participants in the study responded to statements about the Equifax data breach from different sources using a Likert scale. Results showed that participants agreed that customers were victims, but opinions varied on whether the company itself was also a victim. The data distribution was skewed towards neither agreeing nor disagreeing. There was a noticeable difference in attitudes towards data protection between those who read the company's description and those who read the news. The company's attitude was perceived differently, with some believing they took security seriously while others thought they had a relaxed approach. Participants in the study agreed that the company was helping customers recover from the breach but somewhat neglected data protection. Those reading the news strongly believed the company put customers at risk and disagreed with its helpfulness post-breach. Most participants felt the company was accountable for the breach issues, while customers were not seen as responsible. The study compared responses to data breach descriptions from the company and news sources. Results showed significant differences in participants' perceptions of victimization, security measures, data protection attitude, and helpfulness in after-breach actions. Participants believed the company was helping customers recover from the breach, but neglected data protection. The study compared participants' responses to data breach descriptions from company and news sources. Results indicated that the order and pair of texts did not affect responses, except for statements regarding victimization and helpfulness of after-breach actions. Non-parametric tests and a multi-way ANOVA confirmed these findings. Half of the participants received text about a data breach from a company, while the other half received text from a news source, and their responses to 10 statements about the breach were analyzed. Participants' responses to data breach descriptions from company and news sources were compared. Differences were observed in how participants perceived victimhood and intent to harm, with some statements showing little difference in responses. The study found that the source of the text influenced participants' perceptions, particularly in terms of victimization and accountability of the company. The study compared participants' responses to data breach descriptions from company and news sources. Differences were noted in perceptions of victimhood and intent to harm, with varying views on accountability for the breach. The company was seen as having some level of accountability, while customers were not considered accountable. The issue of accountability was deemed subtle, with attackers playing a key role and the company having a duty of care. The study analyzed how organization communications about data breaches could impact user perception. Using Image Repair Theory, Equifax's press releases were found to employ tactics to reduce reputational damage. Narrative semiotics techniques were used to compare the framing of crisis in news media and company press releases. The comparison revealed differences in how agents were positioned in the narratives. The comparison of Equifax's press releases with news and GAO reports showed differences in how the company was portrayed. The press releases emphasized Equifax as a helper taking protective actions, while news and GAO reports portrayed Equifax as an opponent with weak security protection. The media criticized Equifax's crisis response strategy, including scapegoating and lax attitude towards the incident. The company positioned itself as a receiver of blame, deflecting responsibility. Equifax positioned itself as a victim to reduce responsibility for the incident, using strategies like scapegoating and compensation. The media portrayed Equifax as an opponent with weak security, criticizing their crisis response strategy. Participants' perceptions of a data breach incident differed depending on whether they read the company's press release or news reports. Those who read the company's version rated their actions and security measures more positively, while those who read the news texts were critical of the company's response. This confirmed the impact of different sources on perception and highlighted the effectiveness of IRT in crisis situations. Our text analysis confirms the effectiveness of Image Repair Theory (IRT) in crisis communication. Companies tend to present themselves positively compared to news media, using strategies that influence readers' understanding. Organizations' communication strategies may contribute to users' weak mental models, suggesting a need for improved software design to enhance data tracking abilities. Improving software design to allow users to track data access in detail, determine provenance, and legitimacy, with alarms for sensitive data. This would enable user oversight, facilitate reporting discrepancies to organizations, and promote increased diligence. Organizations could enhance protective measures, assure users, and emphasize diligence. Future research could study the effects of these measures, which may require changes in software architecture. Crisis communications' impact on user perception of accountability should be considered. Communications professionals and legal scholars should consider the impact of crisis communications on user perception of accountability. Limitations include focusing on one case study and potential differences in participant perception due to questionnaire wording. The study analyzed Equifax's crisis communication strategies during a data breach, finding that the company used these strategies to manage its reputation. The study analyzed Equifax's crisis communication strategies during a data breach, finding differences in reporting between press releases, major newspapers, and technical news. Narrative changes in news reports affected reader perception of the data breaches. Questionnaire study showed that different perspectives from companies and news outlets influenced the public's perception of data breach incidents. Large scale data breaches are a serious matter for organizations and users alike. Users may not fully understand the implications of data breaches, leading to confusion about accountability and next steps. Organizations' communication about breaches may be misleading, affecting perceptions of the crisis and responsibility. Software handling sensitive data should help users stay informed about breaches."
