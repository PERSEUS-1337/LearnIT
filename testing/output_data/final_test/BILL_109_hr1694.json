    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Revitalizing Cities Through Parks Enhancement Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that urban infrastructure lacks open spaces and community parks, especially in inner-city areas with vacant lots due to tax foreclosures. The recent economic recession has increased the number of vacant lots, leading to drug trafficking, decreased property value, and higher crime rates. Refurbishing these lots into well-maintained open spaces and parks would create positive assets for the community. Establishing community parks would create positive assets for surrounding communities, provide outlets for youth, increase property values, attract other investments, and enhance residents' quality of life. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development can make grants to qualified community organizations for creating urban open spaces. Grants to a single organization in a fiscal year cannot exceed $250,000. Qualified community organizations are defined under the Act. Qualified community organizations eligible for grants under this Act must have significant activities related to improving the neighborhood, a history of serving the community, maintain accountability to residents, and comply with financial standards set by the Secretary. Eligible activities for grants under this Act include developing municipal real property for community open space, leasing or obtaining property for open space, maintaining open space, and covering administrative costs related to its establishment and management. Grants under this Act must allocate less than 10 percent for costs, require a development plan approved by the Secretary, and involve community organizations in the planning process. The development plan must be made available for examination and comments, and public hearings must be held to gather views from interested parties. Qualified community organizations may carry out activities under the plan if they are recipients. SEC. 6. ELIGIBLE MUNICIPAL REAL PROPERTY.\n\nGrant funds can be used for establishing community open space on urban property owned by the local government, free of structures, and committed for at least 7 years for community use.\n\nSEC. 7. APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN. The Secretary will allow nonprofit organizations to apply for grants under this Act by submitting detailed development plans for the use of grant funds, including establishing community open space on eligible municipal property. The application must also demonstrate ownership of the property and the organization's qualifications. The nonprofit organization applying for grants must provide a detailed plan for developing community open space on eligible municipal property, including demonstrating ownership, qualifications, activities to be conducted with grant funds, commitments for assistance, need for open space, maintenance plans, and community participation. The nonprofit organization applying for grants must provide a detailed plan for developing, maintaining, and managing community open space on eligible municipal property, including a budget and any other information deemed necessary by the Secretary. SEC. 8. SELECTION AND GRANT AGREEMENTS. The Secretary will select community organizations for grants based on feasible development plans and community involvement in managing open spaces. Selection criteria include community involvement and the need for open space in the neighborhood. The Secretary will enter into agreements with qualified community organizations to ensure grant funds are used for approved development plans and community open space management. The Secretary will review and approve or disapprove amendments to development plans submitted by recipients. Recipients may be required to submit reports to ensure compliance with the development plan and grant agreements. The Secretary will also provide annual reports to Congress on grants, recipients, and community open spaces funded. The Act defines \"community open space\" as publicly accessible recreational land, \"nonprofit organization\" as a private entity with earnings not benefiting individuals, and \"qualified community organization\" as a nonprofit meeting specific criteria. The Act defines terms such as \"recipient\" as a qualified community organization eligible for a grant, \"urban area\" as a city within a metropolitan statistical area, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and \"unit of general local government\" as any city, town, or township. The term \"general local government\" refers to various political subdivisions of a State, including cities, towns, counties, and villages. The term \"State\" encompasses the States of the United States, along with other territories and possessions. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement the Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal years 2006 and 2007."
