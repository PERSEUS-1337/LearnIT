    "content": "The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) are federal statutes that evolved from Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Both aim to balance government information gathering for national security with individual privacy. ECPA focuses on protecting privacy from individuals, while FISA allows collection of information on foreign powers and their agents, regardless of criminal activity. The common law prohibition against eavesdropping evolved with the invention of the telegraph and telephone, leading to state laws outlawing wiretapping. Congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute during World War I to prevent disclosure of government secrets. Later laws further prohibited intercepting private radio messages. The Supreme Court decision in Olmstead involved a federal wiretap prohibition challenge by a bootlegger convicted under the Prohibition Act. Despite arguments based on Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, the Court ruled against him, stating that there was no official search or seizure involved. Chief Justice Taft pointed out that Congress expanded the Radio Act's proscription against intercepting and divulging radio communications in the 1934 Communications Act. The Federal Communications Act outlawed wiretapping but did not address surreptitious recording of face-to-face conversations. As a result, cases involving surreptitious recording surged, eroding the principles of the Olmstead case. Initially, the Court applied Olmstead's principles to electronic eavesdropping cases. The Court applied Olmstead's principles to electronic eavesdropping cases, determining that no physical trespass meant no Fourth Amendment violation. However, physical intrusion onto private property, such as using a \"spike mike\" to record conversations, did constitute a Fourth Amendment breach. The Court found that the government's use of a \"spike mike\" to record conversations constituted a Fourth Amendment violation, as it intruded upon the privacy of the home. This expanded interpretation of the Fourth Amendment focused on warrantless trespass onto private property, emphasizing the protection of intangible items like conversations. The Fourth Amendment protects against overhearing verbal statements and traditional seizure of papers and effects. In Katz v. United States, the Court ruled that privacy should be respected where individuals have a reasonable expectation of it, even in public spaces like telephone booths. This extends the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to electronic eavesdropping. The Fourth Amendment extends its warrant requirement to electronic eavesdropping, protecting against overhearing verbal statements. Some states established statutory systems for law enforcement to obtain warrants for wiretapping. The Court found deficiencies in one state's statute in Berger v. New York, such as the lack of specific descriptions, limitations on searches, and prompt execution of orders. Berger helped persuade Congress to enact Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, a wiretapping statute with strict limitations. Congress later added a judicially supervised procedure for wiretapping in foreign intelligence gathering. There was debate over the President's inherent powers to authorize wiretaps without judicial approval in national security cases. After the Court ruled against warrantless electronic eavesdropping on domestic threats, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Security Act of 1978 (FISA) to enhance foreign intelligence gathering. FISA allows judicial review and authorization of surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Another Supreme Court case, United States v. Miller, determined that customers have no privacy expectation in bank records, making them accessible to the government. The government can access third party records with a subpoena duces tecum instead of a warrant. In Smith v. Maryland, no warrant was needed for using a pen register or trap and trace device to identify telephone numbers. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was enacted in 1986, consisting of Title III, the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and provisions for pen registers and trap and trace devices. Congress has made adjustments to ECPA and FISA over the years. Congress has adjusted the components of ECPA and FISA over the years, with enactments such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008. ECPA prohibits wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping without authorization. The ban on illegal wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping prohibits any person from intercepting wire, oral, or electronic communications without authorization, except in specific authorized circumstances. This includes interceptions with consent, law enforcement or intelligence gathering interceptions, communication services, radio broadcasts, and spousal wiretapping. Title III prohibits unauthorized interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications. It applies to various entities and individuals, requiring intentional conduct for a violation. Two interception bars are outlined in subsection 2511(1), with specific jurisdictional circumstances. Congress adopted this approach due to concerns about constitutional authority in banning electronic surveillance. The Justice Department enforces Title III, which prohibits unauthorized interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications. It includes specific jurisdictional factors to address concerns about constitutional authority in banning electronic surveillance. Interception is defined as the acquisition of communication contents through electronic or other devices, with cases showing it can occur where the communication begins, is transmitted, or is received. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) expanded the definition of \"interception\" to include not just aural acquisitions but also other forms of acquiring communication. This expansion complicates determining which part of the ECPA governs the legality of capturing communication information. There is a lack of consensus on when an interception occurs, particularly regarding whether it involves surreptitious acquisition. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the legality of intercepting voice mail by removing it from wiretap coverage under Title III. Interceptions under Title III are limited to capturing the content of a communication, not just information about its source and recipient. Contemporary telephone communications now transmit both non-content and content, requiring authorities to use a Title III wiretap order instead of a pen register/trap and trace order. The statute excludes common law \"eavesdropping\" and defines interception as using electronic or mechanical devices, including computers but not hearing aids or extension telephones in normal use. The use of extension phones in the ordinary course of business or law enforcement duties can complicate whether they are considered interception devices under Title III and state laws. The exemption requires legitimate business reasons, routine monitoring, and employee notification. Law enforcement officials have an exception for recording phone lines as part of their routine activities. Title III exempts law enforcement institutions from the statute, allowing for administrative monitoring with a valid law enforcement concern. Interception is only a violation if it involves protected forms of communication like telephone, face-to-face, or electronic communication. Silent video surveillance is covered, but not all wire, oral, or electronic communications. \"Oral communications\" include face-to-face conversations with an expectation of privacy, while \"wire communications\" involve voice transfers. \"Electronic communications\" encompass radio and data. The term \"electronic communications\" includes radio and data transmissions, but excludes certain radio transmissions easily captured. Title III exempts law enforcement from the statute, allowing administrative monitoring. Consent interceptions have a controversial history, upheld by the Supreme Court against Fourth Amendment challenges. Consent interceptions, allowed under federal law with the consent of at least one party, are not unlawful. State laws may have different requirements, with some states requiring consent from all parties. Federal law allows for explicit or implicit consent. Interception with the consent of at least one party is allowed under federal law, but some state laws may require consent from all parties. Consent must be freely given and not coerced, and interceptions cannot be conducted for criminal or tortious purposes. Interceptions with consent are allowed under federal law, but some state laws may require consent from all parties. The interception must be freely given and not coerced, and cannot be conducted for criminal or tortious purposes. The means of interception may have been criminal or tortious, but the limitation no longer includes injurious purposes to protect First Amendment values. Certain radio communications are exempt, including those intended for public hearing and interceptions necessary to identify the source of disruptive transmissions. Government officials have exemptions when executing eavesdropping orders or acting in emergency situations. Interceptions with consent are allowed under federal law, with exemptions for emergency situations, Title III communications, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices. Service providers like telephone companies are also exempt for improved service, fraud prevention, assisting officials with court orders, and FCC regulatory activities. Some courts recognize a \"vicarious consent\" exception for custodial parents recording minor children's conversations. Title III allows custodial parents to secretly record conversations of their minor children for protection. Some federal courts permit one spouse to wiretap the other under certain circumstances. Title III prohibits disclosing unlawfully intercepted communications. Title III allows for the secret recording of conversations involving minor children for protection. It prohibits the disclosure of unlawfully intercepted communications, with exceptions for matters of public concern. Authorized electronic eavesdropping results can be used for law enforcement and testimonial purposes. Title III prohibits the disclosure of intercepted communications obtained through authorized means, such as police wiretapping or electronic surveillance. It is a federal crime to disclose this information with the intent to obstruct criminal justice. Individuals who disclose information obtained through interception of communications in connection with a criminal investigation, with the intent to obstruct justice, face criminal and civil liability similar to those who illegally wiretap. This prohibition applies to both federal and state wiretaps authorized under Section 2516. Section 2516 allows state wiretapping when authorized by state law. Congress may have intended to make it a federal crime to obstruct state criminal prosecutions by disclosing information from a state wiretap. A disclosure prohibition applies to electronic communications service providers who intentionally reveal communication contents during transmission to unauthorized parties, with exemptions for consent, court-approved interceptions, transmission needs, and inadvertent crime-related information discovery. Violators could face criminal liability under general laws. The curr_chunk discusses the sanctions and liabilities for individuals who use information obtained through illegal wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping. The use prohibition mirrors the disclosure prohibition, with violators facing criminal and civil liability. Case law on the use prohibition is limited, and it is rarely invoked independently of the disclosure prohibition. The wording of the two prohibitions is parallel, and the legislative history describes their intent. The curr_chunk discusses the criminal and civil liability for unlawful use of intercepted communications, which is similar to the liability for unlawful disclosure. Possession and trafficking of wiretapping and eavesdropping devices have stricter proscriptions. There are exemptions for service providers and government officials, but not for others. The curr_chunk discusses the prohibitions under Section 2512 regarding the intentional use or possession of devices primarily designed for surreptitious interception of communications. There are exemptions for government officials and service providers, but not for private individuals. Inoperable equipment may not be considered as intercepting devices for conviction under this section. The curr_chunk discusses the prohibition of advertising devices primarily designed for surreptitious interception of communications. It includes electronic, mechanical, or other devices that promote such interception. The prohibition of advertising devices designed for surreptitious interception of communications includes penalties of up to five years in prison and fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Congress considered various items like martini olive transmitters and disguised microphones. The legality of equipment for unauthorized reception of scrambled satellite TV signals under \u00a72512 has been clarified, with possession not leading to a private cause of action. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits the possession of devices for intercepting communications, but simple possession alone does not create a private cause of action. ECPA's prohibitions give way to government access, typically with judicial oversight. Title III exempts law enforcement from interception prohibitions in certain circumstances, such as court orders, party consent, and intruder communications. Approval from a senior Justice Department official is required for a Title III interception order in federal criminal investigations. The court order authorizes interception of wire or oral communications based on probable cause for federal crimes. Any federal prosecutor can approve an application for interception of electronic communications for any federal felony. At the state level, the principal prosecuting attorney can approve wiretapping for felony evidence. Court orders for wiretapping and electronic surveillance must meet federal requirements and be based on probable cause for felonies such as murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, drug trafficking, or other dangerous crimes. Applications must include details of the crime, location of interception, communications to be intercepted, and alternative investigative techniques used. The court must find probable cause for authorizing interception, including details of the crime, communication to be seized, history of previous interception efforts, and any additional information required by the judge. The interception order must include details such as the identity of persons involved, location of facilities, type of communication to be intercepted, and the duration of the interception. The interception order must include details such as the identity of persons involved, location of facilities, type of communication to be intercepted, and the duration of the interception. The order shall be executed promptly to minimize innocent communication seized, with cooperation from communications providers. In emergency cases, approval from senior Justice Department officials may postpone compliance briefly. Court orders are valid for up to 30 days, with possible 30-day extensions granted. Progress reports may be required during this time. Title III allows for the interception of communications with court-issued orders, requiring progress reports and evidence to be secured. Intercepted individuals must be notified within 90 days of the order's expiration. Information obtained can be disclosed to law enforcement officials, federal intelligence officers, and other government entities for official purposes. Title III permits the interception of communications involving foreign intelligence information and threats from foreign powers or terrorists. Witnesses can disclose results of a Title III tap in court, as long as the communication is not privileged. Authorities can intercept communications with the consent of one party, either explicitly or implicitly. Subscriber consent to recording conversations on a phone is considered implicit consent to interception. The paragraph discusses the importance of freely given consent for interception of electronic communications, particularly in cases involving computer trespassers. Violating Title III can result in imprisonment and fines. The Homeland Security Act imposes penalties for unlawful interception of electronic communications, including cell phone and cordless phone conversations. There are reduced penalties for unauthorized interceptions of satellite communications if not done for criminal purposes. Equipment used for wiretapping in violation of Title III can be confiscated by the United States. Title III of the Homeland Security Act provides defenses to criminal liability based on good faith and allows victims of violations to seek equitable relief, damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Federal courts have varying opinions on awarding damages and fees, but generally hold that governmental entities can be liable for violations. Law enforcement officers have qualified immunity under Section 2520, and the cause of action is subject to a good faith defense. The 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act limits non-governmental individuals from claiming defense, while the USA PATRIOT Act allows for a cause of action against the United States for willful violations. Successful plaintiffs can receive $10,000 or actual damages, along with litigation costs. Upon a finding of a Title III violation, federal officers or employees may face consequences. The American Bar Association (ABA) once considered it unethical for attorneys to intercept or record conversations without consent. State regulatory authorities had mixed reactions, some agreeing with the ABA and others expanding the circumstances for ethical recording. The ABA has since changed its position, and attorneys engaging in unlawful wiretapping remain subject to professional discipline in all jurisdictions. Attorneys engaging in unlawful wiretapping are subject to professional discipline in all jurisdictions. Courts and bar associations have varied reactions to lawful wiretapping, with the federal wiretap statute prohibiting disclosure of information obtained. Individuals can claim benefits of the exclusionary rule through a motion to suppress if the evidence is the product of an unlawful interception or other specified circumstances. The admissibility of intercepted conversations raises questions, with some courts allowing the use of unlawfully obtained evidence for impeachment purposes. Privately recorded conversations are less likely to be admissible compared to those recorded by government officials. The admissibility of intercepted conversations requires showing accuracy, authenticity, and trustworthiness. Courts may demand proof of the recording device's capability, operator competence, authenticity, preservation, speaker identification, and voluntary conversation. Title III was originally inadequate in protecting privacy for modern communications vulnerable to intrusion. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications at rest, extending beyond interception laws. It criminalizes unauthorized access to electronic communication services, providing limited protection similar to telephone conversations. The SCA includes general and specific prohibitions, making it a federal offense to access electronic communication facilities without authorization. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications in storage, including obtaining, altering, or preventing access to electronic communications while in storage. The offense requires intentional violations and involves access to a communication facility, consequences such as obtaining or altering electronic communications, and denial of access to them. Courts have no difficulty determining if a defendant's actions constitute a violation of the Act. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications in storage, including obtaining, altering, or preventing access. Courts have debated cases where access was granted but used for unauthorized purposes. The Act protects communications in electronic storage, including temporary and backup storage. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications in storage, including temporary and backup storage. Section 2701's prohibitions have exceptions and defenses, such as conduct authorized by service providers or users, and good faith reliance on court orders or statutory authorizations. The Stored Communications Act provides exceptions and defenses for unauthorized access to electronic communications in storage, including authorized conduct by service providers or users, good faith reliance on court orders or statutory authorizations, and general immunity from civil liability for providers under certain circumstances. The Stored Communications Act prohibits disclosure of electronic communication content and records by service providers, requiring them to keep such information confidential. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and records, requiring them to maintain confidentiality. Section 2702 outlines exceptions for disclosure of communication contents to intended recipients or their agents. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and records, requiring confidentiality. Exceptions include disclosure to intended recipients or their agents, with lawful consent, for service rendition, or to protect provider rights or property. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and records, except in specific circumstances such as reporting to authorities in cases of child abuse, law enforcement agencies for crime investigations, or government entities in emergencies involving danger. The Ninth Circuit in Quon highlighted exceptions that allow providers to disclose protected communications with lawful consent. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and records, except in specific circumstances such as reporting to authorities in cases of child abuse, law enforcement agencies for crime investigations, or government entities in emergencies involving danger. The service provider violated the Act by supplying the Ontario Police Department with the text of Sergeant Quon's pager messages. Law enforcement access to stored communications and transactional records is less demanding than under Title III, with two primary avenues for access provided by the Stored Communications Act. Section 2702 of the Stored Communications Act allows ECS and RCS providers to disclose a customer's communication content to law enforcement in cases of crime discovery or emergencies. It also permits disclosure to any governmental entity in emergency situations. Section 2703 outlines when providers may be required to disclose communication content and records. The Stored Communications Act distinguishes between recent communications and those in electronic storage for over 180 days. Government entities need a search warrant to compel providers to supply content held for less than 180 days, while a warrant, subpoena, or court order can be used for content held for more than 180 days. A subsection 2703(d) court order can be issued by a federal magistrate or a qualified judge, with the person whose communication is disclosed entitled to notice unless delayed notification is authorized. Officials may certify the need for delayed notification in the case of a subpoena based on traditional exigent circumstances and a final general inconvenience justification. Subsection 2703(d) authorizes an order when specific and articulable facts establish reasonable grounds to believe the contents are relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. Some courts have held that this standard may be constitutionally insufficient for government access to provider-held email. The Sixth Circuit panel has ruled that government access to provider-held email without a warrant, subscriber consent, or indication of waiver violates the Fourth Amendment. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) requires providers to preserve customer communications upon government request, subject to Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and exceptions. Subsection 2703(f) mandates providers to save records pending a warrant, court order, or subpoena. The Stored Communications Act requires providers to preserve customer communications upon government request, subject to Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and exceptions. Providers may be required to preserve backup copies of communications covered by a subpoena or court order. Section 2703 provides greater protection to communication content than to provider records. Under subsection 2703(c), a governmental entity can request ECS or RCS providers to disclose customer information with a warrant, court order, or consent. Subpoenas can be used for limited customer-related data without notifying the customer. The Third Circuit has debated the standard for obtaining cell phone location information. In United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court addressed this issue. In United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court ruled that attaching a tracking device to a car and capturing long-term information violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court found that this activity constituted a search, either through physical intrusion or breaching the driver's reasonable expectation of privacy. It is uncertain how this decision will impact future cases involving unauthorized access. The decision in Jones will impact cases involving unauthorized access. Violations of Section 2701 can lead to criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions, including imprisonment and fines. Victims can seek equitable relief, attorneys' fees, costs, and damages. Violations by the United States may result in legal action. Violations of the Stored Communications Act (SCA) may result in disciplinary action against offending officials or employees, with potential civil damages, costs, and liabilities for ECS and RCS providers. Unlike violations of Title III, there is no statutory prohibition on disclosure or use of information under Section 2701, but violations trigger both Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and exceptions. No criminal penalties apply to voluntary provider disclosure violations under Section 2702. A trap and trace device and pen register do not intercept communication content but identify call sources and numbers dialed. ECPA expanded interception definitions, regulating these devices separately from Title III. However, advancements in technology may allow them to capture communication content, triggering Title III wiretap provisions. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened coverage under Sections 3121-3127. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded Sections 3121-3127 to include sender/addressee information for electronic communications. Subsection 3121(a) prohibits the use of pen registers or trap and trace devices without court authorization, except in specific circumstances. Government officials can apply for court orders to use these devices in criminal investigations. An order authorizing installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device in a criminal investigation must specify relevant details, involve carrier assistance, terminate within 60 days, and impose nondisclosure requirements. It can be issued by a judge of competent jurisdiction or approved by senior Justice Department or state prosecutors. State prosecutors can approve the emergency use of pen registers or trap and trace devices in cases involving organized crime, immediate danger, national security threats, or attacks on protected computers. This use must end within 48 hours if court approval is denied. Federal authorities have sought court orders to track cell phone users in criminal investigations, with varying success. Unauthorized use of these devices is prohibited. Unauthorized use of pen registers or trap and trace devices, other than by authorized entities, is a federal crime punishable by imprisonment and fines. There is a defense for reliance on court orders or emergency requests. Violations do not trigger an exclusionary rule like Title III violations. Targets are not required to be notified upon expiration of the order, and there is no federal private cause of action for victims. Gag orders may be limited to avoid First Amendment concerns. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes special court orders for electronic surveillance, physical searches, and the use of pen registers/trap and trace devices. FISA requires Congress to be informed and once allowed surveillance orders targeting overseas communications. Its replacement provisions for orders directed at persons abroad expire on December 31, 2017. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court) established by FISA consists of eleven federal district court judges designated by the Chief Justice of the United States. They receive and act upon FISA order applications, including challenges and requests to modify gag orders. Federal magistrate judges may also handle pen register/trap and trace orders. The FISA court handles tangible item orders, and the government can appeal denials to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. FISA electronic surveillance and physical search procedures are similar to law enforcement but with differences. FISA wiretapping orders differ from law enforcement orders in defining electronic surveillance. The curr_chunk discusses the acquisition of communication by surveillance devices in the United States, targeting specific individuals with a reasonable expectation of privacy. This includes wire communication and radio communication, with the requirement of a warrant for law enforcement purposes. The FISA court judges individually approve or reject requests for electronic surveillance in the United States under specific circumstances requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. The application for surveillance must include the identity of the individual being targeted. The electronic surveillance or physical search application must include the identity of the individual submitting the application, the identity or description of the person targeted for interception, reasons for believing the person is a foreign power or agent, details of the minimization procedures, description of communications to be intercepted, certification by a senior official that the information sought is foreign intelligence, and a summary of the means of interception. The judges issue orders approving electronic surveillance or physical searches based on meeting application requirements and probable cause to believe the target is a foreign power or agent. Orders specify the identity of the person, nature and location of targeted facilities, and type of communications to be intercepted. The judges issue orders approving electronic surveillance or physical searches based on meeting application requirements and probable cause to believe the target is a foreign power or agent. Orders specify the nature and location of targeted facilities, type of communications targeted, means of interception, authorization tenure, device ranges, minimization procedures, assistance from carriers, security precautions, compensation, and notification of additional surveillance details. Orders expire after accomplishing their purpose, generally within 90 days. Interception and physical searches for foreign intelligence surveillance can be conducted without a court order in certain situations, with reporting requirements to Congress and the FISA court. Extensions for surveillance may not exceed one year, with emergency situations allowing for interception prior to approval. Constitutional limitations may apply, especially when American citizens are involved. FISA has provisions for surveillance and physical search authority, including confidentiality requirements, notice to the \"aggrieved,\" suppression procedures, and oversight by Congress. Surveillance and search orders can consult with law enforcement officers, and semiannual reports are required on their use. Title III and FISA are the exclusive authorities for governmental electronic surveillance in the US. The 2008 FISA Amendments Act established a second exclusivity section to prevent exceptions without explicit statutory language. It is a federal crime for officials to abuse their authority under FISA provisions. The prohibitions under Title III and FISA cover illicit surveillance and searches by federal officers or employees. Violations can result in fines and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years, with a defense available if acting under a warrant or court order. Offenders may also face civil liability. The 2008 FISA Amendments Act provides immunity from civil suits for those assisting in electronic surveillance or physical search orders. Dismissal is required if the Attorney General certifies that the assistance was provided under certain conditions outlined in the Act. The 2008 FISA Amendments Act provides immunity for those assisting in surveillance orders related to foreign powers or terrorist attacks authorized by the President between 9/11 and January 17, 2007. Only specific types of service providers can claim protection for assistance provided during this period. The 2008 FISA Amendments Act provides immunity for assistance provided to intelligence agencies, with the Attorney General's certification being binding if supported by substantial evidence. Challenges to the certification are considered ex parte and in camera to protect national security. State court cases can be removed to federal court, and the Act preempts state regulatory authority over communication service providers. The USA PATRIOT Act amendments provide victims of improper use of information under FISA surveillance with a cause of action against the United States for damages. FISA has exclusionary rules for evidence from unlawful surveillance, but lawful surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes may yield admissible evidence of a crime. The FISA exclusionary rules do not apply before the grand jury. FISA pen register and trap and trace procedures are similar to law enforcement procedures, with many attributes of other FISA provisions. Orders can be issued by a member of the FISA court or a FISA magistrate upon certification by a federal officer that the information is relevant to international terrorism or intelligence activities. The Attorney General can authorize emergency installation and use within 48 hours, with restrictions if an order is not granted. The provisions for using acquired information are similar to those for FISA surveillance and physical search orders. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act increased Congressional oversight for FISA pen register/trap and trace authority. Information acquired must be used lawfully and consistent with FISA restrictions. Unauthorized use of pen register or trap and trace devices is a federal crime, punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine. Good faith reliance on statutory authorization, like FISA, is a defense. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act increased oversight for FISA pen register/trap and trace authority. Assistance under FISA provides immunity from civil liability, but victims of unlawful information use have a cause of action against the US. The exclusionary rule for FISA orders is similar to that for evidence from FISA surveillance or physical search. FISA's tangible item orders allow for the release of business records with certification of relevance to a foreign power. The USA PATRIOT Act and USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act temporarily changed the procedure for accessing tangible property for investigations related to foreign intelligence or international terrorism. Recipients of the order are prohibited from disclosing it but can consult an attorney and challenge its legality. They have immunity from civil liability for complying in good faith. The 2008 FISA Amendments Act established procedures for acquiring foreign intelligence information, with safeguards such as minimization standards, use restrictions, and reporting requirements. Congress can petition to lift or modify disclosure restrictions annually, subject to appellate review. The Justice Department's Inspector General conducts audits on FISA tangible item authority use. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 established procedures for acquiring foreign intelligence information by targeting individuals or entities overseas. Different sections, such as 50 U.S.C. 1881a, 1881b, and 1881c, cover various scenarios involving overseas targets and electronic communications. Section 1881a of the FISA Amendments Act allows the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to jointly authorize targeting individuals outside the US for acquiring foreign intelligence information for up to 1 year. It empowers them to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information and the methods that may be used. The FISA Amendments Act allows the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information and methods for capturing communications. This process involves certification to the FISA court or determination by officials in exigent circumstances. Key requirements include targeting individuals outside the US, involving electronic communication service providers, and implementing court-approved minimization procedures. The FISA Amendments Act allows for the authorization of foreign intelligence acquisition, subject to court-approved procedures and guidelines. Certification must include targeting and minimization procedures, affidavits from senior officials, and notification of authorization details. Limitations prohibit targeting individuals in the US or engaging in \"reverse targeting\" overseas. The FISA Amendments Act allows for foreign intelligence acquisition with court-approved procedures. The Attorney General must establish targeting and minimization procedures to prevent targeting individuals in the US or acquiring communications in violation of the Fourth Amendment. These procedures are subject to review by the FISA court for sufficiency. The FISA court reviews requests for certification approval under the FISA Amendments Act. Guidelines must be provided to the court and congressional committees. Electronic communications service providers can be instructed to assist in acquisition, with compensation and immunity from suit. Providers can petition the court to modify or set aside directives. The Attorney General can enforce directives against uncooperative providers, with appeal options available. The Foreign Intelligence Court of Review and the Supreme Court can review appeals of directives. Section 1806 governs the use of information obtained under Section 1881a. The court can authorize acquisition of information from American individuals or entities in the country under Section 1881b, with approval from the Attorney General. The application must be made under oath and include specific details about the target and the information sought. The minimization procedures for obtaining foreign intelligence information under FISA require certification by a senior official, a description of the information sought, the purpose of the effort, and the means of acquisition. The application must include details about the target, previous applications, proposed tenure of the order, and any additional information required by the FISA court. The FISA court must issue an acquisition order upon finding that the application meets statutory requirements, has adequate minimization procedures, and shows probable cause that the American target is overseas and linked to a foreign power. The court's order must include details about the target, activities targeted, information sought, means of acquisition, and order duration, along with compliance with minimization procedures. Any insufficiencies in probable cause or procedures can be appealed to higher courts. The acquisition order requires compliance with minimization procedures and may involve provider assistance at a prevailing rate. Providers are immune from civil liability for directed assistance. In emergency cases, the Attorney General can authorize acquisition pending court approval, with notification and filing requirements. If emergency acquisition is not approved, resulting evidence cannot be used unless the target is not American. Information sharing with federal officials requires target consent or concerns serious bodily harm. Section 1881a governs the use of information obtained under FISA for serious bodily injury threats. Section 1881c allows targeting Americans overseas for foreign intelligence, including acquisitions outside the US. It has similar approval and appeal provisions as Section 1881b, with authorization under a court order or in emergencies. Section 1881a governs the use of information obtained under FISA for serious bodily injury threats. Section 1881c allows targeting Americans overseas for foreign intelligence, with similar approval and appeal provisions as Section 1881b. Authorization is available under a court order or in emergency circumstances under the order of the Attorney General. Acquisition activities must be discontinued during any period when the target is thought to be in the United States. Unlike 1881b, it is not limited to electronic surveillance or the acquisition of stored electronic information. In the case of acquisition abroad, recourse to a court order is only necessary when the target American, found overseas, has a reasonable expectation of privacy. A challenge to the constitutionality of Section 1881a was initially dismissed for lack of standing, but the Second Circuit disagreed. The Attorney General must report every 6 months on the use of FISA authority to specific congressional committees. The report must include details on the number of persons targeted under various FISA orders, lone wolf terrorists, use of FISA material in criminal proceedings, legal interpretations, and court decisions. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"wire communication\" and \"oral communication\" in relation to interception laws. It also defines the term \"State\" in the context of the United States. The curr_chunk defines \"State\" as any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. It also defines \"intercept\" as acquiring the contents of wire, electronic, or oral communication using any electronic, mechanical, or other device.
