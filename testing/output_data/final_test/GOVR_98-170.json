    "content": "This report reviews effective means for persuasive communication in speeches written by congressional staff for Senators and Representatives. The speeches are often prepared under tight deadlines, leaving little time for extensive revision. The reliance on speechwriters is heightened by time limitations and media urgencies, with speeches needing to reflect the speaker's intention and style. The best ghostwriters should be invisible, reflecting the speaker's intention and style. Practice and experience are key to achieving this ideal. This report provides guidance for congressional staff on speechwriting principles. Effective speeches require attention to audience, occasion, and the speaker's attitudes and style. Speechwriters must learn to \"write aloud\" to create speeches that sound as good as they read. When writing speeches, prioritize the ear over the eye for easy intelligibility. Keep sentences simple, direct, and short, aiming for clarity without sacrificing nuance. Avoid extremes of complexity or oversimplification. Craft sentences that convey meaning clearly and draw on the richness of spoken English, with an average length of 8 to 16 words for optimal listener comprehension. When writing speeches, prioritize the ear for easy understanding. Keep sentences simple, direct, and short, with an average length of 8 to 16 words for optimal listener comprehension. Complex sentences can be clarified by repeating key words and using simple connections, as seen in Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech. Repetition with variation is a basic speechwriting tool to emphasize key elements without monotony. Speeches often use repetition with variation to emphasize key elements and build a powerful climax. Examples include Lincoln at Gettysburg, Winston Churchill in World War II, and Franklin D. Roosevelt in his \"One third of a Nation\" speech.

It highlights the tradition of public speaking in English and the role of figures of speech in enhancing meaning and relationships among ideas. The text also provides examples of classic oratory using rhythmic patterns and balanced constructions, such as repetition and parallel structure. The curr_chunk discusses the technique of comparing and contrasting dissimilar elements in writing, using examples of famous quotes and sentence structures. It emphasizes the use of periodic and loose sentences, as well as rhetorical questions to create impact and variation in writing. The speaker uses rhetorical questions and dramatic pauses to emphasize the consequences of sacrificing freedom for peace. This technique aims to enhance the impact of the message and engage the audience in critical thinking. The speaker uses rhetorical devices like dramatic pauses and periodic sentences to emphasize key points and engage the audience in critical thinking. By giving special emphasis to certain phrases and using simple connective conjunctions, the speaker aims to make complex sentences more easily understandable and impactful. Speech is powerful, and imagery through metaphors enhances its impact. Extended metaphors should be used carefully to avoid losing the main point. Multiple metaphors in a sentence should be handled with caution to prevent confusion. Effective speechwriting for Congress requires clarity of expression, identity with the listener, and consideration of the context and speaker's personality. It is not merely creative writing but aims to be persuasive, even if at times ambiguity or complexity is necessary. The best speechwriter tailors the speech to the occasion and speaker, projecting the desired image to the audience. The section on speech analysis in this report focuses on audience analysis, emphasizing the importance of knowing your listeners' age, gender, culture, education, profession, audience size, and affiliation to effectively connect with them. Different audience demographics have varying life experiences, interests, and communication styles. Gender differences in societal roles are less pronounced than before, but some persistent disparities in viewpoints between men and women remain. William Wiethoff defines culture as race, customs, and religion shared by an audience. Education, profession, and income level can be pitfalls for speechwriters, who should be sensitive to varying audience frames of reference. When preparing a speech, it is important to consider the audience size and formality of the occasion. Speeches should be familiar, sympathetic, and topical, tailored to the Member's comfort level. Different audiences may require varying levels of formality, length, and delivery style. Members may need only talking points for town meetings, while intimate gatherings may call for extemporaneous speaking. In the age of media, Members may address small physical audiences with a larger online presence. The writer must craft remarks considering both the physical audience and those watching remotely. Speechwriters must tailor their words based on the audience's political affiliation. It is essential to remember that the Member represents all constituents, regardless of party affiliation or location. The speechwriter must consider the occasion and tailor remarks accordingly, ensuring they align in tone and content. For solemn events like Veterans' Day and Memorial Day, focus on themes of commemoration, service, and sacrifice. High school and college commencements may require inspirational remarks. The writer should tailor remarks to the occasion and audience, considering the tone and content appropriate for each setting. Congressional staff should plan substantive remarks for significant events, ensuring they are delivered in suitable surroundings with adequate media coverage and at optimal timing. The purpose of a speech and the occasion at which it will be delivered are closely related. William E. Wiethoff suggests a \"purpose\" template for speechwriters in Writing the Speech, establishing three categories of purpose: information, persuasion, and entertainment. These speeches aim to convey facts or information to the audience, linking new facts with existing knowledge, elaborating on details without confusing the audience, and summarizing main points. The persuasive speech can aim to instill acceptance or a more favorable opinion towards a particular idea, while dissent seeks to change the audience's impressions or convictions. Wiethoff also identifies entertainment as a speech purpose, with many Member speeches falling into this category. Speeches in the entertainment category serve to reinforce common ties and experiences within communities, contributing to the vitality of civic life in America. These speeches are delivered during significant ceremonies or rituals, with an expectation of what will happen, whether solemn like a Memorial Day address or celebratory remarks. Speeches at community events, whether solemn or celebratory, are vital expressions of civic life. The Member's role as a community leader should not be underestimated, and a congressional speechwriter should devote talent and originality to these occasions. Combining persuasion with information is often necessary to convince an audience, while also seeking to entertain to capture and retain their attention. When writing speeches for community events, congressional speechwriters should consider various factors such as audience analysis, occasion, and the speaker's style and preferences. Understanding the Member's natural inclinations, whether they are concise or verbose, and their tendency to stick to the script or share anecdotes and humor, is crucial for effective communication. Additionally, considering the time of day can also impact the audience's receptiveness to the speech. When writing speeches, consider factors like audience, occasion, and speaker's style. Morning audiences are fresh, while afternoon ones may need stimulation. Avoid lengthy after-dinner remarks. Speech length should typically be around 20 minutes as listeners may tune out after that. When writing speeches, consider factors like audience, occasion, and speaker's style. Speech length should typically be around 20 minutes as listeners may tune out after that. Different speakers have varying paces, ranging from 115 to 175 words per minute. An average 20-minute speech contains about 2,600 words, or about 130 words per minute. When preparing a speech, it is important to have a fixed time limit to avoid excessive verbiage. Time limits help speakers be concise and prevent speeches from becoming overly complex. Jefferson's criticism of long speeches in 1824 still holds true today. The speechwriter's focus should be on gathering relevant ideas, facts, examples, and humor to make the speech effective. When preparing a speech, it is essential to gather relevant ideas, facts, examples, illustrations, quotations, and humor to give substance and interest to the speech.

Commercial publications like CQ also offer legislative information. Commercial publications such as CQ Weekly, Congressional Quarterly Almanac, and Congress and the Nation provide legislative information. National Journal focuses more on executive branch activities. Websites like American Rhetoric and Speechwriter.com offer resources for speechwriters, including speeches, debates, research sites, statistics, and biographies. The Advanced Public Speaking Institute website offers 43 articles on using humor in speeches. Recommended resources for speechwriting include books like \"Writing Great Speeches\" by Alan M. Pearlman, \"The Lost Art of the Great Speech\" by Richard Dowis, and \"Choosing Powerful Words\" by Ronald H. Carpenter. These books cover content, memorability, the rule of three, and other speechwriting techniques. Ronald H. Carpenter, a professor of English and communications, recommends essential materials for speechwriters including a good dictionary, a thesaurus like Roget's or J.I. Rodale's Synonym Finder, and quotation resources like Bartlett's Familiar Quotations or Respectfully Quoted. Contact the Loan Division of the Library of Congress to request books. Essential resources for speechwriters include quotation dictionaries like Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, annual almanacs for quick reference, literary works such as Shakespeare and the King James Bible for both spiritual and literary value, standard encyclopedias for fact-checking, and annual guides like Chase's Calendar of Events for special observances. The Statistical Abstract of the United States provides useful facts and statistics for speech preparation. The government publication Statistical Abstract of the United States is a valuable resource for speechwriters, providing facts and statistics for speech preparation. Other sources such as Vital Speeches of the Day offer examples of speeches by public figures on current topics and events. Daily newspapers, weekly news magazines, and specialized journals are also recommended for speech research. The Internet provides new sources of information for congressional speechwriters, including home district newspaper websites for local news. General principles for speechwriting include using quotations and anecdotes sparingly and avoiding pseudo-quotations. Quotations should always be verifiable in authoritative sources. When writing speeches, it is important to use humor with a light touch and avoid offensive jokes targeting personal lives or religious groups. Statistics should be used sparingly to avoid turning the speech into a statistical abstract. Properly quoting and giving credit for borrowed material is essential to avoid plagiarism, while adapting existing materials for new speeches is acceptable. Jefferson defended himself against plagiarism accusations, stating that he did not aim to invent new ideas but rather recycle and improve upon existing ones. Using outlines can greatly aid in the speechwriting process, despite the temptation to skip this step for time constraints. Using outlines can greatly aid in the speechwriting process by forcing the writer to plan and organize thoughts, determine what to say in advance, and begin at the beginning. The outline serves as a skeleton for the fully developed speech, which should eventually be invisible when delivered with ideas and emotions. Outlines can be written in topics, key sentences, or complete thoughts in an orderly sequence, and can be retained for future use in folders or notebooks. Outlines are essential for speechwriting, whether stored digitally or on physical media like notebooks or index cards. President Ronald Reagan famously used note cards to emphasize key points in his speeches. A speech should always aim to communicate clearly and effectively, with a central theme guiding the logical progression of ideas. Each fact should lead to the next point, ultimately aiming to move, convince, or inspire the audience. When crafting a speech, it is important to have a clear central theme guiding the logical progression of ideas. Stick to no more than three major points to avoid diluting the message. A speech typically follows a three-part structure of introduction, body, and conclusion. When crafting a speech, it is crucial to have a clear central theme guiding the logical progression of ideas. Stick to no more than three major points to avoid diluting the message. The speech should have a basic three-part structure of introduction, body, and conclusion. An arresting introduction should lead into an emphatic statement of the main theme, while the argument that follows seeks to elaborate and develop the theme convincingly and effectively. One helpful approach for overcoming word fright is to write the speech in reverse, beginning with the conclusion to summarize the central message. Working backward can impart unity, coherence, and emphasis to the speech as a whole. When crafting a speech, it is important to have a clear central theme and stick to no more than three major points. The speech should follow a basic structure of introduction, body, and conclusion. Persuasive techniques such as appeal to reasonableness, emotion, and ethics are commonly used to create a sense of community and trust with the audience. When crafting a speech, it is important to have a clear central theme and stick to no more than three major points. Persuasive techniques such as appeal to reasonableness, emotion, and ethics are commonly used to create a sense of community and trust with the audience. The speech can utilize different approaches like the \"attention-problem-solution\" method or the \"this-or-nothing\" method to engage the audience and advocate for a particular policy. The speaker should reinforce their main ideas in a speech, avoiding apologies for content. It is advisable to avoid speaking off-the-cuff and not memorize speeches. Contemporary usage is preferred over historical styles like all-day speeches and classical allusions. The development of public address systems, radio, and television has changed the style of public speaking in the United States to be more low key and conversational, promoting a sense of psychological bonding between the speaker and audience. This shift was exemplified by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his radio addresses. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was one of the most effective practitioners of public speaking, revolutionizing communication with his radio \"fireside chats.\" He spoke \"with,\" rather than \"to,\" the people, using natural language and a conversational flow. Using the first person in speeches is acceptable and can help create a sense of community between the speaker and the audience. Using the first person singular in speeches can help connect the speaker to the audience and create a sense of community. Speakers should avoid excessive use of \"I\" and also refrain from using first person plural or third person singular, as it can come across as archaic or convey excessive self-importance. Writers should aim for simple, declarative sentences in active voice when making important statements, although the passive voice can be appropriate in certain situations. Excessive use of the first person singular in speeches should be avoided, as it can create a choppy cadence. Points to emphasize in speeches should serve as clear transitions, while jargon, redundancy, distracting mannerisms, and cliches should be avoided. Punctuation is crucial for effective speech delivery, with historical traditions of syntactical and elocutionary punctuation. Three methods of punctuating include structure/logic, rhythm, and respiration for natural speech flow. The most appropriate method for punctuating speeches is to punctuate according to the ear and not the eye, focusing on natural speech flow and allowing time for the speaker to breathe. Congressional speechwriters should declaim aloud lengthy sentences intended for the Member to ensure they are not too taxing on the lungs. Punctuation in speeches should be based on natural speech flow, allowing pauses for the speaker to breathe. Colons and semicolons can be divisive, with some viewing them as serving similar functions as commas and dashes, while others see them as more emphatic, requiring a full stop in the flow of remarks. Ultimately, the congressional speechwriter should consider the Member's personal style and preferences when deciding on punctuation. Correct grammar and syntax in speechwriting mean using appropriate English for the occasion, focusing on clarity of expression. Communication of personality through emotion and enthusiasm is crucial for a speech to be perceived as sincere and trustworthy. Effective delivery can enhance a weak speech, while poor delivery can ruin even the best-prepared speeches. Delivery should always be considered during speech preparation, as it can greatly impact the overall success of the speech. The speechwriter must be familiar with the speaker's style, pace, and tendencies before drafting a speech. It is important for the draft to be reviewed by the writer, speaker, and a third party for effectiveness. However, too many revisions can be counterproductive. Evaluation of the speech's impact and audience reaction can be done after delivery. An effective political speech is defined by the character of response it evokes, with the speaker always concerned about eliciting positive feedback. This involves a network of contacts to report on audience opinions and reactions, as well as evaluating media coverage and subsequent treatment. Keeping in touch with constituents and sponsors is crucial for maintaining political relevance. Good speech preparation involves wide reading to develop style, vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. Regular practice improves speechwriting skills and flow. Personal preferences dictate the physical form of a speech, with some speakers opting for polished texts with tailored anecdotes and jokes. Speech preparation involves reading widely to develop style, vocabulary, and syntax. Some speakers prefer polished texts with tailored anecdotes and jokes, while others speak from notes or extemporize. President-elect Lincoln's farewell speech in 1861 is noted for its brevity and setting on a train, reflecting the historical connection between political events and the railroad. Lincoln's speaking style is described as the American style par excellence, characterized by precision, vernacular ease, rhythmic virtuosity, and elegance. His use of parallelism, balanced phrases, and rich Biblical overtones in his speeches is rooted in everyday speech but elevated by form and rhythm. Some argue that rhetorical eloquence has no place today, favoring bluntness instead. Some argue that rhetorical eloquence is still significant today, citing Lincoln's mastery of speechmaking as an example. Lincoln expresses sadness at leaving a place where he has lived for a quarter of a century, with a task ahead greater than Washington's, relying on divine assistance for success. The rise of simplistic language in American political speaking, influenced by mass media advertising, has led to a trend of numbing mediocrity. This shift towards brevity and repetition of simple ideas has been noted as a decline in the quality of style in speeches. The decline in the quality of contemporary political speech is evident, with many speeches being pedestrian and lacking in style. The remedy may lie in cultivating impressive language that is vivid, clear, concise, and meaningful, bearing the personal stamp of the speaker. Good speechwriting involves the ability to communicate values and connect with the audience, requiring the speaker to impart confidence and understand the audience's character. Effective persuasion requires winning the hearts and minds of the audience by appearing natural and ethical. The speaker's integrity, understanding, and humanity are key components of their personal effect on the audience. Abraham Lincoln emphasized the importance of using kind and unassuming persuasion to influence behavior. Effective persuasion involves using kind and unassuming tactics to win people over. It is important to convince them that you are a sincere friend first, as this approach is more effective than being forceful. This method, likened to a drop of honey catching flies, appeals to the heart before the mind, making it easier to persuade them to see the justice in your cause."
