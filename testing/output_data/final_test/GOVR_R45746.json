When technologies converge, they may need to adhere to multiple standards and regulations, leading to extended regulatory reviews and additional costs for the industry. New converged technologies like social media, IoTs, and virtual assistants may fall into regulatory gaps without a clear oversight framework in place. Regulating companies offering converged technologies is challenging due to the evolving and expanding nature of their services and products. This can lead to regulatory gaps and challenges in classification, potentially resulting in antitrust concerns and varying levels of oversight for companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. Smart home security devices, like smart doorbells and locks, raise regulatory concerns as they may not be subject to the same regulations as traditional home security companies. The convergence of technologies also complicates regulatory roles, with Congress focusing on digital privacy issues related to the collection and use of personal information by these devices. The convergence of technologies raises concerns about digital privacy as data collection and usage increase, potentially identifying individuals and revealing patterns in their activities. Consumer worries about protecting digital privacy may intensify as technologies generate more data that can track and monitor individuals. The use of converged technologies raises digital privacy concerns as data can identify, locate, track, and monitor individuals without their knowledge. Current U.S. data protection laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to address privacy issues related to financial institutions and healthcare data. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations protect medical information known as \"protected health information\" (PHI) for covered entities like health care providers, health plans, and certain business associates. The regulations cover the use, sharing, disclosure, safeguards, and breach notification of PHI. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs the collection and use of consumer creditworthiness information by credit reporting agencies (CRAs) and furnishers. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs credit reporting agencies (CRAs), entities furnishing information to CRAs (furnishers), and individuals who use credit reports. Unlike HIPAA or GLBA, FCRA does not require entities to provide notice or obtain consent before collecting or disclosing consumer data. FCRA focuses on ensuring accuracy and permissible use of consumer information. The Communications Act of 1934 established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for regulating interstate communication. The Communications Act of 1934 established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for regulating interstate communication. It includes data protection provisions applicable to common carriers, cable operators, and satellite carriers. The Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) was enacted in 1988 to preserve personal privacy regarding video tapes or similar materials. The VPPA prohibits video tape service providers from disclosing personally identifiable information without consumer consent. The Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) prohibits disclosing personally identifiable information without consumer consent. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects student education records, giving control over disclosure to parents or students. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) gives students control over their educational records, including the disclosure, review, and challenging of inaccurate information. Federal securities laws require companies to adopt controls to prevent data breaches and disclose breaches when required. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulates the online collection and use of children's information. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulates operators collecting personal information from children online, requiring compliance with data collection, privacy policy notifications, and data security. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) provides privacy protections for electronic communications and imposes obligations on both governmental and non-governmental actors. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) have limited impact on online privacy.

Litigants have struggled to apply ECPA to online data collection, and CFAA imposes liability for unauthorized access to protected computers. The FTC Act is crucial for data privacy and security, giving the FTC authority to address deceptive practices. The Act exempts certain entities like common carriers and financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts by covered entities. Enacted in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, it created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). State and international laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and GDPR provide guidance on digital privacy. The FTC Act and Clayton Act are also important for data privacy and security. The FTC Act and the Clayton Act give the FTC authority to protect consumers and promote competition. The FTC focuses on data security issues like identity theft and deceptive advertising. Consumer protection law may not cover all digital privacy and data security issues. Data privacy and data security are closely related topics in digital privacy discussions. Data privacy involves governing data collection, use, and sharing, while data security protects data from unauthorized access. Data security is more related to cybersecurity and defends against theft of data through proactive and responsive measures. Malicious actors engage in unlawful activities like breaking into databases or sending phishing emails to steal identity and financial information, causing financial harm to individuals and businesses. Data privacy issues arise from unauthorized collection, use, and sharing of personal information, leading to financial damage. Privacy implications occur when data security is compromised, revealing unexpected aspects of individuals. Examples include mobile apps and websites using online activity for targeted ads. Data privacy concerns arise from lack of transparency in commercial marketing strategies, leading to potential violations of individuals' privacy rights. Key aspects of data privacy are not clearly defined for digital data, especially for personal information like geolocation data collected by apps. In the 115th and 116th Congress, committees discussed data privacy concerns related to personal data collected by various technologies. Several bills were introduced, but none became law in the 115th Congress. In the 116th Congress, bills like H.R. 1282 were introduced to address data privacy concerns. Two bills introduced in Congress address data privacy concerns. The Data Accountability and Trust Act by Representative Bobby Rush focuses on securing personal information and notifying individuals of security breaches. The American Data Dissemination Act by Senator Marco Rubio imposes privacy requirements on internet service providers. The FTC would play a role in regulating data security policies. Two bills introduced in Congress aim to address data privacy concerns. S. 189, the Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act, requires online platforms to disclose their data collection practices. S. 583, the DATA Privacy Act, focuses on digital accountability and transparency, mandating clear disclosure of privacy practices for collected data. Both bills involve enforcement by the FTC and state attorney generals. The FTC enforces privacy practices for data brokers who collect and resell consumers' personal information. Data brokers operate without consumer interaction, leading to unawareness of their practices. The FTC categorizes data brokers into three groups based on their activities. The FTC enforces privacy practices for data brokers who collect and resell consumers' personal information. Data brokers are categorized into three groups based on their activities. The FCRA governs credit reporting agencies and entities furnishing information to them, but lacks privacy and data security provisions. Data brokerage companies like Acxiom, Cambridge Analytica, and others remain opaque in terms of transparency. Data brokers purchase and aggregate information from various sources, including app developers, websites, and social media. Technological convergence leads to more data generation and consumption, potentially exposing personal details. Congress may focus on data and physical security of converged technologies due to increased access points for unauthorized entry. Increased access points due to technological convergence lead to a higher risk of cyberattacks and data theft.

Congress may need to consider policy options for overseeing technological convergence, digital privacy, and data security. Regulating technological convergence may involve addressing jurisdictional conflicts and harmonizing policies for new technology categories. Regulating technological convergence poses challenges due to jurisdictional conflicts and the rapid evolution of technology. Options for oversight include industry self-regulation or maintaining current regulatory jurisdiction with enhancements for new technology categories. The Administration could maintain current regulatory jurisdiction but implement a deconfliction or harmonization policy for convergent technologies. Alternatively, they could expand regulatory authorities to include self-regulated technologies, requiring a complete overhaul of the regulatory framework and potential stifling of innovation. Federal data protection laws currently in place apply to specific types of data with varied privacy and data security provisions. However, there is no comprehensive federal law addressing digital privacy for all types of data. While illegal use of personal information is enforced by federal agencies, the legal use of data from users or converged technologies like social media and IoT is not as regulated. Transparency into the activities of legal data brokers and collectors is limited, prompting Congress to consider introducing new comprehensive federal laws to define the federal government's role in overseeing digital privacy. The government is considering new federal laws to regulate digital privacy, potentially expanding existing authorities like the FTC. Congress may need to make decisions on data privacy, data security, and how different types of personal data should be treated. Data security in the context of technological convergence is a key concern that may impact both cyber and physical security. Data security laws vary and may focus on cyber-aspects, with different protocols for notifying users of compromised data. Congress may need to consider new legislation addressing data security concerns related to technological convergence and expanding cybersecurity missions. Balancing convenience with security measures is crucial in protecting data. A data security policy must balance convenience with security measures to effectively address vulnerabilities from technological convergence. Congress may need to consider combining data privacy and data security into one policy, as they are interconnected for digital information protection. Having separate policies for data privacy and data security could help focus more clearly on specific aspects of each issue."
