    "content": "The \"Dairy Augmentation for Increased Retail in Yogurt products (DAIRY) Act\" establishes Dairy Farm Savings Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"DAIRY Act\" allows qualified dairy farmers to deduct cash contributions to a dairy farm savings account. The deduction is limited to 150% of the individual's 3-year average income from dairy farming. A qualified dairy farmer is defined as an individual engaged in the trade or business of dairy farming. The \"DAIRY Act\" allows qualified dairy farmers to deduct cash contributions to a dairy farm savings account, limited to 150% of the individual's 3-year average income from dairy farming. The dairy farm savings account is a trust created for making qualified distributions, with specific requirements for contributions and trustee qualifications. The trust administrator must invest trust assets in cash, US Treasury securities, or approved low-risk securities. Assets cannot be mixed with other property except in a common trust fund. Individual account balances are nonforfeitable. The term 'qualified distribution' from a dairy farm savings account is defined as the amount paid to the beneficiary not exceeding 100 percent of the beneficiary's 3-year average income from dairy farming minus the gross income from dairy farming in the taxable year. The term 'account beneficiary' refers to the individual for whom a dairy farm savings account was established. Special rules similar to those in sections 219(d)(2) and 219(f)(3) apply to this section. Tax Treatment of Dairy Farm Savings Accounts: These accounts are generally exempt from taxation unless they no longer qualify as such. However, they may be subject to taxes under certain circumstances. If the account beneficiary stops dairy farming, all accounts associated with them will no longer be considered dairy farm savings accounts. Tax Treatment of Distributions from Dairy Farm Savings Accounts: Any amount paid or distributed from a dairy farm savings account, excluding rollover contributions, will be taxable income. Prohibited transactions and pledging the account as security will result in the distribution being treated as not used for qualified purposes. Any payment or distribution from a dairy farm savings account (excluding rollover contributions) will be included in the beneficiary's gross income. Non-qualified distributions will incur an additional 15% tax on the amount. Exceptions apply for disability or death situations. If excess contributions are made to a dairy farm savings account, distributions exceeding the excess contributions can be received by the individual before the due date of the return without incurring penalties, provided certain conditions are met. Individual can receive distributions exceeding excess contributions before the tax return due date if accompanied by net income attributable to the excess contribution. Any net income received is included in the individual's gross income for that taxable year. An excess contribution refers to a non-deductible contribution, excluding rollover contributions. A rollover contribution from a dairy farm savings account must meet specific requirements, including timely payment into the account beneficiary's account within 60 days. This provision does not apply if the amount is not paid into the beneficiary's account within the specified timeframe. Transfer of an individual's interest in a dairy farm savings account to their spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument is not considered a taxable transfer, and the interest remains untaxed after the transfer. After the transfer of an individual's interest in a dairy farm savings account to their spouse, the spouse is treated as the account beneficiary. If the designated beneficiary is the spouse and acquires the interest after the account beneficiary's death, the account is treated as if the spouse were the beneficiary. In other cases, if any person acquires the interest after the beneficiary's death, the account is handled accordingly. If a person acquires the interest in a dairy farm savings account after the beneficiary's death, the account will no longer be considered a dairy farm savings account. The fair market value of the assets in the account on the date of death will be included in the person's gross income for that taxable year. The Secretary may require the trustee of a dairy farm savings account to make reports to the Secretary and the beneficiary regarding contributions, distributions, and other relevant matters. The IRS requires reports on dairy farm savings accounts to be filed and furnished as needed. A new deduction for dairy farm savings accounts is added to the tax code. Excess contributions to such accounts are subject to a tax. The new subsection (h) defines excess contributions to dairy farm savings accounts as the aggregate amount contributed for the taxable year that is not deductible under section 224, plus any amount from the previous year, minus distributions subject to additional tax. The tax code is amended to include a special rule for dairy farm savings accounts, with a focus on prohibited transactions. Contributions distributed from the account are treated as non-contributed amounts. The tax code is amended to exempt individuals with dairy farm savings accounts from certain taxes on transactions if the account no longer qualifies as a dairy farm savings account. Additionally, a new subparagraph is added for dairy farm savings accounts in the code. The tax code is amended to include reports on dairy farm savings accounts in Section 6693(a)(2) and make clerical amendments to the table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1. The tax code is amended to include dairy farm savings accounts in Section 6693(a)(2) and make clerical amendments. The amendments apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
