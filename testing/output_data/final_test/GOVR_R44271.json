    "content": "The United Republic of Tanzania, with a population of nearly 54 million people, is an East African country twice the size of California. Despite being ranked as the 31st-poorest country globally in 2016 by the IMF, it has natural resource wealth and agricultural potential. President John Magufuli, elected in 2015, has attracted official development aid, but corruption and a difficult business climate remain concerns. Some sectors, like extractive industries, are seeing private investment. U.S.-Tanzanian ties have been generally cordial, with expanding U.S. aid. Since President John Magufuli's election in 2015, U.S.-Tanzanian ties have been cordial, with expanding U.S. aid. However, concerns about Tanzania's governance have arisen since the 2015 elections, particularly regarding the nullification of election results in Zanzibar and restrictions on civil liberties. In response to these concerns, the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation suspended its partnership with Tanzania in March 2016, halting the development of a second MCC compact with the country. The Obama Administration had funded initial research for a second compact in Tanzania focused on the electrical power sector. Despite tensions, bilateral ties were described as strong with a shared vision of improving Tanzanians' quality of life. The future of U.S.-Tanzanian ties under the Trump Administration remains uncertain. The U.S.-Tanzanian relationship is characterized as strong with collaborative efforts towards shared goals in health, education, economic growth, and regional security. Tanzania may benefit from the new USAID Administrator, who is a former U.S. ambassador to the country. Tanzania has been a significant recipient of aid in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. The Trump Administration has requested $535 million for Tanzania in FY2018, a minimal 2% drop from the current FY2017 estimate. Most U.S. development aid for Tanzania has been provided under Obama Administration initiatives like Feed the Future, Global Health Initiative, and Power Africa. Tanzania was selected as a partner country under the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership in 2014. Tanzania, a Partnership for Growth country, receives U.S. aid focused on health, economic growth, and bilateral security cooperation. It is a top African contributor to peacekeeping operations. Some Members of Congress advocate for protections for albinos in Tanzania. Tanzania, formed in 1964, is a union of Tanganyika and the Zanzibar archipelago. Tanzania gained independence from Britain in 1961, while Zanzibar gained independence in 1963 and remains semiautonomous. Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's president from 1964 to 1985, implemented socialist policies known as ujamaa, focusing on rural collectivism and nationalization of industries. Ujamaa had mixed results, with central state control hindering economic growth and village collectivization facing resistance. In the mid-1980s, Tanzania sought credit and technical cooperation with international financial institutions due to factors like the oil crisis and poor commodity prices. This led to the gradual liberalization of the economy and state. Nyerere's leadership united a diverse population under a shared national identity, preventing ethnic tensions. Zanzibar, however, faced internal ethnic and religious frictions. Since the mid-1990s, successive governments have further liberalized the economy in Tanzania. Despite efforts to liberalize the economy, Tanzania's business environment remains challenging due to the lasting effects of state-centric policies. Corruption and poor service delivery hinder poverty reduction and infrastructure development. The Obama Administration supported Tanzania's governance reform and development efforts with substantial aid. Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), was formed in 1977 by Nyerere through a merger of ruling parties. Despite criticism from opposition parties, CCM has dominated Tanzanian politics. While opposition parties have gained legislative seats in elections, they face harassment and restrictions. Increased political pluralism may lead to ethnic, regional, and religious divisions that CCM aimed to prevent. In recent years, opposition political figures in Tanzania have faced harassment and restrictions on their activities. Tundu Lissu, a prominent member of parliament and critic of President Magufuli, was shot and seriously wounded in 2017. Other opposition parliamentarians also experience pressure from the police. In recent years, opposition political figures in Tanzania have faced harassment and restrictions on their activities, with police arresting MPs and prohibiting meetings with constituents. Newspapers critical of the government have also been suspended or banned. Opposition parties have grown stronger in challenging the ruling party during electoral periods. In 2014, opposition parties boycotted the drafting of a new constitution due to disagreements with the ruling party. The government planned a referendum for April 2015 but later postponed it indefinitely. Rivalry between the ruling CCM and opposition alliance UKAWA remains a key political focus. Tanzania held elections in October 2015, with key issues including land access, poverty, corruption, and energy sector development. Former President Kikwete was constitutionally barred from running for a third term. In the 2015 Tanzanian presidential election, the ruling CCM party, led by Dr. John Magufuli, faced a strong challenge from the opposition coalition UKAWA, with Edward Lowassa as their candidate. Lowassa, a former CCM figure and prime minister, defected to become the main opposition candidate, energizing the electorate, especially the youth population. In the 2015 Tanzanian presidential election, the ruling CCM party, led by Dr. John Magufuli, faced a strong challenge from the opposition coalition UKAWA, with Edward Lowassa as their candidate. The election raised tensions with some campaign-period violence, and complaints of police interference. Magufuli won with 58.5% of the vote, while the CCM won 74% of legislative seats. The 2015 Tanzanian national election was deemed well-administered by the EU, but lacked transparency, leading to distrust in the electoral commissions. In Zanzibar, the ZEC chairman nullified the election results amidst reports of military intervention, sparking violence and calls for new elections. The Zanzibari vote was questioned for credibility, leading to electoral violence. Small bombings and protests followed the annulment by the ZEC. The NEC in Tanzania did not consider the nullification in its vote tallies, causing criticism and calls for reversal. Late 2015 mediation efforts were made involving the CUF and other parties. In 2015, ad hoc dialogue and mediation efforts were made involving the CUF and other parties, but no public details were disclosed. Despite CUF opposition, a rerun of the Zanzibar vote was held on March 21, 2016, which the CUF boycotted. The ZEC declared the CCM candidate as the winner with 91% of votes. The United States, 14 European governments, and the European Union expressed regret over the rerun without a negotiated solution. The current political impasse in Zanzibar calls for inclusive and representative electoral processes. The Government of Tanzania is urged to lead and seek a negotiated solution for peace and unity. The population of Zanzibar has shown calmness and restraint, with a call for national reconciliation. The U.S. MCC Board suspended its partnership with Tanzania due to concerns over the Zanzibar vote outcome and freedom of expression. Aggression against opposition supporters by \"Zombies,\" pro-CCM youth militia, has been reported. In late 2016, opposition politicians were arrested in Tanzania. President Magufuli, known for his infrastructure projects, took a tough stance against corruption upon taking office. His running mate, Samia Hassan Suluhu, became the country's first female vice president. President Magufuli took a tough stance against corruption and inefficiency, promoted civic service, and advocated austerity measures. His leadership style, characterized by top-down decision-making and controversial actions, has garnered both public support and criticism. Despite causing apprehension within the political establishment, he remains popular, although his unilateral decision-making has raised concerns among observers. President Magufuli's administration's crackdown on critics and media, along with efforts to combat corruption, has raised concerns about autocratic governance in Tanzania. Various scandals, including the diversion of funds by government officials, have led to international donor suspensions and resignations. Tanzania's ranking in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index has declined in recent years. While generally stable, there are occasional threats to state and public security, including attacks on tourists and armed assaults on police stations. Islamic extremists have been arrested in the country. Tanzania has arrested Islamic extremists, including members of Al Shabaab and the leader of the Allied Democratic Forces. The country has a mixed human rights record with legal restrictions on the press and crackdowns on opposition protests. The U.S. State Department's 2016 Country Report on Human Rights in Tanzania highlighted widespread human rights issues, including excessive force by security forces, restrictions on assembly and political expression, gender-based violence, harsh prison conditions, limits on freedom of expression online, religious freedom restrictions, corruption, child abuse, discrimination based on sexual orientation, mob killings, societal violence against persons with albinism, and trafficking in persons. The State Department's report on human rights in Tanzania highlighted various issues including excessive force by security forces, restrictions on political expression, gender-based violence, corruption, and trafficking in persons. One particular challenge is witchcraft-related killings and mutilation targeting albinos, with reports of murders and attacks in recent years. Members of Congress have shown support for efforts to end these acts. In March 2017, four Tanzanian albino children arrived in the United States for medical treatment after being attacked. LGBT individuals also face discrimination in Tanzania, where homosexuality is illegal and government officials have made threatening comments. The government has halted U.S.-funded programs for gays and restricted HIV/AIDS services for key populations. Tanzania's GDP was $47.2 billion in 2016, with growth driven by agricultural exports, tourism, and gold exports. The country is diversifying into manufacturing and mining, with resources like coal, iron, nickel, and a new helium reserve. Industry contributes 26% to GDP, while services contribute 43%. Other growing sectors include communications, transport, financial services, construction, and retail. Tanzania's economy is diversifying into manufacturing and mining, with industry contributing 26% to GDP. Services contribute about 43% of GDP. Agriculture remains a mainstay, contributing about 31% of GDP, with a large portion of the workforce engaged in agriculture. However, agricultural growth has been slow. Tanzania faces barriers to economic development such as poor infrastructure, low productivity growth, high population growth rate, and a cumbersome regulatory environment that deters foreign investment. Per capita GDP is estimated at $970 in 2016, with nearly 47% of Tanzanians living on $1.90 or less per day. Tanzania's economy is diversifying into manufacturing and mining, with industry contributing 26% to GDP. Services contribute about 43% of GDP. The country faces barriers to economic development such as poor infrastructure, low productivity growth, and a cumbersome regulatory environment. Tanzania has large reserves of natural gas, attracting foreign investment from firms like ExxonMobil and Statoil. The government estimates 57 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, with potential for export revenue. Many Tanzanians have welcomed these discoveries. Tanzania has large natural gas reserves attracting foreign investment. Many Tanzanians welcome the discoveries, especially for domestic electricity generation. However, there have been protests against a gas pipeline in Mtwara due to fears of unequal distribution of gas revenues. The sector has faced political controversy, with a controversial oil and gas development bill passed in 2015. The passage discusses the implications of a controversial oil and gas development bill in Tanzania, which has raised concerns about rushed passage without public scrutiny. Despite controversies, gas development and electricity generation are expected to benefit many Tanzanians. A 330-mile natural gas pipeline has been established by Tanzania's state-run Petroleum Development Corp to transmit gas from Mnazi Bay to power plants in Dar es Salaam. The government aims to expand gas-fired electricity generation capacity and utilize national coal reserves for power production. Plans for a geothermal power plant and a cross-border oil pipeline from Western Uganda are also in progress. The completion of a cross-border oil pipeline from Western Uganda to northern Tanzania is expected by 2020. Tanzania aims to diversify its energy mix with gas-fueled, coal-fired, and geothermal power generation to reduce reliance on hydroelectricity, which is affected by droughts. Questions have been raised about Tanzania's energy governance capacity due to the enactment of a key oil and gas bill in 2015 and its implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Tanzania complied with EITI reporting guidelines after being suspended in 2015. The government prioritizes national beneficiation from the mining sector and made legislative changes to reshape the industry. The government of Tanzania has made legislative changes in the mining sector, allowing annulment of contracts detrimental to national interest, abolishing international arbitration, requiring local processing of minerals, increasing government ownership in projects, and raising royalty rates. These changes may deter foreign investment. Tanzania and Malawi have a longstanding dispute over Lake Malawi. The dispute over Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa, between Malawi and Tanzania has resurfaced periodically since the mid-1960s. The disagreement intensified in 2012 due to potential fossil fuel reserves in the lake. Malawi claims the entire lake while Tanzania claims half, leading to diplomatic protests and mediation efforts. In 2017, Malawi announced plans to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Malawi plans to take the Lake Malawi dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, while allowing oil and gas exploration to continue. Tanzania has hosted refugees and played a mediational role in the Great Lakes region. Since 2015, Tanzania has hosted refugees from Burundi due to a political and security crisis. Despite commitments to aid refugees, Tanzania's actions have been questioned, with concerns over curtailing protections and pressuring refugees to return to their countries of origin. The number of Burundian refugees in Tanzania has steadily increased since the crisis began in April 2015, reaching 358,600. The Burundian refugee population in Tanzania has grown steadily since the start of the crisis in April 2015, reaching 358,600 by early September 2017. Most refugees reside in the Kigoma Region in three large camps supported by various humanitarian agencies. Tanzania also hosts refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite previous pledges, the Tanzanian government stopped providing automatic refugee recognition to Burundian refugees in early 2017. President Nkurunziza of Burundi visited Tanzania in July 2017, urging all Burundians in the country to return. In July 2015, Burundian President Nkurunziza and Tanzanian President Magufuli called for the voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees in Tanzania. Magufuli later suspended further registrations and naturalizations of Burundian refugees. In late August, Magufuli reiterated the call for voluntary repatriation, sparking criticism from human rights groups. Amnesty International warned against pressuring refugees to return to a country still in crisis. Tanzania played a key role in ending Burundi's civil war in the 1990s. The East African Community appointed former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa to facilitate an \"inter-Burundian dialogue\" to resolve the current Burundian crisis. Mkapa's plan of action presented at an EAC summit in September 2016 aimed for a final agreement by mid-2017, but disagreements over participation and doubts about Mkapa's neutrality have hindered progress. Opposition doubts Mkapa's credibility and neutrality, citing bias towards Burundian government. EAC summit in May 2017 heard progress report on Mkapa's efforts but took no substantive actions. EAC leaders, including President Magufuli, opposed US and EU sanctions on Burundi, angering opposition. UNSC endorses Mkapa's dialogue efforts, calling it the only viable solution. The UNSC endorses the \"inter-Burundian dialogue\" as the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement, expressing deep concerns over the lack of progress in the dialogue and related human rights issues in Burundi. The council intends to take targeted measures against actors threatening peace and security in Burundi. China is a key international partner of Tanzania, with a long history of political relations and economic cooperation, including the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway. China is Tanzania's largest trading partner and a significant security partner. China is a key security and economic partner for Tanzania, with significant investments in infrastructure projects like the natural gas pipeline and the Bagamoyo megaproject. The projects are financed by Chinese firms and Oman's State General Reserve Fund, with China Merchants Holdings-International as the construction manager. The Bagamoyo development is expected to surpass ports in Dar es Salaam in capacity. Tanzania's partnership with China includes major infrastructure projects like a $7.6 billion loan for a railroad, a $500 million housing project, power projects worth over $828 million, and coal and iron ore projects totaling $3 billion. Bilateral trade between Tanzania and China reached $4.67 billion in 2015 but dropped to $4 billion in 2016. Chinese-Tanzanian economic ties have grown exponentially in favor of China, with Chinese exports being almost 12 times larger than imports from Tanzania in 2016. U.S.-Tanzania trade is much lower, totaling $278 million in 2015 and $309 million in 2016. Tanzanian communities have faced backlash from Chinese businesses, leading to displacement and competition issues. Tanzania contributes to regional and international peace efforts, hosting refugees from countries like Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tanzania hosts refugees from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights are located in Arusha. In 2017, Tanzania faced scrutiny for allegedly assisting North Korea in upgrading military systems, potentially violating UN sanctions. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea, including arms embargoes and financial sanctions. Tanzania had \u20ac10.5 million in prohibited military contracts with North Korea. Despite tensions, U.S.-Tanzanian ties have grown, with a contract dispute between TANESCO and Symbion Power being a point of contention. Symbion received over $110 million in MCC awards to improve Tanzania's power sector. The State Department described the U.S.-Tanzania relationship as a partnership with mutual respect and shared values. High-level engagements between the two countries have been cordial, with former President Kikwete being the first African leader to meet with President Obama in 2009. President Obama visited Tanzania in 2013, and President Kikwete attended the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014. The future of U.S.-Tanzanian relations under the Trump Administration remains uncertain. Tanzania's trade relations with the U.S. are positive, with eligibility for trade preferences under AGOA. The East African Community, including Tanzania, has made efforts towards regional integration. Trade between Tanzania and the U.S. reached $310 million in 2016. In 2016, trade between Tanzania and the U.S. reached $310 million, with U.S. imports including precious stones, apparel, coffee, and cashews, and exports including machinery, used clothes, cereals, and aircraft parts. An out-of-cycle review of Tanzania's AGOA eligibility was initiated in June 2017 in response to a petition by the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association regarding a phased-in ban on imports of used clothes. SMART raised concerns about the economic impact of EAC's decision to ban imports of used clothing and footwear, with tariffs causing hardship for the U.S. used clothing industry. At an AGOA eligibility hearing in August 2016, SMART expressed its objections. A petition was filed after an out-of-cycle hearing in July 2017, where various parties testified, including Stephen Lande who argued against revoking Tanzania's AGOA eligibility based on individual objections. USTR officials are expected to provide their recommendations following the review. USTR officials are conducting a review of Tanzania's AGOA eligibility, with recommendations to be submitted to U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer. The results of the review will be announced in early January 2017, alongside routine eligibility announcements for other AGOA countries. In 2012, U.S. and EAC officials agreed to pursue a trade and investment partnership dialogue, leading to discussions on a possible U.S.-EAC Investment Treaty and Trade Facilitation Agreement. The U.S. Department of Commerce opened an office in Tanzania in 2014, and in 2015, a cooperation agreement was signed between the United States and the EAC for technical cooperation. The United States and the East African Community (EAC) signed a cooperation agreement for technical cooperation at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Trade Facilitation, capacity-building, and reducing trade barriers. In late 2016, the U.S. launched a $194 million grant to support the EAC, focusing on institutional capacity-building, regional economic integration, natural resource management, healthcare access in border areas, and trade promotion. This grant complements Trade Africa, an initiative aimed at increasing U.S.-Africa and intra-African trade and investment.

Tanzania is involved in various U.S. assistance programs, including the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) and State Department exchange programs. The Peace Corps has 220 volunteers in Tanzania, focusing on agriculture, education, and health. Health funding comprises the majority of State Department aid, with a significant portion allocated to fighting HIV/AIDS under PEPFAR. Under the Trump Administration's FY2018 proposal, PEPFAR and HIV/AIDS-centered aid would make up 92% of total health spending. Tanzania is a partner country under the Global Health Security Agenda, with a focus on mitigating disease outbreaks. In 2016, Tanzania had a 4.7% adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, with varying rates by region and higher rates in urban areas. Tanzania's HIV prevalence varies greatly by region and gender, with higher rates in urban areas. The country is working towards the UNAIDS \"90-90-90\" target, with progress in diagnosing and treating HIV patients. Tanzania has made strides in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission, with 84% of pregnant women receiving necessary treatment. PEPFAR supports Tanzania in meeting UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets and other HIV/AIDS goals. Challenges include weak health infrastructure and stigma. Tanzania is a focus country under the Trump Administration's PEPFAR Strategy for HIV/AIDS control. Key efforts include prevention of mother-to-child transmission through antiretroviral therapy. PEPFAR in Tanzania focuses on preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV through antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Efforts also include scaling up ART coverage, increasing access to voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV counseling and testing, and condom provision. Gender-differentiated strategies are prioritized, along with pediatric treatment. PEPFAR is shifting towards high-prevalence areas and populations at high risk for HIV/AIDS. Additionally, efforts to combat cervical cancer are supported through the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon partnership. Between FY2011 and 2015, PEPFAR funds in Tanzania were allocated as follows: 29% to prevention, 21% to care, 34% to treatment, and 16% to health governance and system support. Agriculture development aid, a significant focus of U.S. support, saw a decrease from $54 million in FY2017 to $10 million in the FY2018 request under the Trump Administration. This aid, primarily through Feed the Future, aims to improve agricultural productivity, rural infrastructure, staple food and horticulture value chains, nutrition access, and policymaking in Tanzania, with a focus on southern regions. The Feed the Future (FTF) program in Tanzania focuses on southern regions with untapped agricultural potential. Collaboration with U.S. global health programs and participation in initiatives like the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition are key components. U.S. assistance also supports governance, infrastructure development, economic growth, education, and law enforcement. The future of FTF in Tanzania is uncertain.

Additional funding of $9.78 million was provided for feasibility studies for a second compact focused on the power sector. In June 2015, the MCC Board stated that a second compact for Tanzania's power sector would not be approved until the government made progress on energy sector reform commitments. In March 2016, negotiations for a $472 million second compact were suspended due to concerns over the government's actions in Zanzibar elections and lack of respect for freedom of expression. The Cybercrimes Act implementation in Tanzania has raised concerns about freedom of expression and association, particularly in relation to the elections in Zanzibar. U.S. security cooperation with Tanzania has increased since the 1998 embassy bombing, focusing on peacekeeping support. However, funding for military cooperation initiatives like APRRP is uncertain under the Trump Administration. Tanzanian troops have received training under the U.S. Global Peace Operations Initiative. The U.S. provides security assistance to Tanzania through various programs like GPOI, ACOTA, IMET, and PREACT to support peacekeeping, military professionalization, and counterterrorism efforts.

U.S. law enforcement training focuses on detecting illegal drugs and ivory at ports and airports. Tanzania is expected to remain stable but economically challenged, with potential for increased political tension due to growing multiparty competition. Access to information through mobile phones may drive demand for political change and improved governance. Growing access to information, particularly through mobile phones, may lead to increased exposure to current events and global norms, contributing to market growth and improved social services in Tanzania. Foreign assistance, including from the United States, along with better infrastructure and government services, are expected to boost economic activity, production, and trade, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for Tanzanians. The United States is likely to continue supporting Tanzania's democratic system and socioeconomic development, making it a key development partner in the region. Tanzania is seen as a key development partner in East and Southern Africa."
