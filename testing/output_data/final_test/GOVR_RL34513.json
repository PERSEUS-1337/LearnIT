    "content": "The Earth's surface has warmed by 1.1 to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, with increased precipitation and changes in ocean temperatures, wind patterns, extreme weather events, and melting glaciers. The IPCC declared in 2007 that climate warming is unequivocal and mostly caused by human activities. Without reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's climate will continue to warm to unprecedented levels, posing risks to human and ecological systems. The urgency to address climate change is driving policymakers, industry leaders, NGOs, and citizens to take concrete actions. This includes identifying and evaluating policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to observed or expected changes. Domestic efforts to combat climate change are gaining momentum. In the 110th Congress, numerous bills have been proposed to address climate change research and policy, including a bill to cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the Administration must consider regulating greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. President George W. Bush proposed a national goal for U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2025. States and localities have also implemented their own plans and regulations. Primary concerns include costs, which could reach trillions of dollars over the coming decades. The debate internationally has revived over how nations may commit to mitigation, adaptation, and technology actions beyond 2012, aiming to produce a post-2012 decision by the end of 2009. U.S. domestic policy development could influence international cooperation, with potentially high stakes for mitigating human-induced climate change. The report introduces the reader to fundamentals of the climate change issue, summarizing current understandings and controversies. It also provides an update on domestic and international policies and outlines the policy toolbox available to policymakers. The Earth's surface has warmed since the Industrial Revolution, with most warming occurring since the 1970s. Over the past century, regions have experienced changes in precipitation levels due to heightened greenhouse gas concentrations. The IPCC declared in 2007 that climate warming is unequivocal, with observable impacts on natural systems. Human activities have been recognized as a potential cause of Earth's warming through the release of GHGs into the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases (GHGs) trapping heat in the atmosphere, warming the Earth to habitable temperatures. Solar variability has contributed to some global temperature changes, but most warming since the 1970s is due to human activities releasing GHGs, such as fossil fuel use and land clearing. Further research is needed to quantify other potential influences on climate change. The greenhouse effect is primarily caused by human activities such as the use of fossil fuels and land clearing, which release greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. These GHGs, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap the Sun's radiation and raise the Earth's temperature. Some scientists disagree on the extent of temperature increase from projected GHG concentrations. GHGs can persist in the atmosphere for decades to thousands of years, leading to global warming effects that last for extended periods. The long atmospheric residence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) leads to global warming effects that persist for decades to millennia. There is a lag between policies to reduce GHG emissions and their full impact on the climate system. Concentrations of specific GHGs have increased since the Industrial Revolution, including CO2 by over 33%, methane by about 150%, and nitrous oxide by 16%. Human-related GHG emissions are partially offset by carbon removals and sequestration in forests and agriculture. In 2005, human-related carbon removals and sequestration in forests and soils offset about 11% of U.S. GHG emissions. CO2 constituted 74% of global human GHG emissions, with China likely surpassing the U.S. as the leading emitter. Developing countries' emissions are expected to grow faster than industrialized countries. Top 10 emitting countries contributed 60% of global GHG emissions in 2005. Scientists project that rising GHG emissions will likely raise the global average temperature by at least 1.5 o Celsius above 1990 levels by the end of the 21st Century. There is a possibility of temperature increases of 2.5 to 3.2 o C, with a small chance of exceeding 5 o C. This would surpass the highest temperature levels experienced since the emergence of human civilizations. Future climate change may advance smoothly or sporadically, with regions experiencing fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, and extreme events. Most regions will warm, some becoming wetter while others drier. Sea levels could rise by 7-23 inches by 2100. Common expectations include more heat waves, droughts, decreased cold episodes, and increased summer warming. Precipitation may become more intense, increasing flooding risks. Impacts of climate change include both beneficial and adverse effects, with risks of abrupt changes increasing as global temperatures rise. Some populations may successfully adapt and profit from new opportunities, while others could face livelihood losses. Climate change will result in ecological disruptions and changes in species ranges, potentially leading to extinctions. Disappearances of regional environments pose risks to species, emphasizing the need to reduce human interference with the climate system. The study projects that a significant percentage of Earth's land areas may experience new climates or lose existing climates by 2100 due to climate change. This poses a risk to species with narrow distributions and could lead to extinctions. Conservation efforts may need to adapt to address these challenges in biodiversity hotspots. Some people value ecological impacts based on services natural systems provide to humans, while others emphasize ethical perspectives like stewardship of Earth's resources. Differences in values lead to controversies in public debates on climate change. The 110th Congress has proposed bills to increase research on climate change impacts and adaptation options. Some bills proposed by the 110th Congress focus on impacts of climate change and options for adaptation, ranging from repealing the Global Change Research Act of 1990 to specific concerns like drinking water or wildlife. There is uncertainty about GHG emissions, climate change, and risks, leading to differing views on reducing emissions. Experts suggest targets to cap GHG concentrations in the atmosphere to limit future risks. Current CO2 concentrations are over 380 parts per million (ppm), with future projections ranging from about 550 ppm to almost 1000 ppm by 2100. Debate surrounds stabilizing GHG concentrations at levels of 450, 550, or 650 ppm by 2100, with some advocating for lower targets. The \"Stern Report\" suggests that stabilizing at or below 550 ppm CO2 equivalents would require global action. Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at or below 550 ppm CO2 e would require global emissions to peak in the next 10-20 years and then fall at a rate of at least 1-3% per year. By 2050, global emissions would need to be around 25% below current levels. To stabilize at 450 ppm CO2 e, global emissions would need to peak in the next 10 years and then fall at more than 5% per year, reaching 70% below current levels by 2050. Technologies exist today to begin this trajectory, but new technologies will be needed in the longer term. Greenhouse gas control programs raise concerns about costs. Many studies show that costs of greenhouse gas mitigation may be influenced by the stringency of reductions, timing, and program flexibility. Designing flexibility in mitigation programs can significantly lower costs, allowing for trading of emission permits, generation of emission reduction credits, and banking or borrowing of permits. Modeled cost estimates vary due to differences in models, assumptions about economic and energy growth rates, technology costs, and program design. Costs of greenhouse gas mitigation are influenced by reduction stringency, timing, and program flexibility. Designing flexible programs can lower costs through trading permits, generating credits, and banking permits. Modeled cost estimates vary due to economic assumptions, technology costs, and program design. Mitigation efforts can also support other policy objectives like energy security and reducing health costs of pollution. The costs of greenhouse gas mitigation are influenced by reduction stringency, timing, and program flexibility. Designing flexible programs can lower costs through trading permits, generating credits, and banking permits. Mitigation efforts can also support other policy objectives like improving energy security and reducing health costs of pollution. Co-benefits such as these are discussed in a later section. Critical to policymakers are the distributions of costs on specific industry sectors, regions, and income groups, as well as concerns regarding trade and competitiveness impacts of GHG reductions. Low income populations may be disproportionately impacted by policies to limit GHG emissions due to higher energy bills and lack of control over energy dependence. Some groups, like manufacturers of high-efficiency vehicles, may benefit from GHG controls. Equity issues in policy design could drive costs up but lead to more acceptable distributional effects. Climate change policy affects various sectors and can have trade-offs in terms of costs and benefits. GHG emissions are linked to multiple sectors, impacting national policy objectives like public well-being, energy services, food supply, and natural resource management. Various technologies and policies can address these objectives, with energy efficiency investments being a cost-effective option. Cross-issue analysis can help identify win-win choices and avoid conflicts, but may be under-utilized due to resource constraints or disciplinary barriers. Efficient GHG reduction legislation could cut U.S. emissions by 25% by 2030 at a cost of around 0.3%. GHG emissions could be reduced by 25% by 2030, costing 0.3% to 3.8% of GDP. The effectiveness of the \"Lieberman-Warner\" bill in stimulating technological advance is debated. The cost analyses of bill S. 2191 are debated between the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) and the American Council for Capital Formation/National Association of Manufacturers (ACCF/NAM). CATF expresses confidence in the bill's provisions and models, while ACCF/NAM is skeptical about the availability of technology and market mechanisms to achieve emission targets. This difference in assumptions leads to varying cost estimates, with CATF estimating a reduction of -0.9% of GDP per capita in 2030, compared to ACCF/NAM's estimates of -2.6% to -2.7%. The Environmental Protection Agency's analysis of S. 2191 (S. 3036) on international trade found no \"leakage\" if developing countries maintain their 2015 GHG emission levels by 2025 and return to 2000 levels by 2050. In a worst-case scenario, developing countries' GHG emissions could increase by 1%, leading to potential U.S. emission leakage rates of 11% in 2030 and 8% in 2050. U.S. exports were projected to decline, with uncertain impacts on imports. The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 suggests that stabilizing GHG concentrations at 590 to 710 ppm could have small costs or gains for economic growth. Lower concentrations like 450 ppm could dampen growth, with costs less than 3% of Gross World Product projected for 2010-2030. Policy choices would determine how costs are distributed globally, and adaptation efforts are seen as necessary due to current and future climate changes. Adaptation costs are essential due to current and future climate changes attributed to past GHG emissions. Economic analyses often overlook these costs, impacting economies and non-market processes. Comparing the benefits and costs of climate change actions is challenging due to inadequate data and tools. Benefits analysis is less emphasized in the United States compared to other countries. Studies vary in estimating the benefits of mitigating GHG emissions, with few integrating both mitigation and climate change impacts. Few studies integrate both mitigation and impacts of climate change, facing challenges in quantifying non-market effects and applying values to affected nations. Most use GDP as a metric for impacts, which is inadequate for measuring well-being. Assessing all ramifications of climate change is complex, with potential political instabilities in developing countries. Climate change in developing countries could worsen political instabilities and threaten U.S. security. Predicting the extent of added security risks is uncertain due to the unprecedented future climate projections. Improved analysis and consideration of uncertainties are needed for more informed decision-making. Economists generally agree that while short-term climate change may have some benefits, long-term impacts would lead to decreased benefits and increased damages. Most economists agree that long-term climate change will likely damage global economic growth and incur trillions of dollars in costs. However, well-designed policies could have modest costs and save trillions of dollars over the next century. The Stern Report, commissioned by the UK government in 2006, provides a comprehensive review of the benefits of mitigating climate change but has faced criticism from some economists. The Stern Report highlights the importance of value-laden choices in climate change policy, with estimates of damages ranging from 0 to 20% of global consumption. Various studies on the costs of projected climate change in the United States have been conducted, but face challenges in applying economic and ethical methods to the issue. A recent review by the University of Maryland's Center for Integrative Environmental Research highlighted key lessons on the economic impacts of climate change in the United States. It stated that impacts will be unevenly distributed, negative impacts will outweigh benefits for most sectors, and public sector budgets will be strained. Regional studies project costs in the tens of millions to hundreds of billions of dollars through the 21st Century. The economic costs of climate change in the United States are projected to be much higher than currently reported, with few studies attempting to quantify and compare these impacts. Studies recognize uncertainty and methodological questions, with potential considerable costs across market sectors. Projected climate change in the U.S. could lead to significant economic costs or temporary benefits by 2100, depending on pessimistic or optimistic scenarios. Under pessimistic assumptions, real GDP could be 0.6-1.9% lower, with even larger reductions under a \"high and drier\" climate scenario. Negative impacts on GDP worsen over time in pessimistic scenarios, while optimistic scenarios show a potential increase of 0.7-1.0% in GDP by 2100. The impacts of climate change on the U.S. economy could vary depending on different scenarios. Studies suggest that climate change may provide modest benefits initially, but these benefits may diminish over time. Adaptation plays a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change, especially for vulnerable populations with limited resources. Mitigating climate change through GHG reduction measures can have multiple benefits, such as improving energy security, addressing the world food crisis, reducing pollution, and conserving natural resources and biodiversity. These \"co-benefits\" can enhance the value of climate change mitigation efforts, although there may be trade-offs with other national or local goals that can be minimized through thoughtful policy design. For example, increasing biofuel use to reduce GHG emissions could impact food prices and security, highlighting the importance of considering the interconnectedness of different issues. Climate change will impact food security, with some regions benefiting while others suffer. Migration and adaptation will be necessary for some, while others may lose livelihoods or lives. Mitigating GHG emissions could also have effects on industries like coal production. The debate over climate change policies includes concerns about distributional inequities and the lack of research on these issues. Developing countries now contribute the majority of GHG emissions globally, requiring reductions from all major countries. Industries fear trade impacts if competitors do not have similar GHG reduction requirements. In the United States, concerns about leadership, sovereignty, and GHG concentration targets are part of the debate. Legislative actions are needed to reduce U.S. GHG emissions and create a coherent strategy. Internationally, countries aim to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. The determination of what is considered \"dangerous\" is a political decision, not solely based on scientific findings. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by most countries in 1997, sets legally binding GHG targets for 38 industrialized countries. The United States signed but did not ratify it due to concerns about science uncertainty, high costs, and lack of commitments from developing countries. President Bush announced a policy to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% from 2002 to 2012. The U.S. aimed to reduce emissions intensity by 18% from 2002 to 2012, exceeding previous trends. The UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol operate under \"common but differentiated responsibilities.\" Nations differ on post-Kyoto steps, with industrialized nations concerned about economic competitiveness and developing nations prioritizing poverty alleviation. The \"Bali Action Plan\" was established in December 2007 to negotiate the next round of international commitments under the UNFCCC. President Bush announced the formation of major economies meetings in May 2007 to develop a post-2012 framework. President Bush proposed a multilateral \"clean technology fund\" of $3 billion to address climate change and stimulate international investments in clean energy. Japan also proposed a similar fund of $10 billion. President Bush announced a national goal to halt increases in U.S. emissions of GHGs by 2025, with emissions declining thereafter through regulatory measures and market incentives. The United States would be willing to include this plan in a future international agreement. Some stakeholders criticize the new Bush policy for proposing emission caps, while others see it as insufficient. Current federal climate policies offer incentives to reduce GHG emissions, such as tax breaks for efficient vehicles and building improvements. Federal programs provide information and assistance to businesses and universities to quantify and reduce emissions. Some GHG reductions are achieved through existing regulations on energy efficiency, methane emissions, and other controls. Large programs focus on developing new technologies to further reduce GHG emissions. Experts argue that voluntary efforts and existing incentives may not be enough to prevent \"dangerous\" climate change. The US and EU have proposed an agreement to eliminate barriers to environmental technologies and services in WTO negotiations. The proposal aims to lower costs and increase access to clean energy technologies, with most of the $6.4 billion in U.S. federal funding for climate change activities in FY2008 allocated to research and development. Tax incentives are expected to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 billion in FY2008. Congress is under pressure to address climate change risks, avoid conflicting state requirements, provide certainty for investors, and enhance U.S. competitiveness in clean energy markets. Numerous bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress to tackle different aspects of climate change. Members in the 110th Congress have introduced various bills addressing climate change, including research, cap-and-trade programs, emissions taxes, GHG reporting, and adaptation planning. Two key pieces of legislation, P.L. 110-140 and P.L. 110-161, have been enacted to increase climate change research efforts, improve vehicle fuel economies, and regulate GHG emissions. Annual appropriations directly impact federal climate change programs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is directed to develop regulations for a mandatory GHG reporting program. The Lieberman-Warner bill aims for economy-wide GHG reductions and is set for Senate consideration in June 2008. States have implemented GHG mitigation policies, with some establishing mandatory emission limits and controls on CO2 emissions. States are implementing controls on CO2 emissions from specific sources and working together to create regional schemes for cap and trade of GHG emissions. This complex landscape of state, local, and regional initiatives may push the federal government to establish a national regulatory strategy. Litigation related to climate change has also increased, with the Supreme Court ruling in 2007 that the EPA must regulate CO2 and other GHGs from motor vehicles. Further legal challenges may prompt action from the Executive Branch using various environmental laws. The government is considering various paths to address climate change, including legal actions and international law claims. There is a growing consensus on the need for comprehensive solutions from the political branches, rather than narrowly targeted litigation. Legislators are deliberating on how to address climate change, with some preferring existing research and voluntary programs while others consider additional policy tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and risks. Part Three of this report outlines various policy tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate risks to the economy, specific populations, and natural systems. These tools include regulatory measures, distribution of revenues from GHG programs, non-regulatory tools to enhance market efficiency, incentives for technological innovation, strategies for economic transition, instruments for international cooperation, and tools for climate change adaptation. Proponents argue that a combination of these tools would be more effective in achieving results than any single tool alone. Most experts agree that the most economically efficient way to reduce GHG emissions is to put a price on emissions that reflects the costs to others. This can be done through traditional regulation or market mechanisms. Regulatory controls, such as setting emission performance standards or requiring specific technologies, have proven effective over decades. Compliance costs could have been reduced with prioritized strategies. The compliance costs for reducing GHG emissions could have been lower if strategies focused on cost-effectiveness and flexibility. Regulations, while effective, can be difficult to adjust and may not always achieve emission reduction targets at the lowest cost. Market mechanisms proposed in the 110th Congress aim to increase efficiency by allowing for lower overall costs in reducing emissions. Market mechanisms such as GHG taxes and cap-and-trade systems offer flexibility in emission reductions, with taxes ensuring price certainty and cap-and-trade systems guaranteeing emission reductions. Both mechanisms can generate significant revenues, raising questions about revenue allocation. Emission fees or taxes are seen as economically efficient for reducing emissions, with fees charged based on total emissions. Various design options exist, such as charging fees only on emissions above designated rates by source types. Flexibility in when emissions reductions are made could be allowed, but the main flexibility lies in the source's decision to reduce emissions or pay taxes. Economists generally support emission fees or taxes as the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In cap-and-trade programs, regulators set an overall cap on emissions and allocate allowances to individual sources. Entities can sell unneeded allowances, while those exceeding their allowances must reduce emissions or buy additional allowances. This system allows flexibility in emission reductions and includes options for international credits or offsets. International credits or offsets can help minimize costs by allowing reductions to occur in other countries at a lower cost. Banking and borrowing of allowances provide flexibility for entities to save or borrow against future allocations. Designing a cap-and-trade program involves resolving questions about setting the cap, covering sources, and allowing offsets from non-covered sources and other countries. This section discusses how to allocate GHG reduction requirements and set prices for allowances in a cap-and-trade system. Policy makers must determine who is responsible for reducing emissions, which affects who pays for reductions. Allowances can be given away, sold, or auctioned, transferring wealth between different groups. This transfer of wealth could exceed the economic cost of reducing emissions. The allocation of GHG allowances in a cap-and-trade system is crucial, as it can involve transferring wealth between different groups. Selling allowances rather than giving them away can increase efficiency and reduce distortions in incentives. This approach, including auctions, can be similar to an emission fee or tax program. Many proposals suggest a combination of giving away and auctioning allowances to various entities. GHG allowances in a cap-and-trade program are treated as a market commodity, with prices subject to volatility based on various factors. To control costs, some advocate for a \"safety valve\" on prices, where additional allowances could be released through auctions or fixed fee sales if prices exceed a certain level for a period of time. This would limit overall program costs and GHG emissions. Some stakeholders suggest setting a price floor for GHG allowances in the market to stimulate technological innovation and ensure a minimum value for services provided by new technologies. This would also generate public revenues through taxes or auction sales. Public revenues generated through taxes, sales, or auctions could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars per year. The key policy issue is deciding how to use these revenues, which could include offsetting other taxes, funding programs to reduce transition costs, addressing distributional concerns, or supporting legislation with wider public appeal. The use of public revenues generated through taxes, sales, or auctions is a key policy issue in supporting legislation with wider public appeal. Complementary non-regulatory policies and technical assistance programs can help achieve GHG reductions at the lowest possible costs. Public information and education campaigns, along with risk-sharing policy tools like loan guarantees and tax incentives, can support the commercialization of more efficient products with fewer GHG emissions. Achieving deep GHG reductions would require significant changes in energy use and supply, but perceived risks can hinder consumer and investor adoption of new technologies. The cost of reducing GHG emissions depends on developing and deploying improved technologies. Policy tools can stimulate demand for new technologies through technology-forcing regulations. Economists prefer price incentives to stimulate innovation. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended tax credits to individuals and businesses for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy to accelerate technology deployment. Federal policy tools include subsidies for research and development to mitigate climate change. Federal appropriations of billions of dollars have been enacted in recent years to stimulate more efficient energy technologies, including renewable, nuclear, and clean coal technologies. These subsidies can take the form of tax credits, cost-sharing grants, direct investments, loan guarantees, and technology awards. Government procurement policies can also drive technological development forward by setting challenging standards for performance and guaranteeing purchase of less-emitting technologies at an attractive price. Some experts propose a \"Manhattan Project\"-like federal research effort to advance technologies emitting fewer GHGs. Policy tools like incentives for training scientists in GHG mitigation fields could promote technological advancement. Ancillary effects of policy choices, like a GHG cap-and-trade program with a cost ceiling, may impact technology incentives. The maximum price of GHG allowances can discourage investors from taking technology development risks. Price floors may reduce risks for technology investors. Costs to mitigate GHG emissions are high due to reliance on fossil fuels and petroleum-dependent vehicles. Policy mechanisms can help transition the economy to low-GHG emissions. The private sector is concerned about the international competitiveness and trade impacts of GHG reductions in the United States. Policy tools could be applied to manage reductions in GHG emissions, including trading, banking, and borrowing of allowances, market facilitation tools, investment in infrastructure for emerging technologies, and regulatory regimes prepared for new technologies. Policy tools that could be applied to manage reductions in GHG emissions include border tax adjustments, \"international reserve\" allowances, negotiating with WTO Members, and working multilaterally to have GHG emission controls applied. The effectiveness of U.S. policies to address climate change will depend on collaboration with other countries, especially the largest emitters like Japan and the European Union. The United States, China, and other large developing countries have not committed to quantified GHG reductions, while Russia's position beyond 2012 is uncertain. The U.S. can use various policy tools to encourage effective GHG control internationally and avoid WTO challenges. The United States can utilize various policy tools to promote global GHG reductions, including leadership, strategic leverage, capacity building, financial assistance, and research and technological contributions. Additionally, there is a focus on legislative proposals to enhance understanding of climate change impacts and facilitate effective adaptation. Research to improve future climate change characterization and variability is part of the policy toolbox for efficient adaptation. Policy tools to address future climate change include public information dissemination, development of practical tools for decision-makers, financial incentives to reduce risks, improved emergency planning, and acquisition of key assets for long-term adaptation. Policy tools for addressing climate change are relatively undeveloped compared to GHG mitigation efforts. With the current focus on reducing GHG emissions, policymakers may need to decide on legislating a climate strategy and what form it should take. They must consider the certainty of human-induced climate change risks and how to balance them with reasonable costs in designing a domestic policy package. The report discusses designing a climate policy that balances risks of climate change with reasonable costs, interacts with international negotiations, and promotes adaptation.
