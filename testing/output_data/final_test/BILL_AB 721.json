    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 69800 of the Education Code in California is amended to require postsecondary educational institutions to provide information on flexible repayment options for federal student loans and the availability of federal direct loans regardless of income in their financial aid materials. Federal direct loans are available to students regardless of income. Institutions must clearly distinguish private loans from federal loans in financial aid awards, stating whether the rate is fixed or variable. Private student loan lenders can offer variable interest rates that can change over time. Private student loans have varying interest rates and fees, with the interest rate possibly depending on the borrower's credit rating. Students should determine the details of the private student loan in their financial aid package before accepting it. They can contact the lender or their school's financial aid office for any questions. If the institution provides a list of private loan lenders, they must also provide general information about the loans available and disclose the basis for each lender's inclusion on the list, emphasizing that students have the freedom to choose any lender. Within 12 months of a completed academic year, institutions must disclose the number of students who received a certificate, associate\u2019s degree, or bachelor\u2019s degree. The institution must report the number and percentage of students who borrowed through any student loan program for each type of credential, along with the total principal borrowed for each type of credential. The institution is required to report the number and percentage of students who borrowed federal student loans for each type of credential, along with the total principal borrowed for each type. Before certifying a borrower's eligibility for a private student loan, educational institutions must provide information on unused state and federal financial assistance to the student. This includes federal student loan moneys available to the student. An institution not participating in federal student loan programs must inform students about their non-participation and provide information on federal loans available at other institutions. California Community Colleges are encouraged to comply with Section 69800 of the Education Code."
