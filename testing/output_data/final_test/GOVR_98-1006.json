    "content": "In recent years, efforts have been made to maintain health care benefits for military retirees. Some retirees argue that the reduction in military medical infrastructure has limited their access to care, leading to claims of broken promises regarding free healthcare for life in military facilities. Recent court decisions and congressional reports have not supported claims of free healthcare for life in military facilities for retirees and dependents. In response, bills like H.R. 602 and S. 407 have been introduced in Congress to expand military healthcare options and fulfill promises to retired members of the uniformed services. Recent court decisions and congressional reports have not supported claims of free healthcare for life in military facilities for retirees and dependents. Congress expanded military retiree health care benefits via the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act, providing active duty personnel with entitlement to military health care. However, retirees and their dependents have no statutory entitlement to such care, leaving the military services with full discretion in determining when and how to provide care. The military services have full discretion in determining when retirees and their dependents will receive care from military treatment facilities. Tricare is the health benefit plan for military beneficiaries, consisting of Prime, Extra, and Standard coverage options. Retirees can seek care from civilian providers under Tricare or Medicare if eligible. Military retirees and their dependents have options for healthcare coverage, including Tricare Prime, Extra, Standard, and Medicare. With the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act, retirees over 64 can participate in Tricare with Medicare Part B, known as \"Tricare for Life.\" Congress has the authority to create and regulate these healthcare benefits. The military does not have the authority to provide \"free health care for life at military facilities\" for retirees without explicit authorization from Congress. Congressional history and legal precedent show that only Congress can create such benefits. Military health care has historically been paid for by active duty members since 1799. In 1799, Congress enacted legislation for military healthcare, later extending care to dependents and retirees. In 1956, a law allowed retired military members to receive medical and dental care upon request. In 1966, Medicare was created to provide healthcare for individuals over 65 and disabled persons. Congress created the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) to provide healthcare for retired military personnel and their dependents who were too young for Medicare. CHAMPUS was a fee-for-service benefit with cost sharing, not related to care from military medical facilities. Many believe they were promised free health care for life at military facilities, but written documentation of such promises is lacking. Military recruiting literature mentions health care for service members and their families during service and after 20 years of Federal service for retirement benefits. However, it does not specify free health care or care through military facilities. Military retirees do receive lifetime benefits through Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Military retirees receive promised lifetime benefits via MTFs, Tricare, and Medicare earned from their federal military service. A 1991 CRS report noted that while there was no legal entitlement for care, retirees and dependents usually had access to care in military health facilities, which was a useful recruiting tool. Many military personnel and retirees mistakenly believed they were entitled to free healthcare for life in military facilities, but Rear Admiral Koenig clarified that there is no legal guarantee for this. The benefits promised were often misinterpreted, with medical care for life being available to beneficiaries through defined programs. The Department of Defense clarified that free medical care for retirees in military facilities is a privilege, not an absolute right, as many had assumed. Federal courts have consistently ruled that claims of a promise for free healthcare have no legal standing, dismissing lawsuits seeking such benefits. The Department of Defense clarified that free medical care for retirees in military facilities is a privilege, not an absolute right. Federal courts have consistently ruled that claims of a promise for free healthcare have no legal standing. Regulations guaranteeing lifetime medical care for retirees and their dependents under [10United States Code sec. 1074(b)] would be inconsistent with the statute and therefore invalid. Federal courts have consistently ruled that retirees are not entitled to medical care as a matter of right, and promises of free healthcare for life made by recruiters are not legally binding. Federal courts have ruled that retirees are not entitled to free medical care for life as promised by recruiters, as it does not create a binding contract with the government. The 1922 Manual of the Medical Department of the United States Navy did not create a right to free unconditional lifetime medical care for retirees. The retirees have not shown they have a right to the health care they claim was \"taken\" by the government. The Coalition of Retired Military Veterans appealed their case on December 8, 1999. The Coalition of Retired Military Veterans appealed their case to the Supreme Court on December 8, 1999. The Supreme Court denied the petition to review the lower court ruling on April 17, 2000. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court ruling on February 8, 2001, stating that the government breached its contract with retirees by failing to provide health care benefits. The case was remanded for a determination of damages, but the ruling only applied to two named plaintiffs, not all military retirees. The Appeals Court vacated the judgment and agreed to rehear the appeal en banc to determine the validity of promises of free lifetime care. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that there was no actual authority for the recruiters' promises, leading to the plaintiffs' claim failing as a matter of law. The Supreme Court denied the petition to review the case. Media reports vary on the existence of free health care for life. Some former recruiters claim to have made promises of free health care for life, but unauthorized promises do not constitute a contractual obligation. Despite no legal entitlement, some argue for a moral or popular opinion-based obligation to fulfill such promises. Hon. Stephen Joseph stated in 1995 that there is no legal fine print guaranteeing free medical care. The subcommittee in 1995 discussed the lack of contractual obligation for free medical care guaranteed for life, despite claims made by recruiters. The courts and administrators do not enforce these claims as they could interfere with Congress's role in determining compensation and benefits for the armed forces. Despite extensive documentation and court decisions proving otherwise, the belief in legally guaranteed \"free lifetime care\" at military facilities persists. Congressional reports have addressed the issue, with recent legislative actions supporting additional benefits for military retirees. The Department of Defense faces significant challenges in providing lifetime care despite the lack of authorization for such benefits. The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense's constraints in meeting expected benefits for participants in the Military Health Service System, especially for military retirees over age 65. The nation fulfills its obligation to provide care through Medicare, as expressed in existing statutes and the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act. Congress acknowledges the need for quality healthcare for retirees in findings. Many retired military personnel believe they were promised lifetime healthcare in exchange for 20 or more years of service. Military retirees are unable to use their employer-provided healthcare at or after 65 years of age. The Department of Defense's reduction in healthcare infrastructure has made it increasingly difficult for military retirees to access healthcare. Congress recognizes the importance of quality healthcare as a critical recruiting incentive for the Armed Forces. The Congress acknowledges a moral obligation to provide quality healthcare to retired military personnel entitled to benefits. Legislation has been proposed to address healthcare availability issues for retirees within two years. Representative Jo Ann Emerson introduced a bill to establish a task force for Medicare-eligible military retirees. A task force was proposed to study promises made to military members regarding health care coverage after separation from the Uniformed Services. The task force would determine the extent to which these promises were binding. The legislation was reintroduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses, with Congress recognizing the need for action. The legislation introduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses aimed to expand military retiree health care options by including access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It highlighted findings regarding medical care entitlements for military personnel who served after June 7, 1956. The Department of Defense views military retiree health care as permissive, not an entitlement. Legislation in the 108th Congress expanded health care benefits for military retirees, including an enhanced pharmacy benefit and Tricare coverage for those age 65 and older. H.R. 602 was introduced in 2005 to further address military retiree health care. H.R. 602/S. 407, introduced in the 109th Congress, is similar to previous bills in the 108th Congress. The bills aim to address military retiree health care, with some opposition citing inconsistencies with official military health care history. Section 1 of the bill provides the title \"Keep Our Promises to America's Military Retirees Act,\" while Section 2 outlines various findings related to the issue. The first finding states that no statutory health care program existed for uniformed services members who entered service before December 7, 1956, and retired after 20 years. Congress had previously allocated funds for nonactive duty military medical benefits. On June 7, 1956, P.L. 84-569 became law, providing care for active duty personnel's dependents in military and civilian facilities. However, a House provision for retired members and their dependents was rejected. The law authorized discretionary health care at military medical facilities for military retirees and their dependents, putting into statute the previous policy of permissive care. Recruiters and officers used tactics that led members to believe they would receive fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement. Opponents argued that promises beyond what was afforded in law were unsustainable. The Findings highlight the case of Schism v. United States where the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected retirees' claims for lifetime health care promised by recruiters. The Court expressed sympathy for the retired officers of the World War II and Korean War era who served with the understanding of receiving free health care for life. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected retirees' claims for lifetime health care promised by recruiters. The retirees were promised full free health care for life, but the court upheld the judgment against their breach-of-contract claim as Congress never ratified or acquiesced to this promise. The government lawyers affirmed that promises were made, and suggested that Congress may address the moral claims raised by the retirees in the future. The government lawyers affirmed that promises were made, but did not confirm the specific promise of \"free lifetime care at military facilities.\" Courts have rejected retiree claims based on the lack of authority to make such promises, stating that only Congress can fulfill promises made by recruiters in good faith. The court found that Congress has the power to provide benefits to military retirees, acknowledging that promises made without congressional authority do not create a contractual obligation. Statutes enacted in 1956 allowed certain retirees to receive medical and dental care in uniformed services facilities. The court officially put into law the space- and service-available provisions for eligible retirees, despite prior promises of fully paid lifetime health care. Opponents argue that recruiting materials did not guarantee such benefits. The reduction in military medical facilities has made access to space-available health care difficult for many military retirees. Critics argue that while access has decreased, retirees still have other government-sponsored health care benefits available to them. The lack of adequate health care for retired members of the military is impacting their ability to recommend military service as a career choice. Critics argue that recruitment challenges post-9/11 are more related to war hazards than retirement benefits. Young people considering joining the military are not focused on retirement benefits, but concerns about this could affect career retention. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act extended TRICARE coverage to Medicare-eligible military retirees age 65 and older, but did not address the healthcare needs of retirees under 65. Critics argue that the law expanded healthcare coverage for retirees, with some claiming it to be the most generous benefits offered by the Federal government. They assert that the law did not decrease benefits for retirees under 65 already established in law. Critics suggest fulfilling promises made to WWII and Korean War era recruits by providing high-quality healthcare for all retired uniformed service members. The Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act extended TRICARE coverage to Medicare-eligible military retirees age 65 and older. Critics argue that healthcare benefits for retirees have significantly increased in recent decades, fulfilling promises made to WWII and Korean War era recruits. H.R. 602 / S. 407 would provide all military members and retirees with access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The bill proposes to expand the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to include all \"eligible beneficiaries,\" such as retired uniformed services members and certain former spouses and dependents. This would broaden the program beyond the current demonstration project's limitations. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is proposed to include retired uniformed services members, former spouses, and dependents. The terms \"dependent\" and \"member of family\" have different definitions, potentially causing confusion. \"Dependent\" includes spouses, children under 21, and full-time students, while \"member of family\" only includes spouses and dependent children under 22. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program may raise questions about coverage for 21-year-old children not enrolled in higher education institutions, as the definition of \"member of family\" only includes spouses and dependent children under 22. This could potentially exclude 22-year-olds enrolled in higher education institutions from coverage. The bill allows \"eligible beneficiaries\" to enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan for self-only or family coverage, including dependents. They would not be eligible for military-provided health care plans like TRICARE but could receive care in military facilities billed to the FEHBP. Eligible beneficiaries can participate in open season and change plans like other FEHBP participants. The government would contribute the same amount towards FEHBP coverage for eligible beneficiaries as for employees. Premiums would be determined separately, and a system would be developed to reimburse for health care costs not covered by FEHBP but by TRICARE Standard. A previous demonstration project for military retirees to access FEHBP benefits had low participation and expired in 2002. The expired demonstration project allowed eligible beneficiaries to receive reimbursement for pharmacy benefits from a non-TRICARE network pharmacy if they had physical or medical constraints preventing access to a TRICARE network pharmacy. The bill would amend the Social Security Act to provide eligible individuals with free Medicare Part B, including certain military personnel and their spouses. This change would not increase premiums for other Part B participants or subject this group to income-based premium adjustments. The bill proposes to waive penalties and premiums for military retirees aged 65 and over who enrolled in the TRICARE for Life program from 2001-2004, effective January 2005. This provision would not increase Federal expenditures and would provide rebates to eligible individuals for any premiums paid after January 1, 2005. The cost of military medical care has doubled since 2001, reaching $50 billion a year, with at least 75% of benefits going to veterans and retirees. A new plan for military retirees, TRICARE for Life, will cost at least $100 billion over the next decade, posing a long-term problem for the Pentagon. Efforts are being made to raise Tricare fees and copayments for retirees. The Department of Defense is considering raising Tricare fees and copayments for retirees under 65 and their families due to rising medical costs. Total spending for the Military Health System has doubled in the past four years, with a significant portion going towards individuals no longer on active duty or their family members. Efforts are being made to control the growth in costs. The Department of Defense is considering raising Tricare fees for retirees and their families to control rising medical costs. Annual enrollment fees for Tricare Prime may triple by October 2008, with fees doubling for under-65 enlisted retirees. Additionally, Tricare Standard users may see increased deductibles and a new annual enrollment fee. All Tricare fees and co-payments would be indexed to medical inflation in the future. The Department of Defense is considering raising Tricare fees for retirees and their families to control rising medical costs. By 2024, military medical costs are projected to grow by about 80 percent in real terms. The greatest budget risk facing the military, other than the cost of war, is health care costs. The report suggests increasing fees and co-payments to boost out-of-pocket user costs to the level of civilian HMOs. The proposal aims to increase Tricare fees for retirees and their families to control rising medical costs. Even with the increases, military retirees would still pay a fraction of the annual costs that many civilians pay. The Military Officers Association of America opposes health care cost-shifting from the government to military beneficiaries and aims to increase health care access by reducing deterrents to provider participation. The proposal aims to increase Tricare fees for retirees and their families to control rising medical costs. The Military Officers Association of America opposes health care cost-shifting from the government to military beneficiaries and aims to increase health care access by reducing deterrents to provider participation. They seek to reinstate Tricare benefits for remarried widows, codify requirements to continue Prime benefits in affected localities, extend the Tricare Extended Care Health Option program eligibility, and seek increased funding for mental health and family counseling for deployed families.

They seek to reinstate Tricare benefits for remarried widows, codify requirements to continue Prime benefits in affected localities, extend the Tricare Extended Care Health Option program eligibility, and seek increased funding for mental health and family counseling for deployed families. Military medical care will remain a topic of congressional consideration in 2006, with potential increases in Federal spending due to retirees remaining on Tricare rather than joining employer-sponsored health plans. Under a new law in North Carolina, eligible state employees can opt for TRICARE Supplemental Health Insurance instead of the Teachers' and State Employees' Comprehensive Major Medical Plan. This offers full health benefits coverage with no deductibles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs, and is portable even if the employee leaves UNC Health Care. Such arrangements help minimize health care costs for states and employers while encouraging military retirees to stay under TRICARE. The new law in North Carolina allows state employees to choose TRICARE Supplemental Health Insurance over the Teachers' and State Employees' Comprehensive Major Medical Plan, reducing health care costs for employers. This change may lead to increased Federal spending as military retirees previously relied on employer health plans with TRICARE as a secondary payer."
