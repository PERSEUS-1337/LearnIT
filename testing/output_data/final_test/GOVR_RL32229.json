    "content": "The authority for awarding federal government contracts is found in the United States Code (U.S.C.) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 mandates full and open competition, but there are exceptions outlined in the FAR, DFARS, and AIDAR for using other than full and open competition in certain circumstances. Exceptions to full and open competition in federal government contracts include: 1. Only one responsible source available. 2. Urgent need to prevent serious government injury. 3. Maintenance of suppliers for national emergencies or industrial mobilization. 4. International agreements. 5. Statutory requirements. 6. National security concerns. 7. Public interest considerations. The Bush Administration has set additional criteria for eligibility for contracting in Iraq, limiting competitive bidding for certain Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction prime contracts. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz issued a memorandum stating the public interest would be better served by using other than full and open competition. Procedures for justifications and eligibility criteria can be found in DFARS and AIDAR guidelines. Contracts funded with U.S. appropriated reconstruction funds were initially limited to U.S. firms due to national security interests. However, foreign countries could participate as subcontractors, making up a significant portion of the total contract costs. FY2004 appropriations managed by the CPA are being handled differently, with a report issued on December 5, 2003 outlining new procedures. The December 5, 2003 \"Determination and Findings\" report by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz states that prime contracts are only open to U.S. firms and 62 other eligible countries, including Iraq and coalition partners. Excluded countries like Germany and France have raised concerns about potential violations of the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement. Some U.S. officials argue that the contracting organization, CPA, is not bound by the GPA and can restrict competition. President Bush announced on January 13, 2004, that Canada could compete for contracts in Iraq. Israeli businesses are not eligible for prime contracts but can participate as sub-contractors in reconstruction programs. The U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) is responsible for overseeing Iraq reconstruction contracts worth up to $18.6 billion. By March 2004, only $2.2 billion had been obligated, with contracts potentially worth $8 billion awarded by May. Delays in progress are attributed to the need for open and competitive bidding. Among recent reasons for slow progress in Iraq's reconstruction are open and competitive bidding requirements for new contracts, inter-agency disputes over fund control, and escalating security concerns since March. USAID, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Department of State have been involved in contract awards and management. It is expected that these federal agencies will continue to play a role in the contracting process alongside the CPA's efforts. USAID has been responsible for contracting the majority of FY2003 reconstruction appropriations in Iraq, covering a wide range of development programs. They have awarded contracts in various sectors such as seaport and airport administration, capital construction, public health, education, governance, agriculture, and higher education. Despite handling significant projects, the CPA retains control over most available funding for reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The CPA has control over most of the funding for reconstruction in Iraq, with USAID handling non-construction development programs. USAID has obligated over $3.5 billion in aid contracts and grants as of May 18, 2004. The Center for Public Integrity investigated contract awards in Iraq and Afghanistan by DOD, Department of State, and USAID. The Center for Public Integrity investigated contract awards in Iraq and Afghanistan by the United States General Services Administration, revealing new companies receiving contracts and existing companies seeing contract increases totaling $5.8 billion. The CPA Program Management Office reported no protests against $5.1 billion in construction contracts awarded in March 2004. The United States Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) was established in 1985 to manage civilian contractors for DOD missions during war and military mobilizations. It is administered through the Army Materiel Command and coordinates efforts to negotiate contracts with vendors. LOGCAP contracts have been used in various military operations, including work in Rwanda. LOGCAP contracts are awarded for various tasks in different countries, operating under a \"costs-plus award fee\" structure. Task orders outline specific actions for contractors, approved as needed without competition. Three task orders under LOGCAP III were each valued at least $60 million. The Defense Contract Audit Agency found deficiencies in task orders issued under the Halliburton/KBR LOGCAP III contract, questioning their ability to produce well-supported proposals for fair prices. The first LOGCAP contract was awarded in 1992 to Kellogg, Brown, and Root (KBR) to support US and UN military forces. The LOGCAP program supported US and UN military forces in Somalia. Three contracts were awarded competitively to DynCorp, KBR (now a Halliburton subsidiary), and Halliburton/KBR. The third contract (LOGCAP III) was awarded in 2001 for various tasks including extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq, housing troops, food preparation, water supply, and trash collection. The contract was cost-plus-award-fee based on specific task orders. The 2001 Halliburton/KBRLOGCAP III contract rose to over $3.5 billion in 2003. The contract includes a fixed 1% profit above costs with the potential for additional incentive bonuses. The contract is cost-plus, award fee based, with a 2% fixed fee and the possibility of an extra 5% incentive fee. Portions of the contract can be viewed on the Center for Public Integrity's website. On March 24, 2003, the Army announced that Halliburton's subsidiary KBR was awarded a sole-source contract to extinguish oil well fires in Iraq and assess necessary repairs to the oil infrastructure. KBR was chosen due to their ability to quickly implement the contingency plan, with equipment and personnel already in the region. This contract was expected to be used temporarily until additional contracts could be awarded. The Army Corps of Engineers conducted a competition to replace the sole-source Halliburton contract, awarding two new contracts for a full range of services in Iraq. The Request for Proposal was issued on July 9, 2003, and closed on August 14, 2003. The Army Corps of Engineers held a conference on July 14, 2003, to award two contracts for the repair and continuity operations of Iraq's oil infrastructure. Halliburton subsidiary KBR was awarded the first contract to rebuild the oil industry in Southern Iraq, while Bechtel was awarded the second contract to repair various infrastructure and facilities, including hospitals and schools, worth up to $1.8 billion over two years. The contract award information for rebuilding Iraq's oil infrastructure worth $1.8 billion over two years can be accessed from the Federal Business Opportunities website. Security Council Resolution 1483 replaced the Oil-for-Food Program, ending sanctions against Iraq and shifting responsibility for oil profits to the United States. The Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) was phased out in 2003, with $39 billion allocated for humanitarian assistance. The remaining $8.2 billion in assets were transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq. The CPA managed the supplies and equipment designated for Iraq, with $7.6 billion transferred by March 31. The CPA established a coordination center in Baghdad to handle issues previously managed by the OFFP. The termination of the OFFP limited contract applications for exporting goods to Iraq. A priority system was developed considering Iraqi views and needs. The CPA website provides details on eligible and ineligible contracts, with specific suppliers listed by country. Press reports in 2004 referred to allegations of abuse of the OFFP by the Hussein government. In March 2004, Secretary-General Koffi Annan suggested an independent investigation into corruption and fraud within the OFFP, endorsed by the Security Council. An independent panel chaired by Paul Volcker was expected to conduct a comprehensive investigation. Iraqis may also be organizing their own investigation into the allegations. The latest potential scandal involves dealings during Saddam Hussein's rule, separate from current contract management under the CPA. Roughly 60% of Iraqis still rely on food assistance from the public distribution system. The new Iraqi interim government is expected to take over closing out the program and managing food distribution. Halliburton/KBR purchased oil fuels for Iraq, with 75% coming from Turkey. The cost differential in oil fuel purchases from Kuwait and Turkey is being questioned. Between May and October 2003, Halliburton imported about 179 million gallons of gasoline from Turkey and 61 million gallons from Kuwait. The cost of fuel and transport from Kuwait was more than twice as high as from Turkish suppliers, raising questions about the cost differentials in each element of the transaction. The cost of gasoline from Turkey was $1.24 per gallon delivered, while purchases from Kuwait averaged $2.64, including transport and fees. Factors contributing to higher Kuwaiti prices included dangerous transportation and short-term supply contracts. The Kuwait Petroleum Corp. refused to allow KBR to use any supplier other than Altanmia Commercial Marketing Company for petroleum products. Altanmia, owned by Najeeb al-Humaizi, a prominent Kuwaiti family member, refused to disclose cost information due to Kuwaiti law. In response to fuel price issues, the Pentagon assigned fuel procurement to the Defense Energy Support Center, which solicited bids for 6.6 million barrels of fuel. KBR solicited bids for 6.6 million barrels of fuel on January 21, 2004, with a contract expected by April 1, 2004. Despite being under investigation for wrongdoing, KBR supplied fuel. The Pentagon Inspector General found KBR had overcharged $61 million, while two Halliburton employees admitted to taking $6 million in kickbacks. The kickbacks were unrelated to the gasoline purchases under scrutiny. The Defense Contract Audit Agency requested the Inspector General's findings be forwarded to Pentagon criminal investigators. The spot market price of gasoline in the Persian Gulf area increased from 71 cents per gallon to over $1.00 per gallon between October and December 2003. This rise, along with a $14 increase in spot market gasoline prices per barrel, was likely influenced by Halliburton/KBR fuel purchases, exceeding typical crude oil cost increases. DESC took over the program to supply civilian fuel to Iraq, sourcing petroleum products from more robust markets to avoid price increases. They supported Task Force-Restore Iraqi Oil through Defense Logistics Agency, initiating Requests for Proposals and signing supply contracts. On April 1, 2004, DESC assumed sole responsibility for fuel supplied to Iraq from Turkey and Kuwait, ending Halliburton/KBR's involvement. The Coalition Provisional Authority's Program Management Office announced the awarding of over $5 billion in contracts for Iraqi reconstruction activities, using up to approximately $8 billion of the 2004 supplemental appropriation. Separate solicitations for program management support from the Pentagon Renovation Program are also expected. Tables 2 and 3 provide information on the awarded reconstruction contracts, which can be viewed at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net. U.S. businesses can bid for federal government contracts in Iraq for supplying goods or services. The General Services Administration defines a contract as a legal relationship between the seller and buyer. Small businesses may struggle with large federal contracts. More information can be found on the Federal Acquisition Regulation website. Prime contractors in Iraq may need to use subcontractors to fulfill contract obligations. They are responsible for choosing subcontractors and can access information on subcontracting opportunities through contractors' websites or the FedBizOpps website. Commercial vendors can search for federal procurement opportunities on the FedBizOpps website. The federal contracting community can search for contract information on the FedBizOpps website. Searches can be done by keyword, agency name, or product/service. Other business opportunities in Iraq include CPA and Iraqi Ministry solicitations, working with state-owned enterprises, international institutions, and private enterprises. The Iraq Reconstruction Task Force website lists contract awards for Iraq. The Iraq Reconstruction Task Force website provides a listing of contract awards for Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004, including prime contractors and subcontractors. The website also offers resources such as the \"Business Guide for Iraq\" covering commercial environment, laws, international trade, and key industry sectors. The curr_chunk provides information on business opportunities in Iraq, including FAQs on travel, security, health, trade, job opportunities, and business counseling. Companies can register for email alerts on commercial developments in Iraq. Additional resources can be found on the Iraq Investment and Reconstruction Task Force website. The curr_chunk provides links to various resources for vendors interested in Iraq reconstruction projects, including the CPA-PMO website and the Iraq Business Outreach Hotline. It also offers information on potential Congressional oversight actions regarding Iraqi contracting. Potential Congressional oversight actions regarding Iraqi contracting include requirements in proposed bills S. 2400 and S. 2401 for the Secretary of Defense to submit reports to Congress on contractor personnel management and security activities in Iraq. P.L. 108-136 mandates DOD compliance with procurement laws for reconstruction contracts in Iraq. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees, along with other relevant committees, may oversee Iraqi contracting issues, including the awarding of contracts for reconstruction activities in Iraq. Representative James Leach introduced a resolution to create a select committee to investigate contracts for activities in Afghanistan and Iraq related to the war on terrorism. P.L. 108-106 created the position of Inspector General, Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA-IG) to oversee reconstruction activities in Iraq. Stuart W. Bowen, Jr. was appointed as CPA-IG and is required to submit quarterly reports to Congress. The first report was submitted in March 2004, covering the first 70 days of his appointment. Bowen requested future reporting dates to be changed to July 30, October 30, and January 30. The Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA-IG) requested a change in future quarterly reporting dates to July 30, October 30, and January 30. Additionally, a bill called H.R. 3275, the Clean Contracting in Iraq Act, was introduced in the House to promote competition in awarding contracts for Iraqi reconstruction activities. The bill would require larger contracts to be awarded to a minimum of two different contractors and each contracting agency to develop a cost-minimization plan, including the use of Iraqi contractors if cost-effective. The CRS reports discuss Circular A-76 Revision 2003, OMB Circular A-76, Federal Contracting of Commercial Activities, Competitive Sourcing Targets, and The Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act."
