The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made some provisions permanent, reducing the number of expiring \"tax extender\" provisions in 2016. The tax code contains temporary provisions known as \"tax extenders\" that are often extended by Congress for short periods. All provisions that expired at the end of 2017 had previously expired at the end of 2016. Congress may enact temporary tax provisions for various reasons such as evaluating effectiveness before extension, providing relief during economic weakness or natural disasters, or for budgetary reasons. The tax code includes temporary provisions called \"tax extenders\" that are regularly extended by Congress. Despite the rationale for expiration dates to prompt policymakers to review the costs and benefits of special tax treatments, in practice, these provisions are often extended without systematic review. This lack of analysis results in the extenders being passed as a package of temporary tax benefits without careful consideration of their effectiveness. Tax extenders are temporary provisions in the tax code regularly extended by Congress. Despite the rationale for expiration dates to prompt review, these provisions are often extended without systematic evaluation. Some provisions, like tax incentives for alcohol fuels, have not been extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the cost. Recent \"tax extender\" packages have included all expiring provisions or left some out, allowing them to expire as scheduled. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended most expiring provisions, while the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made all extensions permanent or for five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 retroactively extended provisions that expired in 2016 through 2017. Tax policy can also address temporary circumstances like economic stimulus or disaster relief. Tax policy can be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief, with measures like bonus depreciation or casualty loss deductions. Temporary provisions, like forgiven mortgage debt exclusion, payroll tax cuts, and grants for weak tax-equity markets, are enacted for special economic circumstances. These provisions should expire once the situation is resolved, and temporary tax policies may be enacted for budgetary reasons. Temporary tax provisions are easier to offset short-term extensions for budgetary reasons. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, leading to an overstatement of projected revenues in the long term. Making tax provisions temporary rather than permanent has a smaller effect on the long-term fiscal outlook, acting as a form of federal subsidy that channels economic resources into qualified uses. Extenders influence economic actors and resource allocation. Evaluating tax benefits considers efficiency, equity, and simplicity. They provide subsidies to encourage activities, balancing economic objectives. Market distortions from taxes can improve efficiency in some cases. Tax extenders can improve economic welfare by addressing market failures and stimulating desired activities. Direct spending programs may be more effective at targeting resources than indirect subsidies through the tax system. Tax fairness is achieved when the tax burden is distributed socially desirable. Extenders can lead to differential tax treatment for individuals or businesses with similar incomes, deviating from horizontal equity standards. Tax extenders may lead to differential treatment, deviating from horizontal equity standards. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens based on ability to pay. Tax benefits may disproportionately benefit higher income individuals, reducing progressivity and equity in the tax system. The above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses varies based on income levels, with higher-income taxpayers receiving a greater benefit. Extenders add complexity to the tax code and increase administrative costs, impacting the fairness and progressivity of the tax system. The tax code's complexity in temporary provisions increases costs for taxpayers and the government. Twenty-eight provisions expired in 2017, affecting individuals, businesses, and energy. Three individual provisions expired, including the above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses, regularly extended since 2001. The tax code has several temporary provisions that have regularly been extended, including housing-related deductions for mortgage insurance premiums and canceled mortgage debt income. Extending these provisions for the 2017 tax year is estimated to reduce federal revenue by $3.8 billion, while permanently extending them would reduce revenue by $31.2 billion between FY2018 and FY2027. Twelve business tax provisions also expired at the end of 2017. At the end of 2017, several tax provisions expired, including the empowerment zone tax incentives, credit for railroad track maintenance, Indian employment tax credit, American Samoa economic development credit, and mine rescue team training credit. Other expired provisions relate to cost recovery, such as accelerated depreciation for business property on Indian reservations, seven-year recovery for motorsport racing facilities, expensing of mine-safety equipment, special expensing rules for film, television, and live theatrical production, and three-year depreciation for race horses two years or younger. The cost recovery provisions interact with bonus depreciation from the 2017 tax revision. If property claims bonus depreciation, the cost of the special cost recovery allowance falls. Two tax provisions expired in 2017 and are unlikely to be extended further. The 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) repealed the Section 199 production activities deduction and reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Most business provisions that expired at the end of 2017 have been part of the tax code for close to a decade or longer, with some dating back to the 1990s and mid-2000s. The 2017 tax revision repealed the Section 199 production activities deduction and reduced the top corporate tax rate. Several business tax provisions enacted in the mid-2000s are set to expire, including the American Samoa economic development credit and the credit for railroad track maintenance. The extension of these provisions is estimated to reduce federal revenue by $0.8 billion between FY2018 and FY2027. Thirteen energy tax provisions expired at the end of 2017, with the largest provisions costing the most for a one-year extension. The largest provisions in the legislation expired at the end of 2017, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, alternative fuels, and energy efficiency for buildings. Certain energy tax provisions were extended through 2021, with reduced rates for nonsolar technologies in 2020 and 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) extended most energy tax provisions through 2021, with reduced rates for nonsolar technologies in 2020 and 2021. Permanently extending these provisions beyond 2017 would significantly reduce federal revenue. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) extended energy-related provisions through 2021, including the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financing rate and the tax credit for production from advanced nuclear power facilities. These changes are estimated to reduce federal revenue by $15.1 billion between FY2018 and FY2027. Not all provisions extended in BBA18 are likely to be extended beyond 2017, following changes made in the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97). Permanently extending tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $92.5 billion over the FY2018 to FY2027 budget window. One-third of this cost is associated with tax incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Making these \"tax extenders\" permanent would decrease federal revenues by about 0.2%. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2016 through the end of 2017. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made many temporary tax provisions permanent and provided long-term extensions through 2019. These extensions were estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between FY2016 and FY2025. The cost of extending tax provisions between FY2016 and FY2025 was $628.8 billion, with $426.8 billion attributed to \"tax extender\" provisions. Permanent extensions accounted for $559.5 billion, while the cost of making provisions permanent was $361.4 billion. Only $17.7 billion was for a two-year extension of expired provisions in 2014. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions, costing $41.6 billion over 10 years. The 113th Congress passed one-year retroactive extenders legislation, while the American Taxpayer Relief Act made dozens of temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) extended expired and expiring tax provisions, costing $73.6 billion over 10 years. Some traditional extenders were not renewed. Additional tax provisions, like the excise tax on coal for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, are set to expire at the end of 2018. Starting in 2019, tax rates for coal mining are set to be $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. Another tax provision allows deductions for medical expenses exceeding 10% of adjusted gross income, up from 7.5% previously. This change was implemented in 2013 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The 2017 tax revision reduced the AGI threshold for medical expenses from 10% to 7.5% for individual taxpayers in 2017 and 2018. Making this provision permanent would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $24.8 billion between FY2019 and FY2028. Additionally, a $0.09 per barrel excise tax on crude oil is scheduled to expire at the end of 2018, with a history of expirations, reinstatements, and rate adjustments since 1990. The 2017 tax revision included special provisions for disaster-related tax benefits, such as enhanced deductions for casualty losses from presidentially declared disasters in 2016 or 2017. Before the change, losses were deductible if they exceeded $100 per casualty, but the revision increased this threshold to $500 per casualty. Additionally, disaster-related casualty losses were previously part of itemized deductions but were allowed to be claimed in addition to the standard deduction under the new provisions. Disaster relief for hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma was included in the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017. The Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-63) provided tax benefits for disaster-affected areas, including waiving the 10% tax on early disaster-related retirement plan distributions, an employee retention tax credit, suspended income limits on charitable contributions, and modified casualty loss deductions for hurricane-related losses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 expanded hurricane-related disaster provisions to include relief for the California wildfires of 2017. Tax relief for hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria was estimated to reduce federal revenue by $5.6 billion between FY2018 and FY2027, with $4.0 billion associated with enhanced casualty loss deduction. The disaster tax relief expansions in BBA18 were estimated to reduce federal revenue by an additional $0.5 billion between FY2018 and FY2027. \"Tax extenders legislation temporarily extends expired or expiring provisions. The package of provisions included in tax extenders has changed over time. Examples of tax extenders legislation include Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\" The following acts have been passed: Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004, Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Small Business and Job Protection Act of 1996, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Tax Extension Act of 1991, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, and Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988."
