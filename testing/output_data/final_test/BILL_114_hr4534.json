Land Forces consist of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard. Before September 11, 2001, the Land Forces of the United States had 1,036,601 Soldiers and 212,744 Marines. During the Global War on Terrorism, these numbers increased to 1,138,907 Soldiers and 242,558 Marines. For fiscal year 2016, the Land Forces of the United States include 1,015,000 Soldiers and 222,900 Marines. By fiscal year 2018, the end strength is planned to be approximately 970,000 Soldiers and 220,500 Marines. The Administration has enacted a policy to reduce the end strength of United States Land Forces, including the Army and Marines, based on security analysis and future force capabilities outlined in various defense reviews. This reduction in forces has raised concerns about the ability to deter adversaries and respond to Russian aggression in Europe. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) outlines the end of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, closer ties with Russia, a shift towards European countries as security producers, a focus on smaller-scale operations, increased reliance on allies, and emphasis on innovation and technology for a smaller force. The security environment assumptions outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review are outdated and proven flawed due to new threats faced by the United States, its allies, and partners. These threats include a civil war in Syria, the rise of the Islamic State with global ambitions, and Iran's continued support for terrorist activities. The security environment assumptions outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review are outdated and proven flawed due to new threats faced by the United States, its allies, and partners. These threats include a resurgent Russia annexing Crimea, invading Ukraine, and conducting military operations in Syria, China's military build-up and actions in the South China Sea, and North Korea escalating tensions and expanding its nuclear capability. In response, short notice deployments of United States Land Forces have increased globally. To address global security threats, the Army deployed forces in Eastern Europe, Ukraine, and Iraq, while United States Land Forces remain in Afghanistan. The Marines were also deployed to stabilize troubled areas in Southeast Asia and Africa. To address global security threats, the Army and Marine Corps have deployed to conflict-scarred countries such as Cambodia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. United States Joint Special Operations Forces constantly deploy worldwide to address unique threats and build partner capacity. Additionally, the Army and Marine Corps respond to natural disasters like the Indian Ocean earthquake, Haiti earthquake, Japan tsunami, Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and Nepal earthquake on short notice across the globe. The 2014 National Defense Panel and the National Commission on the Future of the Army disputed the assumptions about the future purpose, use, and capability of the Land Forces. They criticized the reduction in Army end strength and the lack of resources to address escalating threats and react to unforeseen circumstances. The 2014 National Defense Panel and the National Commission on the Future of the Army criticized the reduction in Army end strength and lack of resources to address escalating threats. A comprehensive view of the Land Forces is needed, as reserve components have been deployed extensively since September 11, 2001, for various missions including homeland defense. The Army is not currently sized or shaped for large-scale, long-duration missions at acceptable risk. The reserve components of the Land Forces play a crucial role in homeland defense and disaster relief missions. Senior military leaders have expressed concerns about reductions in the end strength of the Land Forces, including risks in capacity highlighted by General Martin Dempsey in the 2014 QDR. The current Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark Milley, disputed assumptions about future wars and the use of advanced technologies. General Philip Breedlove highlighted concerns about virtual presence leading to actual absence. Defense officials are warning that further reductions in infrastructure and forces will limit access to strategic locations during crises. Former military leaders, including General James Amos and Admiral James Stavridis, have expressed concerns about a future military force that may be unprepared and lacking rotational relief for deployments. Defense officials are cautioning against significant reductions in troop levels, citing the need for readiness in real combat operations across multiple continents. The sense of Congress is to immediately halt the planned drawdown of Land Forces due to the need for trained and ready forces to deter threats, respond to crises, and win wars. Additionally, defense officials are warning against significant troop level reductions to maintain readiness for combat operations. In fiscal year 2016, the authorized end strength levels for the land forces of the United States are as follows: Army active duty personnel - 480,000, Marine Corps active duty personnel - 184,000, Army National Guard - 350,000, Army Reserve - 205,000, and Marine Corps Reserve - 38,900. SEC. 5. REVISION IN PERMANENT ACTIVE DUTY END STRENGTH MINIMUM LEVELS.\n\n    Section 691(b) of title 10, United States Code, is amended to set new end strength levels for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.\n\nSEC. 6. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    The United States policy is to maintain peace through strength, requiring Congressional approval for any proposal to lower end strength levels."
