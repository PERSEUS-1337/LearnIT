    "content": "The \"Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" is cited as the official title. It amends the Clean Air Act by adding a section on a low carbon fuel standard. The \"Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" defines key terms related to fuel emissions, including fuel emission baseline, transportation fuel, and transportation fuel provider. The baseline is the average greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy of all transportation fuels in 2005. Transportation fuel includes fuel for motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, and aircraft, with the option to include ocean-going vessels. The \"Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" defines transportation fuel providers as individuals or entities involved in producing, refining, blending, or importing transportation fuels. The Administrator is required to establish regulations within 3 years to determine lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, fuel emission baseline, and apply to relevant providers to ensure emission standards are met from 2014 to 2022. The \"Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" requires transportation fuel providers to ensure that emissions of transportation fuel do not exceed the fuel emission baseline. They must also reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for transportation fuel sold in any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia from 2023 onwards. The Administrator must review and revise the annual average lifecycle greenhouse gas emission requirements every 5 years starting in 2020. The emissions must be reduced by at least 5% below the fuel emission baseline for 2023 and by at least 10% for 2030 and beyond. The regulations issued under this subsection contain compliance provisions for transportation fuel providers to meet emission requirements. There is no per-gallon obligation for lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, and biofuels from non-renewable biomass must not exceed the fuel emission baseline. The regulations allow transportation fuel providers to elect to participate in the program, with provisions for tracking fuel used for transportation separately from other purposes. The regulations under subsection (b) allow transportation fuel providers to generate credits for exceeding required fuel reductions. The Administrator determines credit amounts and conditions for their use, including the use of credits or renewable identification numbers. The Administrator may issue regulations for generating credits for electricity used as transportation fuel from sources other than the vehicle. Compliance requires transportation fuel providers to demonstrate using credits generated, banked, or purchased. If unable to obtain enough credits, providers must meet regulations. Compliance deficit can be carried forward if fuel provider achieves compliance in the following year and generates or purchases additional credits. The Administrator may waive regulations based on petition or revise greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements. The Administrator may waive regulations under subsection (b) if implementation would harm the economy or environment, or if there is a fuel supply shortage. Studies on environmental impacts and energy security must be completed within specified timeframes. The study will assess the impact of regulations on energy security, potential fuel shifting internationally, and environmental implications. Section 211(o) will not apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2022, with exceptions noted."
