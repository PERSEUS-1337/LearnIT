    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Assistance Act of 1993\". It includes findings related to the assistance provided to grandparents raising grandchildren. The Congress finds that many grandparents in the US are primary caregivers to their grandchildren due to issues like addiction, abuse, and health problems. They face legal, financial, and emotional hardships. National policies are needed to assist these grandparents. Grandchild social security benefits are based on dependency. The Social Security Act is amended to remove certain clauses and requirements for child dependency if parents are alive. If a child is treated as a child of an individual and a parent is living, the child shall not be considered dependent unless specific conditions are met. The Social Security Act is amended to suspend benefits if a child reunites with their natural or adoptive parent who is over 18 years old and not a dependent. The amendments made by this section apply to benefits for months after the enactment of this Act, based on applications filed after that date. SEC. 4. Development of optional model procedure for notifying relatives prior to placement of a child in foster care. This amendment applies to benefits for months after the enactment of this Act, based on applications filed after that date. The Secretary must develop a model procedure within 180 days for States to notify relatives before placing a child in foster care. States have the option to adopt this procedure as part of their approved plan under the Social Security Act. The agency will establish the procedure developed by the Secretary for notifying relatives before placing a child in foster care. The amendments made by this section will be effective upon the enactment of this Act. Model standards for insurance coverage of dependents will be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners fails to do so within a year of the enactment of this section. The Secretary will distribute these standards to state insurance commissioners. Additionally, census data on grandparents as primary caregivers for their grandchildren is addressed in another section. The Secretary of Commerce will expand data collection efforts of the Bureau of the Census to gather significant data on grandparents as primary caregivers for their grandchildren. This includes expanding the census question to differentiate households with grandparents and grandchildren. The Secretary of Commerce will expand data collection efforts to gather significant data on grandparents as primary caregivers for their grandchildren, including differentiating households where grandparents temporarily provide a home for grandchildren during parental distress. SEC. 7. GRANTS FOR A NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER FOR GRANDPARENTS. The Older Americans Act of 1965 is amended to establish the National Resource Center for Grandparents, providing assistance to older individuals raising their grandchildren, facing visitation issues, or needing support with their relationship. The Center will offer information and services through a toll-free telephone number. The National Resource Center for Grandparents will provide a toll-free telephone number for older individuals raising their grandchildren, offering information on programs, projects, public and private entities, State laws on grandparent visitation, and Federal assistance. Additionally, they will refer grandparents to entities providing assistance on rearing grandchildren, drug abuse prevention, and promoting good health and nutrition. The amendment made by subsection (a) defines 'eligible entity' as a nonprofit private organization with experience in representing older individuals with grandchildren. It will take effect on the first day of the first fiscal year after the enactment of this Act."
