    "content": "U.S. support for Plan Colombia began in 2000 with $1.3 billion in assistance for Colombia and neighboring countries. The funding totaled $3.5 billion from FY2000 to FY2004, with an additional $731 million in FY2005. The program aims to eliminate drug production, strengthen law enforcement, and support alternative crop development and democratic institutions in countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. The INCLE program supports interdiction and alternative development efforts in counternarcotics activities. It includes training national police and military forces, providing intelligence systems, infrastructure development, and promoting the rule of law. The program also manages the AirWing fleet for drug crop imagery and eradication programs in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, with an estimated FY2005 funding of $70 million. The Air Bridge Denial Program, funded by ACI, operates in Colombia and was temporarily suspended in Peru after a civilian aircraft carrying U.S. missionaries was shot down in 2001. The program resumed in Colombia in 2003, supporting aircraft fleet, pilot training, and intelligence to track and intercept suspected drug trafficking aircraft. The Air Bridge Denial Program in Colombia allows for the shooting down of unresponsive aircraft under the direction of the Colombian Air Force. Funding for the program in Peru is pending safety enhancements. The FY2005 request was for $21 million, with Congress approving $11.2 million. Additional funding for the Andean region is provided through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs. The Defense Department's counternarcotics account supports worldwide programs for interdiction, training, equipment, and intelligence sharing, managed by the U.S. Army Southern Command. Foreign Military Financing grants aid foreign nations in purchasing U.S. defense equipment and training to improve their defense capabilities. The Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program aims to assist key allies in improving defense capabilities, strengthening military relationships, and promoting professionalism in friendly countries. Majority of FMF funding goes to countries in the Middle East, Western Hemisphere, and the Andean region, with a focus on supporting national authority in remote areas used by guerrilla organizations and narcotics traffickers. Funding in FY2004 for the Andean region totaled $124.1 million, with Colombia receiving $109.4 million. In FY2005, the request was for $115.5 million, with $108 million allocated for Colombia. The FY2005 request was for $115.5 million, with $108 million for Colombia. Congress approved $106.5 million for the region, with nearly $100 million for Colombia. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program provides training to students from allied nations to improve defense capabilities and foster relationships between U.S. and foreign militaries. IMET funding for the Andean region is estimated at $2.8 million in FY2004 and $3.7 million in FY2005. The Department of Defense Counternarcotics Account is also involved in counternarcotics efforts. The Department of Defense has authority for counternarcotics detection and monitoring worldwide, requesting $3.7 million for counternarcotics programs. In FY2005, $366.9 million is allocated for Latin America, with up to $200 million planned for Colombia. Activities include detection and monitoring operations to assist in drug trafficking interdiction, training, equipment, and intelligence sharing in the Andean region. Economic assistance programs are not part of the Andean Counterdrug Initiative but support related programs like poverty reduction. Development Assistance (DA) and Child Survival and Health (CSH) programs in the Andean region focus on economic growth, trade, health, and family planning. In FY2004, the ACI region received $46.1 million for DA and $42.1 million for CSH out of the total Latin America budget. For FY2005, $43.3 million is allocated for DA and $39.8 million for CSH in the ACI region. These programs aim to foster sustainable development and improve health outcomes in the region. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) program in Latin America focuses on promoting stable democracies, secure borders, anti-corruption, trade-led growth, and counternarcotics. The ACI region received $32.2 million in FY2004 and $36 million in FY2005 for counternarcotics programs with conditions set by Congress. The FY2005 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act included provisions related to the Andean Counterdrug efforts. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4200 / P.L. 108-375) includes provisions related to Colombia, maintaining language authorizing support for counternarcotics efforts. This authority will cease if the Colombian Armed Forces fail to restore government authority and respect for human rights in certain areas. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4200, P.L. 108-375) increased the cap on U.S. military and civilian contractors deployed in Colombia in support of Plan Colombia. The cap for military personnel was raised from 400 to 800, and for civilian contractors from 400 to 600. As of late November 2003, there were 278 military personnel and 373 civilian contractors in Colombia for Plan Colombia. These numbers fluctuate as programs are initiated, expanded, or completed. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act increased the cap on U.S. military and civilian contractors in Colombia for Plan Colombia. The cap for military personnel was raised to 800 and for civilian contractors to 600. The law also includes provisions regarding the use of helicopters procured with ACI funds and reporting requirements for the Secretary of State. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act increased the cap on U.S. military and civilian contractors in Colombia for Plan Colombia, allowing 800 military personnel and 600 civilian contractors. The act also includes provisions on the use of helicopters and reporting requirements for the Secretary of State. Additionally, a report is required on relationships between foreign governments and designated terrorist organizations in Colombia, detailing assistance received and U.S. policies in place. Human rights conditions must be met for the release of assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces. The Colombian government is actively investigating and prosecuting military members involved in human rights violations and paramilitary activities. The Armed Forces have made progress in cooperating with civilian authorities, severing ties to paramilitary groups, and dismantling their leadership and financial networks. Certification for further assistance depends on continued efforts to restore government authority and respect for human rights. The legislation requires vigorous operations to restore government authority and respect for human rights in areas controlled by paramilitary and guerrilla organizations in Colombia. It denies visas to individuals who support these groups or commit gross human rights violations. Additionally, it includes the Leahy amendment, which withholds funds from security forces with evidence of human rights abuses unless the Secretary of State determines otherwise. The legislation in Colombia requires funding to be contingent on effective measures being taken to address human rights violations. Earmarks designate specific funding amounts for alternative development, institution building, judicial reform, human rights protection, biodiversity, and indigenous reserves. Aerial fumigation funding is limited to 20% for chemicals procurement. The legislation in Colombia requires funding for aerial fumigation to be contingent on certification that the herbicide mixture meets EPA requirements and does not pose risks. Funds are also tied to programs providing alternative income sources for growers targeted for fumigation. The legislation prohibits U.S. military personnel from participating in combat operations in Colombia. It also requires certification for resuming support for a Peruvian air interdiction program and mandates human rights compliance for assistance to Bolivian military and police forces. Congressional consultation is needed before USAID funds can be obligated for Colombian peace initiatives. The conference agreement expressed concerns about the demobilization process in Colombia, including the lack of dismantling of FTOs and prosecution for drug trafficking and human rights violations. It recommends that FY2006 funds for demobilization should not be requested unless certain conditions are met, such as compliance with U.S. anti-terrorism laws and extradition treaty obligations. The Colombian government is implementing a policy to dismantle armed groups, prosecute those responsible for human rights violations and drug trafficking, provide reparations to victims, and return stolen assets. The U.S. requires strict adherence to verification roles before providing funds for demobilization in Colombia. President Bush's budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 includes $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with $21 million allocated for the Air Bridge Denial Program in Peru and Colombia. The majority of the funding, $463 million, is designated for Colombia, with $313 million for drug interdiction and $150 million for alternative development and institution building programs. The Administration sees FY2005 as a crucial year for the program. The FY2005 funding objectives for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative include supporting drug interdiction and eradication efforts in Colombia, infrastructure improvements, police training, secure communications systems, and military helicopters for counternarcotics and counterterrorism. Funds will also be used for development projects in Colombia and Peru, with $112 million proposed for Peru, focusing on alternative development, institution building, and strengthening democracy and human rights. In FY2005, funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative includes $50 million for alternative development and institution building, and $62 million for interdiction efforts in Bolivia. This includes economic development in coca growing areas, demand reduction education programs, and operational support for specialized counterdrug police and military units. The United States plans to provide support for specialized counterdrug units, improve data collection for law enforcement, maintain a helicopter fleet, purchase vehicles and patrol boats, and refurbish counternarcotics bases. Ecuador, Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela are also recipients of ACI funds to prevent drug trafficking spillovers from Colombia and provide interdiction support. The FY2005 request for FMF for the Andean region totals $115.5 million, with Colombia receiving the largest portion. Funding would be used to establish and strengthen national authority in remote areas used by armed groups and for cocaine production. Other countries in the region would also receive funding to strengthen their capabilities for drug interdiction. The FY2005 IMET request for the Andean region is $3.8 million, with a focus on civil-military issues for military officers. The estimate for FY2005 DOD counternarcotics funding for all of Latin America is $366.9 million, including detection and monitoring operations. In the Andean region, DOD counternarcotics funding of $366.9 million supports detection, monitoring, training, equipment, and intelligence sharing activities to combat drug trafficking. Specific allocations for countries are not available, but $200 million is designated for initiatives in Colombia. Peru and Bolivia are primary beneficiaries of Development Assistance funds, with Peru receiving $10.5 million and Bolivia receiving $14.5 million in FY2005. Brazil and Ecuador would each receive $7 million. In FY2005, Peru would receive $13 million, Bolivia $16.1 million, Brazil $7.6 million, and Ecuador $351,000 for Child Survival and Health. Economic Support Funds would be divided between Bolivia ($8 million), Ecuador ($13 million), Panama ($3 million), Peru ($8 million), and Venezuela ($500,000) as part of the Andean Counterdrug Initiative to combat drug trafficking in the region. The United States is a major trading partner for oil producing countries like Venezuela and Ecuador, who are members of OPEC. The Andean Community economic integration pact links the five traditional Andean countries, despite geographical obstacles posed by the Andes mountain range. These countries have diverse populations, with Colombia and Venezuela having mestizo populations, while Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador have significant indigenous populations. Colombia's rugged terrain provides isolated areas for drug cultivation and processing, making it difficult for the government to exert control. The country has a history of democracy but also faces ongoing violence from guerrilla insurgencies and drug trafficking. Various groups, including leftist guerrillas like FARC and ELN, rightist paramilitaries, and drug cartels, contribute to the instability in the nation. The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and other paramilitary groups are involved in drug production, trafficking, and human rights abuses. The AUC has been accused of collaborating with the Colombian military against FARC and ELN. The U.S. policy debate on Colombia focuses on addressing drug trafficking and security concerns post-9/11. The U.S. policy debate on Colombia includes concerns about human rights abuses, counterterrorism assistance, aerial fumigation effects, alternative development, judicial reform, and rule of law programs. Congress will review the progress of Plan Colombia and consider proposals for continued U.S. assistance after 2005. The Senate approved raising caps on military personnel and civilian contractors in support of Plan Colombia in the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act, responding to concerns about drug crops, judicial reform, and American hostages held by the FARC. The House-passed bill raised the military personnel cap to 500 and maintained the civilian cap at 400. The Conference Report was passed by both chambers and sent to the White House, raising the cap on military personnel. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act raised caps on military personnel and civilian contractors in support of Plan Colombia, increasing the limits to 800 and 600 respectively. Supporters argue that Colombia needs assistance to combat drug-fueled armed forces and guerrilla insurgency, emphasizing the importance of counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts to prevent further deterioration. They advocate for expanding military assistance to strengthen Colombian security forces and control rural areas to undermine paramilitary groups. Guerrilla forces cross borders for refuge and supplies, destabilizing the region. FARC and ELN attack infrastructure crucial for Colombia's economic development, especially in oil. Colombia exports 256,000 barrels of crude daily to the US. Critics of US policy argue against military approaches in drug control, advocating for halting aerial fumigation and providing economic alternatives for coca farmers. Many critics argue against forcing coca farmers to give up cultivation, fearing it will drive them to armed groups or displacement. They suggest counternarcotics policy should focus on interdiction over eradication to reduce direct costs to farmers. Some propose economic and social aid, addressing human rights abuses, supporting peace negotiations, and reducing drug demand in the US. Others advocate for a regional and multilateral approach to combat drug consumption. The Uribe Administration in Colombia focused on defeating guerrilla insurgents, eliminating paramilitaries, and ending narcotics trafficking. Upon taking office in 2002, Uribe invoked emergency powers allowing security forces to make arrests without warrants and imposed controls on movements in war-torn areas. The country's constitutional court has ruled some components of the state of emergency unconstitutional. The Uribe Administration in Colombia introduced legislation to give security forces permanent powers, including tapping phones and searching homes without warrants. The Congress also passed a law allowing for the consecutive re-election of presidents, with Uribe expected to run for a second term. President Uribe has taken a tough stance on negotiations, only willing to engage with groups willing to give up terrorism and agree to a ceasefire. He has increased the size of the military and police through a war tax. President Uribe in Colombia increased the military and police size with a war tax on the wealthy and created a civilian informers program. He also ramped up resources for aerial fumigation to eradicate coca crops by 2006, resulting in a significant decrease in armed group desertions, homicides, rural massacres, and kidnappings. The economy saw growth with private investment increasing by 17% in 2003. The economy in Colombia grew by 3.3% in 2003, with growth projections for 2004 ranging from 3.5% to 4%. President Uribe's administration announced a demobilization agreement with the AUC, aiming to disband its members by the end of 2005. The Organization of American States established a mission to support the peace process in Colombia in February 2004. President Uribe proposed controversial legislation for conditional amnesties to illegal combatants, including FARC and ELN fighters if they negotiate with the government. The United States designated the AUC as a foreign terrorist organization. The United States has designated the AUC as a foreign terrorist organization and requested the extradition of top leaders for drug-related charges. The Uribe Administration argues that without amnesties, paramilitary leaders may not demobilize, leading to continued violence. Critics argue that AUC forces have committed severe human rights violations. President Uribe's proposal aims to grant amnesty to combatants from illegal armed groups who agree to disarm, support the peace process, make reparations to victims, and admit to crimes in a criminal court. Critics argue that paramilitaries are not abiding by the accord and continue military activities. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires states to ensure that violators are brought to justice. President Uribe's revised legislation proposes minimum jail sentences of at least five years, pending approval by the Colombian Congress. Aerial eradication and alternative crop development are key components of the government's efforts to combat coca cultivation, with reported decreases in cultivation by Colombian and U.S. officials. The United Nations estimated a 30% decrease in coca cultivation over a certain period, while opium poppy cultivation also declined according to the State Department. Cocacultivation in Colombia declined by 24% in 2002 and 10% in 2003, with aerial fumigation being a controversial method. Despite efforts to eradicate coca crops, replanting still occurs, and the effectiveness of spraying is debated due to environmental and health concerns. The Environmental Protection Agency certified on December 15, 2003 that chemicals used in spray operations in Colombia do not pose a risk to health or the environment. Colombia received funding under the Plan Colombia for various assistance programs, including support for the police and military, economic development, aid for displaced persons, human rights, and counternarcotics efforts. The Defense Department also provided assistance for the Colombian military's anti-drug efforts. Colombia received $373.9 million in ACI allocations for FY2002, with a portion allocated to counternarcotics assistance and economic and social programs. For FY2003, Colombia received $526.2 million in ACI funding, including $377 million for narcotics interdiction and eradication, and $149.2 million for alternative development. The FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental also included an additional $54 million in ACI and FMF funding for Colombia. The FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental provided $54 million in additional ACI and FMF funding, totaling $580.2 million. $110.1 million in FMF funding was allocated to train a Colombian army brigade for protecting an oil pipeline. For FY2004, $463 million was allocated for ACI, with $150 million for alternative development and $313 million for narcotics interdiction. FMF received $98.5 million. In FY2005, $463 million was requested for ACI, with $150 million for alternative development and $313 million for narcotics interdiction. FMF requested $108 million, but Congress approved $466.5 million for ACI and $100 million for FMF. Peru, a major cocaine producer, shares its northern border with Colombia. Peru is a major cocaine producer and exports to various markets. Despite success in counternarcotics efforts, there were protests leading to a temporary suspension of drug eradication programs. Coca cultivation decreased by 15% in 2003. Peru is concerned about spillover effects from Colombia, with reports of FARC forces entering Peruvian territory. Peruvian officials stated in early 2002 that there are no permanent FARC forces in Peru, but they may temporarily cross into border areas. President Alejandro Toledo faced strikes and protests, with his popularity hitting new lows in 2003. Toledo labeled drug trafficking a national security issue and established a drug czar for coordination. U.S. military aid to Peru was suspended on July 1, 2003, due to a lack of agreement exempting U.S. citizens from prosecution. The U.S. military aid to Peru was suspended on July 1, 2003, after an incident in which a Peruvian military plane shot down a small plane, killing an American missionary woman and her infant daughter. This led to a joint investigation between Peru and the United States, with a report released on August 2, 2001, citing communication system overload and cumbersome procedures as factors in the accident. The accident involving a Peruvian military plane shooting down a small plane was attributed to \"systemsoverload\" and \"cumbersome procedures.\" Current law requires the Secretary of State to notify Congress before resuming U.S. support for the air interdiction program. Peru received funding for KMAX helicopters and ACI allocations for counternarcotics aid and alternative development in various fiscal years. The Administration allocated $116 million in ACI funds, with $66 million for counternarcotics aid and $50 million for alternative development. Peru is set to receive $1.7 million for FMF funding. Bolivia, despite not sharing a border with Colombia, faces potential threats to its progress in reducing illegal coca production. Bolivia has made significant strides in reducing coca cultivation in the past, but forcible eradication of coca has led to social discontent and political instability concerns. Bolivia's coca cultivation has increased in recent years, leading to tensions over class and ethnicity. Despite this, it is still below 1995 levels. The US has been involved in controlling coca production in Bolivia for decades, providing aid for counternarcotics efforts. The United States has supported Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts by providing significant assistance and forgiving debt for development and food projects. Bolivia has seen success in reducing illegal coca cultivation through interdiction operations and alternative development programs. However, forced eradication has led to social and political unrest, resulting in the resignation of President Gonzalo S\u00c3\u00a1nchez de Losada. The National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) forced President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Losada to step down in 2003 due to public protests over coca eradication policies, economic marginalization, and a controversial gas export proposal. The new President faces challenges in governing a politically fractured society, with a highly mobilized indigenous community led by Evo Morales. Congressional approval is needed for revisions to gas industry laws after a referendum endorsed changes. Bolivia received $25 million in Plan Colombia funding for interdiction assistance. Bolivia received significant funding for drug interdiction and alternative development assistance from FY2000 to FY2005, totaling over $400 million in ACI funds and Foreign Military Financing. For FY2005, the Administration requested $91 million in ACI funding for interdiction, eradication, and alternative development. Ecuador, on Colombia's southern border, is a key partner in counternarcotics efforts, cooperating extensively with the United States. In 1999, the US signed a 10-year agreement with Ecuador for a forward operating location in Manta for aerial counterdrug operations. Ecuador's concern over US military presence in the region due to potential use against guerrillas in Colombia. Colombian guerrillas crossing into Ecuador for refuge and FARC camps detected in northern province. Ecuador uncovering and destroying cocaine labs in the area. Constant flow of Colombian refugees into Ecuador. Ecuador is experiencing a constant flow of Colombian refugees into poor areas, with paramilitary organizations running extortion rings in border regions. Ecuador has reinforced its northern border with Colombia due to increased anti-guerrilla operations. President Lucio Gutierrez has expressed concerns about the adverse effects of the Colombian conflict on Ecuadoran peasants and the environment. Ecuador received $20 million in US assistance as part of the FY2000 Plan Colombia funding. Ecuador received $20 million in US assistance under the FY2000 Plan Colombia funding, with $12 million for drug interdiction efforts and $8 million for alternative development. Additionally, $61.3 million was allocated for a Forward Operating Location in Manta for counternarcotics aerial surveillance. In subsequent years, Ecuador received funding for interdiction, law enforcement programs, and alternative development through ACI allocations and FMF funding. For FY2004, the Administration allocated $35 million in ACI funding for Ecuador, with $20 million for interdiction and law enforcement, and $15 million for alternative development. In FY2005, the Administration requested $26 million in ACI funding, with $11 million for interdiction and law enforcement, and $15 million for alternative development. Congress approved $26 million for ACI and $1 million for FMF. Brazil's Amazon region borders Colombia and is a transit route for cocaine. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva became President of Brazil in 2003. Brazil is a significant drug-producing country and a conduit for cocaine transit. In 2002, a federal counter-narcotics law was passed. To control the Amazon region, Brazil implemented the $1.4 billion Amazon Vigilance System. They also established a military base at Tabatinga with 25,000 personnel. In 2000, the COBRA border security program was launched to address spillover effects from Colombia. Brazil expanded the COBRA border security program in 2003 to its northern borders with Peru, Venezuela, and Bolivia, focusing on controlling land and air entry into Brazil. The program is headquartered at Tabatinga and aims to address spillover effects from Colombia, including drug trafficking activities and FARC incursions along the border. In response, Brazil announced an increase in troops along states sharing a border with Colombia. Brazil did not exempt U.S. citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, leading to potential sanctions and loss of military education and training funds in FY2004. Brazil received limited Plan Colombia assistance, with ACI funds allocated for law enforcement activities in FY2002-2005. Venezuela, a major transit route for drugs, shares a border with Colombia, leading to concerns about the spread of conflict. Colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries entering Venezuela have strained relations. In late 2003, Venezuelan officials accused Colombian paramilitary forces of killing seven National Guard soldiers, leading to tensions between the two countries. Colombian paramilitaries have been linked to the creation of a new paramilitary group in Venezuela. Accusations of President Hugo Chavez harboring FARC guerrillas have not been proven, but reports suggest FARC camps may exist in Venezuela. The FARC has expressed support for Chavez's revolution, raising concerns that the Venezuelan government is ignoring guerrilla presence. Some coca cultivation has been found in Venezuela, with eradication efforts conducted in 2001. In 2001, coca fields were located and eradicated in Venezuela, with processing labs destroyed. Eradication efforts and seizures occurred in 2003. Despite policy disagreements, Venezuela cooperated with the United States in counternarcotics efforts under President Hugo Chavez, who led political changes in the country. Chavez has at times used anti-U.S. rhetoric and denounced U.S.-dominated military strategies like Plan Colombia. Venezuelan officials have refused to exempt U.S. citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and faced sanctions leading to the loss of military funds. The Senate Foreign Operations Bill contained a provision regarding Venezuela's alleged support for Colombian terrorist organizations. Venezuela received varying amounts of ACI funding for law enforcement and administration of justice programs in FY2002, FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005. Panama, historically linked to Colombia, is separated by the \"Darien Gap\" and has a strategic location due to the Panama Canal. Panama's strategic location at the center of the country, with major cities and the Panama Canal, led to unsuccessful negotiations with the US for a military presence. Instead, the US developed Forward Operating Locations in other countries. Despite this, US-Panama relations remain friendly, with Panama exempting US citizens from the International Criminal Court. Panama is a major transshipment point for cocaine from South America and a hub for money-laundering activities. Panama has cooperated with the United States in counternarcotics efforts, seizing illicit drugs and enforcing anti-money laundering legislation. In 2004, Panama extradited a Colombian drug lord to the US for prosecution. There have been cross-border incursions by Colombian guerrillas and paramilitary groups, with evidence of paramilitary groups being founded in Panama with support from Colombian groups. Small arms shipments for Colombian guerrillas have been seized in Panamanian territory. Shipments of small arms for Colombian guerrillas have been seized in Panamanian territory. Panama and Colombia signed a border security agreement in April 2003 to prevent incursions by Colombian guerrillas and paramilitary forces. Panama received funding for border control and law enforcement, including $5 million in ACI funding for FY2002, $4.5 million for FY2003, $6.5 million for FY2004, and a request for $6 million for FY2005. Additionally, Panama received $1 million in Foreign Military Financing for FY2003 and $2 million for FY2004. Financing for FY2005 included $6 million in ACI funding and $1.5 million in Foreign Military Financing. Congress approved $3 million for ACI and $1 million for FMF. The House passed a bill fully funding ACI at $731 million, with expectations of decreased funding in FY2006 due to the end of Plan Colombia. Provisions included a unified campaign, human rights conditions for Colombian military, and prohibition on U.S. combat operations. The bill maintained requirements for advance notification before resuming the Air Bridge Denial Program in Peru and for returning helicopters used for illegal activities. It directed $5 million for programs benefiting internally displaced persons in Colombia and supported USAID alternative development programs. Concerns were expressed about inadequate funding for alternative development in Peru and Bolivia, emphasizing local participation and government support. The Secretary of State was encouraged to negotiate on these issues. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2812 (S.Rept. 108-346) on September 15, 2004, encouraging negotiations with European allies for counternarcotic programs in the Andean region. The bill provided $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with $272 million for alternative development programs, including $140 million for Colombia. The Administrator of USAID would be responsible for policy decisions on fund allocation. The bill directed funding for judicial reform, human rights protection, and biodiversity programs in Colombia. It authorized support for a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorism, with conditions for military operations and human rights respect. Reporting requirements were included by the Senate. The Senate included reporting requirements for the use of funds in Colombia, specifically regarding aerial fumigation programs. The Secretary of State must certify the herbicide mixture's compliance with EPA requirements and Colombian law to release 20% of the funds for chemical procurement. The remaining 80% can be spent without certification, but complaints of harm must be evaluated for fair compensation before funds are used for aerial fumigation. The bill requires fair compensation for harm caused by fumigation in Colombia, with funds only to be used if alternative income sources are provided. Aerial fumigation in national parks must comply with Colombian laws, and U.S. personnel are prohibited from combat operations. Helicopters procured with funds cannot aid self-defense groups. The bill requires fair compensation for harm caused by fumigation in Colombia, with funds only to be used if alternative income sources are provided. Aerial fumigation in national parks must comply with Colombian laws, and U.S. personnel are prohibited from combat operations. Helicopters procured with funds cannot aid self-defense groups. In relation to the AUC demobilization process in Colombia, funds may be provided only if certain conditions are met, including prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations and drug trafficking, dismantling of group structures, and support for displaced civilians. The bill also addresses extradition of Colombian citizens. The FY2005 Foreign Operations Act, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2005, prohibits U.S. assistance to security forces with human rights violations in Colombia and Bolivia. It also restricts visas for those supporting illegal armed groups in Colombia. Assistance to Bolivian military and police is contingent on human rights respect and cooperation with judicial authorities. The bill allocates $731 million for Andean assistance. The conference agreement on the FY2005 Foreign Operations Act allocates $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with $264.6 million designated for alternative development and institution-building programs. USAID is to receive $237 million, including $125.7 million for programs in Colombia. The agreement includes a 0.83% rescission for FY2005 appropriations and maintains current law on support for a unified campaign, use of U.S. funded helicopters, and prohibiting U.S. personnel from combat. Funding is conditioned on certifications from the Secretary of State on human rights and aerial fumigation. The FY2005 Foreign Operations Act allocates $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with specific funding for alternative development programs. The act maintains the Leahy amendment on security forces and prohibits visas for those suspected of aiding Colombia's armed groups. It requires notification before resuming an Air Bridge Denial program in Peru and mandates a country-by-country report on fund usage. Assistance to the Bolivian military and police is contingent on human rights compliance. Funding is earmarked for judicial reform, human rights protection, and biodiversity programs in Colombia. The conference report addresses the demobilization process in Colombia. The conference report on the demobilization process in Colombia removes a Senate provision on assistance to illegal armed groups. It requires consultation before USAID funds for peace initiatives and expresses concerns about FTO dismantling, illegal activities, and lack of prosecution for drug trafficking and human rights violations. The State Department should not request FY2006 funds for demobilization unless activities comply with U.S. anti-terrorism laws. The Colombian government is committed to extraditing Colombians involved in illegal armed groups, implementing a legal framework for demobilization, dismantling such groups, seizing assets, and returning stolen assets. The OAS Mission in Colombia receives U.S. funds for demobilization purposes and is strictly adhering to its verification role. FTOs are concentrated in demobilization zones, and the legal framework governing demobilization conforms with the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights advice. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization includes provisions for a unified campaign against drug trafficking and related terrorist activities in the Andean region, with a cap increase on U.S. military personnel stationed in Colombia in support of Plan Colombia. The House and Senate versions of the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act raised caps on U.S. military and civilian personnel stationed in Colombia in support of Plan Colombia. The Senate included a provision for a report on relationships between foreign governments or organizations and designated terrorist groups in Colombia. The report recognized progress made by the Uribe Administration. The report (S.Rept. 108-260) acknowledged progress in combating narco-terrorist groups by the Uribe Administration and Colombian Armed Forces. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-767/P.L. 108-375) authorized a unified campaign against drug trafficking and terrorism for FY2005 and FY2006. It increased the cap on military and civilian personnel deployed in support of Plan Colombia.
