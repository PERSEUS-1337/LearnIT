    "content": "The report examines the legal framework for withdrawal from international agreements, focusing on the Paris Agreement on climate change and the JCPOA related to Iran's nuclear program. The Constitution outlines the President's power to make treaties with Senate approval but is silent on termination procedures. Executive agreements, not requiring Senate approval, are commonly used by the President for international commitments. International agreements, including binding executive agreements and political commitments, operate in dual international and domestic contexts. The legal procedure for withdrawal may vary depending on the nature of the pact, with international law governing the process for entering into and withdrawing from agreements between sovereign states. These procedures aim to apply to all nations but may not consider the specific constitutional and statutory frameworks of individual countries. The legal procedure for termination or withdrawal from international pacts depends on the type of pact, whether withdrawal is under international or domestic law, and if Congress has enacted implementing legislation. This process may differ from international law and be complicated if legislation has been enacted. Under U.S. law, international agreements can be treaties, executive agreements, or nonlegal agreements. Treaties require Senate approval, while executive agreements do not. The majority of U.S. international agreements are executive agreements. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution outlines the different types of international agreements the President can enter into, including congressional-executive agreements, treaties, and sole executive agreements. Political commitments, although not legally binding, can still carry significant moral and political weight. Nations can withdraw from binding international agreements in accordance with the agreement's provisions. Most modern international agreements allow withdrawal with consent or according to specified conditions. The Vienna Convention requires a 12-month notice for withdrawal, even if not explicitly stated in the agreement. Certain events like a breach or change in circumstances may also permit withdrawal. The Vienna Convention allows for the termination of treaties through an act declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from, or suspending the operation of a treaty. A notice of withdrawal issued by the President would effectively withdraw the United States from the international agreement as a matter of international law, provided it complies with applicable treaty withdrawal provisions. The Executive branch is responsible for communicating the United States' intention to withdraw from international agreements, regardless of whether the commitment contains a withdrawal clause. Withdrawal may not violate international law, but could lead to political consequences and actions from other nations. The degree of Congress or Senate involvement in the decision to withdraw is a topic of debate among scholars. The Constitution requires Congress or the Senate to participate in the decision to withdraw from international agreements, but the President may independently terminate executive agreements without approval. Courts have avoided settling separation-of-powers disputes between the branches, leaving disagreements to be resolved through political processes. The President has the authority to unilaterally terminate sole executive agreements and nonbinding commitments without Senate or Congressional approval. The mode of termination for congressional-executive agreements and executive agreements made pursuant to treaties may be dictated by the underlying treaty or statute. Congress or the Senate may also dictate how termination occurs for congressional-executive agreements. In the context of termination of agreements, Congress can dictate how termination occurs for congressional-executive agreements, as seen in examples like the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 and the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951. The Truman Administration relied on the law to terminate agreements with the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. There is a debate over the President's authority to unilaterally withdraw from congressional-executive agreements without legislative approval. Presidents have terminated pre-authorized agreements without objection, but there is disagreement on agreements approved by Congress after being entered into. Some argue that the President may unilaterally terminate certain congressional-executive agreements, particularly those related to international trade. However, there is debate over whether Congress must approve the termination of these agreements. Despite ongoing discussions, there has not been significant opposition from Congress regarding the President's ability to terminate such agreements. The termination of Senate-approved treaties has sparked occasional debate between the legislative and executive branches. While the Constitution outlines the process for treaty approval, it is silent on termination procedures. Some argue that the President has broad powers to unilaterally withdraw from treaties based on Supreme Court precedent and executive authority. Some argue that the President has the power to unilaterally terminate treaties without needing approval from the legislative branch, citing historical precedent and executive authority. However, not all agree on this interpretation, with some believing that the power to terminate treaties is shared between the political branches. Some argue that the President can unilaterally terminate treaties, while others believe power is shared between political branches and that the Senate must consent to treaty terminations. Proponents of congressional involvement assert the Founders did not intend for the President to be the sole authority in treaty matters. During the 19th century, treaties were terminated through various methods, including executive withdrawal with prior authorization from Congress or the Senate, or without prior authorization but with subsequent approval. Historical practices show a range of approaches to treaty termination. During the 20th century, treaty termination practices shifted towards unilateral presidential termination without legislative approval. This became the norm, with occasional opposition from Congress through lawsuits to block such actions. During the 20th century, treaty termination practices shifted towards unilateral presidential termination without legislative approval. In the 1970s, Congress attempted to prevent the President from terminating a treaty with China through litigation. Congress passed the International Security Assistance Act to require prior consultation on any proposed policy changes affecting the continuation of the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 with Taiwan. In the 1970s, a group of Members of Congress filed suit to block the President's unilateral termination of a treaty, arguing that the Executive lacks the constitutional authority for such action. The district court agreed, stating that treaty termination is a shared power that cannot be exercised by the President alone. The executive nor legislative branch has exclusive power to terminate treaties. Any decision to terminate a treaty must involve the advice and consent of the Senate or approval of both houses of Congress. The U.S. Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court's interpretation of past practice and the constitutionality of President Carter's action, emphasizing the President's role in foreign relations. The D.C. Circuit court ruled that the termination power of treaties lies with the President, citing the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 as an example. The Supreme Court later vacated this decision without addressing the constitutional question. The Supreme Court did not reach a majority opinion on the constitutional question regarding President Carter's termination of the Mutual Defense Treaty. Justice Rehnquist argued for dismissal due to it being a nonjusticiable political question, while Justice Powell believed the case was not ripe for review until the Senate acted. Justice Brennan's opinion supported the D.C. Circuit's decision, focusing on the Executive's power to recognize the PRC as China's official government. In the years following the litigation over the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, the Executive continued the practice of unilateral treaty termination in many cases. Private plaintiffs filed suit in 1986 to prevent President Reagan from terminating a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Nicaragua, but the district court dismissed the suit as a nonjusticiable political question. Members of Congress later opposed the President's unilateral termination in another case. In response to George W. Bush's 2001 termination of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty with Russia, Members of the House of Representatives challenged the constitutionality in Kucinich v. Bush. The district court dismissed the suit on jurisdictional grounds, citing lack of standing and deeming the dispute a nonjusticiable political question. No appeal was filed. The court did not rule on the constitutional question regarding treaty termination, and no appeal was made. Past cases have not addressed a situation where the Executive's decision to terminate a treaty conflicted with the Senate or Congress. The International Security Assistance Act of 1978 called for consultation between Congress and the executive branch on treaty termination but did not require Senate consent. A Senate resolution stating that Senate approval is needed to terminate mutual defense treaties was introduced but not passed. The resolution to block the President from terminating a treaty was never passed by Congress. If such a resolution were passed and the President still terminated the treaty without approval, the separation of powers analysis might change. The Supreme Court often refers to Justice Jackson's opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, which outlines a framework for evaluating constitutional powers. Justice Jackson's opinion outlines a framework for evaluating the President's constitutional powers, categorizing them into three levels based on congressional authorization. The President's authority is strongest when acting with Congress's approval, in a \"zone of twilight\" when Congress has not spoken on an issue, and at its weakest when acting against Congress's will. If Congress were to pass legislation disapproving of unilateral treaty termination, the President's authority could be at its \"lowest ebb,\" limiting actions to matters involving exclusive presidential prerogatives. The legal framework for treaty termination involves a debate on the President's plenary powers versus the shared role of the legislative branch, especially in matters implicating Congress's enumerated powers. The need for implementing legislation from Congress may be required for non-self-executing provisions or agreements. When Congress passes legislation implementing an international pact into domestic law, the President may not have the authority to unilaterally terminate the domestic effect of that legislation without following the full legislative process for repeal. This is due to the bicameral process required for repealing statutes, as set forth in Article I. Even if the President can withdraw the U.S. from an international pact under international law, this withdrawal alone may not suspend U.S. obligations to its pact counterparts. The withdrawal of the U.S. from an international pact may not automatically repeal the domestic effect of implementing legislation. Congress could influence the role of the pact in domestic law by repealing the implementing legislation, potentially leading to the President's withdrawal from the pact. Implementing legislation may determine how termination of an international agreement affects domestic law, with some legislation immediately ceasing to be effective upon agreement termination. Analysis of implementing statutes is necessary to understand the legal impact. President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, a global pact to combat climate change. Unlike the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement did not require Senate approval. Obama's administration considered it an executive agreement. President Obama signed an instrument of acceptance of the Paris Agreement on August 29, 2016, which entered into force on November 4, 2016. The sources of executive authority for entering into the Agreement were not clearly articulated, but there appears to be no restriction on unilateral presidential withdrawal. The Paris Agreement allows for withdrawal with a multiyear process outlined in Article 28.1 and 28.2, requiring written notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and a one-year waiting period before it becomes effective. This process was not disputed when President Obama signed the agreement in 2016. The Paris Agreement allows for withdrawal with a multiyear process outlined in Article 28, requiring written notification and a one-year waiting period before it becomes effective. President Trump's announcement in 2017 did not mention Article 28, leading to confusion about the timing of the United States' withdrawal. Some suggested withdrawing from the parent treaty, the UNFCCC, as a quicker method of exiting the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement allows for withdrawal with a multiyear process outlined in Article 28, requiring written notification and a one-year waiting period before it becomes effective. The UNFCCC has similar withdrawal requirements, but the three-year prohibition expired in 1997. The Trump Administration has not announced intentions to withdraw from the UNFCCC. As of now, the United States remains a party to the Paris Agreement but has announced its intention to withdraw once eligible. President Trump criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan in a speech on October 13, 2017. In October 2017, President Trump criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) related to Iran's nuclear program, announcing that he would not renew certain certifications of Iranian compliance with the agreement. The JCPOA, finalized in 2015, placed limitations on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions imposed by the P5+1 nations. The President declined to certify compliance with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act in January 12, 2018. This did not automatically terminate the US participation in the JCPOA or re-impose lifted sanctions. The JCPOA, finalized in 2015, lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limitations on its nuclear program. The Obama Administration treated the JCPOA as a political commitment, not requiring congressional approval. President Trump could withdraw from the plan and reinstate sanctions without violating international law. Domestic law likely does not require congressional approval for withdrawal. The JCPOA is a nonbinding commitment where the United States will withdraw certain \"secondary sanctions\" related to transactions with Iran. President Obama revoked previous executive orders imposing these sanctions, which could be reinstated by President Trump through his own executive order. The JCPOA allows the President to sanction Iran through executive order, while secondary sanctions imposed by statute can be waived for a period of time. The Trump Administration has continued to issue these waivers, but they could choose not to renew them, reinstating U.S. sanctions on Iran. The JCPOA calls for the comprehensive lifting of U.N. Security Council sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. Resolution 2231 terminated prior sanctions-imposing resolutions, welcoming diplomatic efforts to reach a solution. Some believe Resolution 2231 may have turned voluntary commitments in the JCPOA into legal obligations. Resolution 2231 terminated prior sanctions-imposing resolutions and may have turned voluntary commitments in the JCPOA into legal obligations under the U.N. Charter. The nature of legal obligations imposed by a U.N. Security Council resolution depends on the language used, with certain affirmative language indicating binding duties on Member States. Resolution 2231 terminated prior sanctions and may have turned voluntary commitments in the JCPOA into legal obligations under the U.N. Charter. The Security Council intended the provisions lifting sanctions to be binding, as stated in the resolution. It is unclear if the resolution creates an obligation for the U.S. to withhold domestic secondary sanctions or comply with the JCPOA. Resolution 2231 terminated prior sanctions and may have turned voluntary commitments in the JCPOA into legal obligations under the U.N. Charter. The Security Council intended the provisions lifting sanctions to be binding. The question of compliance with the JCPOA is complex, with varying interpretations of the phrase \"calls upon\" in Security Council resolutions. Some see it as nonbinding, while others view it as creating an obligation under international law. Member States have historically interpreted this phrase differently, leading to ambiguity in compliance. Resolution 2231 terminated prior sanctions and may have turned voluntary commitments in the JCPOA into legal obligations under the U.N. Charter. The Security Council intended the provisions lifting sanctions to be binding. The question of compliance with the JCPOA is complex, with varying interpretations of the phrase \"calls upon\" in Security Council resolutions. Some see it as nonbinding, while others view it as creating an obligation under international law. Member States have historically interpreted this phrase differently, leading to ambiguity in compliance. The legal effect of U.N. Security Council Resolutions is dependent on their relationship with existing authorizing or implementing legislation, and in some cases, domestic law may authorize the Executive to implement the provisions of a resolution through sanctions. However, Resolution 2231 may not be self-executing, and domestic law alone may not mandate compliance with its terms. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act requires the President to certify every 90 days that Iran is fully implementing the JCPOA, has not breached the plan of action, and that the suspension of sanctions is vital to US national security interests. Congress did not directly approve the US entry into the JCPOA, but passed legislation providing oversight. President Trump is withholding certification under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, stating that he cannot certify the continued lifting of sanctions is appropriate relative to Iran's measures to terminate its nuclear weapons program. This allows Congress to use expedited procedures to re-impose sanctions on Iran. President Trump has the authority to terminate the JCPOA at any time and stated that the US will not waive sanctions to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Under current domestic law, the President can end US participation in the JCPOA and re-impose sanctions on Iran. However, the termination of the JCPOA or re-imposition of sanctions could raise questions about whether Resolution 2231 converted the JCPOA's nonbinding commitments into binding obligations under the UN. Some argue that unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA or re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions may violate Resolution 2231, which could create legally binding obligations. The Trump Administration's belief in Iran's noncompliance with the JCPOA could provide a way for the U.S. to relieve itself of commitments under the agreement. Article 36 of the JCPOA outlines a dispute resolution process for cases where a party believes Iran is not meeting its commitments. If significant non-performance is determined, the United States can cease its commitments. The definition of significant non-performance is not specified, but it can be reported to the U.N. Security Council for further action. Resolution 2231 establishes a \"snapback\" process where the Security Council must vote to continue lifting sanctions on Iran within 30 days of nonperformance. The US, as a permanent member, can veto this vote and reinstate sanctions. President Trump has criticized Iran's JCPOA performance but has not invoked the dispute resolution mechanisms or the \"snapback\" process publicly."
