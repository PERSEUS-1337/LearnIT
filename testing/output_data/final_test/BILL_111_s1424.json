    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Enhanced Violent Crime Community Policing Act of 2009\". According to Congress, the COPS program funded 105,000 police officers from 1995 to 2000. The program contributed to a 2.5 percent decline in violent crime between 1999 and 2000. Economists suggest that increasing the police force size reduces violent crime and property crime rates. Economists estimate the annual cost of crime in the US at $2 billion, with potential savings of $4.00 to $8.50 for each dollar invested in the COPS program. Despite a decline in violent crime rates, some of the largest local police departments saw a decrease in law enforcement personnel. FBI statistics show an increase in violent crime from 2004 to 2006. In recent months, violent crime, gang violence, violence against police officers, and homicides have increased in many US metropolitan areas. Examples include the shooting of four Oakland police officers, the killing of three Pittsburgh police officers, and a man in Binghamton killing 13 others before taking his own life. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. ENHANCED VIOLENT CRIME COMMUNITY POLICY.\" is a condensed version of the information provided in the previous paragraph about the increase in violent crime in US metropolitan areas. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to prioritize hiring and training new law enforcement officers for deployment in high-crime areas. The Attorney General may give preferential consideration to applications for this purpose. The Attorney General shall make grants to hire and train new law enforcement officers for deployment in high-crime areas to enhance community policing. Grants under this subsection are awarded to units of local government based on violent crime rates and other criteria determined by the Attorney General. The grant amount awarded under this subsection is based on criteria such as drug trafficking rate, high school drop-out rate, unemployment rate, poverty rate, population, and other criteria determined by the Attorney General. The grant amount is not more than necessary to increase the grantee's police force by 10 percent. The grant amount awarded under this subsection is based on criteria such as drug trafficking rate, high school drop-out rate, unemployment rate, poverty rate, population, and other criteria determined by the Attorney General. The grant amount is not more than necessary to increase the grantee's police force by 10 percent. The provisions of matching funds do not apply to grants awarded under this subsection. If funds are insufficient, the Attorney General will reduce the grant amount proportionately. The grant amount awarded under this subsection is based on criteria such as drug trafficking rate, high school drop-out rate, unemployment rate, poverty rate, population, and other criteria determined by the Attorney General. The grant amount is not more than necessary to increase the grantee's police force by 10 percent. Matching funds do not apply to grants awarded under this subsection. Termination of grants for hiring officers and hiring costs are also addressed in related subsections."
