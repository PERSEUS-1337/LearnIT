    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 50035 of the Government Code requires a legislative body to determine the cost-effectiveness and public interest of using a contingency fee contract for civil litigation. Written findings must support the use of such a contract, considering factors like existing legal resources, complexity of the case, and geographic area of legal services. The legislative body must determine the cost-effectiveness and public interest of using a contingency fee contract for civil litigation. Factors such as the geographic area for attorney services, experience required, and control over the case must be considered. The written request for proposals must be posted on the city or county's website, and any contingency fee contract must ensure that the lead attorney retains control over the case. The oversight of litigation requires involvement of a supervisory attorney or legislative body. The lead attorney retains authority to reject decisions made by contracted attorneys. Defendants can contact the lead attorney directly. Supervisory attorneys or legislative bodies must attend settlement conferences. The lead attorney has exclusive authority over settlement decisions. The contracted attorney must provide monthly status reports. Contingency fee contracts must be posted on the city or county's website for public inspection. Any payment of a contingency fee for legal services must be posted on the city attorney or county counsel's website within 15 days and remain there for a year. The fee calculation excludes fines, penalties, or punitive damages. Detailed records of services, expenses, and hours worked must be maintained by attorneys under contract with a legislative body. Detailed records of services, expenses, and hours worked by attorneys under contract with a legislative body must be maintained for at least four years. These records are subject to inspection under the California Public Records Act. This section does not expand the authority of any local agency to enter into legal services contracts. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of transparency in contracts for legal services based on contingency fees by local governments, in line with the California Constitution's right to public access. This act aims to ensure openness and accountability in such agreements."
