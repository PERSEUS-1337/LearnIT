    "content": "Debate in the United States continues over federal government action on human-induced climate change. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 by 195 governments, outlines goals for international cooperation to address climate change. The agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. On November 4, 2016, the Paris Agreement entered into force after meeting the criteria of 55 countries representing at least 55% of global GHG emissions. President Obama accepted the agreement on behalf of the United States in August 2016. By April 1, 2017, 142 more nations joined as Parties. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced the intent to withdraw the United States from the agreement, citing a desire to renegotiate terms. The agreement allows a Party to withdraw after three years by giving written notice to the U.N. depositary. The United States could withdraw from the Paris Agreement one year after giving notice, potentially on November 4, 2020. The agreement aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change through cooperation and support. Congress members have varied opinions on the agreement, leading to questions about its content and implications for the U.S. The Paris Agreement raises questions about its implications for the United States, as it is subsidiary to the UNFCCC and only Parties to the UNFCCC can be Parties to the agreement. It is the result of the Durban Mandate and aims to address climate change through cooperation. The Paris Agreement, subsidiary to the UNFCCC, may be adopted by the COP in December 2015 and implemented by 2020. It may utilize existing UNFCCC processes and rules for GHG inventories and adaptation to climate change. The agreement, though only 16 pages long, contains complex mechanisms that will require further definition by negotiating Parties. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, contains complex mechanisms that will require further definition by negotiating Parties. Some experts question its significance due to lack of binding quantitative GHG obligations, while others note substantive differences from prior commitments. The PA introduces a common framework for all Parties, superseding the wealthier vs. developing countries divide, and sets a long-term objective to limit temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement aims to limit temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius and includes a \"ratchet mechanism\" for countries to set GHG abatement targets. It emphasizes greater subsidiarity and decentralization, with countries setting their own targets and using market-based mechanisms for emission reduction credits. Non-state entities play a growing role in the negotiations and implementation of the agreement. The Paris Agreement and the negotiations leading to it involved more non-state entities, including the private sector, as key decision-makers and implementers of activities for GHG abatement and climate resilience. France set up a website for non-state actors to make pledges. All countries agreed to a single system for transparency and accountability to promote compliance with the agreement. The PA aims to balance accountability and trust-building to ensure compliance. The Paris Agreement aims to enhance implementation of the UNFCCC and strengthen the global response to climate change by stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Parties adopted the agreement to avoid dangerous interference in the climate system, with a focus on expert-based compliance mechanisms rather than punitive measures. The effectiveness of this strategy will be closely monitored by many parties and observers. The Paris Agreement aims to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere to limit temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Parties aim to peak GHG emissions as soon as possible and reduce them rapidly to achieve a balance between emissions and removals. The Paris Agreement aims to achieve net zero anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions within a defined time period. It establishes a framework for all Parties to communicate every five years, undertake Nationally Determined Contributions to mitigate emissions, and participate in a transparency framework. It remains unclear if individual Parties can be held accountable if the collective objective is not met. The Paris Agreement requires Parties to report GHG inventories biennially, with international review. Developed countries must provide economy-wide GHG reduction targets, while developing countries are encouraged to enhance their targets over time. Developing countries have flexibility in reporting based on their capacities. The Paris Agreement emphasizes the importance of financial support for developing countries in their climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Parties are required to set a new goal for mobilizing at least $100 billion annually by 2025. This funding can come from public and private sources, with a focus on scaling up financing. The Paris Agreement allows Parties to use private investment for financing, including through emissions markets. It establishes a compliance committee and provisions for voluntary withdrawal. The Department of State confirmed the legal and binding nature of certain elements of the Agreement. The Paris Agreement, negotiated as a legal instrument, contains both mandatory provisions and recommendations. International agreements are generally presumed to be legally binding unless otherwise indicated. Factors such as negotiating history and specificity of provisions can determine the legal nature of an agreement. The PA is a subsidiary agreement to the legally binding UNFCCC treaty. The Paris Agreement, negotiated as a subsidiary agreement to the UNFCCC, aims to enhance implementation through legally binding provisions such as entry into force, dispute settlement, and specific obligations for Parties. The text includes imperative verbs like \"shall\" to denote mandatory obligations, with some qualifications to soften certain requirements. The Paris Agreement includes mandatory provisions for Parties, with imperative verbs like \"shall\" used to denote obligations. Provisions may be exhortative or facilitative, with key mandatory requirements for Parties outlined in Article 4.2, including the preparation and communication of nationally determined contributions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. While NDC submissions are required, their contents are not intended to be legally enforceable. The Paris Agreement mandates Parties to submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, but these contributions are not legally binding. Parties must communicate their NDCs every five years and report on their progress in achieving them. The Agreement does not obligate Parties to achieve their contributions. The Paris Agreement requires Parties to submit NDCs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and report on progress. While the agreement includes various obligations, there is no individual Party accountability for collective shortcomings. Experts suggest the US has no additional legal obligations beyond the UNFCCC. The Obama Administration stated that binding elements align with previous agreements. Some provisions in the PA may introduce new obligations for certain Parties. The Paris Agreement introduces new obligations for Parties, including transparency and review guidelines for all. Parties under the UNFCCC, like the United States, have obligations such as reporting GHG emissions and mobilizing financial resources. Industrialized countries in Annex I have stronger obligations than others. The Paris Agreement introduces new obligations for all Parties, including transparency and review guidelines. Countries listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC, like the United States, have stronger obligations such as reporting GHG emissions and providing financial assistance. Developing countries receive support to meet their obligations. The Agreement establishes a framework for Parties to communicate every five years, submit NDCs to mitigate emissions, participate in a transparency framework, and undergo international reviews of their implementation. The Paris Agreement expands reporting and reviews for non-Annex I Parties, with all Parties eventually subject to common procedures and guidelines. Developed countries must provide economy-wide GHG reduction targets, while developing countries are encouraged to deepen their reductions over time. Each Party's successive NDC will represent a progression beyond their current commitments. The Paris Agreement includes a ratchet mechanism for progressively deeper GHG emission reductions. Developed countries are obligated to provide financial support for developing countries' mitigation and adaptation efforts. All Parties are encouraged to voluntarily contribute to climate finance, with developed countries taking the lead in mobilizing funds from various sources, including public funds. The COP Decision under the Paris Agreement urges developed countries to increase financial support for climate action, particularly for adaptation efforts. A new collective goal of mobilizing at least $100 billion annually to assist developing countries is set, with a focus on enhancing support for higher ambition in developing country actions. The Decision under the Paris Agreement recognizes the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as a key entity for UNFCCC financing, ensuring financial resources from various sources including public, private, bilateral, and multilateral. The GCF operates independently with its own board and secretariat, established during the COP in Durban in 2011. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established during the 2011 COP in Durban, South Africa, and became operational in 2014. It is accountable to the Conference of Parties and operates independently with its own board. A key issue in the Paris Agreement negotiations was \"loss and damage\" due to climate change, with vulnerable Parties seeking commitments from high-emitting countries for compensation. Loss and damage, defined as impacts associated with climate change in developing countries, can occur despite preparation and adaptation efforts. The Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage was established in 2013 under the UNFCCC, but legal remedies like liability or compensation were not adopted. Instead, Article 8 allows for cooperation and facilitation under the authority of the CMA. The CMA is exploring cooperation and facilitation for early warning systems, emergency preparedness, risk assessment, and resilience. Article 6 of the PA allows market-based mechanisms for GHG reduction credits. A work program is called for to govern market mechanisms under the PA. Article 6 offers opportunities for Parties to cooperate on GHG emissions mitigation through cooperative approaches. \"Internationally transferred mitigation outcomes must align with future CMA guidelines to prevent double counting. The transfers are under the authority of participating Parties, not the CMA, unlike the Kyoto Protocol. A mechanism for mitigation and sustainable development is established under the CMA.\" The CMA establishes a mechanism for developing credits to meet NDCs, with proceeds helping developing countries. A framework for non-market approaches is outlined but not finalized, focusing on sustainable development and capacity-building. The mechanisms are diverse and inclusive, with no preference for one approach over another in the PA. The PA does not specify the gases and sectors covered. The PA is silent on anthropogenic gases and sectors covered, following the UNFCCC's definition of GHGs. It includes all human-related GHGs, sectoral sources, and removals by \"sinks.\" Article 5 urges Parties to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. INDCs were submitted in 2015, outlining country-driven intentions for GHG mitigation and adaptation. Each Party decided which GHGs and sectors to cover, leading to diverse scopes across nations. The UNFCCC Secretariat is working on putting INDCs into a common metric and assessing their aggregate effects. The COP Decision requested guidance for estimating and accounting for GHG emissions in NDCs. The PA entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, following specific steps by Parties, including signature, ratification, and deposition of instruments. The agreement has legal force only for nations that are Parties to it. The Durban Mandate envisioned the agreement taking effect in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, earlier than anticipated in the Durban Mandate. Parties face challenges in developing procedures for compliance with the agreement's provisions. Over 170 governments, including the United States and EU, signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, setting a new record for U.N. treaty signatures in a single day. As of June 1, 2017, 195 signatures were received, with only Nicaragua and Syria not signing. The Paris Agreement was signed by over 170 governments, including the United States and the EU, on April 22, 2016. Signature alone did not trigger entry into force, as further steps such as ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession by the signing state or regional economic integration organization were required. 15 nations deposited their ratifications with the U.N. depositary on April 22, 2016. By October 5, 2016, 72 nations had deposited their ratifications, acceptances, or approvals of the Paris Agreement, surpassing the threshold for it to enter into force. As of June 23, 2017, 149 Parties had joined the agreement, including major emitters like Brazil, the EU, India, Japan, and South Korea. Russia and Iran are among the top 20 emitting countries that have not yet become Parties. The United States completed necessary steps to join the Paris Agreement, becoming a Party when it entered into force on November 4, 2016. President Obama signed an instrument of acceptance on August 29, 2016, and deposited it with the UN Secretary General on September 3, 2016. The United States joined the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2016, with President Obama accepting it as an executive agreement instead of seeking Senate advice and consent. This process has been used for other international treaties, including the 2013 Minamata Convention. The State Department's Handbook on Treaties and Other International Agreements provides guidelines for determining the type of agreement and procedures for joining. Factors include whether the agreement requires additional legislative authorization and if it contains new legal obligations for the United States. The State Department's Handbook outlines guidelines for determining the type of agreement and procedures for joining, considering factors like the need for additional legislative authorization and new legal obligations for the United States. Senior officials argue that the Presidential Agreement (PA) is an executive agreement not requiring Senate submission, while State Department officials follow standard procedures for authorizing it. Consultations with Congress are emphasized to avoid compromising constitutional powers. The 2016 White House statement provided little insight into the decision on the type of agreement to be used. The Senate Legislative Counsel in 1975 stated that the scope of presidential authority to make executive agreements is unclear. Congress has interests in the substance of the agreement and protecting its constitutional authorities. Members of Congress introduced resolutions in 2015 to express the sense that the PA should be submitted for the advice and consent of the Senate, but none received further action. In the 115th Congress, resolutions were introduced to oppose or support U.S. participation in the PA, but no further action was taken. The 1997 Byrd-Hagel Resolution expressed the Senate's opposition to an agreement under the UNFCCC that would mandate new commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions for Annex I Parties without similar commitments from Developing Country Parties or harm the U.S. economy. The PA aligns with the first clause by requiring all Parties to submit NDCs to reduce GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to submit NDCs to reduce GHG emissions by 2030, with the U.S. opting for a target date of 2025. The NDCs are not binding, and stakeholders have differing views on the legal form and process for the agreement in the United States. The PA is seen as an executive agreement by some, as it does not impose new legal obligations beyond those in the UNFCCC. The Paris Agreement requires Parties to submit NDCs to reduce GHG emissions by 2030. Some commentators argue that the obligation to submit NDCs is procedural, with no legal obligation to comply with the content. There are differing views on the legal form and process for the agreement in the United States, with some arguing it should have been submitted to the Senate. Some commentators argue that the Paris Agreement could result in stronger obligations for the United States than anticipated. The agreement allows Parties to withdraw with written notice after three years, with the earliest date for the US being November 4, 2019. President Trump announced his intent to withdraw on June 1, 2017, with the withdrawal taking effect as soon as November 4, 2020. President Trump announced his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. The agreement allows for withdrawal with written notice after three years, with the earliest date for the US being November 4, 2019. Some suggest a quicker withdrawal by invoking Article 25 of the UNFCCC. The Constitution outlines a procedure for treaty termination, raising questions about the role of Congress in the process. The Constitution outlines a procedure for treaty termination, but there is debate over the President's power to unilaterally terminate treaties without Senate approval. The role of Congress in this process is unclear due to diverse past practices and unsettled laws. Congress's role in the termination of treaties, such as the UNFCCC, is unclear. It is uncertain if the executive branch would need congressional approval to withdraw from the UNFCCC, and how disputes between branches would be resolved. Congress can influence U.S. commitments under the UNFCCC and the PA through appropriations, oversight, and authorizations. This includes using funds for supporting UNFCCC processes, providing assistance to lower capacity countries, and engaging in cooperative activities. Congress plays a significant role in overseeing the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Members of Congress consult with the executive branch, conduct oversight, and may express views through letters and resolutions. Congressional hearings provide public settings for discussions, and committee chairs may request reviews by the Government Accountability Office. Key issues may attract oversight if the United States proceeds with its commitments under the agreements. Key oversight issues if the United States withdraws from the Paris Agreement include options for withdrawal, U.S. participation in PA activities, renegotiation possibilities, implications of other Parties' decisions post-withdrawal, and evaluation of bilateral cooperation in technology and information-sharing. While the U.S. remains a Party, focus is on developing methods for reporting and achieving NDCs, protecting intellectual property, and fostering market opportunities. Key oversight issues if the United States withdraws from the Paris Agreement include options for withdrawal, U.S. participation in PA activities, renegotiation possibilities, implications of other Parties' decisions post-withdrawal, and evaluation of bilateral cooperation in technology and information-sharing. The focus is on developing methods for reporting and achieving NDCs, protecting intellectual property, and fostering market opportunities. The overall outcomes of Parties' actions in light of the objectives of the UNFCCC and PA are critical to considering the effect of the agreement. The United States communicated its INDC to reduce GHG emissions by 26-28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. The pledge was not conditional on other countries' actions and was supported by domestic policy actions to reduce emissions by 17% by 2020. The United States pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 17% by 2020 and aims for \"deep decarbonization\" of 80% by 2050. The U.S. submitted its INDC to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2015 before joining the PA, satisfying the PA's requirement. The Secretariat has registered the U.S. pledge in the interim NDC Registry. There is a question about whether a Party can rescind its NDC and submit a new one, which is relevant to the United States. The United States is facing questions about the ambition of its GHG emission reduction target under the Paris Agreement. Some stakeholders suggest revising the NDC to be less ambitious, citing concerns about economic impact and competitiveness. President Trump's intention to withdraw from the agreement has raised legal and political questions regarding interpreting related provisions. The U.S. NDC has been registered by the Secretariat and remains in effect unless rescinded. Most Parties have set a 2030 target date for their NDCs, with GHG emissions data becoming available for review in 2032 or later. Formal accounting of actions to achieve NDCs may not be required until the next biennial national report in 2018. This communication is due under the Convention, regardless of U.S. intent to withdraw from the PA. The United States may have broader considerations than just the legal terms of the Paris Agreement (PA) and the UNFCCC. There are no provisions in the PA allowing a Party to rescind its NDC. The possible withdrawal of the U.S. NDC raises compliance issues regarding the requirement for each Party to submit a NDC and the need for more ambitious pledges in each NDC. The U.S. NDC has already been registered. The United States' withdrawal from its NDC without submitting a new one could lead to non-compliance with the Paris Agreement. Deadlines for NDC submissions are flexible, with subsequent NDCs required every five years to reflect higher ambition levels. If the U.S. rescinds its NDC, Parties may or may not pursue non-compliance processes. Article 4.11 of the Paris Agreement allows Parties to adjust their NDCs to increase ambition levels. Legal advisers and officials have differing opinions on the legal obligation of this \"ratcheting\" mechanism. The language in the agreement is permissive, not prohibitive, leading to ambiguity in whether less ambitious NDCs would be noncompliant. The use of \"will\" and \"may\" instead of \"shall\" weakens the argument for mandatory ambition increases. The use of \"will\" and \"may\" instead of \"shall\" in NDCs may weaken arguments for legal obligations. A less ambitious NDC could contradict the goal of peaking global emissions. The US invoking a compliance question may depend on diplomatic repercussions and meeting NDC targets is uncertain. The United States' decision to cease implementation of its NDC under President Trump in 2017 could impact its ability to meet GHG emissions targets. Despite this, many states and entities in the US are still committed to reducing emissions in line with the NDC. Several analyses indicated that the United States may not meet its NDC pledge to reduce GHG emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The State Department reported that current measures could only achieve a 12-16% reduction, falling well short of the target. The Trump Administration's policies could further decrease the likelihood of meeting the NDC target. The Trump Administration's policies, including Executive Order 13783, could hinder the United States from meeting its NDC GHG target. The order directed the EPA to review and potentially suspend the CPP, a key measure in Obama's Climate Action Plan aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired electric generating facilities. This could impact the US's ability to achieve its NDC target of reducing GHG emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The Trump Administration's policies, including Executive Order 13783, could hinder the United States from meeting its NDC GHG target by potentially suspending the CPP. The Supreme Court stayed the rule in 2016, and EPA announced a review of the CPP in 2017. The administration also reconsidered vehicle GHG standards for Model Years 2017-2025, with outcomes on U.S. GHG emissions uncertain. Many factors outside of federal policy could impact meeting the GHG emission target. Economic and technological factors may reduce emissions through 2025, with natural gas and renewable energy playing a significant role. Future emissions projections depend on economic conditions, consumer preferences, energy sector size, policy measures, and modeling methods. State, local, and philanthropic programs are also contributing to emission reduction efforts. Many state and local policies, along with private sector initiatives, are working to limit GHG emissions. California is leading with its Advanced Clean Car Program and goals to reduce emissions significantly by 2030. Ten northeastern states are also implementing the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to limit CO2 emissions. Many states and cities are implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with initiatives like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and renewable energy portfolio requirements. Electric utilities are investing in renewable energy generation, and experts predict that advanced technologies will continue to reduce costs and increase availability of low-emission energy systems. Factors like low motor fuel prices and consumer choices may impact progress. The U.S. energy economy is heavily reliant on fossil fuels through 2030 and beyond, with challenges such as electricity grid constraints and renewable energy storage issues. Over 190 Parties to the UNFCCC have submitted NDCs with specific GHG targets and actions to address climate change. The UNFCCC Secretariat assessed the pledges of 189 Parties representing 99% of global emissions as of April 4, 2016. The UNFCCC Secretariat assessed the pledges of 189 Parties representing 99% of global emissions as of April 4, 2016. Implementation of the INDCs would result in higher global emissions by 7-19% in 2025 and 8-23% in 2030. GHG emissions are projected to continue rising to 2030, but at a slower rate compared to 1990-2010. China's NDC includes policies and targets for 2030, aiming to peak CO2 emissions around that time. By 2030, countries aim to peak CO2 emissions, increase non-fossil energy sources, reduce CO2 per unit of GDP, expand forest stock volume, establish carbon trading systems, and adapt to climate change. The EU plans to reduce GHG emissions by 40% below 1990 levels, India aims to reduce emissions intensity by 33-35% below 2005 levels, and Mexico pledges to peak emissions by 2026. Canada intends to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below current levels. Canada aims to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, while Russia plans to limit GHG to 25-30% below 1990 levels by 2030. The Paris Agreement relies on good faith, transparency, and peer pressure for compliance, with a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote adherence. The compliance mechanism under the Paris Agreement aims to be expert-based, transparent, and non-punitive. It is uncertain whether formal sanctions lead to better compliance, as seen in the experience with the Kyoto Protocol. Enforcement provisions did not effectively encourage compliance from some Parties. The compliance mechanism under the Paris Agreement aims to be expert-based, transparent, and non-punitive. Compliance procedures raised questions about reporting or implementation actions of some Kyoto Protocol Parties, which were corrected during the process. It is uncertain if formal sanctions improve compliance, as seen in the Kyoto Protocol experience. Many states fulfill treaty obligations even without enforcement mechanisms, suggesting that legal provisions or penalties may not be necessary for the effectiveness of the PA. The Public Works Committee majority staff doubts future compliance with the Paris Agreement, stating that signing and ratifying the agreement does not guarantee legal effect. They argue that non-binding targets in the agreement may not increase compliance. Processes are being developed to implement transparency and facilitative provisions of the agreement. Monitoring mechanisms will be in place to assess the effectiveness of these processes. Compliance with the long-term aspects and pledges made under the agreement will be closely watched. According to scientific models, significant reductions in cumulative GHG emissions would reduce temperature increase. Full compliance with the Paris Agreement could lead to near-zero GHG emissions by the second half of the century, stabilizing atmospheric concentrations and curbing global warming on a long-term scale. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C. Parties need to increase their GHG reductions faster than current pledges to meet these goals. While some INDCs show emissions rising until 2030, a few envision downward trajectories to 2050, but none commit to net zero emissions by mid-century. The assessment compared INDCs with GHG scenarios for a 2\u00b0C temperature limit, showing that full compliance would result in lower emissions than pre-INDC paths. Global emissions from implemented INDCs are expected to be lower by 2.8-3.3 Gt CO2 eq in 2025 and 3.7-5.3 Gt CO2 eq in 2030, with conditional components leading to even lower emissions. The gap between INDCs and least-cost paths to temperature targets below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C is expected to be larger. The PA and COP Decision have outlined tasks to bring the PA into force and ensure effective functioning. The APA met for the first time in May 2016, and CMA 1 was held in November 2016 after the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. Parties are pushing for quick decisions by the CMA on various topics identified in the work program from November 2016. Key elements include NDCs, adaptation communications, transparency framework, Global Stocktake, implementation and compliance mechanism, Adaptation Fund, public registries, Technology Mechanism assessments, cooperative approaches under Article 6, and accounting for financial resources. Sensitive negotiations are expected on controversial issues. The UNFCCC Secretariat provides a complete list of tasks arising from the Decision to adopt the PA. The CMA is tasked with developing guidance for NDCs to be clear, transparent, and comparable. A public NDC Registry has been established by the Secretariat. Parties must agree on guidance for measuring performance on NDCs. Countries are urged to submit long-term low GHG emission strategies by 2020. The Warsaw Mechanism's Executive Committee is reviewing recommendations for addressing displacement due to climate impacts. The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice under the UNFCCC is developing guidance for market-based systems for NDCs. The Adaptation Committee under the COP is working on methods to recognize adaptation efforts of developing countries and communicate Parties' priorities. The CMA will negotiate for a new collective agreement in the 2020s. The CMA will negotiate a new collective goal for climate finance by 2025. President Trump's announcement to withdraw from the PA raises questions about the withdrawal process and the United States' participation in PA meetings until withdrawal. The United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord, including the nationally determined contribution and the Green Climate Fund. Questions arise about the Administration's follow-up on reentering the agreement or negotiating a new one. Other Parties may adjust their strategies in response to the U.S. announcement, potentially shifting the balance of influence in negotiations."
