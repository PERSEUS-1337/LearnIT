The term \"provocation\" includes armed invasion, border violations, terrorism, and tests of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. Reports of North Korean involvement in drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings are not covered. Information is sourced from South Korean and Western sources, often denied by North Korea. Congressional concern remains over North Korean provocations. Since President Bush's 2002 \"axis of evil\" speech, tensions between North Korea and the United States have been rising due to North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs. Congressional concern remains over the potential escalation of hostilities. The sources used for this list of provocations include South Korean and Japanese newspapers, North Korean state media, and U.S. dailies. On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea without warning, leading to the Korean War. The conflict ended in July 1953 with an armistice.
