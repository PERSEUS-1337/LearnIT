Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic nation with a 700-mile border on the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Arctic region, known as Inuvikput to the indigenous population, is home to a population that has relied on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife for millennia. Since 1959, temperatures in the Arctic region of the United States have warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, more than twice the global average. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and thinning, with estimates that the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in summer within 30 years. These changes are impacting the indigenous communities and ecosystems, leading to health problems and increased mortality among the northern population. Increased mortality related to suicide and injuries is higher among Arctic populations compared to those in more moderate climates. Health disparities affecting Arctic people include higher rates of alcohol abuse, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), diabetes, high blood pressure, injury, and cancer. Alaska Native people have a FASD prevalence rate 3.5 times higher than all Alaskans. Suicide rates in Alaska are among the highest in the nation, with Alaska Native people having a rate 3 times higher than non-Native Alaskans and 4 times higher than the national average. Alaska Native children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty compared to Alaskans of other races. (10) The reasons for health disparities among northern populations are unclear, possibly due to various factors like toxic influences, socioeconomic status, and cultural changes. (11) Further research is needed to understand and address the disparities in public health problems in the Arctic. The Arctic Research Commission will conduct a 2-year study in collaboration with Federal health agencies to examine mental, behavioral, and physical health issues in the Arctic, focusing on Alaska. $1.2 million is authorized for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Additionally, a National Arctic Health Science Policy will be established. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will collaborate with other entities to develop a national Arctic health science policy, reviewing the 1984 policy by the American Public Health Association Task Force. A Desk for Arctic Health will be established within the Division to work with the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee. The Research Policy Committee, established under the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, collaborates with governmental entities and organizations involved in Arctic health issues, including the State of Alaska, University of Alaska, and indigenous Arctic populations. Collaboration with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research on indigenous Arctic health issues is also emphasized. Arctic health issues are addressed through collaboration between the National Institutes of Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and other international entities. SEC. 399U. ARCTIC HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include assessments for Arctic health impacts. Congress finds that health impact assessments are valuable tools for evaluating potential health benefits and risks of projects or policies in the Arctic. These assessments can provide recommendations to improve health outcomes and raise awareness of public health issues among decision-makers in non-traditional health sectors. The Secretary, through the CDC Director, is tasked with establishing this process. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish a program at the National Center of Environmental Health to support Arctic health impact assessments. Health impact assessments evaluate the potential effects of policies, programs, or projects on population health."
