    "content": "The Energy Storage Promotion and Deployment Act of 2015, also known as the Energy Storage Portfolio Standard, is an amendment to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. It establishes standards for energy storage in the United States. The Energy Storage Promotion and Deployment Act of 2015 defines energy storage devices as various technologies used to store energy for later use. It also defines a retail electric supplier as a person who sells electric energy to consumers. The term 'retail electric supplier' includes a person selling electric energy to consumers for purposes other than resale, with a minimum sales threshold. Exclusions apply to certain entities like the United States, States, and political subdivisions. Retail electric suppliers must comply with energy storage portfolio standards by specific dates. Sales to parent companies or affiliates are not considered sales to electric consumers. Retail electric suppliers must have energy storage devices with a power capacity rating of at least 1% of annual peak power demand by 2025, increasing to 2% by the same date. Retail electric suppliers must meet energy storage portfolio standards by having storage capacity that can provide electricity at the rated capacity for at least 1 hour, with specific requirements for the years 2021 through 2023. Compliance can be achieved through energy storage devices associated with retail customers, owned or operated by the supplier, or electrically connected to the supplier. Energy storage devices owned by third parties, regional transmission entities, or transmission/generation entities can provide power. Energy storage devices placed in operation before January 1, 2009, cannot be used for compliance with energy storage portfolio standards. Retail electric suppliers must certify compliance with the standards by specified dates, with the Secretary having the authority to grant waivers. The Secretary may grant a 1-year waiver to a retail electric supplier if compliance by the deadline would cause undue hardship to the supplier or ratepayers. Additional waivers can be provided as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The table of contents of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended by adding items relating to title VI. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include items related to rural and remote communities electrification grants and energy storage portfolio standard."
