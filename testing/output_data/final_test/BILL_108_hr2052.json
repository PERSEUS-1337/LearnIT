    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast Service Act of 2003\". Congress finds that localism is a key principle in the Communications Act and has guided broadcast industry regulation for decades. In 1996, Congress directed the FCC to limit national multiple television ownership to prevent excessive concentration of media ownership. If a limit to the national audience reach of television stations that one party may own or control is not codified, further national concentration may occur, threatening the independence of non-network-owned stations and turning local stations into passive conduits for network transmissions. The landscape of national television ownership has changed significantly in the past two decades, with networks now able to own multiple stations in local markets, engage in various programming ventures, and own popular cable and Internet content businesses. A cap on national multiple television ownership is necessary to preserve localism and prevent networks from dictating programming on local stations. The changes in national television ownership have strengthened network power, leading to potential threats to local interests. Network-owned stations have multiple interests to consider, including national advertising, syndicated programming, foreign sales, cable programming, and local station interests. This growth in network power has resulted in affiliation agreements being skewed in favor of networks. The Act aims to preserve localism in television broadcasting by promoting diversity, competition, and preventing excessive ownership concentration. Networks have skewed affiliation agreements in their favor, limiting the ability of non-network-owned affiliates to reject programming not in the best interest of local communities. Penalties are imposed for unauthorized preemptions and exceeding preemption baskets. The Act aims to prevent excessive ownership concentration in television broadcasting by establishing limits on the national audience reach of television stations owned or controlled by any one party. SEC. 3. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS. This section establishes limitations on the national audience reach of television stations owned or controlled by any one party. The Commission prohibits granting licenses for commercial TV stations if it would result in a party exceeding a 35% national audience reach. Parties exceeding this limit must divest themselves of excess licenses within a year. The section prohibits exceeding a 35% national audience reach for commercial TV station licenses. The term 'national audience reach' is defined as the total number of television households in Nielsen DMA markets where stations are located divided by the total national television households at the time of license grant, transfer, or assignment. No market can be counted more than once. The section limits national audience reach for commercial TV station licenses to 35%. A 'cognizable interest' is defined as any ownership interest of 5% or more in a licensee. Amendments are made to the Telecommunications Act of 1934 to align with these regulations."
