    "content": "The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue major disaster declarations in response to incidents that overwhelm tribal, state, and local governments. A major disaster is defined as a natural catastrophe or any fire, flood, or explosion causing severe damage, warranting federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) managed by FEMA provides federal assistance for major disaster declarations, supporting response and recovery efforts. This report outlines actual and projected obligations funded through the DRF between FY2000 and FY2015. Between FY2000 and FY2015, a total of 936 major disaster declarations resulted in over $133.6 billion in obligations from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The funding varied significantly for each disaster, and information on assistance programs can be found in the CRS Report R42845. Between FY2000 and FY2015, there were 936 major disaster declarations, totaling over $133.6 billion in obligations from the Disaster Relief Fund. The funding varied greatly for each disaster, with more than $48.6 billion obligated for disasters in FY2005 alone. Actual and projected obligations for all major disaster declarations are displayed in Figure 1, reflecting expenses incurred over several years following an incident. Major disaster declarations authorize funding for various purposes based on state needs. Funding for different purposes is authorized through major disaster declarations, including Public Assistance for emergency services and infrastructure repair, Individual Assistance for households, Hazard Mitigation Assistance for projects, FEMA administrative costs, and Mission Assignment for federal disaster assistance. The decision on types of assistance is made during or after the disaster declaration. The funding for various purposes is authorized through major disaster declarations, including Public Assistance for emergency services and infrastructure repair, Individual Assistance for households, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance for projects. In addition to major disaster assistance, there are other forms of assistance funded through the DRF, such as Emergency Declarations and Fire Management Assistance Grants. Emergency Declarations are made to assist tribal, state, and local efforts before an incident occurs. Total obligations for emergency declarations from FY2000 to FY2015 typically result in lower levels compared to major disaster declarations. Total obligations for emergency declarations from FY2000 to FY2015 were $2.37 billion, while Fire Management Assistance Grants totaled $1.21 billion during the same period. Floods are the most common disaster declarations, with the National Flood Insurance Program providing assistance. Numerous CRS reports cover DRF issues and disaster declaration processes. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on disaster assistance and FEMA programs, including FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, FEMA's Disaster Declaration Process, and FEMA's Public Assistance Grant Program. The reports offer background information and considerations for Congress. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides disaster assistance to states, the District of Columbia, tribal lands, and various territories. Obligations from the DRF for major disaster declarations in specific regions can be requested."
