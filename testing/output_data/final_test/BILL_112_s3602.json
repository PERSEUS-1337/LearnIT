The Food Stamp Restoration Act of 2012 establishes a food stamp block grant program for fiscal years 2014 through 2021. Participating states must meet requirements including work, drug testing, citizenship verification, and limitations on benefit uses. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) grant amount for each participating State is determined based on the number of legal residents with income below 100 percent of the poverty line in the State compared to all participating States. Each State receiving a SNAP grant must submit an annual report to the Secretary by January 1, detailing the program's structure, administration costs, rainy day fund status, and participation statistics. The Comptroller General of the United States conducts an annual audit on the effectiveness of the nutritional assistance block grant program and how each State implements it. A report is submitted to Congress by June 30 detailing the audit results and the State's plans for the food stamp program, including eligibility and fraud prevention measures. The State receiving a grant under this section can use it to provide food stamps to residents as they see fit. The grant funds must remain available to the State for 5 years, after which they will either revert to the Federal Government for deficit reduction or be used to reduce the Federal debt. The curr_chunk states that the Secretary of the Treasury can determine the appropriate manner for the use of grant funds.
