    "content": "The budget cycle involves practices by Congress and the President that impact revenue and expenditure trends. Budget baselines measure legislative changes' effects on the budget outlook and are crucial for policy evaluation. The process spans four years, starting with agencies compiling budget requests overseen by OMB. The President submits the budget to Congress around February, eight months before the fiscal year begins. The budget resolution, agreed upon by the House and Senate, sets the framework for budgetary legislation. If there is disagreement, a \"deeming resolution\" may be used. Appropriations Committees review agency funding requests and propose budget authority levels. Congress passes appropriations acts to set funding. During the fiscal year, Congress and OMB oversee the execution of the budget, with year-end audits conducted by the Department of the Treasury and the Government Accountability Office. Budget baseline projections are used to project the future impact of current laws and measure the effect of future legislation on spending and revenues, included in both the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution. Understanding the assumptions and components in budget baselines is crucial. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) computes current-law baseline projections using assumptions set out in budget enforcement legislation. Changes in models or assumptions can significantly impact deficits, receipts, or expenditures. Policy uncertainties affecting baseline levels have decreased due to resolved tax policy questions and enacted spending controls. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently set individual tax rates, while discretionary spending levels are constrained by Budget Control Act of 2011 caps and automatic reductions. The CBO baseline projections are influenced by budget enforcement legislation such as the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent bipartisan budget acts. It assumes restricted discretionary budget authority and certain expiring tax provisions not being extended, leading to lower spending and higher revenue projections. Macroeconomic assumptions also impact baseline estimates. The CBO's baseline projections, influenced by budget enforcement legislation, show rising deficits due to increases in mandatory spending on Social Security and Medicare. Inflation, interest rates, and economic assumptions also impact future deficit levels. Baseline projections show increasing debt held by the public due to budget deficits and federal loan activity, influenced by existing debt, economic growth, and interest rates. Debt was 77.0% of GDP in FY2016 and is projected to reach 91.2% by FY2027. Alternative policy assumptions could lead to a budget deficit increase of over $1.0 trillion if discretionary spending caps are lifted and tax provisions extended. Federal deficits are projected to grow beyond the 10-year forecast window, with increased outlays mainly due to rising health care and retirement costs. Between FY2009 and FY2012, spending and revenue deviated significantly from historical averages, primarily due to the economic downturn and policies enacted in response to financial turmoil. In FY2016, the U.S. government spent $3.85 trillion and collected $3.27 trillion in revenue, resulting in a deficit of $0.58 trillion, or 3.2% of GDP. The deficit in FY2016 was $0.58 trillion, higher than the average deficit from FY1947 to FY2016. Federal outlays are divided into discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and net interest. Mandatory spending includes entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, with Congress setting eligibility requirements and benefits. Net interest is the government's interest payments on debt. Total outlays as a percentage of GDP have fluctuated over the years, reaching a peak of 24.4% in FY2009 and falling to 20.3% in FY2014 before rising again to 20.9% in FY2016. Under the CBO baseline, outlays are projected to continue rising, reaching 23.6% of GDP in FY2027. Discretionary spending was the largest source of federal outlays in FY1968 but has gradually declined since then. Discretionary spending as a share of the economy peaked at 9.1% of GDP in FY2010, but has since declined to 6.4% in FY2016. Projections show a further decrease to 5.9% by FY2021 and 5.4% by FY2027, mainly due to restrictions from the Budget Control Act. Mandatory spending has consistently grown over the years, reaching 13.2% of GDP in FY2016 from 4.7% in FY1962. It peaked at 14.5% in FY2009 due to increases in income security programs during the recession. The economic recovery has led to lower mandatory spending on certain programs. Mandatory spending has been increasing over the years, reaching 13.2% of GDP in FY2016. It is projected to continue rising towards 15.4% of GDP in FY2027, with growth in entitlement programs. In FY2016, mandatory spending accounted for 63.0% of total outlays, while discretionary spending was 30.8% and net interest was 6.2%. The largest mandatory programs include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, making up 48.4% of federal spending. By FY2027, mandatory spending is expected to increase to 65.0% of total outlays. In FY2027, mandatory spending is projected to rise to 65.0% of total outlays, while discretionary spending's share is projected to fall to 22.7%. Net interest spending is projected to increase to 12.4% of total outlays. Some experts argue that reductions in mandatory spending are necessary to achieve significant cuts in federal spending. Budget and social policy experts warn that cuts in mandatory spending could disrupt many households as it comprises a significant portion of the social safety net. Despite recent declines in the budget deficit, future projections show increasing deficits and high debt levels, prompting the need for further action to address long-term fiscal health. In FY2016, federal revenue collections totaled 17.8% of GDP, higher than the historical average since FY1947. Real federal revenues have increased in recent years due to an improving economy. Revenue collection was depressed between FY2009 and FY2013, but ATRA increased revenue certainty. Individual income taxes have been the largest revenue source, followed by social insurance and corporate income taxes. Projections show revenues reaching 18.4% of GDP in FY2027. In FY2016, individual income tax revenues totaled 8.4% of GDP, while social insurance programs increased to 6.1% of GDP. Corporate income and other outlays decreased to 1.6% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Budget deficits or surpluses are determined by the annual difference between revenue and outlays, impacting the level of federal debt and interest payments. Between FY2009 and FY2012, annual budgets as a percentage of GDP were higher than deficits in any four-year period since FY1945. The FY2016 unified budget deficit was $585 billion, or 3.2% of GDP. Excluding off-budget items, the on-budget FY2016 federal deficit was $620 billion. The FY2017 budget deficit is estimated to be $693 billion, or 3.6% of GDP, due to decreases in real revenues and a small increase in real spending. In FY2016, the unified budget deficit was $585 billion, or 3.2% of GDP. The federal debt is composed of debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt, with debt held by the public being the most relevant in macroeconomic terms. Congress historically sets a ceiling on federal debt through a legislatively established limit. The debt limit imposes fiscal accountability on Congress and the President to authorize further federal borrowing when nearing the statutory limit. It can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage finances, leading to inconvenience and uncertainty. A binding debt limit could prevent timely payment on federal obligations, resulting in default and reduced ability to borrow funds on advantageous terms. The debt limit can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage finances, leading to inconvenience and uncertainty. It may result in default, increased debt, negative outcomes in global economies, and penalties for late payments. This could also affect the perceived credit risk of federal government borrowing, potentially reducing fiscal space. Interest payments on the debt in FY2016 amounted to $240 billion, or 1.3% of GDP, influenced by market interest rates and the size of the federal debt. Low interest rates have kept payments below historical averages, but concerns exist about potential future strain on the budget as interest costs could rise with economic recovery. Interest rates are projected to gradually rise, resulting in net interest payments of $818 billion (2.9% of GDP) in FY2027, potentially exceeding historical averages. Recent legislation like the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent revisions have significant ramifications for the federal budget. Congress has enacted measures to increase the debt limit, require deficit reduction, and impose caps on discretionary budget authority. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made changes to the federal tax code. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over a period of ten years. Subsequent legislation like the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2016 and 2017 made changes to the federal tax code and extended certain provisions. The BBA 2015 allowed for the reinstatement of the statutory debt limit in March 2017. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over ten years. It included deficit reduction provisions such as savings from discretionary spending caps and the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Joint Committee failed to reach an agreement, triggering automatic spending reductions starting in FY2013. These reductions included lowering annual caps on discretionary budget authority and automatic cuts to certain mandatory spending. The BCA measures were later amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) and subsequent Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015 raised caps on defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority, extended mandatory spending reduction measures, and made offsetting changes in spending and revenue. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) made changes to tax policy, including the extension of tax cuts for taxpayers below certain income thresholds and an increase in tax rates for those above. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) increased the top tax rate on long-term capital gains and dividends to 20% and reinstated the personal exemption phase-out (PEP) and limitation on itemized deductions (Pease) for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $250,000. ATRA also extended tax changes to various credits, provided marriage tax penalty relief, and modified education-related tax incentives. Additionally, ATRA included a permanent \"patch\" for the alternative minimum tax and established permanent estate and gift tax rules. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act) was enacted to address tax extenders. The PATH Act, enacted as Division Q of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), extended 56 tax provisions that expired in 2014. It included extensions for two, five, and permanent provisions. No subsequent legislation has been enacted for provisions that expired in 2016. Congress enacts laws for discretionary appropriations annually, providing federal agencies with authority to incur obligations for a single fiscal year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided continuing appropriations for federal agencies without regular appropriations through the end of FY2017. Funding lapses may lead to partial or full shutdown of federal operations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) suspended the debt limit until March 15, 2017. The debt limit was reinstated at $19.809 trillion on March 16, 2017. As of April 30, 2017, federal debt subject to limit was approximately $19.809 trillion, with $14.279 trillion held by the public. Secretary Mnuchin requested that the debt limit be raised and announced extraordinary measures. The Trump Administration submitted its FY2018 budget to Congress on May 23, 2017, outlining national priorities and policy initiatives. Total FY2018 outlays would be $4,094 billion if policies are fully implemented. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes total outlays of $4,094 billion and revenues of $3,654 billion, resulting in a $440 billion deficit. The budget includes significant spending cuts, with reductions in nondefense discretionary programs, Medicaid, and other mandatory programs. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes significant spending cuts, including reductions in nondefense discretionary programs, Medicaid, and other mandatory programs. The budget also includes cuts attributable to the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, as well as net interest spending reductions. Additionally, there is an increase in infrastructure spending and changes to the defense budget, resulting in an increase in discretionary defense outlays. The budget does not include an explicit policy proposal for federal tax reform but lists core principles such as reduced individual and corporate income tax rates. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes significant spending cuts, including reductions in nondefense discretionary programs, Medicaid, and other mandatory programs. It also includes cuts related to the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, as well as net interest spending reductions. The budget features an increase in infrastructure spending and changes to the defense budget, resulting in higher discretionary defense outlays. Additionally, there are core principles listed for federal tax reform, such as reduced individual and corporate income tax rates, a switch to a territorial corporate income tax system, modifications to tax deductions, and the repeal of the estate tax and 3.8% surtax on capital gains earnings. The budget aims to make these reforms deficit-neutral and includes an allowance for a repeal of ACA-related taxes, leading to a revenue reduction of $1.00 trillion over the FY2018 to FY2027 window. The budget uses different economic projections than those of congressional budget operations, projecting a rise in the real economic growth rate from 1.6% in FY2016 to 3.0% per year over the FY2021 through FY2027 period. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget includes economic growth projections of 1.9% per year from FY2021 through FY2027, aiming to reduce deficits by $2.06 trillion over the FY2018 to FY2027 window. The budget provides two deficit projections, with the first being a Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) baseline. The projections differ from those of congressional budget operations, projecting a rise in real economic growth rate from 1.6% in FY2016 to 3.0% per year over the FY2021 through FY2027 period. The FY2018 budget includes deficit projections under current law and the proposed budget. The projected deficits under current law are $413 billion in FY2018 and $1.34 trillion in FY2027, totaling $8.78 trillion over FY2018-FY2027. The proposed budget projects a deficit of $440 billion in FY2018, decreasing to a surplus of $16 billion in FY2027, with a total deficit of $3.15 trillion over the same period. The President's budget incorporates economic effects in deficit projections. The President's budget includes a line item for economic feedback effects, projecting a higher growth rate due to productivity-enhancing policies. Some analysts argue that the budget double-counted deficit reduction from economic growth. Without economic feedbacks, the proposed budget would show a deficit of $442 billion in FY2018. The President's proposed budget projects a deficit of $442 billion in FY2018, gradually declining to $480 billion in FY2027. The budget aims to reduce deficits by $5.63 trillion over the next decade compared to the pre-policy baseline. Adjustments to discretionary spending caps are also proposed. The Budget Control Act (BCA) placed limits on discretionary budget authority in 2011, with provisions for spending cuts. Congress and the President have made modifications to the BCA to allow for increases in discretionary spending. The President's budget for FY2018 increases the cap on discretionary defense spending by $54 billion while decreasing nondefense spending by the same amount. Defense spending caps decrease over time, while nondefense spending caps increase. In FY2021, the President's budget proposes to increase defense cap by $52 billion and decrease nondefense cap by $121 billion. If BCA caps are extended through FY2027, defense cap would increase by $42 billion and nondefense cap would decrease by $260 billion. Congress focuses on FY2018 budget after passing FY2017 appropriations. Budget committees gather information from various sources to develop budget resolution. The discretionary budget authority for FY2018 is set at $549 billion for defense activities and $515 billion for nondefense activities, $5 billion lower than FY2017. Ongoing budget challenges may lead to congressional action, with a focus on deficit reduction and long-term budget sustainability. Entitlement program spending is expected to increase deficits, prompting discussions on achieving fiscal sustainability. Budget issues will be prominent in near-term congressional debates, including FY2018 appropriations legislation and potential revisions to deficit reduction measures under the BCA. Congress may revisit deficit reduction measures imposed by the BCA, including discretionary caps on defense and nondefense budget authority through FY2021 and spending reduction measures on certain mandatory programs through FY2025. Modifications to the discretionary caps were made each year from FY2013 through FY2017, increasing annual caps on defense and nondefense spending equally. Congress may also consider modifying the statutory debt limit, with Treasury currently implementing extraordinary measures to stay under the debt limit. The latest CBO budget forecast projects a larger nominal budget deficit in FY2017 ($559 billion) than in FY2015 ($466 billion), potentially reducing the time extraordinary measures can postpone a binding debt limit. Deficit spending can help smooth outlays and revenues to shield taxpayers and program beneficiaries from economic shocks in the short term, but persistent deficits lead to growing federal debt and higher interest payments. The growing federal debt from persistent deficits may lead to higher interest payments and adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term. Large deficits will eventually need to be reduced through tax increases, spending cuts, or both. Analysts believe additional deficit reduction is necessary to ensure long-term fiscal solvency, especially with rising retirement and healthcare costs impacting government spending. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term due to rising health care costs and an aging population. CBO projects that federal spending on health programs will increase from 5.5% of GDP in FY2017 to 8.8% in FY2047. Analysts agree that additional deficit reduction is necessary to address the growing federal debt and ensure long-term fiscal solvency. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term due to rising health care costs and an aging population. CBO projects that federal spending on health programs will increase from 5.5% of GDP in FY2017 to 8.8% in FY2047. Analysts agree that additional deficit reduction is necessary to address the growing federal debt and ensure long-term fiscal solvency. It seems probable that spending on these programs will rise as a share of GDP over time, with interest payments on the debt projected to consume a greater share of future federal spending. CBO projects that net interest payments will grow rapidly, from 1.4% of GDP in FY2017 to 5.2% of GDP in FY2047. GAO's simulations project that debt held by the public as a share of GDP will exceed historical highs in the next 15 to 25 years. Maintaining future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in all spending other than for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, or reining in the costs of these programs. Maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at today's level in FY2047 would require significant deficit reduction through spending cuts or revenue increases. To bring debt levels down to historical averages, even larger spending reductions or revenue increases would be necessary. Increasing revenues is an alternative to decreased spending for deficit reduction. Increasing revenues through modifications to the federal tax system is an alternative to decreased spending for deficit reduction. Recent tax reform proposals aim to be \"revenue neutral\" over a 10-year budget window, with the goal of not significantly altering the long-run budgetary outlook. The amount of fiscal space available for increases in federal debt depends on government borrowing that creditors are willing to finance. The amount of fiscal space available for increases in federal debt depends on the current size of the debt, how fast it is increasing relative to GDP, deficits, borrowing rate, and economic growth. There is uncertainty about when investors would stop financing federal borrowing, but with interest rates currently low, there is little concern in the short run. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides data and analysis to Congress, including baseline estimates of outlays and revenues. The Congressional Budget Office issues Budget and Economic Outlook reports with baseline estimates of outlays and revenues. These reports are used to evaluate legislative proposals' impact on spending and revenue collection. The CBO also evaluates budgetary consequences of legislative proposals, while the Joint Committee on Taxation focuses on revenue proposals. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases publications on the future fiscal health of the United States, including The Long-Term Budget Outlook and Budget Options volumes. CBO provides projections on federal budget over 75 years, policy options impact on spending and revenues over 10 years, and arguments for and against each policy. The President's budget includes five major volumes projecting fiscal outlook and proposed spending levels for federal government departments. The Historical Tables volume provides budget data dating back to 1962, along with spending levels for federal government departments. The Department of the Treasury's Green Book offers further details on revenue proposals in the budget."
