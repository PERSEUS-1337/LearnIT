    "content": "Congressional rules establish a division of responsibility where policy and funding are kept separate. Authorization legislation establishes, continues, or modifies federal programs but does not provide funding. Appropriations measures are separate and provide the authority to spend from the Treasury. This distinction is a construct of congressional rules and practices. The House of Congress has the authority to enforce, modify, waive, repeal, or ignore its rules independently from the Senate. The origin of separating general legislation from appropriations dates back to 1835 to address delays in enacting appropriations. This rule was further solidified in the 25th Congress (1837-1839) stating that no appropriation should be included in general appropriation bills. The rule of separating general legislation from appropriations was established in 1835 to address delays in enacting appropriations. This rule was later expanded to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures, and in 1876, it was further clarified to only allow amendments that retrench expenditures. The provision granted the Appropriations Committee authority to include legislative provisions in appropriations bills that reduced federal officials' number and salary, compensation of those paid from the Treasury, or amounts covered in the bill. Initially broad, the rule was later defined to focus on these specific areas until it was eliminated in 1885 by the 49th Congress. The Holman rule, initially eliminated in 1885, was reintroduced in the 52nd and 53rd Congresses but dropped again until the 62nd Congress. Amendments in the 98th Congress narrowed the rule to allow retrenchments reducing money amounts in bills, changing when such amendments could be offered. The Holman rule was reintroduced in the 52nd and 53rd Congresses but dropped until the 62nd Congress. Amendments in the 98th Congress narrowed the rule to allow retrenchments reducing money amounts in bills, changing when such amendments could be offered. In the 106th Congress, further changes were made to clarify that retrenchment amendments are in order if a motion to end consideration of the bill is rejected. The Holman rule currently allows for provisions changing existing law. The Holman rule allows for provisions changing existing law in appropriation bills, providing a limited exception to the general prohibition in House rules against legislation in such measures. For the 115th Congress, a separate order was included in H.Res. 5, allowing retrenchments reducing money amounts in bills. The Holman rule allows for provisions changing existing law in appropriation bills, providing a limited exception to the general prohibition in House rules against legislation in such measures. A provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by reducing amounts of money covered by the bill shall apply to any provision or amendment that reduces money amounts in the bill, the number and salary of officers of the United States, or the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. The purpose of this provision is to provide Members with additional tools to reduce spending during consideration of the regular general appropriation bill. The separate order under H.Res. 787 (115th Congress) amended House Resolution 5, but was not adopted for the 116th Congress. The House interprets the rule through precedents, narrowing its application over time. Precedents established that retrenchments must be a necessary result of legislation to be in order. Legislation conferring discretionary authority to terminate employment is not sufficient for retrenchment. The Holman rule exception does not allow legislation that confers discretionary authority to terminate federal employees' employment if the resulting savings are speculative. It only applies when there is an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill, achieved through specific means like the cessation of government activities or a reduction in total appropriations. The exception does not apply to limitations or broad legislative language without a reduction of funds in the bill. The Holman rule exception does not allow legislation that confers discretionary authority to terminate federal employees' employment if the resulting savings are speculative. It only applies when there is an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill, achieved through specific means like the cessation of government activities or a reduction in total appropriations. The House has held that certain provisions may qualify as retrenchments, but proposals that effectively repeal laws under which appropriations were authorized do not fall under this exception. The separate order for the 115th Congress reinstated language from 1983, potentially allowing for retrenchments resulting from legislative provisions. The Holman rule allows for retrenchments such as reducing the number and salary of officers or consolidating and eliminating offices. Precedents show proposals to limit pay for employees, reduce officers, replace civilian employees with lower-paid U.S. Army personnel, and cap salaries. The Holman rule allows for retrenchments like reducing salaries and consolidating offices. An amendment in the 115th Congress aimed to cap the salary of the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration at $1, but it failed. The rule does not permit retrenchments from funds outside the pending appropriations bill, and exceptions must be relevant. The rule is not meant to expand the scope of a bill. The Holman rule allows for retrenchments like reducing salaries and consolidating offices, but it does not permit retrenchments from funds outside the pending appropriations bill. House precedent establishes that broad legislative provisions or amendments to specific appropriation bills affecting federal employees in other measures may not be in order. During the 115th Congress, an amendment to abolish the Budget Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office failed to pass. The House Parliamentarian is the definitive authority on questions regarding chamber precedents and procedures, with salaries totaling $15 million transferred to the Office of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office."
