    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building, Renovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools Act\". Congress findings show that the average public school in America is 42 years old, with rapid deterioration after 40 years. It would cost $112 billion to bring all schools into good condition, and one-third need extensive repair. Many schools lack infrastructure for necessary technologies. The Federal Government can assist State and local governments with school construction, renovation, and repair needs by providing low-interest loans for paying interest on related bonds, without impeding on local control. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"bond,\" \"Governor,\" \"local educational agency,\" and \"public school facility.\" The term \"public school facility\" excludes certain athletic or non-government-owned facilities. A qualified school construction bond is defined as a bond issued for the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility. It must be issued by a State entity or local government, designated for this purpose, and have a term not exceeding 15 years. A stabilization fund refers to the fund established under section 5302 of the Act. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States, along with other territories and entities. Loans for school construction bond interest payments are addressed in Section 4. The State shall make loans to entities and governments for interest payments on school construction bonds. Requests for assistance must be submitted to the Treasury Secretary. Repayment of loans plus interest is required at the average prime lending rate.

The Secretary of the Treasury has federal responsibilities. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education are jointly responsible for ensuring proper distribution of funds under the Act.

They do not have authority to approve school construction plans.

The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education jointly notify each State of the funds available for borrowing under this Act."
