    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 replaced the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) as the primary federal legislation for employment and job training. WIA Title I authorizes job training services for unemployed or underemployed individuals through formula grant programs for youth, adults, and dislocated workers. These funds support employment and training activities at One-Stop centers administered by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 provides funding for employment and training programs through state formula grants. In program year (PY) 2010, $3 billion of the total $5.5 billion Title I funding was allocated through state formula grants. The dislocated worker program, the largest of the three Title I grant programs, offers approximately $1.2 billion annually in formula grants to states for employment and training activities for unemployed individuals. The dislocated worker program under the Workforce Investment Act provides formula grants to states, with funding volatility intensified by the recent recession. Some states have seen funding declines exceeding 40%, impacting those with high unemployment levels the most. This unpredictability goes against the program's aim of allocating funds effectively. The dislocated worker program faces challenges in effectively allocating funds to states, leading to funding volatility and difficulties in planning and operating responsive programs during economic dislocations. This unpredictability hinders states' ability to provide employment and training services, especially during times of rising unemployment. The dislocated worker program faces challenges in effectively allocating funds to states, leading to funding volatility and difficulties in planning and operating responsive programs during economic dislocations. There is a fundamental misalignment between the formula factors and the intended population of the formula, as it does not specifically identify dislocated workers. As WIA reauthorization is considered, there is interest in improving the formula design to better align with the goals of the dislocated worker program. The dislocated worker program allocation formula is being examined for potential problems in alignment with program aims and volatility in funding. WIA Title I state formula grant funds are allocated to states for adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs, with a portion retained for statewide activities. Alternative design options are being analyzed to improve alignment and reduce funding volatility. Statewide and local Workforce Investment Boards (WIB) receive WIA Title I state formula grant funds for employment and training activities. Statewide activities include evaluations, technical assistance, and accountability systems. Local activities focus on operating One-Stop delivery systems and providing services to participants. Adult and dislocated worker programs follow a sequential service strategy with core, intensive, and training services. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) provides services in three levels: core, intensive, and training. Individuals must progress from core to intensive services based on their ability to obtain or retain employment for self-sufficiency. Training is available for those who are unable to secure self-sufficient employment after intensive services, and they must have the necessary skills and qualifications for successful participation. The dislocated worker program under the Workforce Investment Act targets a specific subpopulation of unemployed workers who are unable to obtain other grant assistance for training services. It receives a significant annual allocation of over $200 million to fund the National Reserve, distinguishing it from the WIA programs for youth and adults. The National Reserve receives over $200 million annually to fund programs for dislocated workers, providing training and services to individuals aged 18 and older who have been terminated or laid off. Dislocated workers, including those facing layoffs or facility closures, are eligible for services under the Workforce Investment Act. The definition of a dislocated worker is broad, encompassing various circumstances such as anticipated facility closings and self-employment. Eligibility is based on dislocation due to termination or facility closure, with no requirement related to the cause of dislocation. The classification as \"adult\" or \"dislocated\" does not impact the services provided through One-Stop centers. The Dislocated Worker program under the Workforce Investment Act provides core services, intensive services, and training to dislocated workers through One-Stop centers. Funding consists of National Reserve and state formula grants, with 20% allocated to National Emergency Grants. State formula grants are distributed based on a three-factor formula. The Dislocated Worker program under the Workforce Investment Act provides funding to states based on a three-factor formula. States must reserve a portion of the allocation for employment and training activities and rapid response activities, with a maximum of 40% reserved for statewide activities. States are required to carry out rapid response activities to assist dislocated workers in obtaining reemployment. The Dislocated Worker program provides funding for rapid response activities to assist workers in obtaining reemployment quickly after a dislocation event, such as mass layoffs or a disaster. Services may include onsite contact with employers, access to training programs, labor-management agreements, emergency assistance, and support for the local community seeking economic development aid. The state reservation for statewide and rapid response activities is suballocated to local areas based on a state-developed formula considering insured unemployment data, unemployment concentrations, plant closing and mass layoff data, declining industries data, farmer-rancher economic hardship, and long-term unemployment. Funding for state formula grants fluctuated between $1.150 billion in PY2003 and $1.272 billion in PY2001, with a level of $1.184 billion in PY2010. Funding for state formula grants averaged around $1.182 billion from PY2005 to PY2010. This section discusses key concepts in allocating federal funds to states and localities. The WIA state formula grant program allocates federal funds to states based on population-based factors targeting areas with the greatest need. Allocation factors determine each jurisdiction's share of the total amount, with a cap on total federal spending. The dislocated worker formula design and performance issues are also examined in this section. Formula programs allocate funds based on various factors such as economic need, population, characteristics, and education levels. Some programs also consider historic spending patterns. Formula programs allocate funds based on factors like economic need, population, and education levels. TANF block grants are distributed using historic spending data, which can significantly impact resource distribution. Data sources used in formulas are crucial, as outdated or revised data may not reflect current needs. Various features like \"hold-harmless\" provisions and minimum funding guarantees are used to stabilize annual funding allocations. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) formulas focus on distributing funds based on unemployment measures. The dislocated worker formula considers total unemployment, long-term unemployment, and excess unemployment. It does not use features like ceilings and floors for stability. Funding for the program is distributed to states through a formula grant outlined in WIA Section 132(b)(2)(B)(ii). Each factor in the formula is equally weighted, totaling approximately $400 million. ETA provides guidance on formula descriptions and data factor definitions. The DW formula in WIA allocates approximately $400 million based on factors from CETA and JTPA. Funding is distributed among eligible entities based on relative unemployment and excess unemployed persons compared to other jurisdictions. The JTPA added long-term unemployment as a factor in allocating funds for training and employment services. Unlike the WIA Title I adult activities funding formula, the dislocated workers' formula does not include small-state minimum provisions, hold-harmless provisions, or stop-gain provisions. Allocations are based on changes in formula factors and use unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Formula factors are derived from statistical modeling that includes data from the Current Population Survey. The allocation of funds for training and employment services under the WIA program is based on formula factors derived from statistical modeling using unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The formula factors include the state share of total unemployed individuals in the U.S., with the official concept of unemployment defined by the BLS. The dislocated worker formula uses a 12-month average level of unemployment to calculate each state's relative share of funds. For example, in New Jersey, there were an average of 372,712 unemployed individuals each month from October 2008 to September 2009. In the 12-month period from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009, New Jersey had a relative share of 2.79% of the total number of unemployed individuals in the U.S. The excess unemployed factor in the dislocated worker formula is calculated based on the number of unemployed individuals in excess of an unemployment rate of 4.5%, with each state having a relative share. For example, in New Jersey, there were an average of 168,689 excess unemployed individuals. In New Jersey, there were 168,689 individuals counted as \"excess unemployed\" in the 12-month period ending September 30, 2009. This was calculated by subtracting the number of unemployed individuals from the total unemployed, resulting in a relative share of 2.66% compared to all states. States with unemployment rates at or below 4.5% receive a relative share of zero. The allocation of funds for dislocated workers is based on the state's share of long-term unemployed individuals in the U.S. The calculation includes the number of individuals unemployed for 15 weeks or more, with the reference period varying between calendar years and monthly averages. For example, in New Jersey, there were an average of 186,300 long-term unemployed individuals. In New Jersey, there were 186,300 long-term unemployed individuals, accounting for 3.0% of the total in the U.S. The focus is on aligning the dislocated worker formula with statutory intent and addressing volatility. The formula targets a specific subset of the unemployed population, requiring narrow scope factors for measurement. The dislocated worker formula aims to align with statutory intent and address volatility by examining if fluctuations in funding correspond to actual need. It is crucial for the formula to accurately capture the target population defined by the WIA as \"dislocated workers.\" The dislocated worker formula categorizes individuals based on their circumstances, such as termination, attachment to the labor force, substantial layoff, or self-employment. This aligns with the WIA definition of dislocated workers and ensures funding matches actual need. The dislocated worker formula aligns with the WIA definition of dislocated workers, categorizing individuals based on circumstances like termination, self-employment, or layoff. Data for the formula factors is drawn from the Current Population Survey. The dislocated worker state formula grant factors are based on unemployed individuals as measured in the CPS survey. CPS data provides information on occupation and industry, but does not perfectly match WIA definitions of dislocated workers. Data limitations include not providing reasons for termination. The dislocated worker state formula grant factors are based on unemployed individuals from the CPS survey, which does not consider reasons for termination or labor force attachment. This leads to an over-representation of dislocated workers, including those who have lost their job for any reason and may not have sufficient attachment to the labor force. The CPS data includes self-employed workers in the count of unemployed individuals but does not provide a separate count or information on the cause of unemployment. Displaced homemakers are also included in the data but not as a separately identified group, making it difficult to determine how many meet the criteria. The CPS data, while accurate and timely, do not capture the WIA-defined population of \"dislocated\" workers due to limitations in measuring attachment to the labor market. The CPS data used for allocating funds in the dislocated worker formula does not specifically focus on the population targeted by WIA, leading to volatility in state allocations. The formula is based on unemployed workers in general, with some consideration for long-term unemployed individuals, but not specifically on dislocated workers. State allocations can vary significantly from year to year, highlighting the need for a more targeted approach. The dislocated worker funding allocation data shows significant volatility in state allocations from year to year. Out of 468 state-years between PY2002 and PY2010, 23% experienced annual allocation changes of at least 30% from the previous year. On average, 12 states per year had swings of greater than 30% in funding allocations. The dislocated worker funding allocation data exhibits significant volatility, with 13 states seeing increases of at least 30% and 12 states experiencing decreases of at least 30% from PY2008 to PY2009. While some volatility is expected in the formula, excessive fluctuations can hinder states' ability to plan employment and training activities effectively. The formula is designed to accommodate some volatility to reflect changes in the dislocated worker population, but extreme volatility can lead to challenges in aligning allocations with state unemployment changes. The funding allocation for dislocated workers shows significant volatility, especially driven by excess unemployment. Year-to-year funding swings in states like Michigan with high unemployment have raised concerns about sustaining programs. Formulas based on relative share may not accurately reflect changes in factor values. The use of a threshold can worsen this issue. The dislocated worker formula includes a factor of excess unemployment to target areas with worse employment problems. The threshold of 4.5% for excess unemployment is arbitrary and does not consider a state's performance relative to national or recent unemployment rates. This measure aims to allocate additional funds to states with the highest unemployment levels. The dislocated worker formula allocates additional funds to states with high unemployment levels, creating volatility in funding allocations. Unlike other programs, it lacks \"hold harmless\" provisions, leading to substantial shifts in allotments between states. The formula is based on a state's share of unemployment, with no features affecting the calculation other than the weights themselves. The excess unemployment factor in the dislocated worker funding formula allocates funds to states with unemployment rates above 4.5%. States below this threshold receive no funding from this factor. In PY2008, 23 states split one-third of the funding, while in PY2009, 37 states did the same. In PY2009, 14 more states shared dislocated worker funding, with Michigan receiving $87.4 million from the excess unemployment factor. In PY2009, Michigan experienced a decline in dislocated worker funding to $75.1 million due to a change in its relative share of excess unemployment. Despite an increase in excess unemployment, Michigan lost $55.8 million of its funding. Florida, on the other hand, had no excess unemployment in PY2008 but had 141,829 individuals in excess unemployment in PY2009, receiving $0 in funding from this factor in PY2008 and $31.4 million in PY2009. In PY2009, Florida's total dislocated worker funding increased to $77.1 million, with $25.8 million attributed to the changing relative share of excess unemployment. A comparison of excess unemployed and funding allocations from PY2009 to PY2010 is illustrated in Figure 1. The excess unemployed factor contributed approximately $395 million to each state's overall funding change in PY2010. The use of a fixed threshold for defining excess unemployment does not always match actual economic conditions, leading to divergent funding allocations among states. The dislocated worker formula led to varying funding allocations among states with similar increases in excess unemployed. Some states received more funds while others received less compared to previous years, even when experiencing similar levels of excess unemployment. This resulted in funds being transferred away from states with persistently high unemployment. In PY2010, 12 states received no allocation from the excess unemployed factor, indicating a shift in funding distribution. In PY2010, 12 states that previously received no allocation from the excess unemployed factor now triggered for funding. This shift in funding distribution was necessary due to the addition of new states receiving allocations, leading to reallocation from states currently receiving funds. The dislocated worker program's formula may cause funding mismatches due to changes in economic conditions and formula factors. In PY2009 to PY2010, changes in formula factors led to shifts in funding allocation for California's dislocated worker program. Despite increases in unemployment, allocations from certain factors decreased, resulting in a loss of $19.9 million in total funding for California. In PY2009 to PY2010, California's dislocated worker program funding decreased by $19.9 million due to changes in allocation factors, primarily driven by a drop in funding from the excess unemployment factor. Despite overall increases in unemployment levels, funding from certain factors decreased, leading to the loss in total funding for California. The funding for dislocated worker programs fluctuates due to changes in allocation factors, with long-term unemployed factor showing less volatility compared to excess unemployed factor. This volatility affects funding intensity and per capita funding, leading to challenges in providing consistent services. Figure 2 illustrates the funding distribution from each factor. The funding for dislocated worker programs fluctuates based on allocation factors, with the long-term unemployed factor showing less volatility. Figure 2 shows the distribution of funding from each factor, with per capita funding ranging from $1,703 in PY2002 to $155 in PY2010. The intensity of funding decreases as the number of targeted individuals increases. The allocation per capita for dislocated worker programs ranged from $1,703 in PY2002 to $155 in PY2010, reflecting changes in targeted populations due to fluctuations in unemployment. Funding intensity varies significantly, with the highest per capita funding for excess unemployed individuals being much greater than for total and long-term unemployed individuals. The annual changes in funding intensity are primarily driven by the excess unemployed factor. The per capita allocation for dislocated worker programs fluctuated significantly from $1,703 in PY2002 to $155 in PY2010, reflecting changes in targeted populations due to unemployment fluctuations. The total per capita allocation dropped from $909 to $348 from PY2008 to PY2009, with $500 attributed to the decrease in funding for excess unemployed individuals. The current formula for dislocated worker funding does not align well with the definition of dislocated workers and leads to volatile and countercyclical state funding. The current formula for dislocated worker funding results in significant volatility and inequity in funding allocation per capita, with large fluctuations in resources available per targeted population. The excess unemployed factor in the formula exacerbates this volatility by shifting funding among states from year to year. The current dislocated worker funding formula causes volatility and inequity in funding allocation per capita, with fluctuations in resources available. Alternative factors are considered to enhance alignment and reduce volatility, but increasing appropriations may not be feasible. Existing data sources do not align perfectly with the definition of dislocated workers, leading to a mismatch between formula factors and the population. The WIA state formula grant program distinguishes between unemployed populations with separate funding streams for adults and dislocated workers. There is a mismatch between the intent of the formula construction and the practice of using similar measures for both programs. Alternative factors are being considered for the dislocated worker formula to address concerns about this mismatch. The WIA state formula grant program differentiates between unemployed populations, with separate funding for adults and dislocated workers. Factors are evaluated for alignment with the target population of dislocated workers, focusing on their volatility. Adjustments may be made to improve alignment between the formula's intent and construction, ensuring factors capture key characteristics of dislocated workers. The WIA state formula grant program focuses on dislocated workers who are terminated or laid off, self-employed but unemployed due to economic conditions or natural disasters, or displaced homemakers. Table 3 outlines current and alternative formula factors capturing characteristics of dislocated workers. The table outlines current and alternative formula factors capturing characteristics of dislocated workers as defined by WIA. The alternative factors are targeted more towards the dislocated worker population than total unemployment. The civilian labor force (CLF) is a broad measure of the labor market, not specifically aligned with dislocated workers. It can provide stability in allocations when used alongside more targeted factors in a formula. The Mass Layoff Statistics (ML) program tracks layoff events resulting in separations from employment. The Mass Layoff Statistics (ML) program tracks layoff events with at least 50 initial claims for unemployment insurance filed against an establishment in a consecutive five-week period. The data include total mass layoff events and initial claimants for UI benefits, published monthly with a lag of about a month. The ML data series focuses more on the dislocated worker population than overall unemployment, capturing terminated workers attached to the labor force. The Mass Layoff Statistics (ML) program tracks layoff events with at least 50 initial claims for unemployment insurance filed against an establishment in a consecutive five-week period. The data focus on dislocated workers, including those terminated from employment with varying degrees of labor force attachment. The ML data do not cover self-employed workers or displaced homemakers. The Mass Layoff Statistics (ML) program captures substantial layoff events involving at least 50 initial claimants who are sufficiently attached to the labor force. It does not include smaller dislocation events or provide an exact account of those eligible for compensation. The relative share of mass layoffs may not align with the actual need generated by an ML event. The Extended Mass Layoff Statistics (EML) program, administered by BLS, tracks layoff events resulting in separations from employment. In 2009, Delaware and West Virginia had similar numbers of initial claims from mass layoff events, but the impact was greater in Delaware as a proportion of the civilian labor force. The EML data tracks mass layoff events where at least 50 initial claims for unemployment insurance are filed against an establishment over five weeks, with 50 workers separated for more than 30 days. It includes total events, separations, and initial claimants for UI in private, nonfarm industries. Data is published quarterly with a one-month lag. The EML data series aligns more with the dislocated worker population than a broader measure of unemployment. It captures terminated workers attached to the labor force, those affected by substantial layoffs or closures, and self-employed individuals. The data includes initial claimants and total separations for mass layoff events. The EML data series focuses on terminated workers affected by substantial layoffs or closures, excluding self-employed and displaced homemakers. It captures initial claimants and total separations for mass layoff events involving at least 50 individuals. The Unemployment Insurance (UI) program data, collected by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of DOL, includes initial claims, first payments, weeks claimed, weeks compensated, and exhaustions. Initial claim refers to a request for eligibility, first payment is the initial payment in a benefit year, and exhaustion is the final payment of original entitlement. State data includes DC and Puerto Rico, and the UI data series is published weekly. The UI data series, published weekly, aligns well with the concept of dislocation for different classes of dislocated workers defined by WIA. UI data capture terminated individuals attached to the labor force, with initial claims, first payments, and exhaustees reflecting evidence of labor force attachment and potential difficulty in returning to previous occupation or industry. The UI data series captures terminated individuals attached to the labor force, reflecting evidence of difficulty in returning to previous occupation or industry. It excludes self-employed workers and displaced homemakers. Initial UI claims indicate dislocations involving terminated individuals sufficiently attached to the labor force. The UI first payment and exhaustion data capture individuals with clear labor force attachment who lost employment through no fault of their own. The U-2 data series measures job losers and those who completed temporary jobs, providing insights into unemployment trends. The U-2 data series measures job losers and those who completed temporary jobs, providing insights into unemployment trends. It captures terminated workers, individuals from substantial layoffs or closures, and self-employed individuals. However, it does not provide information on the degree of attachment to the labor force or detailed circumstances of job loss. The U-2 data measures job losers and those who completed temporary jobs, including terminated workers and self-employed individuals. It does not include displaced homemakers and focuses on individuals who lost employment through no fault of their own. Volatility in allocation formulas is important to consider, as it reflects changes in funding distribution among states. There is volatility in annual formula grant allocations, particularly in the dislocated worker formula, which aims to direct funding to areas with the greatest needs. Fluctuations in funding may not align well with economic conditions, driven by the excess unemployment factor. High volatility can lead to misalignment of allocations with local conditions. High volatility in annual formula grant allocations can make it difficult for state and substate entities to budget and plan programs. Large swings in per capita funding, driven by factors like excess unemployment, create challenges in dealing with funding fluctuations. Adding formula features that create a \"cliff\" effect could worsen volatility. Broader measures of labor market activity, such as the civilian labor force, are more stable and predictable. The civilian labor force is stable and predictable, while targeted measures like mass layoffs are more variable. Alternative formula factors may reduce volatility. Comparing each state's share of factors over time can help measure volatility. The coefficient of variation is a useful statistic for comparison. The coefficient of variation is a useful statistic to compare the volatility of alternative formula factors for the dislocated worker formula. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean, providing a way to compare the dispersion of factor values with varying means across states. A higher coefficient indicates more average dispersion, with ranges varying for different factors like excess unemployment and civilian labor force. The coefficient values for the civilian labor force factor range from 0.005 to 0.05, with factors like excess unemployment showing greater funding shifts. The excess unemployment factor is the most volatile among the dislocated worker formula factors, with high coefficient of variation in most states. The excess unemployment factor has the highest coefficient of variation among dislocated worker formula factors, showing considerable variation compared to regular unemployment. Mass layoffs and extended mass layoffs also exhibit high levels of volatility, but even their minimum coefficient of variation values are lower than excess unemployment. The coefficient of variation data shows that broader measures of labor market activity have lower volatility than narrow measures. Excess unemployment has the highest coefficient of variation, indicating more allocation volatility compared to other factors. The unemployment factor results in the highest allocation volatility due to large fluctuations in relative share. The civilian labor force is the most stable factor with a coefficient of variation range from 0.005 to 0.054, as it includes both employed and unemployed individuals. However, it is not targeted at dislocated workers. The inclusion of the CLF in a formula factor provides stability across states alongside more targeted factors like mass layoffs and extended mass layoffs, which are volatile and episodic. The coefficients of variation for mass layoffs and extended mass layoffs show high volatility, ranging from 0.055 to 1.199. The volatility of mass layoffs and extended mass layoffs ranges from 0.055 to 1.199, higher than other factors except excess unemployment. The UI factors used in the analysis have low volatility, with first payments ranging from 0.019 to 0.797 and exhaustions from 0.040 to 0.677. These factors are stable and track overall movements in total unemployment. The alternative measure of labor underutilization from BLS, U-2 series, is stable and tracks overall movements in total unemployment. It is more targeted than the total unemployed count as it excludes voluntary quits. The job loser measure may better align with the concept of a dislocated worker, representing occupations one is unlikely to return to. The job loss data series does not include Puerto Rico and represents occupations one is unlikely to return to. Compared to other factors, excess unemployment is the most volatile. Total unemployment is relatively stable, with some states experiencing large changes but no state moving from zero to some unemployed. The presence of some unemployment at all times creates a smoother series over time. The long-term unemployed measure falls between total unemployment and excess unemployment in terms of coverage, capturing a more narrow part of the labor force. Each state has had some long-term unemployed in each program year, with an increase in relative share due to a higher total number in the past two years. The excess unemployed factor is the most volatile, not well aligned with the dislocated worker population. The coefficients of variation range from 0.233 to 3, with the excess unemployed factor having the highest volatility. The use of a threshold of 4.5% creates volatility in allocations, leading to fluctuations in the number of states receiving funding. For example, in PY2008, $394.6 million was divided among 23 states. In PY2008, $394.6 million was allocated among 23 states, averaging $17.2 million per state. Formula features can adjust funding allocations, with the WIA dislocated worker formula using weighting and threshold features. The WIA dislocated worker formula uses various features to adjust funding allocations, including weighting to prioritize factors. Each factor is equally weighted at one-third of the total amount, but weighting could be adjusted to give higher priority to specific factors. Weighting can be used in the WIA dislocated worker formula to adjust funding allocations based on factors like excess unemployment. By assigning higher weights to more stable factors, volatility can be reduced. This allows for a flexible way to change the contribution of factors without altering the formula's other features. The WIA state formula grants include a 90% hold harmless and a 130% stop gain provision, which can impact funding allocations based on factors like excess unemployment. Hold harmless amounts are guaranteed only if funds are sufficient, otherwise, they are reduced proportionally to meet the appropriation level. The introduction of a \"hold harmless\" and \"stop gain\" provision in the dislocated worker formula would provide stability in state funding but may weaken the linkage between changes in state factors and funding. It could mitigate large swings in funding, limit losses, and cap gains for states experiencing significant increases in formula factor values. The introduction of hold harmless and stop gain provisions in the dislocated worker formula would provide stability in state funding, mitigate losses, and limit funding reallocation. Different provisions can lead to varying degrees of volatility in funding allocations. Some formulas also include state minimum grants expressed as a percentage of total allocations. State minimum grant provisions in funding allocations are set as a percentage of total state grants or fixed dollar amounts per state. These minimums ensure all states receive a viable grant, with adjustments made by redistributing funds from states below the minimum to those above it. In the current WIA state formula grants, small state minimum grants are included in the Adult and Youth formulas. The dislocated worker formula could benefit from a small state minimum grant to provide a baseline allocation and mitigate allocation volatility. This would ensure that states receive a minimum grant even in years with no excess unemployment, preventing any state from receiving $0 due to the excess unemployment factor. The current dislocated worker formula creates funding volatility due to a fixed threshold for excess unemployment. Some alternative formulas suggest using indexation of factors to moving averages or national averages to mitigate this volatility. The current dislocated worker formula uses fixed indexation of 4.5% for excess unemployment, leading to funding volatility. Alternative formulas propose indexing factors to moving averages or national averages to reduce this volatility. Indexing excess unemployment to the national average unemployment rate may help mitigate volatility issues in the current formula. This approach would provide a relative measure of unemployment reflecting changing economic conditions. Analysis from PY2002 to PY2010 shows that 40% of state-years had excess unemployment, while 60% did not. States consistently below the national average would not receive funding for excess unemployment. Using the national average unemployment rate as the threshold for excess unemployment may reduce volatility in annual allocations. In the period from PY2002 to PY2010, 40% of state-years had excess unemployment, with 60% not qualifying. This approach would target funds towards states with unemployment above the national average, rather than a fixed threshold, leading to more stable allocations. Using a moving national unemployment rate as the threshold for excess unemployment could reduce volatility in annual allocations. This approach would result in fewer states triggering excess unemployment, leading to more stable funding for states with consistently high unemployment rates. The index for excess unemployment could be based on each state's recent history of unemployment, comparing it to a trailing average to reduce volatility in measurements. This approach removes the fixed threshold concept and ties state excess unemployment to recent trends, providing a more stable funding allocation. The excess amount of unemployment was calculated by comparing current year levels to the average of the previous three years. States' relative share of the change was determined by dividing the number of excess unemployed by the total number of excess unemployed. Out of 468 state-years between 2002 and 2010, 62% had excess unemployment while 38% did not. Using a moving baseline approach to target funds towards states with increased unemployment levels compared to the past, allowing for increased funding for states with lower unemployment levels that experience an increase. This approach would also include measures to reduce volatility in funding allocations during times of decreasing unemployment. The current factors in the WIA state grant formula for dislocated workers are not fully aligned with the target population, measuring a broader labor market group than just dislocated workers. Allocations from the formula are volatile, driven by the excess unemployment factor. The volatility in the WIA state grant formula for dislocated workers is driven by the excess unemployment factor, leading to large swings in state allocations. Appropriations for the program have remained largely constant, contributing to the inconsistency in funding levels despite changes in economic conditions and the number of dislocated workers. The WIA dislocated worker program allocates funding based on economic conditions and the number of dislocated workers, leading to a zero-sum allocation where one state's gain results in another state's loss. Alternative factors for measuring the dislocated worker population are available, which may reduce funding fluctuations. Additional factors for the formula were considered but not presented in the report. Unemployment Insurance Initial Claimants are part of the UI program data and provide a measure of labor market dislocation. However, they were not fully analyzed in this report as the \"first payments\" series is more aligned with the criteria of attachment to the labor force. The UI initial claimants series was not used in this report due to lack of alignment with criteria of attachment to the labor market. The Permanent Job Losers series from CPS data counts workers who have lost jobs through no fault of their own, but its main drawback is timeliness for state-level estimates. The Displaced Worker Survey (DWS) is a biennial survey that defines displaced workers as individuals who lost their jobs due to various reasons. It aligns closely with the target populations in the WIA dislocated worker formula but lacks state-level data due to sample size constraints."
