    "content": "The Aviation Safety Enhancement Act of 2008 may be cited as the \"Aviation Safety Enhancement Act\". It establishes the Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office. The Aviation Safety Enhancement Act of 2008 establishes the Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office within the Federal Aviation Administration. The Office will be headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, with qualifications in investigations and aviation experience, serving a 5-year term. The Director of the Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office is appointed by the Secretary of Transportation for a 5-year term. Any vacancy in the Director position will be filled for the remainder of the predecessor's term. The Director has the authority to receive complaints and information related to violations of orders, regulations, or standards. The Director of the Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office, appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, assesses complaints and information to determine potential violations of aviation safety laws. Recommendations for further investigation or corrective actions are then made to the Administrator. The Director of the Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office assesses complaints and information for potential violations of aviation safety laws. The Director may disclose identities with consent or if unavoidable during an investigation. The Secretary or any Agency officer cannot interfere with the Director's assessments. The Director of the Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office has access to all necessary information to assess complaints for potential violations of aviation safety laws. The Administrator must respond to recommendations made by the Director. The Director must respond in writing to recommendations made by the Director under subparagraph (A)(iii) and keep records of any further investigations or corrective actions taken. If a violation requiring immediate action is suspected, the Director must promptly report it to the Administrator and the Inspector General. If there are reasonable grounds to believe a Federal criminal law violation has occurred, the Director must report it to the Inspector General. The Director must report violations of Federal criminal law to the Inspector General promptly. An annual report to Congress must include information on complaints received, summaries of investigations and corrective actions recommended, and the Administrator's responses to recommendations. Modification of customer service initiative. Congress finds that despite directives prioritizing safety, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a vision statement focusing on customer service and accountability. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a customer service initiative requiring aviation inspectors to treat air carriers as \"customers\" rather than regulated entities. This emphasis on customer satisfaction has led to some managers discouraging vigorous enforcement and replacing inspectors whose actions negatively impacted an air carrier. The Federal Aviation Administration will modify its policies to prioritize safety over satisfying air carriers, clarifying that only individuals traveling on aircraft are considered customers. Air carriers do not have the right to choose the Agency's employees who inspect their operations. SEC. 4. POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS FOR FLIGHT STANDARDS INSPECTORS. Post-Employment Restrictions for Flight Standards Inspectors: Prohibits individuals who previously served as or oversaw flight standards inspectors from being employed by or representing a certificate holder before the Federal Aviation Administration within a 2-year period. The amendment prohibits former flight standards inspectors from representing certificate holders before the FAA within a 2-year period. This does not apply to individuals already employed by a certificate holder at the time of enactment. SEC. 5. ASSIGNMENT OF PRINCIPAL SUPERVISORY INSPECTORS. An individual serving as a principal supervisory inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration may not oversee a single air carrier for more than 5 years. A transitional provision allows current inspectors to continue overseeing carriers until the end of the 5-year period or 2 years after the enactment of this Act. The Administrator of the FAA must issue an order within 30 days of the Act's enactment to implement this section. Authorization of Appropriations is granted to the Administrator to carry out this section. SEC. 6. Headquarters review of air transportation oversight system database. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration establishes a monthly review process of the air transportation oversight system database to identify regulatory compliance trends and take corrective actions. A team of employees submits reports to the Administrator, Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety, and Director of Flight Standards on the review results. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration establishes a monthly review process to identify regulatory compliance trends and take corrective actions. Quarterly reports are submitted to Congress on the results of reviews conducted, including any trends discovered and corrective actions taken. The House of Representatives passed the document on July 22, 2008, as attested by LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
