    "content": "The \"Pediatric Research Initiative Act of 1999\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress recognizes the importance of pediatric research in promoting children's health and well-being, as well as contributing to new medical discoveries for both children and adults. The expanding knowledge in biology and medicine provides opportunities for researchers to benefit society through advancements in pediatric healthcare. The importance of pediatric research is highlighted due to the limited resources and focus on children's health needs compared to adults. More support for children's health research comes from the Federal Government. Investing in children's research today will benefit them in the future, including ensuring a future supply of pediatric physician-scientists. The supply of pediatric physician-scientists is at risk due to market demands. Improvements in training grant support are crucial for the future of pediatric clinical investigators, as over 60% of pediatric departments in the US lack NIH funding. This lack of support threatens the existence of future generations of pediatric physician-scientists who play a critical role in moving research discoveries to patients. Establishment of a Pediatric Research Initiative under the Public Health Service Act to address the lack of NIH funding for pediatric departments in the US. The Secretary will establish a Pediatric Research Initiative within the Office of the Director of NIH to provide funds for pediatric biomedical research, support collaborative efforts among Institutes, and develop pediatric clinical trials and use information. The Director of NIH will consult with relevant institutes and advisors, have discretion in allocating Initiative assistance for pediatric research, and oversee new initiatives. The Director of NIH will oversee the allocation of Initiative funds for pediatric research and provide annual reports to Congress. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002, with the option to transfer funds to Institutes for Initiative purposes. SEC. 452E. INVESTMENT IN TOMORROW'S PEDIATRIC RESEARCHERS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to allocate funds for pediatric research, with oversight by the Director of NIH and annual reports to Congress. The Secretary will provide enhanced support for pediatric researchers' training and career development through increased institutional training grants and career development awards. $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 are authorized for this purpose."
