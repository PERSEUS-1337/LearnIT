The Congress recognizes the national economic interest in spaceport development and the need for a comprehensive policy to compete in the international commercial space market. The United States must demonstrate commitment to supporting commercial space activity to avoid falling behind other nations. The United States aims to regain its position as the primary world supplier of launch services in the international commercial space market through spaceport development, which is crucial for providing launch facilities to the existing parts of the market. The term \"spaceport\" in this Act refers to a space launch or recovery facility designated by a State, including educational or research facilities for space industry worker training or commercial application research. Additionally, there is a provision for the establishment of a National Spaceport Office. The National Spaceport Office is established within the Department of Transportation with a staff including a director, regional supervisors, and support staff. Its duties include administering the application and assistance program, awarding grants, and transferring excess Federal property to spaceports. The National Spaceport Office administers applications for assistance in spaceport development, providing grants, access to Federal assets for educational launches, and transfer of excess Federal property. Tax-exempt bond financing is also available for spaceports. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include spaceports as exempt facility bonds, with treatment comparable to airports for tax-exempt bond financing.
