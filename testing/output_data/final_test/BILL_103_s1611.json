    "content": "The Act titled \"Atlantic Tunas Convention Authorization Act of 1993\" authorizes appropriations. Section 10 of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 is amended to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996 for research activities and advisory committees. For fiscal year 1996, $4,000,000 is authorized for research activities, advisory committees, and working groups. SEC. 3. ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCEDURES. Section 4 of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 is amended to establish procedures for the advisory committee, including quorum requirements, decision-making processes, election of a Chairman, and meeting frequency. The advisory committee, as requested by voting members, the US Commissioners, the Secretary, or the Secretary of State, shall receive administrative and technical support services for effective functioning. It will determine its organization, practices, and procedures for carrying out functions under various acts and agreements, and publish them for public access. The Secretary of Commerce must report to Congress within 90 days of this Act's enactment, identifying research activities on Atlantic bluefin tuna and other migratory species, detailing resources allocated, and explaining how each activity contributes to conservation. Section 3 of the Act of September 4, 1980 is amended to focus on research on Atlantic highly migratory species. The Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with advisory committees, shall develop a research program within 6 months to support the conservation of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species. The research program developed by the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with advisory committees, aims to identify and define the range of stocks of highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean, including Atlantic bluefin tuna. The program includes tagging studies, genetic and biochemical stock analyses, population censuses through aerial surveys, observer coverage of fishing activity, real-time data collection on catches and landings, and studies on the life history parameters of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species. The research program aims to identify and define the range of stocks of highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean, including Atlantic bluefin tuna. It involves tagging studies, genetic and biochemical stock analyses, population censuses through aerial surveys, observer coverage of fishing activity, real-time data collection on catches and landings, and studies on the life history parameters of bluefin tuna and other species. Integration of data from all sources and preparation of databases to support management decisions are also key components. SEC. 5. ACTIONS TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION. The Congress finds that Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species are valuable fisheries in the US and internationally. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas is responsible for managing these species in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. In the last 25 years, Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks and other highly migratory species have declined in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Non-member countries are impacting the recovery by fishing without regard for conservation recommendations. The Commission has identified two stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna for management purposes. The Commission has adopted conservation and management recommendations for Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, with recent additional measures for countries fishing west of the 45 degree line. (10) The United States and other countries fishing west of the 45 degree line have implemented conservation measures for Atlantic bluefin tuna, enforced by the Secretary of Commerce and the Coast Guard.\n(11) Many countries fishing east of the 45 degree line and in the Mediterranean Sea do not comply with conservation measures, hindering the recovery of Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks.\n(12) There have been recent significant increases in Atlantic bluefin tuna catch within 100 miles east of the 45 degree line. Countries fishing east of the 45 degree line and in the Mediterranean Sea may be harming the recovery of Atlantic bluefin tuna by not complying with conservation measures. The United States and the Commission aim to promote conservation efforts for Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. The United States encourages compliance with conservation measures for Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Countries fishing in these areas should immediately comply with management recommendations and agreements adopted by the Commission. Failure to comply will be considered by Congress. The United States urges countries with significant markets for Atlantic bluefin tuna to ban imports from nations that do not follow conservation recommendations. The US also supports exploring working hypotheses for managing Atlantic stocks of highly migratory species through the Commission. The Commission identifies two stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna divided by the 45-degree line. The US should ensure compliance with more restrictive conservation measures for fishing within 10 degrees of the dividing line."
