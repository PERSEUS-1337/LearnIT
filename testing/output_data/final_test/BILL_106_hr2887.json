TVA POWER SALES AND PROPERTY VALUATION. An amendment to the Federal Power Act adds a section regarding TVA power sales. The Tennessee Valley Authority is restricted from selling electric power to a retail customer within a specific area unless certain conditions are met, such as the customer already purchasing power from TVA or the distributor agreeing to the sale. Retail sales of electric power are subject to specific rates, terms, and conditions. The Tennessee Valley Authority's retail sales of electric power are subject to state regulation, and the Authority must obtain a certificate for any new electric generation capacity construction or acquisition. The Commission will issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for new electric generation capacity if the Tennessee Valley Authority's reserve power margin is less than 15 percent and expected to remain so for at least 1 year without new capacity. The Energy Information Administration must determine that there is no commercially reasonable option to purchase power from the wholesale market to meet the needs of the area where the Tennessee Valley Authority operates, and that the proposed construction or acquisition is the only commercially reasonable way to fulfill the Authority's contractual obligations in that area. The Tennessee Valley Authority must ensure that the proposed electric generation capacity will not make them a direct or indirect source of supply in prohibited areas, and that the capacity is fully subscribed for use by customers within specific regions.
