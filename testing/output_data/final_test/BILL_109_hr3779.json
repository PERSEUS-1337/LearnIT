    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The National Women's Rights History Project Act of 2005 recognizes the women's rights movement as a significant protest tradition in U.S. history. It highlights the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 and the formation of the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) under Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) played a key role in securing the passage of the 19th amendment, granting women the right to vote. Susan B. Anthony, a prominent figure in the women's rights movement, fought for women's suffrage and other rights such as property ownership and custody of children. The women's movement also influenced policies on economic and social welfare in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Women's Rights National Historical Park is amended to include the Votes for Women History Trail Route as a new feature. The Women's Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls and Waterloo, New York, has the opportunity to partner with related properties in the corridor between Syracuse and Rochester, including the Susan B. Anthony House, to tell the story of the 72-year fight for women's suffrage. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to establish a vehicular tour route called the 'Votes for Women History Trail Route' linking properties in New York associated with the struggle for women's suffrage, to be administered by the National Park Service. The Votes for Women History Trail Route will be administered by the National Park Service through the Women's Rights National Historical Park. The Secretary will produce educational materials, coordinate management with other agencies, create an official symbol for the trail, and issue guidelines for its use. The Secretary may designate official stops on the Votes for Women History Trail Route at properties related to women's suffrage, including units of Women's Rights National Historical Park and other relevant governmental and nongovernmental facilities.
