    "content": "The 109th Congress adjourned with the FY2007 appropriations process ongoing. A third continuing resolution (CR), P.L. 109-383, provided funding for government operations, including Health and Human Services and Education, through February 15, 2007. A final rule was published authorizing waivers to Head Start grantees from certain provisions. Several federal programs support child care for low-income working families, with specific provisions in the tax code to assist with child care expenses. Funding for these programs and tax provisions over the past five years is detailed in Table 1. Some programs, such as the Child Care and Development Block Grant and Head Start, were due for reauthorization in the 109th Congress but remained unauthorized. The primary federal grant program funding child care is the CCDBG, created in 1990 and reauthorized in 1996. Administered by HHS, it provides block grants to states to subsidize child care expenses for families with children under age 13. The CCDBG has been due for reauthorization since FY2002 and was an incomplete agenda item in the 109th Congress. Child care services under CCDBG are available for families with children under age 13, with income below 85% of the state median. States set income eligibility levels, offer assistance through vouchers or certificates, and establish licensing standards for providers. Health and safety requirements include infectious disease control, premises safety, and caregiver training. Federal law does not specify the details of these standards. The CCDBG is funded through discretionary and entitlement grants, with states required to allocate funds to improve child care quality and availability. States must target 70% of funds towards welfare recipients or at-risk families, but all low-income working families can benefit from the program. The CCDBG is funded through discretionary and entitlement grants, with states required to allocate funds to improve child care quality and availability. State plans indicate that child care is guaranteed for welfare families, with a limit on state administrative costs. The FY2006 Appropriations Act allocated $2.1 billion for the CCDBG, with a 1% rescission bringing the total to $2.062 billion. Funding for a longer period (FY2006-FY2010) was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, providing $2.917 billion annually. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, created in the 1996 welfare reform law, provides fixed block grants for state-designed programs of time-limited and work-conditioned aid to needy families with children. The law maintains the TANF block grant at $16.5 billion for FY2006-2010, with child care being one of the services for which states may use TANF funding. In FY2005, states spent $1.3 billion in federal TANF funds for child care within the TANF program. In addition to TANF funds, states can also use separate state program funds for child care. States may transfer up to 30% of their TANF allotments to the CCDBG program. The CACFP provides federal funds for meals and snacks in licensed child care centers. Children under 12, migrant children under 15, and children with disabilities can participate. Eligible providers must comply with state or federal standards. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides federal funds for meals and snacks in licensed child care centers. It is an open-ended entitlement administered by the Department of Agriculture, with obligations estimated at $2.066 billion in FY2005. Title XX of the Social Security Act authorizes Social Services Block Grants for social services, with no federal income eligibility requirements or matching provisions. State allocations are based on population size, with 10% of total SSBG expenditures in FY2004 ($254 million) used for child care. The SSBG has an entitlement ceiling, but appropriations may exceed it. For example, in FY2001, Congress appropriated $1.725 billion, surpassing the $1.7 billion ceiling. The FY2006 Appropriations Act allocated $1.7 billion for the SSBG, with states able to transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants. An additional $550 million was provided for Gulf Coast Hurricanes needs. Head Start offers early childhood education services to low-income children. The Head Start Act provides childhood education and development services to low-income preschool children. Funding is provided through HHS to local grantees who must comply with federal performance standards. The Administration proposed allowing nine states to administer Head Start, emphasizing skills like language development and numeracy. The Head Start program faced controversy in Congress during the 108th and 109th Congresses, with funding totaling $6.786 billion in FY2006, a decrease from the previous year. Additionally, $90 million in funding was provided for grantees serving children displaced by the Gulf. Funding is allocated for grantees serving children displaced by Gulf Coast hurricanes and for renovating Head Start facilities affected by the storms. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, administered by the Department of Education, provides after-school academic enrichment opportunities for students in low-performing schools. Funding is distributed to states based on Title I, Part A funds, which then make competitive awards to local educational agencies and community-based organizations. The FY2006 Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-149) reduced funding for after-school academic enrichment programs, including the Even Start program for family literacy projects and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) for infants, toddlers, and preschool grants. Post-rescission, funding levels were lower than in FY2005. The Early Reading First program, funded at $103 million in FY2006, supports school readiness for young children from low-income families through research-based strategies. Grants are awarded to eligible educational agencies and organizations for up to six years. The Department of Education provides competitive grants to partnerships to improve early childhood educators' knowledge and skills in high-poverty communities. The CAMPIS program supports low-income parents in post-secondary education through campus-based child care services. Funding for FY2006 was $15.8 million. The HHS program, last funded in FY2005 at $36 million, is authorized by the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Early Learning Fund program, last funded in FY2005 at $36 million, provided grants to enhance school readiness for children under five. Despite being authorized at $600 million, actual funding varied each year. The DCTC is a non-refundable tax credit for child care expenses under Section 21 of the tax code. The Child Tax Credit Act of 2001 increased the maximum credit rate to 35% of expenses up to $3,000 for one child and up to $6,000 for two or more children. The rate decreases based on income, reaching 20% for taxpayers with incomes over $43,000. The estimated revenue loss for 2005 is $3 billion. Payments for dependent care assistance can be excluded from income, with a maximum exclusion of $5,000. Employers can include dependent care assistance in nontaxable flexible benefit plans. The estimated revenue loss associated with excluding dependent care assistance in nontaxable flexible benefit plans is $1 billion in 2005 and $1.1 billion for 2006. H.R. 3010 was signed into law on December 30, 2005, with funding levels compared to the Administration's request and House and Senate versions. President Bush's budget request for FY2006 proposed funding most programs but not all. In 2005, President Bush released his budget request for FY2006, proposing to fund most child care programs at the same levels as FY2005, except for Head Start which had a $45 million increase. The House passed H.R. 3010 on June 24, 2005, matching the proposed funding levels except for Head Start and Even Start programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of H.R. 3010 on July 14, 2005, with funding levels similar to the House bill. Differences included less funding for Head Start, elimination of Even Start program, and increased funding for IDEA Infants and Toddlers Program. President Bush's FY2007 budget proposed maintaining most child care program funding levels from FY2006, except for cuts to the Social Services Block Grant and elimination of the Even Start program. The Administration proposed funding levels for child care and related programs compared to the levels approved in House and Senate committees in 2006. The President proposed to maintain funding for the Child Care and Development Fund at the same levels provided for FY2006. The budget proposal for Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and TANF funding levels for FY2007 did not include a plan for maintaining current service levels. The number of children projected to receive child care services funded through CCDF, TANF, and SSBG is expected to decrease by 300,000 over the next five years. The President proposed to maintain TANF funding at the level agreed upon in the Deficit Reduction Act, which provides $16.5 billion annually for FY2006-2010. States would still have the authority to transfer up to 10% of their TANF grants to the SSBG, which could be used as a potential source of funding for child care. The President proposed a $500 million cut to the $1.7 billion SSBG funding in FY2007, citing overlap with other federal social service programs. Head Start funding would remain at $6.786 billion. Additional hurricane relief funding of $550 million was provided in FY2006. In FY2007, the Administration proposed maintaining funding levels for the Head Start program at $6.786 billion. They also recommended funding the 21st CCLC program at $981 million to provide after-school learning opportunities to over 1.3 million students. Additionally, the Administration suggested increasing the number of children served by Head Start to approximately 917,000 by shifting funds from training to direct service grants. The Administration proposed $436 million for grants to infants and families and $381 million for preschool grants in FY2006. The budget request aimed to support 315,400 infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families, as well as provide $502 per child for approximately 759,000 children through preschool grants. The Administration also aimed to eliminate the Even Start program, which received $99 million in FY2006, with the FY2007 request seeking no funding to complete the process. The President argued that resources should be directed towards early childhood programs like Reading First and Early Reading First. The FY2007 budget request proposed no increase for Early Reading First or Reading First programs. The CAMPIS program was proposed to be funded at the same level as in FY2006. The FY2007 appropriations process was ongoing with continuing resolutions providing funding through February 15, 2007. Congress failed to pass most appropriations bills for FY2007, including for Departments of HHS, Labor, and Education. In FY2007, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to fund government operations, attached to the Defense Appropriations Conference Report. A third CR provides funding through February 15, 2007. The House and Senate did not pass a bill for FY2007 appropriations for HHS, Labor, and Education, but their Appropriations Committees did pass bills. The House and Senate committees reported bills for child care funding levels, including the President's requests. The Good Start, Grow Smart initiative focuses on strengthening Head Start, partnering with states for early childhood education, and providing information to teachers and parents. The President proposed transferring the Head Start program to the Department of Education in the FY2004 budget. The Head Start reauthorization bills in the 109th Congress emphasized increased coordination among early childhood programs but did not propose transferring the program to the Department of Education or state demonstration projects. The Administration implemented the Strategic Teacher Education Program, known as Project STEP, as part of the Good Start, Grow Smart initiative. The Head Start Bureau implemented Project STEP, a professional development program for teachers focusing on early literacy strategies. 3,000 Head Start staff and 100 state child care administrators received training to support children's literacy. Trained individuals will act as mentor coaches. A national reporting system was also developed to assess Head Start programs' effectiveness in promoting school readiness, particularly in literacy and numeracy. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2006 reauthorized TANF and mandatory child care funding for FY2006-2010, increasing annual mandatory child care funding by $200 million. This legislation incorporated provisions from broader reauthorization legislation and raised total annual mandatory funding to $2.917 billion. The House bill H.R. 240 proposed a $1 billion increase in annual mandatory child care funding over five years, while the Senate bill S. 667 suggested a $6 billion increase. The reconciliation measure did not include a reauthorization of the CCDBG Act itself. The Personal Responsibility, Work, and Family Promotion Act of 2005 proposed an increase in mandatory child care funding to $2.917 billion annually for FY2006-FY2010, with additional funding for discretionary CCDBG funding. It aimed to improve the quality of child care and promote school readiness. The bill aimed to improve child care quality, promote school readiness, and allow states to set income eligibility limits based on need. It also required biennial reports to Congress on child care supply, demand, and quality. The mandatory funding for CCDBG programs is included in Section 418 of the Social Security Act, under Title IV. Amendments to H.R. 240 by the Education and Workforce Committee included requirements for states to provide information on the IDEA Part C program to parents and collect data on the ethnicity and language of children receiving CCDBG services. The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources debated H.R. 240 on March 15, 2005, and approved it with Republican support. An amendment to increase mandatory child care funding by $11 billion over five years was rejected. The Work, Family, and Opportunity Promotion Act proposed the same increase but did not receive committee action. Senate bills to reauthorize welfare and child care did not receive committee action. The Finance Committee and the HELP Committee approved bills (S. 667 and S. 525) to reauthorize welfare and child care. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over mandatory child care funding and TANF, while the HELP Committee is responsible for the CCDBG Act. A mandatory child care component was included in the budget reconciliation bill (S. 1932) signed into law on February 8, 2006. The Senate Finance Committee approved a bill (S. 667) known as the PRIDE Act of 2005, reauthorizing TANF through FY2010 and providing $6 billion in mandatory child care funding over five years. The bill proposed to increase mandatory child care funding by $6 billion over five years and provide an additional $1 billion to the Social Services Block Grant. Introduced by Senator Alexander on March 3, 2005, the bill closely resembled the CCDBG reauthorization bill. It authorized CCDBG discretionary funding to rise from $2.3 billion in FY2006 to $3.1 billion in FY2010, with increased funds for quality activities. The bill increased child care funding by $6 billion over five years, with additional funds for quality activities. It set new goals for improving child care quality, promoting school preparedness, and involving parents in education. It removed the federal eligibility limit and required states to coordinate with other early childhood programs. States were mandated to conduct market rate surveys and expand data collection. The bill aimed to increase child care funding by $6 billion over five years, with a focus on quality activities and improving child care services. It also required states to coordinate with other early childhood programs, conduct market rate surveys, and enhance data collection. Additionally, provisions were included to enhance security at child care centers in federal facilities and establish a small business child care grant program. The Family and Community Protection Act of 2005 proposed additional funding for child care. The Head Start program needed reauthorization since FY2003. H.R. 2123 was passed by the House, while S. 1107 was approved by the HELP Committee in the Senate. Other related bills in the 109th Congress included H.R. 335 to amend the CCDBG Act. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to improve child care availability and quality, including incentives for older individuals to become providers, expanding access to programs, funding child care for military families, and grants for child care training infrastructure. After Hurricane Katrina, efforts were made to assist Head Start grantees and state child care administrators in helping affected children and families. After Hurricane Katrina, the Head Start Bureau urged grantees to provide services to displaced children and families. $15 million was allocated by HHS for costs, with preschool-aged displaced children considered income-eligible. Guidance was given for waivers on certain regulations, and grantees were advised to contact regional offices for support. The regional offices were asked by HHS to collect data on evacuee children served by Head Start programs, including whether they were new or previously enrolled in a program in their community pre-Hurricane Katrina. $90 million in additional funding for Head Start was included in the Defense Department's Appropriations Act for FY2006 to help grantees serving children displaced by Gulf Coast hurricanes and renovating damaged facilities. For related documents, visit http://www.headstartinfo.org/hurricane_rir.htm. The Defense Appropriations Act allocated $550 million for expenses related to last year's Gulf Coast hurricanes, including child care costs and expanded services like health and mental health facilities. The Head Start Bureau assessed needs and allocated $90 million for renovating facilities affected by the storms. The allocation of funds for health and mental health facilities in response to hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma was based on FEMA registrant data. The bulk of the funds were allocated to Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama. The Child Care Bureau of HHS provided guidance on using Child Care and Development Block Grant funds for hurricane relief efforts. No additional emergency grant funds were provided, but state administrators were informed of available options. State administrators have been informed of options for using grant funds, such as reallocating funds for emergency child care for displaced families. HHS Secretary Leavitt granted waivers to lift state matching requirements for child care funding in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, allowing access to $60 million in federal funds. More details can be found in the information memorandum sent to state CCDBG lead agency administrators. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-148) granted waivers to lift state matching requirements for child care funding in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, allowing access to $60 million in federal funds. Hearings were held by the House Education and Workforce Committee on welfare reform and early childhood home visitation programs."
