He emphasized the importance of investing in research at universities for long-term national interests. Currently, Members of Congress are concerned about the competitiveness of U.S. research institutions, which rely heavily on federal funding. The nation's economic challenges are leading to discussions about cutting discretionary spending, potentially impacting the research capabilities of U.S. colleges and universities. The competitiveness of U.S. colleges and universities in academic research is crucial for the nation's long-term interests. Academic research contributes to the economy, technological advancements, and overall national growth. However, budget constraints and limited funding sources pose challenges to sustaining research capabilities in the face of economic struggles and global competition. U.S. academic research funding faces constraints from various sources, including self-funding by colleges and universities, state and local government support, and federal budget limitations. Despite the nation's strong presence in top-ranked research universities, some analysts believe that U.S. institutions have declined in global standing over the past decade. Basic research is seen as vital for long-term national interests, yet it has not received significant support. Basic research is crucial for national interests and technological advancement, but it lacks strong private sector support due to perceived cost-effectiveness issues. Increasing support for basic research at universities could enhance the technological strength of the United States. Shirley Ann Jackson emphasizes the importance of universities in generating game-changing ideas through basic research, which aligns with their educational mission of educating bright individuals who ask questions that may lead to unforeseen commercial technologies. When funding basic research, we are investing in serendipity, which is essential for innovation and economic development. Factors like research missions in academia, university-industry partnerships, and funding distribution play a crucial role in the nation's science and technology enterprise. Colleges and universities not only conduct research but also educate future scientific researchers, requiring professors to balance their roles as educators and researchers. Many professors divide their time between teaching and research, with some prioritizing research over teaching. Research-focused academics are often rewarded more in terms of advancements and promotions, leading to a culture that values research over teaching in many institutions. This emphasis on research is due to its ability to bring in revenue and grants, making it a measure of productivity. Teaching excellence is not as highly rewarded, raising questions about how institutions can sustain a research program while also prioritizing teaching. Research-focused academics are often rewarded more in terms of advancements and promotions, leading to a culture that values research over teaching in many institutions. Stakeholders question how institutions can sustain a research program while also prioritizing teaching excellence. The role of federal R&D funding in distorting priorities is also a concern. Professors at Howard Hughes Medical Institute argue that research and teaching are intertwined and can enhance each other, with professors teaching students how to learn and create new knowledge. Some academics supported by HHMI argue that universities should value and reward effective teaching as much as research. They believe teaching and research should be seen as mutually beneficial activities that support each other, rather than being in competition. This shift in culture is essential for the continued vitality of research universities. The value of higher education is debated, with some arguing that research is essential for the value of a degree, while others advocate for a balance between research and teaching. University research-industry partnerships are seen as beneficial for sharing intellectual capital and resources. University-industry partnerships offer benefits such as increased research activities and extended capabilities for institutions with limited infrastructure. National Science Foundation programs like ERCs, STCs, and I/UCRs promote these collaborations by providing funding for research in industrial areas. Multidisciplinary centers require involvement of both undergraduates and graduates in research, with sustained funding being crucial for high-quality research. Universities are engaging in global collaboration and competition. In a global environment, universities are collaborating and competing in research. U.S. academic researchers are increasingly collaborating with scientists from other countries, with approximately 30% of U.S. articles being internationally coauthored in 2008. The OECD noted that university research has become internationalized due to globalization and advancements in technology, leading to increased cooperation and competition at a global level. The OECD report highlights the growing importance of industry-university research partnerships and knowledge transfer in universities. The enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 allowed academic institutions to retain title to inventions, leading to an increase in patenting and licensing. Patenting by academic institutions is concentrated among a select number of colleges and universities, with the number of patents ranging from 2,950 to 3,700 for the period 1998-2008. Patents awarded to academic institutions from 1998-2008 ranged from 2,950 to 3,700, with 200 research institutions accounting for 96% of all patents. Approximately half of the patents were in biotechnology, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. 42% of scientific papers were concentrated at two dozen universities from 2005 to 2009, up from 31% in 1981-1985. Harvard University maintained the top spot in scientific publication output from 1981 to 2009. Texas A&M University System increased its share of publications from 0.72% to 1.2% during the same period. A 2010 report highlighted the shift in global research dominance from the US to the European Union and Asia-Pacific, although the US still leads in relative citation impact. In FY2008, the federal government provided 60% of $51.9 billion R&D funds for academic institutions. Federal funding for academic research increased by 2.5% in current dollars, but only 0.2% when adjusted for inflation. Federal funding focused more on basic research, while private sector funding focused on development. In FY2008, institutions of higher education performed 56% of the nation's basic research, with many colleges and universities facing declining revenues due to reductions in state support and endowments. Approximately 35 states experienced revenue declines in FY2012, leading to cuts in state funding for universities and potential increases in tuition. Despite funding cuts, these institutions are still seen as partners in developing their state economies. The end of federal stimulus funding has led to a loss of operating support for many academic institutions, as noted by Moody's Investors Service in a January 2011 report. Colleges and universities are facing challenges due to their dependence on state support, tuition, and other income sources. While the infusion of ARRA funding temporarily increased federal research funding, overall research funding has become more competitive and stagnant. The largest research universities and independent organizations are best positioned to increase grant submissions and secure multi-year funding. These institutions attract top faculty and have diverse funding sources. Smaller organizations may struggle to expand their research enterprises and attract top researchers. Academic research relies heavily on federal funding, as well as support from industry, private sector, and state and local sources. In FY2009, federal government funding for R&D at colleges and universities decreased to 59.3% from 63.9% in FY2004. Institutional support was 20.4% in FY2009, up from 17.9% in FY2004. Industry support for academic research was 5.8% in FY2009, compared to 4.9% in FY2004. Congress is concerned about federal academic support patterns, including funding for minority-serving institutions like HBCUs and Hispanic-Serving Institutions. In FY2009, federal funding for R&D at colleges and universities decreased. Minority-serving institutions are seeking more federal funding to improve research infrastructure. The top 100 academic institutions received 82.6% of total federal R&D support in FY2007. In FY2007, the top 100 academic institutions received 82.5% of federal R&D support, with Johns Hopkins University ranking number one. The University of Pittsburgh moved from 17th to 10th place, the University of Michigan from 6th to 3rd, and the University of South Florida from 95th to 70th. The University of Oklahoma and Iowa State University, ranked 98th and 99th in FY2007, were not in the top 100 in FY1997. HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions face challenges in enhancing academic and research capabilities due to various issues like aging infrastructure, limited resources, and small endowments. There is variability in institutional ranking among these institutions, and funding is provided for science and engineering obligations at all levels. EPSCoR is aimed at providing assistance in this regard. EPSCoR is a program designed to improve research infrastructure in states with limited federal R&D funds, aiming to build competitive science through partnerships with universities, industry, government, and the federal R&D enterprise. Its goal is to enhance the R&D competitiveness of states through academic S&T infrastructure development. EPSCoR operates in 29 jurisdictions, including 27 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. U.S. colleges and universities are facing financial challenges amidst rising operating costs and student fees. The National Academies examined research institutions' state and recommended strategies for their sustainability, including research commercialization and technology utilization. The National Academies report in 2012 highlighted financial challenges facing U.S. research institutions despite their global ranking. It emphasized the need for sustainable funding to ensure universities can fulfill their missions and compete in areas like health, energy, and global security. The report highlights the financial challenges facing research universities, with federal funding declining, states unable to provide sufficient support, endowments deteriorating, and tuition becoming unaffordable for many families. Research universities also face various forces of change, including demographic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving research networks. The report recommends 10 actions for universities to strengthen their financial health and adapt to these challenges and opportunities. The report recommended 10 actions for research universities to strengthen their education and research capacity, including providing greater autonomy, restoring state appropriations, strengthening business partnerships, and improving graduate programs. The National Academies recommended significant policy changes and investments to improve graduate programs in research universities, aiming to attract talented students and align with national interests. These recommendations would require support from all stakeholders for a \"revitalized\" research partnership, with potential significant returns for both institutions and the nation. President Obama emphasized the importance of academic research in the FY2012 budget, proposing increased funding for leading agencies to support research in institutions. Some in academia argue for competition for limited funding, advocating for \"fewer but better\" research institutions to drive innovation in the knowledge-based economy. President Obama's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double the budget of key federal agencies to boost American competitiveness. This proposal contrasts with calls for austerity measures and severe cuts to scientific research funding. The potential reduction in federal funding could lead to delays or cancellations of collaborative research projects on college campuses, prompting universities to focus on specific disciplines due to budget constraints. Some argue that forcing academic researchers to compete for limited funds could drive innovation, but the impact on the nation's research landscape remains uncertain. Academic researchers may need to compete for fewer dollars, leading to questions about the necessity of fewer but stronger research universities and the ability of colleges to function with less funding. Specific concerns are raised for minority-serving institutions, such as HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions, which may need to form partnerships with non-minority institutions to survive financially. Additionally, there may be an increase in proposals for institutional mergers to address funding challenges. The 112th Congress is facing questions on how to reduce the deficit, balance the budget, and strengthen the economy while maintaining a strong national science and technology enterprise. This includes concerns about funding for minority-serving institutions and the impact on community development efforts and research demands. Federal obligations for science and engineering R&D to universities and colleges are also being examined. The 112th Congress is examining federal funding for Science and Engineering R&D to universities and colleges, including the top 100 institutions receiving the largest amounts in FY1997."
