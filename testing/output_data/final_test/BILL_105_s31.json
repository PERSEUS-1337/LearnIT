    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Estate and Gift Tax Phase-Out Act of 1997\". Congress finds that the economy of the United States requires adequate levels of savings to fuel productive activity, as insufficient savings lead to lower productivity, stagnating wages, and reduced standards of living. Savings levels in the US have declined over the past 25 years, lagging behind industrialized trading partners. This decline has contributed to a long-term downward trend in real economic growth, which averaged close to 3.5 percent over the last century but has slowed to 2.4 percent in the past 25 years. Repealing the estate and gift tax is seen as a way to expand savings and investment. Abolishing the estate tax would promote fairness in the Federal tax system by allowing families to pass on wealth to the next generation without facing taxation. This aligns with the goals of expanding savings, boosting entrepreneurial activity, and fostering economic growth. The proposed legislation aims to phase out estate and gift taxes by increasing the unified estate and gift tax credit. This involves amending the applicable credit amount under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to align with the tentative tax determined by the rate schedule in section 2001(c). The estate and gift tax exclusion amounts for the years 1998 to 2002 were $1,000,000, $1,500,000, $2,000,000, $2,500,000, and $5,000,000 respectively. Amendments were made to align the applicable exclusion amount with the rate schedule in section 2001(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Amendments were made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the estate and gift tax exclusion amounts. The amendments adjust the applicable credit amounts and tax rates for estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 1997. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is repealed, effective for estates of decedents dying, gifts, and generation-skipping transfers made after December 31, 2002. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit any necessary technical changes to reflect the law changes within 90 days."
