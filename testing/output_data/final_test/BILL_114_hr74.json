    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Custodial Interrogation Recording Act\". Video recording of custodial interrogations has been shown to further truth-finding, efficient administration of justice, and protection of constitutional guarantees. It is a significant advancement in law enforcement, aiding in solving crimes and reducing investigation and litigation costs. Video recording of custodial interrogations promotes truth-finding, efficiency in the criminal justice system, and safeguards constitutional rights by reducing fabrication, compensating for unreliable witness recollections, deterring problematic interrogation methods, improving police investigations, and enhancing witness credibility assessment. Video recordings of custodial interrogations aid in identifying and preventing biases, which are often unconscious and operate outside of police awareness. This helps in safeguarding constitutional rights and values, making it easier for various entities such as the press, judiciary, prosecutors, watchdog groups, and police administrators to address and correct misuse of power by law enforcement. Video recordings of custodial interrogations improve public confidence in policing, reduce crime, and enhance citizen cooperation. It also benefits law enforcement by proving cases, lowering investigation costs, and improving systemic accuracy and fairness. Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to authorize appropriations for custodial interrogation video recording grants for the first 5 fiscal years. The Attorney General will provide grants to States and local governments to record custodial interrogations by audio and video means. The grants will cover up to 75% of the program costs, and custodial interrogation is defined as questioning likely to elicit an incriminating response from an individual in custody."
