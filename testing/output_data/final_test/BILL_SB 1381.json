    "title": "SB 1381",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. In the last decade, California has seen a 70% decrease in the number of people training to become teachers. The state currently has the highest pupil-teacher ratio in the nation, reaching 24 to 1 by 2013. Additionally, nearly one in three teachers leave the profession within seven years, with 13% leaving after just two years. According to a poll commissioned by EdSource and the Learning Policy Institute, California's registered voters view the shortage of K-12 teachers as a serious problem. The survey found strong support (85 percent) for the state to offer additional scholarships or partially forgive teacher's college loans to increase the number of people entering the teaching profession. A 1997 study by Wright, Horn, and Sanders emphasized the significant impact teachers have on pupil achievement. Improving teacher effectiveness can enhance education for children. Another study in 2011 by Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff showed that students with effective teachers are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, and live in higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods. A study by the Learning Policy Institute found a significant decline in the number of fully prepared mathematics and science teachers in California over the last four years. This led to an increase in underprepared teachers with temporary permits and waivers. In special education, there was a decrease in the number of credentials issued, with nearly half of special education teachers lacking full preparation. In California in the 2013-14 school year, many education teachers were not fully prepared for teaching according to a study by Darling-Hammond et al. (2016). In California, a program providing grants to full-time, credentialed teachers is administered by the department. Teachers receive a grant of $1,000 after completing their first and second school years of teaching. Starting from the 2019-20 school year, full-time credentialed teachers with three years of teaching experience will receive a $2,500 grant for the next school year. This amount increases to $5,000 for teachers with five years of experience starting from the 2021-22 school year. Starting from the 2022-23 school year, full-time credentialed teachers with six or more years of teaching experience will receive a $5,000 grant for the next school year. Teachers can receive grants in multiple school years, but not more than one grant per school year. A \"credentialed teacher\" is defined as a full-time teacher with a valid teaching credential who serves as the teacher of record in a California public school for at least one day during the taxable year. This definition excludes teachers with only a 30-day substitute permit or those whose sole employment is at a charter school. The State Department of Education will report on the grant program's effectiveness by July 1, 2022. A new section in the Revenue and Taxation Code allows a $5,000 tax credit for qualified taxpayers working full-time, defined as a minimum of 35 hours per week. A qualified taxpayer, defined as a full-time teacher working a minimum of 35 hours per week, may claim a $5,000 tax credit if they serve as the teacher of record for a classroom for at least one schoolday during the taxable year. Any excess credit can be carried over to reduce the net tax in the following years until exhausted. The Legislature intends to allow taxpayers to receive refunds if the tax credit exceeds the \"net tax,\" instead of carrying it forward. Section 41 does not apply to this tax credit. The Legislature intends to treat an appropriation for a tax credit as a tax expenditure program with no impact on school funding, state reserves, or debt-related payments. Any appropriation for the refundable portion of the tax credit would not reduce state obligations. This act provides for a tax levy and shall go into immediate effect."
