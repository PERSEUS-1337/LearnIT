Peanut allergy rates doubled among children from 1997 to 2002. A survey of elementary school nurses in 2003 found that many students had severe food allergies. Forty-four percent of nurses reported an increase in food allergies over the past 5 years. In a 2001 study, over half of fatal food-allergy induced anaphylactic reactions were in individuals aged 18 or younger. Food allergies are a significant concern, especially among children, with over half of individuals aged 18 or younger experiencing allergic reactions. Eight foods are responsible for 90% of food allergies. Anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, can be fatal and is the leading cause of anaphylaxis outside the hospital setting, resulting in thousands of emergency room visits and deaths each year in the United States. Strict avoidance of allergenic foods is the only way to prevent reactions. Delay in administering epinephrine can be critical in food allergy-induced anaphylactic reactions, with a study showing that timely administration significantly impacts outcomes. Various medical associations recognize the importance of managing life-threatening food allergies in schools, although there are no federal guidelines in place for this. In the school setting, management of life-threatening food allergies is challenging. Many elementary school nurses create their own training guidelines. Schools often lack full-time nurses, leading to challenges in overseeing numerous children. Parents of children with severe food allergies may encounter different management approaches when changing schools. Delays in treatment during allergic reactions in schools are often due to not following emergency plans or administering epinephrine promptly. Establishment of food allergy and anaphylaxis management policy. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a voluntary policy for managing food allergies and anaphylaxis in schools within a year of this Act. The policy will require parents to provide documentation from the student's physician or nurse detailing the food allergy diagnosis and any specific allergens. The policy for managing food allergies and anaphylaxis in schools includes documenting the child's allergy history, prescribed medication, emergency procedures, signs of a reaction, readiness for self-administration, and substitute meal options. Each at-risk student will have a file maintained by the school nurse or principal, and communication strategies with emergency medical services will be established. The policy for managing food allergies in schools includes strategies to reduce exposure, dissemination of information, training for school personnel, authorization to administer epinephrine, and accessibility of epinephrine. Extracurricular programs, individual health care plans for children at risk of anaphylaxis, and data collection on epinephrine administration to students are key components of the policy for managing food allergies in schools. The Act developed by the Secretary does not preempt State law, including laws on students self-administering medication for anaphylaxis. Definitions in the Act include schools as kindergartens, elementary, and secondary schools, and the Secretary as the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
