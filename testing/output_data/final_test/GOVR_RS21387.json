    "content": "The South African Customs Union (SACU) consists of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland, with a population of 51.9 million people and covering 1.7 million square miles in southern Africa. SACU accounts for half of sub-Saharan Africa's GDP, with South Africa dominating the group. In 2005, SACU member states had a combined real GDP of about $158 billion. In 2007, merchandise imports from SACU totaled $10.0 billion, with a trade deficit of $4.4 billion. Major imports included minerals, apparel, vehicles, and automotive parts. The US had a services trade surplus with South Africa, with exports of $1.6 billion and imports of $1.1 billion in 2006. U.S. foreign direct investment in South Africa was $3.8 billion in 2006. In 2006, U.S. foreign direct investment in South Africa totaled $3.8 billion, focused on manufacturing, chemicals, and services. South African investment in the U.S. was $652 million. FTA negotiations with SACU may lead to the first U.S. trade agreement with an existing customs union, the world's oldest. The renegotiated agreement was signed in 2002 and is now being implemented. The 2002 Agreement of the customs union aims to harmonize policies within SACU, including rules of origin and customs procedures. It promotes the free movement of goods, a common external tariff, and a common revenue pool. The agreement enhances institutional equality among member states and gives more decision-making power to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland (BLNS). The 2002 Agreement of the customs union established a permanent Secretariat in Windhoek, Namibia and renegotiated the formula for disbursement of the common revenue pool in BLNS countries. The new formula is based on shares of intra-SACU trade, resulting in a redistribution of SACU tariff revenues from South Africa to BLNS. Recent estimates show SACU payments accounted for a significant portion of government revenue in BLNS countries. The South African government is simplifying the SACU tariff schedule by converting tariff lines to ad valorem rates and removing tariffs on items not produced in the SACU. The complexity of the tariff regime has led some U.S. firms to use facilitators to export to South Africa. The WTO found that applied MFN tariffs have decreased in manufacturing, agriculture, and mining and quarrying since 1998. Despite the reduction, some tariffs are bound as high as 400%. U.S. and SACU trade officials ended FTA negotiations in April 2006 after three years of slow progress. On July 16, 2008, U.S. and SACU trade officials signed a Trade, Investment and Development Cooperation Agreement (TIDCA) as a formal mechanism for negotiating interim trade-related agreements. The agreement focuses on key trade issues such as trade facilitation, technical barriers, investment promotion, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards. The halt in FTA negotiations was due to disagreements on the scope of the negotiations, with U.S. negotiators pushing for comprehensive FTAs including intellectual property rights and government procurement. SACU officials argued for excluding intellectual property rights, government procurement, investment, and services provisions from negotiations, preferring to focus on market access commitments first. With AGOA benefits extended to 2015, there may be less incentive for SACU countries to complete an FTA with the United States. Differences between the United States and SACU included views on including industrial sectors in the negotiations, with the U.S. preferring a negative list approach and SACU preferring a positive list approach. The United States and SACU had differences on labor rights and environmental regulations. South Africa may be cautious about negotiating issues that are part of current WTO talks. Former USTR Robert Zoellick noted SACU's lack of harmonized policies, which could complicate FTA negotiations."
