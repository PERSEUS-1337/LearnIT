    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Workforce Investment for Next-Generation Technologies Act\" or the \"WING Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of science- and technology-based industries for economic growth and national security. The United States faces challenges from nations with highly trained technical workforces. Occupations requiring technical and scientific training are projected to grow rapidly. The need for trained technology workers in national security fields has increased post-9/11. National certification systems have successfully attracted more workers into fields like health and information technology. Expanding certification to high technology industries benefits business and workers by allowing skills transfer between states, promoting quality, and introducing stricter accountability based on industry standards. National certification systems facilitate interstate comparisons, identify best practices, and reduce redundancies in education and training programs. The Advanced Technological Education Program, authorized by Congress in 1992, creates national centers of excellence at community colleges with industry linkages to prepare individuals for the technical workforce. Certification signals value to employers, increases employability, and offers a skill development route for working adults and displaced workers. The program should be expanded to all higher education institutions to invest more resources in training and education programs. Investing in training and education programs responsive to marketplace needs is crucial. The one-stop delivery systems under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 have been effective in providing resources for job seekers. These systems help direct displaced workers to certification programs in technical fields with abundant job opportunities. The purposes of this Act include increasing the number of workers educated for high technology industries, aligning educational programs with workforce needs, offering rapid training opportunities, providing skilled technical workers for businesses, and supporting progress towards advanced degrees. Section 171 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to establish 20 pilot projects for industry-validated national certifications of skills, including in high-technology industries like biotechnology, telecommunications, manufacturing, nanotechnology, and energy technology. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to establish 20 pilot projects for industry-validated national certifications of skills in various high-technology industries. The Secretary of Labor will make grants to eligible entities for periods of 36 to 48 months to carry out authorized activities related to certifications in homeland security technology. Eligible entities include institutions of higher education. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, an entity must have a history of effective collaboration with industry on workforce development activities. This includes involvement from various stakeholders such as advanced technology education centers, local workforce investment boards, businesses in target industries, industry associations, labor organizations, and community development organizations. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, an entity must have a history of effective collaboration with industry on workforce development activities. The Secretary of Labor will establish criteria for awarding grants and give priority to entities that can provide matching funds from industry or nonprofit sources. An eligible entity receiving a grant must use the funds to establish certification requirements, develop a certification program, and collect data for analysis and best practices. Matching funds can be provided in cash or in kind. The certification requirements for workforce investment boards must be based on industry skill standards linked to national centers of excellence. Individuals must demonstrate a set of competencies relevant to the industry to receive certification, providing evidence of a transferable skill set. The eligible entity must offer a training and education program related to industry competencies, flexible in delivery mode and timeframe, and provide certification upon completion of the program. The eligible entity must ensure that the certification program aligns with 2-year associate degree requirements and is accessible to students pursuing associate degrees, employed workers, and displaced workers. The Secretary of Labor will consult with relevant authorities to enhance the pilot projects based on best practices from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education Program. The Secretary of Labor will establish core components and guidelines for a high-technology certification program based on data from pilot programs. A report will be submitted to relevant committees, and the data and report will be made public. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorized to be appropriated $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 under section 174(b) for the high-technology certification program."
