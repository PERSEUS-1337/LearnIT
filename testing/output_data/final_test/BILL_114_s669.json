    "content": "The \"Iran Congressional Oversight Act of 2015\" defines the Joint Plan of Action as the agreement signed in Geneva on November 24, 2013, by Iran and the P5-plus-1 countries. The P5-plus-1 countries include the United States, France, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Congress finds that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon would threaten global peace and security, leading to sanctions that brought Iran to negotiations with the P5-plus-1 countries. On November 24, 2013, Iran and the P5-plus-1 countries entered the Joint Plan of Action to limit Iran's nuclear activities. The P5-plus-1 countries and Iran extended the Joint Plan of Action in 2014 to continue negotiations aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran has taken steps such as ceasing uranium enrichment and halting construction on its heavy water reactor. Iran has complied with its obligations under the Joint Plan of Action, allowing more intrusive inspections and managed access to centrifuge production facilities. The United States reserves the option to impose sanctions if Iran violates the agreement. President Barack Obama emphasized the importance of negotiating a comprehensive agreement to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran in his State of the Union address on January 20, 2015. He stated that there are no guarantees of success in the negotiations and that all options are on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENTS OF COMPLIANCE OF IRAN WITH NUCLEAR ARRANGEMENTS. During the Joint Plan of Action or its successor, the President must report to Congress every 90 days on Iran's compliance. The report must include determinations on whether Iran has failed to fulfill the terms of the agreement or attempted to evade inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The President must report to Congress every 90 days on Iran's compliance with the Joint Plan of Action or its successor.

EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION TO REINSTATE SANCTIONS AFTER IRAN VIOLATES NUCLEAR AGREEMENT.

CONSIDERATION IN THE SENATE OF ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION TO FURTHER RESPOND TO A VIOLATION BY IRAN OF A NUCLEAR ARRANGEMENT.

If the US enters a long-term nuclear agreement with Iran that includes lifting sanctions imposed by Congress, those sanctions will remain in effect until repealed by Congress or terminated by another law."
