    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act\". The framers of the United States Constitution recognized free exercise of religion as an inalienable right, protected in the First Amendment. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 reaffirmed this right by prohibiting the government from imposing a substantial burden on religious freedom unless it is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental interest. Many people immigrated to the US to escape religious persecution, yet in World War I, hundreds of conscientious objectors were imprisoned. During World War I, hundreds of conscientious objectors were imprisoned for their beliefs, with some receiving harsh sentences. In World War II, alternative civilian service was recognized to accommodate various religious beliefs, expanding exemptions for conscientious objectors. Thousands of conscientious objectors benefited from this policy during the war. During World War II, conscientious objectors provided essential staff for mental hospitals, volunteered for medical experiments, and served the national health and safety. They sought legal relief for property seizures, wage garnishments, fines, and imprisonment threats due to their beliefs. Federal law recognizes conscientious objection to military service but lacks provisions for objectors who must work many weeks each year. Conscientious objectors work many weeks each year to pay taxes supporting military activities against their beliefs. A tax trust fund for objectors to pay taxes for non-military purposes would increase Federal revenues. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Designated Conscientious Objector refers to a taxpayer opposed to war based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, certified in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury. Military Purpose includes activities that augment military forces, intelligence activities, or enhance war capabilities, including funding for the Department of Defense. The curr_chunk discusses various activities related to military purposes, including those of the Department of Defense, CIA, National Security Council, Selective Service System, Department of Energy, NASA, foreign military aid, and military personnel training and development. The curr_chunk introduces the concept of a Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury establishes the \"Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund\" for conscientious objectors' taxes. Funds are used for non-military purposes, with annual reports to Congress on transfers. The Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund is established for conscientious objectors' taxes, with funds allocated for non-military purposes. Congress believes any revenue increase should align with the Fund's purposes."
