    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Inter-Affiliate Swap Clarification Act\" and addresses the treatment of affiliate transactions. The Commodity Exchange Act Amendments clarify the treatment of affiliate transactions in relation to clearing and execution requirements, margin and capital requirements, and defining 'swap dealer' or 'major swap participant'. The term 'swap' excludes agreements or transactions that would otherwise be considered a 'swap' under certain conditions, involving parties that are not swap dealers or major swap participants that report information on a consolidated basis. Both parties must report agreements, contracts, or transactions to a swap data repository or the Commission within a specified time period as prescribed by the Commission. The Commission can establish public reporting requirements for covered transactions between affiliates, in line with rules governing such transactions. Regulators of insurance funds can still protect fund integrity under their existing authority. The regulator can protect the integrity of a fund without subjecting certain agreements to clearing and execution requirements, margin and capital requirements, or reporting requirements. This does not exempt transactions from certain federal reserve act authorities. The Federal Reserve Act or implementing regulations do not affect federal and state regulatory authorities over banks and insurers. The definition of 'insurer' under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 'swap' under Public Law 111-203 may be subject to rules by the Commission to prevent evasion of requirements applicable to swaps. The Commodity Exchange Act is amended to specify that an affiliate must enter into a swap to hedge or mitigate commercial risk in order to qualify for an exception. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Amendments address the treatment of affiliate transactions for clearing and execution requirements, margin and capital requirements, and defining 'security-based swap dealer' or 'major security-based swap'. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Amendments define 'security-based swap' and exclude certain agreements involving parties that are not security-based swap dealers or major participants that are insured depository institutions. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Amendments define 'security-based swap' and exclude agreements involving insured depository institutions that report information on a consolidated basis. These agreements must be reported to a security-based swap data repository or the Commission. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Amendments require reporting of transactions to the Commission within a specified time period. The transactions are not exempt from certain provisions of the Federal Reserve Act. Regulators of insurance funds can still exercise their authority to protect the funds. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Amendments require reporting of transactions to the Commission within a specified time period. Regulators can protect insurance funds but cannot subject security-based swap transactions between affiliated companies to certain requirements. Federal banking agencies retain safety-and-soundness authorities. Federal banking agencies retain safety-and-soundness authorities over banks defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, while State insurance regulators have authority over insurers, including the ability to impose capital requirements on security-based swaps. The Commission may prescribe rules to prevent evasion of security-based swap requirements. Treatment of affiliates under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended. An affiliate qualifying for an exception under this subsection must enter into a security-based swap to hedge or mitigate commercial risk."
