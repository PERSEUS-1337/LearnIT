Aid programs vary based on countries' needs, with some receiving support for political, socioeconomic, and security challenges. Congress oversees and funds these programs, with the Trump Administration proposing significant reductions in aid. The Trump Administration is proposing reductions in foreign assistance expenditures to shift resources to other priorities, including reassessing objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean. Any changes in aid funding levels or priorities would require approval from Congress. This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to the region, analyzing historical trends, the Administration's budget request for aid agencies, and potential impacts on U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 1946 and 2016, the United States provided Latin America and the Caribbean with nearly $86 billion in foreign assistance. This aid spiked in the 1960s with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, aimed at countering Soviet and Cuban influence. Assistance increased again in the 1980s to support Central American governments against leftist insurgencies. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean fluctuated over the years, declining in the mid-1990s but increasing again in the late 1990s. The higher levels of assistance were due to increased spending on humanitarian and development aid, including aid provided after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and the establishment of new assistance programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Significant aid was also given to Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010. Increased U.S. assistance to Colombia and its Andean neighbors was driven by counternarcotics efforts, starting in FY2000. Additional funding was allocated for Mexico and Central America through the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008, later split into CARSI for Central America and a similar program for the Caribbean in FY2010. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean began to decline in FY2011, partly due to budget cuts but also reflecting changes in the region. Poverty rates decreased from 46% in 2002 to 31% in 2016, and democracy has strengthened. Some countries are now able to provide technical assistance, while others have expelled U.S. personnel and opposed aid. The Trump Administration proposed significant cuts in foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2018, with a $617 million decrease compared to FY2017. This included the closure of USAID offices in some countries and the elimination of the Inter-American Foundation. These changes reflect a shift towards concentrating resources in fewer countries and sectors. The Trump Administration proposed significant cuts in foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2018, with a $617 million decrease compared to FY2017. This included the closure of USAID offices in some countries and the elimination of the Inter-American Foundation. About $516 million (47%) of the Administration's proposed FY2018 foreign aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean was requested through a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) to support democracy, economic reform, education, agriculture, and natural resource management. The FY2018 request for foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean included a $320 million decrease in funding for the ESDF account compared to FY2017. Additionally, $145 million was allocated for Global Health Programs, with $120 million for HIV/AIDS programs and $25 million for maternal and child health, nutrition, and malaria programs. Funding for the State Department GHP account would have increased by $2 million, while funding for the USAID GHP account would have declined by $39 million compared to FY2017. The Administration's FY2018 request for Latin America and the Caribbean included a $39 million (61%) decline in funding for the USAID GHP account. The remaining $432.5 million (40%) would support security assistance programs, including $398 million for counternarcotics and civilian law enforcement efforts through the INCLE account, which would see a $135 million (25%) decrease compared to FY2017. Additionally, $22.9 million was requested for global threat countermeasures through the NADR account, with a $2.5 million (10%) decrease from FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 foreign assistance request for Latin America and the Caribbean included reductions in funding for various programs. This included a $2.5 million (10%) decrease in IMET funding and a zeroing out of FMF assistance, which totaled $83 million in FY2017. The request also proposed a $240 million (34%) cut to the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The Trump Administration's FY2018 foreign assistance request for Central America proposed a $240 million (34%) cut compared to FY2017. The strategy aims to address the root causes of irregular migration by promoting good governance, economic prosperity, and improved security. The request included reduced funding for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and other countries in the region, shifting aid towards security efforts over governance and economic growth programs. Colombia would remain the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a reduced aid amount of $251.4 million. The FY2018 request included funds to support Colombia's counternarcotics strategy and peace accord with FARC. Haiti would have remained the second-largest recipient of U.S. assistance in the region. In FY2018, Haiti and Mexico were major recipients of U.S. assistance. Haiti would have received $157.5 million for various development projects, while Mexico would have received $87.7 million, mainly for strengthening the rule of law. This marked a decrease in funding for both countries compared to FY2017. The FY2018 request for Mexico included funds for strengthening the rule of law, securing borders, and combating organized crime. The proposed budget would have provided $36.2 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), a 37% cut compared to FY2017. The CBSI supports maritime and aerial security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention programs in the Caribbean. The FY2018 budget did not request democracy assistance for civil society groups in Cuba or Venezuela, unlike in FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed eliminating the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), an independent U.S. foreign assistance agency established by Congress in 1969 to provide direct development assistance to Latin America. The IAF, with annual appropriations of $22.5 million, focuses on fostering economic and social development and civic engagement in 20 countries in the region. The Trump Administration proposed eliminating the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), a U.S. foreign assistance agency focused on Latin America. The IAF's distinct approach aims to help marginalized communities help themselves, seen as more efficient than traditional aid programs. President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which funded foreign aid programs slightly below the FY2017 level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, funded foreign aid programs slightly below the FY2017 level at $39.9 billion globally, with a 4.2% cut. Aid levels for Latin America and the Caribbean are unspecified in the legislation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 funded foreign aid programs slightly below the FY2017 level at $39.9 billion globally, with a 4.2% cut. In Central America, the act appropriates \"up to\" $615 million for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement, exceeding the Administration's request by $155 million but falling $84.7 million short of FY2017 levels. The total includes funding for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, CARSI, and other regional programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provides assistance to Central American governments and Colombia. It includes funding for security and development efforts in Colombia, with a requirement for human rights certification. Additional aid is allocated to Mexico to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocates funding for security and development efforts in Colombia, with a requirement for human rights certification. It also provides aid to Mexico to combat drug trafficking into the United States, withholding 25% of FMF aid until human rights concerns are addressed. Additionally, the act appropriates funds for democracy programs in Cuba and Venezuela to promote democracy and the rule of law. The Administration did not request funding for democracy programs in Venezuela in FY2018. The Inter-American Foundation received $22.5 million in appropriations, $17.9 million more than requested. $10 million of Development Assistance will be transferred to the IAF to support the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The Trump Administration's desire to reduce foreign assistance could impact U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean, potentially shifting towards other forms of bilateral engagement and increased involvement of the Department of Defense in security cooperation. The Administration's proposed foreign assistance cuts in Latin America and the Caribbean could lead to a decline in U.S. influence in the region. Budget constraints have forced U.S. agencies to refocus their assistance efforts on fewer countries, impacting programs like USAID's field offices in various countries. The Trump Administration's budget cuts post-recession led to USAID closing field offices in Guyana and Panama. Further reductions in foreign assistance funding could impact aid transitions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Administration's shift towards attracting private capital may result in additional cuts in the future. The Trump Administration's budget cuts have led to USAID closing field offices in Guyana and Panama, with further reductions in foreign assistance funding potentially impacting aid transitions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Development experts caution that transitions should be strategically planned to sustain progress and prevent ruptures in bilateral relations. Successful transitions require close coordination across governments and stakeholders, with a timeline of three to five years deemed necessary. Ceasing new foreign aid funds for a country does not immediately end ongoing assistance programs. The Trump Administration's budget cuts have led to USAID closing field offices in Guyana and Panama, with potential impacts on aid transitions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress appropriates aid for the region through foreign assistance accounts, allowing for funds to be obligated and expended over several years. If aid transitions occur, the U.S. could maintain engagement through smaller programs and help partner countries mobilize private capital. The USAID Administrator consults with Congress on aid transitions and trilateral cooperation initiatives to mobilize private capital for development programs in third countries. Congress influences aid transitions through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The USAID Administrator is directed to submit a report on aid transitions and benchmarks, focusing on security objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Trump Administration's approach includes efforts to combat transnational criminal organizations and reduce illegal migration. The FY2018 budget proposal aimed to reduce State Department-managed security assistance to the region. The Trump Administration reduced security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by 34% in FY2018, intending to replace FMF grants with loans for defense equipment purchases. Some analysts disagreed, stating that this change could harm U.S. relations with foreign militaries and hinder partner countries' security capabilities. For example, Colombia's helicopter fleet maintenance could be affected by the discontinuation of FMF grants. The Trump Administration reduced security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by 34% in FY2018, intending to replace FMF grants with loans for defense equipment purchases. Congress continued to appropriate FMF grant assistance for the region in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. Analysts noted that cuts to State Department-managed security assistance programs could be offset by increased support from DOD, which is authorized to provide a wide range of security assistance to foreign nations. The Trump Administration reduced security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by 34% in FY2018, intending to replace FMF grants with loans for defense equipment purchases. Congress continued to appropriate FMF grant assistance for the region in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. DOD's total assistance for counternarcotics support in the region is estimated to slightly decrease from $198.8 million in FY2017 to $194.6 million in FY2018. DOD is required to submit formal, consolidated budget requests for security cooperation efforts starting from the FY2019 budget. The FY2019 budget requests for security cooperation efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean could give Congress more insight into DOD activities and the overlap with State Department programs. Congress could have more control over the balance between security and non-security assistance to the region and potentially place conditions on security cooperation funds for specific nations. Despite the decreased importance of foreign aid in U.S. relations with the region since the Cold War, the U.S. government continues to prioritize security cooperation. Despite the decline in importance of foreign aid in U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean since the Cold War, the U.S. government continues to use assistance to advance key policy initiatives in the region. This assistance has enabled the U.S. government to influence the policies of partner countries and address issues such as illicit drug production, internal conflicts, organized crime, and unauthorized migration. Analysts argue that steep foreign assistance cuts could handicap the growth and stability of U.S. trading partners and allies in the region, diminishing U.S. influence. Analysts warn that significant cuts in foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean could threaten the success of Colombia's peace process and security progress in Central America. While some argue that the region would benefit from more focused and efficient aid programs, others highlight the potential damage to countries like Haiti, which heavily rely on U.S. assistance. The Administration's efforts to cut foreign aid are seen as part of a broader trend of U.S. disengagement from Latin America and the Caribbean. This has created a leadership vacuum in the region that China is beginning to fill with significant investments. Analysts warn that China's growing influence could come at the expense of the United States. Some analysts warn that China's increasing influence in Latin America and the Caribbean could potentially undermine U.S. power. However, others argue that the region's ties with China may not necessarily lead to a loss of U.S. influence. Congress rejected many of the Trump Administration's proposed foreign aid cuts in 2018 due to concerns that it would weaken U.S. influence globally. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Administration's budget proposal causing confusion and allowing competitors like China and Russia to influence national security narrative. Declining U.S. leadership perceptions in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2016 could hinder support for Trump Administration initiatives. U.S. Foreign Assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has been a concern for the Senate Appropriations Committee due to declining U.S. leadership perceptions in the region since 2016. The FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 budget proposals are under scrutiny for potentially allowing competitors like China and Russia to influence the national security narrative."
