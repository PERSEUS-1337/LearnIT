    "content": "The Act titled \"National Bank Offshore Activities Act of 2001\" clarifies the territorial application of national banking laws and requires reports on offshore interests. Section 5211 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 161) now requires national banks to report any acquisition of a beneficial interest in an offshore company to the Comptroller of the Currency within 30 days. The report must include details such as the names of shareholders, principals, directors, officers, and managing agents of the offshore company. The Comptroller of the Currency requires national banks to report details of offshore company acquisitions, including names of shareholders, principals, directors, officers, and managing agents, as well as the purpose, business, assets, criminal history, and any other required information. Updates must be submitted whenever there are changes. The Comptroller of the Currency mandates national banks to report changes in information regarding offshore company acquisitions. An offshore company is defined as a foreign entity, excluding Edge Act and agreement corporations. Updates must be provided when any changes occur. SEC. 5156B prohibits national banks from engaging with certain violators. SEC. 5156B requires national banks to report any violations of laws by their agents or affiliates to the Comptroller of the Currency. Others can also report violations and petition the Comptroller to take action. The Comptroller of the Currency can prohibit any further relationship between a national bank and a person upon receiving notice of a violation. This includes agents, affiliates, or entities with correspondent banking relationships. The Comptroller of the Currency can issue a prohibition order against a national bank if there are grounds for it, and a hearing will be scheduled to determine the order. If a third party files a petition regarding the relationship in question, they will be provided with a copy of the notice and an opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The Comptroller of the Currency can issue a cease and desist order against a national bank if any violation of laws or regulations by the bank's agent or affiliate has been adjudicated, and there is no good cause to continue the relationship. The Comptroller of the Currency may issue a cease and desist order against a national bank if its agent, affiliate, or other entity is involved in violations, requiring the bank to sever ties and divest ownership interests. This action is in line with the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Comptroller of the Currency may issue a cease and desist order against a national bank for violations, with penalties for non-compliance. Foreign banks with Federal branches or agencies are treated as national banks under this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter one of title LXII of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Prohibition on relations between national banks and certain violators."
