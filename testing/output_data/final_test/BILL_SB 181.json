SEC. 3 declares all public bodies previously organized under any law to be legally functioning with all rights and obligations. SEC. 4 confirms the boundaries of public bodies as previously established. SEC. 5 validates the boundaries shown on maps or plats used by the assessor. SEC. 5 confirms and validates all past actions taken by public bodies regarding annexation, inclusion, detachment, consolidation, merger, or dissolution of territories. SEC. 6 authorizes, confirms, and validates all past actions related to the issuance of bonds by public bodies for public purposes. All bonds issued by public bodies are legally binding obligations, whether previously issued, sold, authorized by ordinance, resolution, order, or through an election. Bonds authorized by a public body through an election are legally binding obligations. SEC. 7 of this act validates past acts and proceedings within constitutional limits, excluding those currently under legal dispute. This act does not legalize any act previously determined to be illegal, void, or ineffective, nor does it authorize contracts between public bodies and the United States. Any challenge to the validity of actions taken under laws related to the formation, organization, or boundaries of public bodies must be filed within six months of this act's effective date. Failure to do so will deem those actions valid and legally binding. This act does not extend the time limit for legal action beyond what is already barred by statutes of limitations or laches. The curr_chunk states that it allows for legal action beyond the period barred by existing statutes of limitations. The curr_chunk clarifies that the creation or boundary changes of public bodies must be filed in accordance with specific government code sections for assessment or taxation purposes. It also declares the act as urgent for validating public bodies promptly."
