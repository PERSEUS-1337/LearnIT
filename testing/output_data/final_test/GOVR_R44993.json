    "content": "The child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC) and the exclusion for employer-sponsored child and dependent care are two tax provisions that subsidize working parents' expenses. The CDCTC is a nonrefundable tax credit that reduces a taxpayer's federal income tax liability based on child and dependent care expenses incurred for work purposes. Taxpayers with little or no federal income tax liability may receive little to no benefit from this credit. To claim the child and dependent care credit (CDCTC), taxpayers must meet eligibility criteria such as having qualifying expenses for a qualifying individual, earned income, and filing taxes with an allowable status. Qualifying expenses are those incurred for the care of a qualifying individual to enable the taxpayer to work or seek employment. Payments to relatives for care may be eligible, except for certain relatives. Taxpayers claiming the CDCTC must provide details of care providers. To claim the child and dependent care credit (CDCTC), taxpayers must have earned income and provide details of care providers, including their address and taxpayer identification number. Qualifying individuals for the credit are the taxpayer's dependent child under 13 years old or their spouse/dependent who is unable to care for themselves. The amount of qualifying expenses claimed cannot exceed the taxpayer's earned income. Married couples filing jointly must both have earnings, unless one is a student or incapable of self-care. Taxpayers are generally ineligible for the CDCTC if they file taxes as \"married filing separately.\" The child and dependent care credit (CDCTC) allows taxpayers to claim expenses for the care of a qualifying individual to enable them to work or look for work. Qualifying expenses include in-home care costs for a nanny or housekeeper. Expenses must have the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to work or look for work. Qualifying expenses for the child and dependent care credit include in-home care costs for a nanny or housekeeper. Care must be provided to a dependent child under age 13 or another qualifying person who regularly spends at least eight hours each day in the taxpayer's home. Care provided at a live-in nursing home for a parent or spouse is not a qualifying expense. Qualifying out-of-home care expenses for the child and dependent care credit include care at a dependent care center, pre-K education, before- and after-school care, and day camp. Expenses for education at the kindergarten level or higher, summer school, and tutoring do not qualify for the credit. Qualifying expenses for the child and dependent care credit include day camp and transportation by a care provider. Payments to relatives for child and dependent care are generally eligible for the credit, except for certain relatives like the taxpayer's dependents, children under 19 years old, and spouses. Taxpayers claiming the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) must provide necessary information about care providers, including their name, address, and taxpayer identification number. This number can be a Social Security number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for individuals, and an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for entities. If a care provider, such as a tax-exempt organization, refuses to provide their information, the taxpayer is only required to provide their name and address. For the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, a qualifying individual includes the taxpayer's dependent child under 13 years old or a spouse incapable of caring for themselves. Taxpayers can still claim the credit if they are unable to obtain necessary information like a Social Security number, as long as they show due diligence in trying to obtain it. The taxpayer's spouse or other dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of self-care and have lived with the taxpayer for more than half the year qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. This includes individuals who require full-time attention for their safety or the safety of others. To claim the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, the taxpayer must provide the taxpayer identification number of each qualifying individual and have earned income during the year. Special rules apply for taxpayers who are unable to work due to incapacity or being a full-time student. Earned income for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit includes wages, salaries, tips, and self-employment earnings. Nontaxable compensation like foreign income and Medicaid payments are not counted. Taxpayers can choose to include nontaxable combat pay. Eligibility for the credit is based on filing status, with \"married filing separately\" generally ineligible. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is available to taxpayers who use the filing status \"married filing separately\" and live apart from their spouse for more than half the year while caring for a qualifying individual. The credit amount is calculated based on qualifying expenses, with the credit rate determined by adjusted gross income (AGI). The credit rate ranges from 35% for AGI under $15,000 to a minimum of 20% for AGI over $43,000. The credit claimed cannot exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) has a credit rate schedule that ranges from 35% for AGI under $15,000 to a minimum of 20% for AGI over $43,000. The maximum expenses that can be multiplied by the credit rate are $3,000 for one qualifying individual and $6,000 for two or more qualifying individuals. The credit formula is more generous towards lower-income taxpayers. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is more generous towards lower-income taxpayers due to the higher credit rate. However, many receive little or no credit as it is nonrefundable. There are limits on the amount of annual work-related expenses used to calculate the credit, with qualifying expenses not exceeding the taxpayer's earned income for the year. For example, if an unmarried taxpayer had $6,000 of qualifying expenses but only $4,000 of earned income, only $4,000 could be applied towards the credit. If an individual (either unmarried or one spouse among married taxpayers) does not have earnings for each month of a calendar year, they can calculate their total earned income by summing up earnings for months with income. Total expenses cannot exceed the earned income of the lower-earning spouse. For example, if the lower-earning spouse earned $500 for three months, their earned income for the earned income limitation would be $1,500. If a taxpayer is unable to work or is a full-time student, their earned income is \"deemed\" to be $250 per month for one qualifying individual or $500 per month for two or more qualifying individuals. If the individual is a full-time student or unable to care for themselves for the entire year, they may be eligible to apply the maximum amount of expenses when calculating the credit. The earned income for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit is $250 per month for one qualifying individual or $500 per month for two or more qualifying individuals, resulting in an annual amount of $3,000 or $6,000 respectively. Only one spouse can be \"deemed\" to have earned income if both are incapable of self-care or full-time students, making the couple ineligible for the credit. Additionally, workers can exclude up to $5,000 of employer-sponsored child and dependent care from their wages. Employer-sponsored child and dependent care benefits allow workers to exclude up to $5,000 from their wages, which is not subject to income or payroll taxes. These benefits can take various forms, such as direct payments to care providers, on-site care, reimbursement of child care costs, and flexible spending accounts. The $5,000 limit applies regardless of the number of qualifying individuals. Taxpayers can set aside up to $5,000 on a pretax basis for child care, with separate limits for the child and dependent care credit based on the number of qualifying individuals. Married taxpayers filing separately can benefit from the exclusion but not the credit. They can claim both the exclusion and credit but not for the same expenses. For every pretax dollar of employer-sponsored child care, qualifying expenses for the credit must be reduced. The family's eligibility for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) was affected by their annual child care expenses and contributions to their employer's FSA. With one child and $10,000 in child care expenses, they couldn't claim the full credit due to their FSA contributions. Adding a second child allowed them to claim more expenses for the CDCTC. Middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers claim the majority of tax credit dollars, with an average credit amount between $500 and $600. Over the past 30 years, the average real credit amount per taxpayer has steadily declined and lost about one-third of its value. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is mainly claimed for the care of children under 13 years old, with an average participation rate of 13% for taxpayers with children. The credit tends to be claimed by middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers, with few low-income or very high-income claimants. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is mainly claimed by middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers, with few low-income claimants benefiting due to its nonrefundable nature. Higher-income taxpayers may have their CDCTC affected by tax-free employer-sponsored child care, potentially leading to larger tax savings through exclusions rather than credits. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) may be affected by tax-free employer-sponsored child care, leading to larger tax savings through exclusions rather than credits. The CDCTC was enacted in 1976 and has seen increases in the maximum allowable expenses and credit rate over the years. Between 1976 and 1988, the average and aggregate credit amounts steadily increased. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) experienced a decline in average and aggregate credit amounts starting in 1989. This drop may be attributed to IRS measures to reduce improper claims, such as requiring Social Security numbers for dependents and caregivers. Congressional changes in 1988 also impacted the credit. Since 1988, the value of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) has steadily decreased due to factors such as non-indexing for inflation and lack of adjustments to qualifying expenses and income brackets. Congressional changes in 1988 also led to a reduction in expenses applied towards the credit, resulting in a smaller credit for many taxpayers. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) has not been increased since 1981, leading to a decrease in its value over time. Data shows that the credit is mainly used for children under 13 years old, with few claims for older dependents due to the exclusion of many expenses for them. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) has not been increased since 1981, leading to a decrease in its value over time. Qualifying expenses for older dependents are excluded, such as eldercare expenses and expenses for stay-at-home caregivers. Data from the Tax Policy Center shows that about 13% of taxpayers with children claim the credit, with a higher proportion among higher-income families. Many families may not claim the credit due to not having childcare expenses. Few families with children claim the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) due to various reasons like not having qualifying childcare expenses, ineligibility for the credit with a stay-at-home parent, or benefiting more from other tax exclusions. Lower-income families also benefit less from the nonrefundable credit, as it is limited to their income tax liability. Access to employer-sponsored child and dependent care benefits is more common among higher-paid employees at larger companies. Data shows that 41% of workers have access to flexible spending accounts, while 11% have access to employer-sponsored childcare. Availability of these benefits varies based on factors like employee wages and employer size. Under P.L. 115-97, the personal exemption amount was reduced to zero from 2018 through 2025. The definition of dependent for the exemption was retained, with tests outlined in Table A-1 to determine qualifying children or relatives."
