    "content": "The \"Base Transition Acceleration Act of 1995\" is also known as the \"Base Transition Acceleration Act\". It revises the disposal process. Section 2905(b) of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 is amended to govern the disposal of buildings and property at installations approved for closure after January 1, 1995. Only federal government departments or agencies can seek the use of buildings and property at these installations through redevelopment plans. The Secretary must ensure timely determinations on the use or transfer of buildings and property at closed installations, to be completed within 60 days of approval. Results of these determinations are to be published in the Federal Register, clearly identifying the buildings and property for potential use or transfer by other federal agencies. The redevelopment authority must submit a plan for closed installations within 180 days of determinations being made. The authority consists of state, local, tribal governments, and citizens affected by the closure. The redevelopment authority must submit a plan for closed installations within 180 days. The chief executive officer of the State can resolve disputes among citizens regarding the authority. The Secretary reviews and accepts or rejects the plan within 60 days, notifying the authority of the decision. The redevelopment authority can submit a revised plan within 90 days if the Secretary rejects the initial plan. The Secretary must review and decide on the revised plan within 30 days of submission. The Secretary notifies the redevelopment authority of plan acceptance or rejection. Buildings and property at an installation are disposed of according to a redevelopment plan approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may postpone or extend deadlines for property transfer under the redevelopment plan if deemed necessary for community interests."
