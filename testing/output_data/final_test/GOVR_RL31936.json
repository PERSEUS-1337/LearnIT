    "content": "The report provides a history and analysis of general revenue sharing (GRS), a federal program that provided transfers to state and local governments without specific spending requirements. Congress considered reviving the GRS program in 2003 and 2004 to address state budget shortfalls. Observers suggest a similar program in 2009 could prevent spending cuts and tax increases. Estimated budget gaps for FY2009 and FY2010 are $31.0 billion and $64.7 billion, respectively. An examination of the previous GRS program from 1972 to 1986 could offer insights. General revenue sharing (GRS) was a federal program that provided unconditional grants to state and local governments, allowing them spending flexibility. The program existed from 1972 to 1986 and there are discussions about potentially revising it in 2009 to stimulate the economy. The estimated budget gap for FY2009 and FY2010 is $64.7 billion. The report analyzes the economic rationale for GRS and its potential use for economic stimulus in 2009. The General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program provided fixed annual grants to state and local governments for spending flexibility. Over $83 billion was transferred from the federal government to state and local governments during the program's 15-year lifespan. To match this level of assistance today, approximately $313 billion would need to be distributed over the next 15 years. Table 1 details the 17 entitlement periods for GRS grants in nominal and adjusted 2008 dollars. The General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program provided fixed annual grants to state and local governments. The grants were determined by a formula based on tax effort, population, and per capita income. After FY1980, only local governments were entitled to GRS grants. The formula stipulated that each state would receive an amount based on the appropriation for that period. The General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program provided fixed annual grants to state and local governments based on tax effort, population, and per capita income. The formula for state allocation considered the state's ability-to-pay and tax structure through the relative income factor (RIF) and general tax effort factor (GTEF). The RIF compares the state's per capita income to the U.S. average, with a RIF greater than one indicating low income and less than one indicating high income. The General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program allocated grants to state and local governments based on tax effort, population, and income factors. The RIF and GTEF were key components in determining the share of revenue for each state. The allocation procedure involved calculating each state's share based on a three-variable formula, with one-third going to the state government and two-thirds to local general purpose governments. The GTEF served as a disincentive for states to rely more on federal revenue by measuring total state tax collections as a share of state personal income. The General Revenue Sharing program allocated grants to state and local governments based on tax effort, population, and income factors. The allocation formula was criticized for generating inequitable treatment of local governments due to tiering allocation procedures. Table 2 below illustrates the allocation of a hypothetical appropriation using data for 2007. Only states are eligible in the example provided in Table 2. The General Revenue Sharing program, which began in the 1960s, underwent changes in response to evolving economic and political conditions. Proponents and opponents adjusted their arguments accordingly. Three main economic rationales behind GRS were identified: intergovernmental fiscal reallocation, addressing government liquidity crises, and aligning federal and state-local fiscal policies. Fiscal reallocation involved replacing state and local tax regimes with federal tax regimes under GRS programs. Under the General Revenue Sharing program, state and local tax regimes are partly replaced by the federal tax regime. Federal spending objectives are also replaced by state and local spending priorities. Proponents argue for a more \"progressive\" tax structure, but achieving fairness through GRS on a small scale is uncertain. GRS would shift government spending decisions to state and local governments, based on the belief that they can better understand and meet the preferences of their residents. Fiscal reallocation through GRS could address the assignment issue, but the net gain in spending efficiency alone may not justify the program. Arguments for and against fiscal reallocation are subjective, revolving around fairness in the tax system and income redistribution. Changing government fiscal relationships would be a significant outcome of fiscal reallocation. State and local governments often face fiscal liquidity problems due to revenue fluctuations, leading to budget deficits. They cannot use debt to close deficits like the federal government can. A countercyclical GRS program could help alleviate short-term liquidity issues for states. State and local governments face short-term liquidity problems due to revenue fluctuations. Research shows that state budgets are asymmetric over the business cycle, leading to less saving during expansions. Political pressure to reduce taxes during surplus periods contributes to this issue. The federal government uses monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize the economy during growth and recession cycles. Stimulative fiscal policy involves tax cuts or increased government spending to boost demand for goods and services, leading to economic expansion. However, state and local governments may counter federal efforts by raising taxes and cutting spending during recessions, which can hinder economic recovery. During recessions, state and local government responses may be \"pro-cyclical,\" undermining federal fiscal stimulus efforts. In the 1970s, general revenue sharing was debated as a way to prevent delays in economic recovery caused by state and local tax increases. The current debate on countercyclical aid to states echoes the 1975-1976 discussions, although the economic conditions then were more severe due to a deeper recession and oil supply shock. This section analyzes the potential impact of general revenue sharing on the economy. The analysis focuses on how General Revenue Sharing (GRS) could impact the economy if implemented in 2009. It discusses the size of GRS compared to state deficits, potential implementation issues, and the question of whether state actions without federal assistance would dampen federal fiscal policy effects. Closing state FY2009 budget gaps with revenue sharing is unlikely to have a significant stimulative effect on the national economy. The NGA study highlights projected shortfalls of $64.7 billion for FY2010, after closing a $40.3 billion budget gap in FY2009. A one-time GRS grant to states could provide significant fiscal stimulus, assuming states spend the funds immediately. Research shows that only a portion of lump sum transfers is translated into new spending, impacting the effectiveness of the stimulus. The leakage theory suggests that a $10 transfer from the federal government may not result in $10 of spending by the state. Instead, the state may reduce own-source tax revenue by $5 and use half of the federal grant to cover the tax reduction, leading to an increase in government spending of $5. Time lags in implementation and varying state budget priorities can hinder the flow of federal spending to designated programs, impacting the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus during a recession. Policy makers should use fiscal stimulus cautiously to avoid mistimed action, as it can become pro-cyclical and inflationary if implemented too late. Time lags in GRS grants can further complicate fiscal policy timing, with delays at the federal level in identifying the need for stimulus and determining grant allocation schemes. This can impact the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus during a recession. The allocation of federal grants to states with greater need may raise concerns about fairness, but it could provide short-term stimulus by preventing layoffs and budget cuts. Debate over the allocation scheme could delay implementation efforts. If grants arrive before June 30, 2009, states could avoid pro-cyclical actions, but if they arrive too late, states may use the revenue for FY2010 budgets to avoid tax increases and spending cuts. States have four options for federal grants: increase government spending, reduce taxes, reduce debt, or contribute to a rainy day fund. Increased spending is the most stimulative in the short run as it injects money into the economy immediately. This option allows states to retain employees, maintain operations, and support social programs like education and healthcare. The fiscal stimulus works best when government spending is quickly multiplied through the economy. The federal transfer payment stimulates the economy the most when the entire dollar is spent by the recipient and then spent again, creating a multiplier effect. To achieve the greatest stimulus, states should avoid contractionary actions like furloughing workers. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) categorized spending strategies to reduce budget gaps for FY2009. Changes in taxes are challenging mid-year and not included. For FY2010, some state and local governments may increase taxes to close budget gaps. The most relative stimulus for each dollar of spending is the preferred option for states. The most effective option for states to stimulate the economy is to avoid net job losses, such as layoffs and furloughs. This is because layoffs reduce aggregate demand and directly reduce measured economic activity. In an environment of rising unemployment, resources would likely remain idle, further hindering economic growth. Preventing net job losses through Government Retention Schemes (GRS) can avoid negative effects on the economy. Saving behavior of separated employees could enhance stimulus, especially for low-income workers who save less. Avoiding early retirement may provide less stimulus than avoiding layoffs and furloughs. Across-the-board cuts would impact various spending programs. Avoiding across-the-board cuts in spending programs would have varying stimulative effects based on state spending patterns. Local government aid would also have a positive but uncertain impact. Tax cuts are less stimulative than direct spending increases, as individuals tend to save some of their tax cut. Rescinding or avoiding tax increases would also be less stimulative. Debt reduction and saving for a rainy day offer little stimulus in the short run. The State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 authorized unconditional GRS grants, which may not lead to a corresponding increase in fiscal stimulus. Some portions of the grants could be used for non-stimulative purposes like substituting for planned spending or tax increases. The 1972 Act established unconditional GRS grants for local governments, with priority expenditures including public safety, environmental protection, public transportation, health, recreation, libraries, social services, and financial administration. Education was excluded from eligible uses, and the priority expenditure list was discontinued in 1976. The 1972 Act established unconditional GRS grants for local governments, with priority expenditures including public safety, environmental protection, public transportation, health, recreation, libraries, social services, and financial administration. The Act also disallowed the use of GRS for matching federal grants, a restriction that was later dropped in the 1976 extension. Congress believed GRS was necessary due to the increasing demand for government services and the challenges faced by state and local governments in raising revenue to meet these costs. The Nixon Administration signed legislation for the GRS program to provide local governments with resources for effective community service. Reasons for implementing the program included stabilizing or reducing state and local taxes, decentralizing government, equalizing fiscal conditions, and shifting reliance to income taxation. The 1976 Extension of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act extended the General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program through FY1980 with minor modifications. Reasons for the extension included rising service costs, declining tax bases, and the need to prevent tax rate increases or service cuts by state and local governments. The 1976 extension of the General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program aimed to address the fiscal challenges faced by state and local governments, including rising service costs and declining tax bases. The extension eliminated spending restrictions and prioritized flexibility in the use of grants. Policymakers viewed revenue sharing as a long-term solution for intergovernmental transfers and a way to stabilize the economy. The 1976 extension of the General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program aimed to address fiscal challenges for state and local governments. It eliminated spending restrictions, prioritized grant flexibility, and viewed revenue sharing as a long-term solution for intergovernmental transfers. The extension's total size was $25.5 billion, approximately 2.5% of total state and local own-source tax revenue collected over the FY1977 to FY1980 period. Nationally, the transfer averaged 0.29% of national GDP annually. The 1980 Extension (P.L. 96-604) extended the program through September 30, 1983, but only for local governments, eliminating the state share to help balance the Federal budget. The 1980 Act reduced General Revenue Sharing (GRS) grants by one-third, from $6.850 billion to $4.567 billion, eliminating state allocations and only providing grants to local governments. It also established a \"countercyclical assistance program\" to aid state and local governments during recessions with $1 billion authorized for each fiscal year from 1981 to 1983. The House report outlines a funding program triggered by consecutive quarterly declines in real gross national product and real wages. Funds are allocated based on the severity of the recession, with $10 million for each one-tenth percentage point decline in wages. Payments are limited to $300 million per quarter, with 1% set aside for territories and the rest split between states and county areas. The countercyclical fiscal assistance program proposed by the House report would allocate funds based on economic downturn severity, with payments to states and county areas adjusted by tax effort. However, no grants were provided as the trigger threshold was never crossed. Table A-1 shows quarterly changes in real wage and GNP from 1980 to 1983, revealing no consecutive declines in both metrics. The 1980 Act discontinued revenue sharing for states. The 1980 Act discontinued revenue sharing for states and introduced countercyclical fiscal assistance through federal grants to local governments. However, the countercyclical assistance program was never funded, and the grants provided to local governments had little effect on the national economy. The $1 billion authorized for countercyclical aid in 1981, 1982, and 1983 was never spent, and would have had a negligible impact on the economy. The 1983 Extension of the GRS program aimed to stabilize the fiscal condition of local governments by providing $13.7 billion in grants over three years. This extension was intended to help local governments address fiscal problems caused by relying on limited revenue sources like property taxes. The GRS program was extended in 1983 to provide $13.7 billion in grants over three years to stabilize local governments' fiscal conditions. The program ended on September 30, 1986, without an extension, and the countercyclical aid program was not continued."
