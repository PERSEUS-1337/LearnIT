    "content": "The \"Patent Application Publication Act of 1994\" amends Section 102(e) of title 35, United States Code, regarding the prior art effect of published applications. It allows for the claiming of benefit of an earlier filing date. The second paragraph of section 119 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to require a timely claim for priority with a certified copy of the original foreign application, specification, and drawings. Failure to do so may result in a waiver of the claim. The certification must be from the foreign patent office and include application dates. Translations may be required if the documents are not in English. The Commissioner may determine the time period for submitting an amendment with a specific reference to an earlier filed application in the United States under Section 120 of title 35, United States Code. SEC. 4. EARLY PUBLICATION. Section 122 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to ensure the confidentiality of patent applications, with exceptions for publication after 18 months from the filing date. The Commissioner may publish patent applications not subject to secrecy orders earlier upon request. Information on published patent applications will be determined by the Commissioner and not released for public access without final decision. The cost of early publication will be recovered through adjustments in filing, issue, and maintenance fees, a separate publication fee, or a combination of these methods. SEC. 5. PROVISIONAL RIGHTS. Section 154 of title 35, United States Code is amended to include the right for a patent holder to obtain a reasonable royalty from anyone who uses, sells, or imports the invention claimed in a published patent application before the patent is issued. The amended Section 154 of title 35, United States Code allows a patent holder to claim a reasonable royalty if the infringer had notice or knowledge of the published patent application and the invention claimed in the patent is substantially identical to the invention in the published application. SEC. 6. TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Section 12 and 13 of title 35, US Code amended to include \"published applications and\" before \"patents\". Tables of sections for chapters 11 and 14 updated for publication of patent applications and provisional rights. Section 181 amended for disclosure and withholding related to publication of an application. The amendments include inserting phrases like \"by the publication of an application or\" in various paragraphs related to disclosure and withholding of inventions. The effective date for sections 2 through 6 of the Act is January 1, 1996, applying to national patent applications filed after that date. Provisional rights under section 5 apply to patents issued within 20 years of the application filing date or the earliest referenced application date."
