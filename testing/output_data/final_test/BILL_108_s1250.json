    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhanced 911 Emergency Communications Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to emergency communications. The Congress emphasizes the importance of a universal emergency telephone number (911) with modern capabilities for homeland security and public safety. It highlights the need for coordination between Federal, State, and local governments for enhanced emergency communications. Funds collected for 911 services should be used solely for their intended purpose, and Federal leadership is crucial for the prioritization of enhanced 911 services. The Act aims to coordinate emergency communications systems, provide stability and resources to Public Safety Answering Points, and ensure funds collected for enhancing 911 services are used appropriately. It also emphasizes the need for coordination between Federal, State, and local governments for enhanced emergency communications. The Assistant Secretary establishes an Emergency Communications Task Force to coordinate between Federal, State, and local emergency communications systems, personnel, and public safety organizations. The task force includes representatives from Federal agencies, State and local first responder agencies, national 911 and emergency communications leadership organizations, and telecommunications industry representatives. The Emergency Communications Task Force includes representatives from various organizations and individuals designated by the Assistant Secretary. Its purpose is to improve coordination and communication between agencies involved in emergency communications, including 911 services, to enhance homeland security and public safety. The Assistant Secretary is required to provide an annual report to Congress on the task force activities and recommendations for improving coordination. Members of the task force serve without special compensation. SEC. 159. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS GRANTS. Grants for E-911 enhancement under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. The Assistant Secretary provides grants to enhance emergency communications services for State, local governments, and tribal organizations. The Federal share of the project cost should not exceed 50%, with the non-Federal share coming from non-Federal sources. Preference is given to applicants who coordinate with public safety answering points. The Assistant Secretary provides grants to improve emergency communications, integrating public and commercial services for 911. Regulations for grant selection will be issued within 180 days of the Enhanced E-911 Emergency Communications Act of 2003, with up to $500,000,000 authorized for grants annually. SECTION 6. STATE AND LOCAL 911 PRACTICES. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to address the diversion of 911 funds. The Commission shall review taxes, fees, or charges on telecommunications services related to emergency communications services twice a year. States must certify annually on the use of revenues from such charges. Each State must annually certify to the Commission that revenues from taxes on telecommunications services have been used for their designated purposes. Failure to provide certification results in public notification and reporting to Congress on non-compliant states and the amount of misused revenues. The Assistant Secretary can withhold Federal grant funds from states or political subdivisions that misuse revenues from taxes on telecommunications services. The withheld amount can be up to twice the misused funds, or the Secretary may require repayment of the misused funds already disbursed."
