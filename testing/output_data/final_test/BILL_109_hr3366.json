    "content": "The \"Western New York Redevelopment Act of 2005\" is cited in this section. An amendment is made to renew replacement power in a specific subsection. Additionally, there is a focus on economic recovery in this Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will impose conditions on new licenses for the Niagara Power Project, including a mandatory annual payment of $10,000,000 to the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation in Buffalo and Erie County. The annual payment for new licenses for the Niagara Power Project will increase by 3 percent each year, with funds held in escrow by NYPA for transfer to the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation. The payment will be used for projects at the Inner and Outer Harbor in Buffalo and Erie County, including transportation infrastructure improvements and Skyway Bridge alternatives. The Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation will receive annual payments for projects at the Inner and Outer Harbor in Buffalo and Erie County, including transportation infrastructure improvements and Skyway Bridge alternatives. Additionally, the New York Power Authority will make annual payments to the Erie County Industrial Development Agency for specified uses. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will require a 1 percent payment of gross proceeds for regional economic benefits from the Niagara Power Project. The Industrial Development Agencies in Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, and Cattaraugus counties in New York will evenly split a percentage of gross proceeds. These funds will be distributed to high-load industries and businesses for capital investment, job retention, and creation. The money will help offset the high cost of energy in New York State and maintain current employment levels. This payment is in addition to any other funds provided by the New York Power Authority to these counties. The term \"gross proceeds\" in this paragraph refers to the total gross proceeds derived by the licensee from power sales for the previous fiscal year, excluding power used by the Corporation or sold to any other department or agency of the State of New York for purposes other than resale. SEC. 4. The Secretary of Energy will audit Niagara Power Project finances and operations to provide information on its economic impact and conduct annual audits for payment verification. SEC. 5. Physical security and safety measures will be implemented. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will require additional security measures for the Niagara Power Project, including acquiring property to create a zone of separation between project facilities and private property. The New York Power Authority must ensure replacement of residential, educational, recreational, and community services affected by acquisition of Niagara Power Project facilities. They must also provide resources to First Responders for equipment and asset maintenance to protect human life and property from harm. The Niagara Power Project must be protected from damage due to acts of terror or criminal behavior. The Act does not allow for an increase in rates for electric energy under the Replacement Power program. If any part of the Act is deemed invalid by a court, the rest of the Act remains valid."
