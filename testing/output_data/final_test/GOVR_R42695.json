    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small business owners and entrepreneurs, including education programs, loan guaranty programs, federal contracting opportunities, and disaster recovery loans. The Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program provides up to $2 million in direct loans to small business owners affected by essential employee call-ups. The SBA provides assistance to veterans through various training partners and programs, including the Office of Veterans Business Development with a $12.7 million appropriation for FY2018. They focus on helping veterans transition from the military to the civilian workforce. The SBA's OVBD, in partnership with Syracuse University, launched the Operation Boots to Business initiative in 2012 to help transitioning servicemembers become business owners. Congress provided an additional $7 million in FY2014 to expand the program nationwide. The two-day Introduction to Entrepreneurship course is now offered at 213 military institutions worldwide as part of the Transition Assistance Program. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) in cooperation with other government agencies. Additional appropriations have been approved to expand the program, including the Boots to Business: Reboot initiative for veterans and active duty servicemembers. Legislation has been introduced to provide statutory authorization for the Boots to Business initiative. The Business Ownership Improvements Act of 2015, along with similar legislation introduced during the 115th Congress, aims to enhance federal employment training programs for specific populations like women and veterans. Some suggest consolidating these programs to reduce costs and improve services, while others argue for maintaining separate programs to address the unique needs of underserved populations. The focus is on improving communication and cooperation among federal agencies instead of consolidation. This report examines the economic circumstances of veteran-owned businesses from the Bureau of the Census's 2012 Survey of Business Owners. It also compares unemployment and labor force participation rates for veterans and nonveterans, discusses employment assistance programs for veterans transitioning to civilian work, and details the SBA's veteran business development, access to capital, and contracting programs. Additionally, it covers the SBA's Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act. The 2012 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) provided comprehensive information on economic and demographic characteristics of businesses and owners. It was sent every five years to a sample of nonfarm businesses in the U.S. The SBO had a 66% response rate from 1.75 million businesses. The 2012 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) provided detailed economic and demographic data on businesses and owners by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status. It included estimates of employer and nonemployer firms, sales, payroll, and employment, categorized by NAICS classification, business type, and geographic location. The SBO data was combined with other sources to create searchable data products on the Census Bureau's website, offering the most detailed information on veterans and veteran-owned firms. The Census Bureau has now discontinued the SBO and is collecting data on business receipts, payroll, and employment by demographic characteristics. The 2012 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) provided detailed economic data on businesses owned by veterans. In 2012, about 9.2% of nonfarm firms in the US were owned by veterans, with California, Texas, Florida, and New York having the highest numbers of veteran-owned firms. Of the 2.54 million veteran-owned firms, 82.3% had no paid employees and 17.7% had paid employees. The first set of data from the new American Business Survey (ABS) will be released in December 2019. In 2012, 80.4% of businesses had no paid employees, while 19.6% had paid employees. 84.3% were owned by males, 15.1% by females, and 0.6% jointly by a male and female. Veteran-owned firms were more likely to be owned by males. 85.1% were owned by Caucasians, 10.7% by African Americans, 2.1% by Asians, 1.3% by American Indians or Alaska Natives, 0.3% by native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, and 2.2% by other races. In 2012, businesses owned by Caucasians accounted for 78.7%, African Americans 9.4%, Asians 7.0%, American Indians or Alaska Natives 1.0%, native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders 0.2%, and other races 4.3%. Individuals aged 55 or older owned 74.5% of firms, while those under 35 owned 3.3%. Veteran-owned firms were more likely to be owned by individuals aged 55 or older. In 2012, veteran-owned employer firms employed 5.5 million persons, with a total payroll of $220.8 billion and generated over $1.47 trillion in total sales/receipts. 99.8% of veteran-owned employer firms had fewer than 500 employees, similar to national figures for 2012. In 2012, veteran-owned nonemployer firms generated $94.5 billion in total sales/receipts, with average sales/receipts of $45,198. Veterans commonly used personal savings to start a business, followed by credit cards and business loans. In 2012, veterans commonly used personal or family savings as the main source of capital to expand their businesses, followed by credit cards, business profits, and government-guaranteed loans. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January 2019 that there were about 19.0 million veterans in the civilian labor force. In 2019, there were about 19.0 million veterans in the civilian labor force. Of those, 9.0 million were employed and 344,000 were unemployed. The unemployment rate among veterans has generally been lower than nonveterans, but veterans who left the military since September 2001 have experienced higher unemployment rates. In January 2019, the unemployment rate for nonveterans was 4.3%, higher than the rate for veterans as a whole (3.7%) and veterans who left the military before September 2001 (3.3%). Veterans who left the military since September 2001 have a higher labor force participation rate (78.0%) compared to other veterans (40.0%) and nonveterans aged 18 and older (62.7%). This is because they entered the civilian workforce more recently and have had less time to develop reasons to withdraw from it, such as health issues or retirement. On the other hand, other veterans have a lower labor force participation rate due to entering the civilian workforce earlier and having more time to develop reasons to withdraw. The SBA sponsors programs to assist veterans in transitioning to civilian workforce. Questions arise about consolidating programs and improving communication among federal agencies. SBA provides training for veteran-owned small businesses. The SBA provides management and technical assistance to over 100,000 veterans annually through various training partners. Programs include the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities and the Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship program. The SBA offers various programs for veterans, including an online entrepreneurship course and a 3-day conference with successful entrepreneurs and CEOs. They also provide an eight-week online training program for National Guard members and reservists through Syracuse University, as well as the Boots to Business initiative within the Department of Defense's Transition GPS program. The Transition GPS program offers three parts for entrepreneurship training: an introductory video, a two-day classroom course, and an eight-week online course. Additionally, the Boots to Business: Reboot initiative expands support to veterans of all eras, active duty servicemembers, and their partners/spouses. The Veterans Institute for Procurement (VIP) program aims to help veteran-owned businesses win government contracts. The SBA offers programs like the Veterans Institute for Procurement (VIP) and the VBOC program to assist veteran-owned businesses in winning government contracts. The agency also collaborates with the Interagency Task Force for Veterans Small Business Development to provide additional support and resources. The Interagency Task Force for Veterans Small Business Development, established in 2010, aims to assist transitioning military members interested in owning a small business by identifying gaps in support and monitoring agency progress. The SBA's OVBD, created by the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, addresses concerns about meeting the needs of veteran entrepreneurs. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 aimed to address concerns about meeting the needs of veteran entrepreneurs by authorizing the establishment of the National Veterans Business Development Corporation. Its mission is to expand access to technical assistance for veterans and assist them in forming and expanding small businesses. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 aimed to assist veterans in forming and expanding small businesses by working with various public and private resources, including the Small Business Administration and other government agencies. It emphasized including veterans in financial and technical assistance programs, targeting them for lending programs and counseling through organizations like SCORE. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 directed the SBA to collaborate with various organizations to provide entrepreneurship training and counseling to veterans, including service-disabled veterans. Services included conducting studies, providing training and counseling on small business management, and offering technical assistance for international markets. The Small Business Administration provides assistance to small business owners, veterans, and service-disabled veterans. This includes promoting exports, providing procurement opportunities, establishing an information clearinghouse, offering distance learning for veterans in business subjects, and compiling a list of small business concerns owned by service-disabled veterans. The Small Business Administration assists small business owners, veterans, and service-disabled veterans by compiling a list of small business concerns owned by service-disabled veterans and delivering it to government departments. The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development promotes veterans' small business ownership through outreach, program development, and direct assistance. OVBD provides management and technical assistance training services to over 100,000 veterans annually through various outreach methods and partnerships with federal agencies and universities. There are discussions about consolidating veteran employment and business development programs offered by federal agencies to better serve veterans. The Department of Labor (DOL), in cooperation with federal agencies, operates the Transition Assistance Program, Transition GPS, to help servicemembers transition to civilian employment. DOL's Jobs for Veterans State Grants program funds outreach specialists for veterans seeking employment. The Veterans Workforce Investment Program and Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program provide grants for various services to assist veterans in transitioning to civilian jobs. The DOL-administered Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program provides grants to fund programs for homeless veterans to achieve employment. Advocates propose consolidating veteran employment programs to reduce costs and improve services, such as transferring programs from DOL to VA under H.R. 4072. In 2011-2015, the House Committee on Small Business recommended transferring funding for SBA's VBOCs to the VA due to duplication of services. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports on federal veteran employment and business development programs, highlighting fragmentation and overlapping missions among various agencies. GAO identified numerous programs providing technical assistance to entrepreneurs, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the current system. Some suggest consolidating programs to better serve the unique needs of entrepreneurs. Improved communication and cooperation among federal agencies and SBA partners could enhance program efficiencies for entrepreneur support programs, preserving services for underserved populations like veterans. The House passed the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009, emphasizing the unique mandates and customized service delivery approaches of Entrepreneurial Development programs. The Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009 aims to enhance oversight and coordination of SBA's management and technical assistance training programs by requiring coordination with State and local economic development agencies and other federal agencies. This will improve program delivery and limit duplication in federal entrepreneurial development activities. The Obama Administration formed the Interagency Task Force for Veterans Small Business Development to improve collaboration across federal agencies and veterans' organizations. The task force issued recommendations to enhance federal entrepreneurial training programs for veterans, including the development of a standardized national entrepreneurship training program specifically for veterans. The Interagency Task Force for Veterans Small Business Development recommended a national entrepreneurship training program for veterans, utilizing local instructors and a web portal for accessing resources. The Small Business Administration administers loan guaranty programs to support small businesses. The Small Business Administration's 7(a) program provides loan guaranties to American small businesses, with up to 85% guaranty for loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% for loans exceeding $150,000, up to a maximum of $5 million. In FY2018, the average approved loan amount was $420,401, and the funds can be used for various business purposes like establishing a new business or expanding an existing one. The Small Business Administration's 7(a) program provides loan guaranties for various business purposes, including constructing new buildings, acquiring fixed assets, purchasing inventory, and refinancing debts. Loan maturity ranges from 5 to 25 years, with negotiated interest rates. In FY2018, 60,353 7(a) loans were approved totaling $25.4 billion, with 3,084 loans to veterans totaling $969 million. The average approved veteran 7(a) loan amount was $314,360. The 504/CDC program provides long-term fixed rate financing for major fixed assets through nonprofit certified development companies. In FY2018, the SBA approved 5,874 504/CDC loans totaling $4.75 billion, with the average approved loan amount being $806,324. In FY2018, the SBA approved 5,874 504/CDC loans totaling $4.75 billion, including 158 loans to veterans totaling $95 million. The average approved veteran 504/CDC loan amount was $601,202. The Patriot Express program (2007-2013) encouraged lenders to provide loans to veterans and their spouses, with loans of up to $500,000. The Patriot Express program, which ran from 2007 to 2013, faced challenges during the Great Recession as veterans had difficulty finding lenders. The program disbursed 9,414 loans totaling over $791 million but had a higher default rate compared to other SBA loan programs. In 2014, the SBA implemented a new streamlined application process for loans under $350,000 and eliminated the Patriot Express program as part of efforts to simplify the loan application process. The SBA waived the loan guaranty fee for veterans under the SBAExpress program from 2014 to 2015 as part of the Veterans Advantage Program. Legislation was introduced to make this fee waiver permanent, and it was authorized for FY2015. The SBA made the practice of waiving the SBAExpress loan program's guaranty fee for veterans permanent starting October 1, 2015. The program provides a 50% loan guaranty on loans up to $350,000 and aims to increase credit availability to small businesses. In FY2018, the SBA approved 27,794 SBAExpress loans totaling $1.98 billion. The SBA waived various loan guaranty fees for smaller 7(a) loans to veterans in FY2014-2018 and reduced fees for loans in rural areas or HUBZones in FY2019. Additionally, in FY2015-2018, the SBA waived 50% of the up-front loan guaranty fee on non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans to veterans. The SBA considered the Patriot Express program and its efforts to enhance veterans' access to capital a success, citing increased lending to veteran-owned small businesses. However, veteran service organizations provided a different perspective, focusing on the SBA's emphasis on streamlining the loan application process and increasing lending amounts. Veteran service organizations prioritize program outcomes, particularly the approval likelihood for SBA loans by local lenders. Testimonies from American Legion and Vietnam Veterans of America highlighted difficulties veterans face in acquiring SBA Patriot Express loans due to tightening lending practices by banks. Since 2010, lenders have eased credit standards for small business loans, potentially improving veterans' access to SBA loan programs. However, a 2013 GAO report highlighted low awareness of the Patriot Express program among the military community as a major challenge for veterans seeking capital. The GAO reported low awareness of the SBA's Patriot Express program among veterans and lenders, suggesting the need for increased outreach. One suggestion is to survey veterans who have received SBA guaranteed loans to gather feedback on their experiences. Obtaining a comprehensive list of veterans who have been turned down for a loan may be challenging due to privacy concerns. Legislation introduced during the 114th Congress aimed to provide grants to GI-Bill benefit-eligible veterans to start or acquire a business. The program required recipients to complete training, have an approved business plan, and the grant amount was based on their unused GI-Bill benefits. The STARTUP Vets Act of 2016 and its Senate companion bill would authorize the SBA to provide grants for business incubators and accelerators to assist veterans in launching small businesses. Legislation in the 115th Congress aimed to waive guarantee fees for small business loans for veterans. The Small Business Act proposed to permanently waive guarantee fees for loans under $150,000 for veterans and spouses. Federal agencies must set procurement goals for small businesses in consultation with the SBA, reporting progress annually. The SBA negotiates goals with agencies and establishes a baseline for evaluating performance. Certain contracts are excluded from the baseline if they do not reflect small business participation potential. The Small Business Administration (SBA) evaluates federal agencies' performance in small business procurement annually. Exclusions from the baseline include contracts not covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations or reported in the Federal Procurement Data System. The SBA releases the Small Business Goaling Report based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation. The federal small business contracting goals have been established for various categories of small businesses, including those owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, HUBZone businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. The current goals require at least 23% of total small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses each fiscal year. The federal small business contracting goals include allocating 5% to women-owned small businesses, 3% to HUBZone small businesses, and 3% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Non-compliance does not result in punitive consequences but is highlighted in the SBA's Small Business Goaling Report, raising public awareness. The FY2017 Small Business Goaling Report shows that federal agencies met the contracting goals for small businesses, including small disadvantaged businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Agencies awarded a percentage of their contracts to different small business categories, with $105.7 billion going to small businesses overall. The House passed H.R. 1694, the Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act of 2015, which aimed to include veteran-owned small businesses in set-asides for federal contracts. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States could lead to more contracts being awarded to VOSBs by the VA, potentially preventing fraud in federal small business contracting programs. Fraud in federal small business contracting programs, including the SBA's loan programs, has been a long-standing concern for Congress and the SBA. Reports of fraud in these programs are frequent, with a focus on the vulnerability of the service-disabled veteran-owned small business program. This program allows for set-asides and sole-source awards for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. A veteran is defined as a person who has served in the military and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. A disability is service-related if it was incurred in the line of duty. Federal agencies can set aside procurements for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses under the \"rule of two\" when at least two responsible small businesses are expected to submit offers at a fair market price. Sole contracts can be awarded to these businesses if only one is expected to submit an offer and the award does not exceed $4.0. The VA can award contracts to veteran-owned small businesses, with a limit of $4.0 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). Sole-source awards may be made to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses under certain conditions. The VA is required to establish annual goals for awarding contracts to veteran-owned businesses and can use non-competitive procedures to meet these goals. The VA can award contracts to veteran-owned small businesses, with a limit of $4.0 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). Sole-source awards may be made to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses under certain conditions. To be eligible for preferences in certain VA contracts, veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses must be listed in the VA's VetBiz database and have their eligibility verified by the VA. Fraudulent misrepresentation of size or status can result in civil and criminal penalties under Section 16 of the Small Business Act. Several bills were introduced during the 112th Congress to address fraud in small business contracting programs, including the False Claims Act, Fraud and False Statements Act, Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, and Contract Disputes Act. S. 3572 and S. 633 aimed to amend Section 16 of the Small Business Act to include service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses among those subject to penalties for fraud. Additionally, the bills would have required these businesses to register in the VA's VetBiz database for verification of their status. During the 113th Congress, legislation was proposed to transfer administration of the VetBiz database from the VA to the SBA for verifying service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. This would be required for eligibility for contracting preferences under the Small Business Act. Some argue that verifying service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses for contracting preferences under the Small Business Act would reduce fraud. Concerns exist about adding to small businesses' paperwork burdens. Alternative solutions are sought to address fraud without increasing paperwork requirements. The effectiveness of preventing fraud in veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small business procurement programs depends on how changes are implemented. The VA's Office of Inspector General found that improvements are needed in the implementation of fraud prevention programs, projecting that ineligible businesses were awarded contracts worth $500 million annually. Strengthening oversight and verification procedures is crucial to prevent awarding $2.5 billion in contracts to ineligible businesses over the next 5 years. VA and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization need to enhance contracting officer oversight, document reviews, and site visits for high-risk businesses. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 authorized the SBA's Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The Senate Committee supported the program due to reservists' businesses being harmed during the Persian Gulf War. The Senate Committee seeks to provide credit and management assistance to small businesses when essential employees are reservists called to active duty, to minimize financial hardships faced during national emergencies or contingency operations. Financial assistance in the form of loans, loan deferrals, and managerial guidance can help alleviate the adverse effects of active duty service on small businesses. The House Committee on Small Business supports the authorization of H.R. 1568, which aims to provide financial assistance to military reservists who are small business owners. The program includes loan deferrals, technical assistance, and loan programs to help these citizen soldiers protect their livelihoods while serving. The SBA also offers direct loans for businesses, homeowners, and renters recovering from natural disasters through the MREIDL program. The program provides disaster assistance in the form of direct loans of up to $2 million to help small business owners facing financial difficulties due to military reservists being called up for active duty. The SBA may waive the $2 million limit under certain circumstances. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides disaster loans to small business owners impacted by military reservists being called up for active duty. An employee critical to the business's operations can qualify for these loans. The SBA can offer loans directly or in partnership with banks, with a maximum term of 30 years and interest rates based on the borrower's ability to repay. The SBA offers disaster loans to small business owners affected by military reservists being called up for active duty. The loan's interest rate is based on the SBA's published rate and may not exceed 4%. Collateral requirements for disaster loans are established by the SBA to balance protection of their interests. MREIDL loans of $50,000 or less generally do not require collateral. The SBA disbursed a total of 352 MREIDL loans since the program's inception. Since its inception through December 31, 2017, the SBA has disbursed 352 MREIDL loans totaling $32.97 million. Out of these, 85 loans (24.2% of the total) amounting to $7.8 million (23.8% of the total) have been charged off by the SBA. This report does not discuss congressional issues related to the MREIDL program due to its small and noncontroversial nature. Congress has shown interest in federal programs aiding veterans' transition to civilian life, including the SBA's veteran business development programs and loan guaranty programs. The SBA's veteran assistance programs have been the subject of congressional hearings and bills introduced to address management and fraud issues. Measuring the effectiveness of these programs on veteran job retention and creation is complex due to various factors influencing business success. The difficulty lies in determining the extent to which a small business's success is attributed to participation in SBA programs or changes in the economy, further complicated by the lack of performance outcome measures. The SBA's veteran assistance programs lack outcome-related performance measures, with recommendations to track borrowers' business success post-SBA loan. Congress may consider surveying veterans for feedback on program effectiveness and loan acquisition challenges. The SBA could survey service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses to assess the impact of SBA loans on job creation and business expansion after receiving federal contracts."
