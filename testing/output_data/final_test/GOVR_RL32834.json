    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for five years. The program has received multiple short-term extensions since its original funding authority expired in 2002. The latest extension funds the program through December 31, 2005. Senate Finance Committee reported bill S. 667 and House Republican leaders introduced H.R. 240, which awaits full committee action. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to extend TANF funding through FY2010 and include marriage promotion grants. They differ in work participation standards and child care funding, with S. 667 proposing $6 billion over five years and H.R. 240 proposing $1 billion. H.R.240 would add $1 billion over five years above current levels of mandatory child care funding, with minor revisions to the TANF contingency funds. The 1996 welfare reform law entitled states to a basic TANF block grant equal to peak expenditures in the pre-1996 welfare programs. The basic TANF grant and MOE are fixed legislatively and not adjusted for inflation. S. 667 and H.R. 240 would maintain current funding levels without adjustments through FY2010. Supplemental grants were provided to states with high population growth or historically low grant levels. Supplemental grants totaling $319 million per year were given to 17 states with high population growth or low historic grants per poor person. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose to continue these grants for the same states at current funding levels through FY2009. Additionally, TANF includes a contingency fund to provide extra matching grants to states during economic downturns based on specific criteria. The two bills, H.R. 240 and S. 667, propose revisions to the TANF contingency fund. H.R. 240 makes minor modifications to the fund, while S. 667 completely revamps it by eliminating certain requirements and basing grants on estimated cash assistance caseloads. Federal TANF grants and MOE funds have specific uses and program requirements. The Federal TANF grants and MOE funds can be used for various benefits and services to assist low-income families with children. TANF grants can also be transferred to other block grant programs, with limits on transfers to specific programs. H.R. 240 and S. 667 propose changes to the TANF contingency fund, with different approaches to revisions. Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 aim to modify TANF rules, with H.R. 240 proposing a 50% transfer limit increase and S. 667 maintaining the current 30% limit. They both include provisions to ease rules on TANF fund usage, allowing states to use carryover funds for any TANF benefit and service. The bills narrow the definition of \"assistance\" to exclude child care and transportation aid, freeing nonworking families from certain program requirements. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose changes to TANF rules, incorporating the \"universal engagement\" proposal. They aim to raise work participation standards from 50% to 70%, increase required working hours, and revise the list of activities for credit. H.R. 240 also includes a \"full family sanction\" for noncompliance with work rules. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to raise work participation standards from 50% to 70% for all families by FY2010, eliminating the separate standard for two-parent families. They also propose changes to the credits that reduce these standards from their statutory rate. Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 aim to increase work participation standards to 70% for all families by FY2010, with changes to credits that lower these standards. H.R. 240 revises the caseload reduction credit to measure changes from a more recent year, while S. 667 replaces this credit with one for employed welfare leavers starting in FY2008. Both bills cap credits against the participation standard, gradually increasing the minimum effective standard from 10% in FY2006 to 50% in FY2010. Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 aim to increase work participation standards to 70% for all families by FY2010. H.R. 240 sets a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, with partial credit for 24 hours of participation. S. 667 also raises the hours standard for full credit, but to a lesser extent than H.R. 240. No special lower-hour standard is provided for single parents with preschoolers in either bill. The House-passed bill proposes higher work participation standards for TANF, with single parents receiving full credit at 24-34 hours per week. Two-parent families have higher hour requirements. Current law allows 12 activities towards work participation, with a focus on core activities like work, job search, vocational training, and community service. Educational activities count only if combined with at least 20 hours of core activities per week. H.R. 240 and S. 667 propose changes to TANF work participation standards, with H.R. 240 narrowing the list of core activities and giving states more discretion. Job search and vocational education would only count for a limited time, after which only work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience would be counted. The proposed changes to TANF work participation standards in H.R. 240 and S. 667 give states more discretion in defining countable activities, with job search and vocational education limited to a specific timeframe. States can also count an expanded list of activities for a set period, in addition to core activities like work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience. H.R. 240 and S. 667 propose changes to TANF work participation standards, giving states more flexibility in defining countable activities. S. 667 allows for an expanded set of activities for single-parent families, including options for participation in education or vocational training programs and rehabilitative activities for disabled individuals. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose marriage promotion grants using TANF funds, including $100 million for activities promoting marriage. States can use federal TANF funds or state funds as matching funds for these grants. The bills propose marriage promotion grants using TANF funds, with additional $100 million for activities promoting marriage. Funds can be used for various marriage promotion activities such as public advertising campaigns, education in schools, marriage education programs, and mentoring programs. The bills propose marriage promotion grants funded by TANF with additional $100 million for activities promoting marriage. S. 667 includes provisions for consulting organizations familiar with domestic violence, clarifying voluntary participation, and prohibiting states from sanctioning non-participants. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 make amendments to TANF provisions regarding state plans, data reporting, tribal TANF programs, and other TANF laws. The reauthorization bills for TANF include provisions for drug testing applicants, sanctions for positive tests, and additional special-purpose grants for programs like purchasing cars and domestic violence support. States are allowed to provide assistance under S. 667. S. 667 and H.R. 240 include provisions for tribal welfare programs, such as funding increases for tribal work programs and grants for tribal TANF programs. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of the TANF provisions in both bills. The comparison of TANF provisions in bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 is denoted in a table, showing the differences in law provisions under the Social Security Act."
