Certifications and designations are reviewed every five years, with the option to delegate certification functions to the State. Additionally, there is a provision for national health outcomes research and evaluation. The Secretary requires health access plans to provide information on enrollees' characteristics, treatments, outcomes, satisfaction, expenditures, and services. This information will be analyzed to evaluate the performance of the plans. The Secretary mandates health access plans to report annually on the health status of individuals in comprehensive health access districts, expenditures on medical services, and the effectiveness of improving health outcomes. Additionally, the Secretary will research the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health status to suggest appropriate interventions for these districts. The Secretary may contract with non-governmental entities to research the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health status in health access districts. Researchers will have access to information from health access plans. The Secretary will create regulations to implement the Act, which will take effect on July 1, 2000, regardless of the status of final regulations."
