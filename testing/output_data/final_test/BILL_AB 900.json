    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California grants superior courts jurisdiction to make determinations regarding the custody of immigrant children, allowing them to petition for special immigrant juvenile status under federal law to prevent deportation. The California Legislature grants superior courts jurisdiction to determine custody for immigrant children to petition for special immigrant juvenile status under federal law, requiring findings of abuse, neglect, abandonment, or similar basis under state law, and that it is not in the child's best interest to return to their country of origin. Despite recent legal changes, misalignment between state and federal law persists. In California, individuals aged 18-21 struggle to obtain findings from superior courts needed for special immigrant juvenile status, despite facing similar circumstances as younger counterparts. Federal law allows those under 21 to apply for this relief, but probate courts cannot take jurisdiction over individuals 18 and older for guardianship. In response to the recent influx of unaccompanied immigrant children in the United States, there is a need to allow these children to petition probate courts for a guardian beyond the age of 18. This is crucial for their well-being as they adjust to a new environment and recover from abuse or neglect. Guardianships of the person may be necessary for individuals between 18 and 21 years of age, allowing probate courts to appoint a guardian for special immigrant juvenile status petitions. This provides a way for individuals in this age group to have a guardian appointed beyond 18 years of age when seeking findings for classification as a special immigrant juvenile. Section 1490 of the Probate Code is amended to define \"guardian\" as the conservator of an adult or the conservator of the person for a married minor. Section 1510.1 allows the court to appoint a guardian of the person for an unmarried individual aged 18 to 21, with consent, in connection with special immigrant juvenile status petitions. A petition for guardianship of a proposed ward aged 18 to 21 can be filed by a relative or any person on behalf of the ward. The court may extend guardianship past 18 years for immigration purposes. The guardianship can be extended until the ward reaches 21 years of age. The section allows a guardian to make decisions for a person under 21 years old who consents to the guardianship after turning 18. The Judicial Council must adopt rules by July 1, 2016. Section 1600 of the Probate Code states that a guardianship terminates when the ward reaches majority, unless extended by the ward. Section 1601 outlines the circumstances under which a guardianship of the person terminates. Section 1601 of the Probate Code allows for the termination of a guardianship if it is in the ward's best interest or if the ward is 18 years of age or older. Notice of the hearing on the petition must be given as per Chapter 3 of Part 1."
