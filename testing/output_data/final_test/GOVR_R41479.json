    "content": "Social Security provides dependent benefits and survivors benefits to spouses, former spouses, widow(er)s, children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. These auxiliary benefits are based on the primary earner's work record. Spousal benefits are for the spouse or divorced spouse of a retired or disabled worker, while survivors benefits are for the survivors of a deceased worker. In 2017, 33% of new benefit awards were given to dependents and survivors. The report discusses the current-law structure of auxiliary benefits for spouses, divorced spouses, and surviving spouses, focusing on adequacy and equity concerns for female beneficiaries. Proposed changes to spousal and widow(er) benefits are also addressed. The Social Security Act of 1935 established Old-Age Insurance to provide benefits to individuals aged 65 or older who had earned retirement benefits through covered work. The Social Security Amendments of 1939 extended monthly benefits to workers' dependents and survivors, establishing Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) for various categories of beneficiaries. The 1938 Social Security Advisory Council justified creating spousal benefits based on the adequacy of household benefits. The Social Security Advisory Council recommended providing supplementary allowances to annuitants with wives over 65 to increase average benefits with minimal cost. The Council suggested an additional 50 percent of the basic annuity for the support of the annuitant's wife, which was supported by the Social Security Board. The Board proposed a supplementary benefit for the aged dependent wife of the retired worker related to his old-age benefit to address greater presumptive need. Since 1939, auxiliary benefits have been expanded to include husbands, widowers, and divorced spouses. These benefits are based on the primary earner's Social Security retirement or disability benefit, calculated from their highest 35 years of earnings. The primary insurance amount (PIA) is determined by applying the benefit formula to the worker's monthly earnings. The Social Security benefit formula is based on the worker's career-average, wage-indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The formula provides a higher percentage of preretirement earnings for workers with low career-average earnings compared to those with high earnings. The initial monthly benefit is equal to the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) if claimed at full retirement age (FRA). Benefits claimed before or after FRA are adjusted to ensure similar total lifetime benefits. Auxiliary benefits are paid to the spouse, former spouse, survivor, child, or parent of the primary earner as a percentage of the primary earner's PIA, with a maximum family benefit amount. For example, a spouse may receive up to 50% of the worker's PIA, and a widow(er) may receive up to 100%. These benefits are subject to adjustments based on age and other factors. To be eligible for spousal benefits, an individual must be at least 62 years old or have a qualifying child in their care. The worker must be entitled to benefits for the spouse to receive them. Benefits are reduced if claimed before full retirement age. Surviving spouses may also be eligible for benefits. Surviving spouses, including divorced ones, may qualify for aged widow(er) benefits at 60, or at 50 if disabled. The benefit is 100% of the deceased worker's PIA. A widow(er) must have been married for at least nine months and not remarried before 60 (or 50 if disabled). Remarrying after 60 (or 50 if disabled) may still entitle one to benefits. Caring for children under 16 or disabled exempts from marriage length requirement. Surviving spouses, including divorced ones, may qualify for aged widow(er) benefits at 60, or at 50 if disabled, equal to 100% of the deceased worker's PIA. Benefits may be affected by the deceased worker's decision to claim benefits before FRA. A surviving spouse caring for the deceased worker's child under 16 or disabled is eligible for mother's or father's benefits equal to 75% of the deceased worker's PIA. Spousal benefits for divorced individuals are available at age 62 if the marriage lasted at least 10 years before divorce. Remarriage ends entitlement to mother's and father's benefits. Survivors benefits for divorced spouses start at age 60 (or 50 if disabled) if not remarried before that age. Divorced spouses are eligible for spousal and survivors benefits if the marriage lasted at least 10 years before divorce. Benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, with survivors benefits starting at age 60 (or 50 if disabled). Remarriage ends entitlement to benefits. If a divorced spouse claims benefits before full retirement age, the benefits are reduced. A divorced person married for less than 10 years does not qualify for spousal benefits on their ex-spouse's record. First marriages that end in divorce have a median duration of 8 to 12 years. Data from different time periods show varying percentages of first marriages lasting longer than 10 years, with a decline in recent decades. For women who married between 1970 and 1999, about 71%-75% had marriages lasting 10 years or more, dropping to 58% for those who married in the early 2000s. Among men and women aged 15 to 44 between 2006 and 2010, the probability of a first marriage lasting 10 years was 68%. The probability varied among different ethnicities, with Hispanic, black, and white women having probabilities of 73%, 56%, and 68% respectively. Additionally, in 2012, 60% of women who were first divorced had marriages lasting 10 or more years. In 2012, 60% of women first divorced had marriages lasting 10 or more years. Spousal or survivor benefits can be received based on one's work record, with the higher benefit amount being paid. Women are increasingly eligible for these benefits. In 2017, the percentage of women aged 62 or older entitled to Social Security benefits based on their own work records grew from 43% in 1960 to 79.3%. More than half of this growth was in the percentage of dually entitled beneficiaries. The percentage of women entitled to benefits based solely on their own work records increased to 54.2% in 2017. In 2017, 45.7% of women aged 62 or older relied on benefits received as a spouse or survivor. In December 2017, a significant number of women and a smaller number of men were dually entitled to Social Security benefits, with spousal or survivors benefits playing a crucial role in women's retirement security. The retired-worker benefit accounted for the majority of the combined monthly benefit for wives, while widows had a more equal distribution between the retired-worker benefit and widow(er)'s benefit. In December 2017, millions of elderly women received Social Security benefits, with various entitlements such as retired-worker benefits, spousal benefits, and survivor benefits. Social Security provided a significant portion of family income for many elderly women, but they remain vulnerable to poverty in old age due to demographic and economic reasons, as well as equity concerns with auxiliary benefits. Women on average live longer than men, leading to more widowed women in older age groups. This results in women spending more time in retirement, facing inflation risks, and the possibility of outliving their assets. Private pension benefits decline with age, making women more vulnerable as they are more likely to take employment breaks for caregiving. During 2016, 88.5% of men and 74.3% of women aged 25-54 participated in the labor force. Women with children under three years old had a lower participation rate at 63%. Employment breaks for caregiving lead to fewer years of contributions to retirement plans, resulting in lower benefits. The earnings gap between men and women can also impact Social Security and pension benefits, leading to inequities in households with similar earning profiles. Spousal and survivors benefits were added to the Social Security system in 1939. In 1939, benefits were added to the Social Security system, including spousal and survivors benefits. Over the years, women have increasingly become wage earners or heads of households, leading to disparities in benefits for two-earner households compared to single-earner households. When a beneficiary qualifies for both a retired-worker benefit and a spousal benefit, they receive the higher of the two amounts, resulting in reduced combined benefits for two-earner households. Social Security benefits can vary based on the earnings of each spouse, leading to disparities in benefits for different types of couples. While Social Security helps many elderly individuals avoid poverty, in 2017, 6.5% of beneficiaries aged 65 or older were still below the poverty line. Married beneficiaries generally have lower poverty rates compared to nonmarried individuals, including widowed, divorced, and never-married women. Among nonmarried women aged 65 or older, including widowed, divorced, and never-married individuals, there is a higher likelihood of poverty compared to their male counterparts. Divorced and never-married women are particularly vulnerable, with 13.7% and 18.0% respectively living below the poverty line in 2017. This disparity is due to women's lower lifetime earnings, resulting from factors such as lower labor force participation and the earnings gap. Additionally, women tend to outlive men, leading to a higher risk of depleting retirement savings. Elderly widows face financial challenges as they tend to outlive men, leading to a higher risk of depleting retirement savings. Women's lower lifetime earnings, lower labor force participation, and the earnings gap contribute to this disparity. Despite an increase in women's labor force participation over the past decades, they still earn less than men and are more likely to work part-time. In 2016, 25% of women in wage and salary jobs worked part-time, compared with 12% of men. Women with children under 18 have entered the labor force more, but have fewer years of paid work on average. By age 50, women without children had worked about two years less than men, while women with two children had a gap of about 6.5 years. In 2017, 69% of mothers were employed, compared to 91% of fathers. Women are also more likely to provide care to family members. Among caregivers in 2015, 60% were female, who tend to work fewer hours and earn lower wages than non-caregivers. Women who leave work to provide care may struggle to return to work, contributing to lower retired-worker benefits compared to men. Full-time women workers earn about 80%-82% of what their male counterparts earn, with the earnings ratio ranging between 80% and 82% since 2004. In 2016, women in full-time wage and salary jobs had median weekly earnings of $749, about 82% of what men earned. In 2016, the earnings gap between women and men varied among age groups. Among full-time workers, women aged 16-24 earned about 95% as much as men; women aged 25-34 earned about 89% as much as men; and women aged 55-64 earned about 74% as much as men. The earnings gap has narrowed over time for most age groups, with the women's-to-men's earnings ratio increasing from 68% to 89% for workers aged 25-34 between 1979 and 2016. Differences in education, work experience, and occupations contribute to the earnings gap between men and women. Comparing annual earnings may understate differences in total earnings over longer periods. One study found that women in the prime working years earned 38% of what men earned over a 15-year period. Another study showed women born between 1955 and 1959 had an average lifetime loss of $531,500 compared to men. Women are entering the workforce in greater numbers, qualifying for Social Security benefits based on their own work records. However, benefits for women are still lower than men's, leading survivor benefits to be crucial for widows after their husband's death. The current Social Security system can lead to unequal benefits for widows, with some receiving higher spousal benefits than single women or those who worked full careers in low-wage jobs. This disproportionality favors one-earner couples over single individuals or couples with two earners. The current Social Security system can result in unequal benefits for one-earner and two-earner couples with the same total household lifetime earnings. This disparity could become more relevant as women's share of household income increases and more women become heads of families. Table 4 shows examples of the differing treatment, where a one-earner couple with $50,000 in household earnings is compared to two-earner couples with the same total earnings. The comparison between one-earner and two-earner couples with the same total household earnings ($50,000) shows that the one-earner couple may receive higher retirement and survivors benefits. Specifically, the one-earner couple receives $2,655 in monthly retirement benefits compared to the two-earner couple's $2,240. The survivor of the one-earner couple also receives $1,770 in monthly benefits. The comparison between one-earner and two-earner couples with the same total household earnings shows that the two-earner couple may receive lower retirement and survivors benefits. The survivor benefit received by the two-earner couple is identical to that received by the one-earner couple, despite the two-earner couple earning more and contributing more in Social Security payroll taxes. This disparity in benefits for two-earner couples highlights the current-law Social Security spousal benefit structure's requirement for higher contributions for similar benefit levels. The disparity in benefits between one-earner and two-earner couples may increase after the death of one spouse. The replacement rate for the third couple is 46%, lower than the one-earner couple's 64%. The surviving spouse in the one-earner couple receives a larger monthly benefit compared to the survivor of the two-earner couple. The disparity in benefits between one-earner and two-earner couples may increase after the death of one spouse. The surviving spouse in the second couple receives a higher monthly benefit compared to the survivor of the first couple, despite both couples paying the same amount of Social Security payroll tax contributions. Similarly, the surviving spouse in the third couple receives the same monthly benefit as the one-earner couple, even though they paid a higher amount of Social Security payroll tax contributions. After the death of one spouse in two-earner couples, the second earnings record does not result in additional benefits. Benefits for nonworking spouses were initially structured to be generous when spousal and survivors benefits were first established. The structure of Social Security auxiliary benefits has evolved over time, with a decrease in women beneficiaries solely based on husband's earnings. Inequities exist among couples with different work histories and earnings levels, as well as among divorced spouses based on the length of marriage. Lawmakers face considerations for potential policy changes regarding Social Security spousal and survivors benefits. Social Security provides pension rights to eligible divorced spouses, with benefits not reduced for current or former spouses. Divorced spouses receive higher benefits after the primary earner's death. This can impact the income of divorced spouses and create disincentives for remarriage. Policymakers and researchers have proposed restructuring Social Security to address adequacy and equity issues. Several proposals have been suggested to restructure Social Security auxiliary benefits, including modifying spousal and survivors benefits to address inequality between one-earner and two-earner couples. Earnings sharing is one proposed solution to provide fair benefits and address disparities in current law. Earnings sharing is a proposed solution to address disparities in Social Security benefits for divorced women and one-earner/two-earner couples. It involves combining a couple's covered earnings during marriage and dividing them evenly. This would replace spousal and survivors benefits, with individual earnings records maintained for each member of the couple. Social Security benefits are computed separately for each member of a couple based on individual earnings records. Couples married for the entire career of one or both members receive identical benefits. Earnings sharing proposals would reduce benefits for the majority of individuals, with 61% experiencing average reductions of about 17%. Under earnings sharing proposals, benefits for married couples would be affected differently based on their earning profiles. One-earner couples would see larger benefit decreases compared to two-earner couples. Studies show that widows and divorced women would experience significant benefit reductions, with widows facing an average reduction of 27% and divorced women facing reductions averaging about 22%. Under earnings sharing proposals, widows and divorced women would see significant benefit reductions. A 2016 study found that 39% of divorced women and 62% of widows would experience a median decrease in benefits. The widow's benefit under current law would be replaced with earnings credits, resulting in lower benefits for surviving spouses. Earnings sharing could lead to lower benefits for widowed men and women, while enhancing benefits for divorced spouses and some married women. Some earnings sharing proposals aim to provide enhanced benefits to survivors or targeted groups. An \"inheritance provision\" could allow a surviving spouse to count all of a deceased spouse's earnings during each year of marriage, in addition to their own earnings. This provision may protect some surviving spouses, with 40% of widows receiving lower benefits compared to current law. Alternatively, benefits for surviving spouses could be based on two-thirds of the combined benefit the couple was receiving when both members were alive. Provisions to protect survivors from benefit reductions could be achieved through program changes, but would reduce savings. Increasing benefits for survivors would raise program costs. A higher survivor benefit could be funded by reducing the combined benefit for couples while both are alive. Divorced spouses must be married for at least 10 years to qualify for benefits. Benefits for divorced spouses are 50% of the worker's PIA, while benefits for divorced surviving spouses are 100% of the worker's PIA. Lowering the marriage-duration requirement for divorced spouses from 10 to 5 or 7 years would increase benefits for a percentage of divorced and widowed women aged 60 or older by 2030. The outcomes were moderately progressive, benefiting a greater share of divorced women. The outcomes of lowering the marriage-duration requirement for divorced spouses were moderately progressive, with a greater share of benefit increases going to low-income and non-college-educated divorced women in old age. Researchers argue that the 50% benefit rate for divorced spouses may not be enough to prevent many from falling into poverty. Some suggest increasing benefits for divorced spouses living alone, as many aged 65 and older have incomes below the poverty line. Another proposal is to raise benefits for the oldest old by a specified percentage, as they tend to rely more on Social Security at advanced ages. After the age of 60, Social Security retirement benefits do not keep pace with rising living standards. The formula for computing initial benefits is indexed to wage growth until age 60 and then to price inflation from age 62. Some argue that the CPI-W is an inaccurate measure of inflation faced by seniors. A study suggests a 5% increase in benefits at age 80 could reduce poverty rates among older beneficiaries. A study suggests a 5% benefit increase at age 80 could reduce poverty rates among older beneficiaries. One proposal is to provide a benefit to persons aged 82 or older based on years contributed to Social Security. Other proposals include linking the Social Security COLA to the CPI-E for Americans aged 62 and older. Less than 30% of additional benefits would go to low-income beneficiaries. The CPI-E, which grows faster than the CPI-W, is projected to increase Social Security benefits, especially for older beneficiaries. The special minimum benefit for workers with long careers at low wages is declining each year, as it is indexed to prices and rising more slowly than regular benefits indexed to wages. The Social Security Administration projected that the special minimum benefit provision would not impact those turning 62 in 2019 or later. Minimum benefit proposals aim to reduce poverty rates among older women, particularly divorced and never-married women, more efficiently than current spousal and survivors benefits. These proposals require 30 to 40 years of Social Security-covered earnings to qualify for a minimum benefit at or slightly above the poverty line. Setting eligibility for a full minimum benefit at 30 to 40 years of covered earnings would allow workers to take time off for caregiving while still receiving a higher benefit. Proposals suggest combining a minimum benefit based on years of employment with spousal benefits or caregiver credits to balance work effort and caregiving recognition. Some proposals link the minimum benefit to wage growth to maintain a constant ratio to living standards. The 2010 National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and the Bipartisan Policy Center proposed new minimum benefits tied to wage growth instead of the poverty line. Researchers suggest modernizing the special minimum benefit in line with National Academy of Social Insurance recommendations. Interactions with other low-income programs need to be considered if a new minimum benefit is provided. Women are more likely to take career breaks for caregiving. The Social Security retired-worker benefit is calculated based on a worker's 35 highest years of earnings, with years of zero earnings due to caregiving lowering the monthly benefit. Proposals suggest replacing zero earnings with a caregiver credit, either fixed or based on foregone earnings, with higher earners potentially receiving more credits. Some proposals require the caregiver to have previous paid labor force experience. Some proposals suggest replacing zero earnings due to caregiving with a caregiver credit, potentially based on foregone earnings. One approach is to drop years of caregiving from the benefit computation period, either by dropping years of zero earnings or low earnings. Dropping years of zero earnings may require leaving the workforce completely, which could be problematic for many women. Allowing a parent to drop up to 5 years of zero (or low) earnings for caring for a child at home would calculate their AIME based on the highest 30 years of earnings instead of 35 years. The Social Security Disability Insurance program allows up to three \"drop-out\" years for caregiving, resulting in higher initial monthly benefits for workers. Policies in other countries credit caregiving years for public pension benefits, raising questions on eligibility for parents who work part-time or full-time and care for young children or other family members. For example, Canada excludes years of caring for children under 7. Some countries provide pension credits for caregiving years, like Canada excluding years caring for children under 7. Recent proposals aim to increase the averaging period for Social Security benefits to improve long-term financial stability and encourage longer work. These changes may disproportionately affect women. Recent proposals to increase the averaging period for Social Security benefits may benefit higher-wage households but could disadvantage lower-wage spouses and single working mothers who cannot afford to stop working for caregiving. There are concerns about ensuring that years out of the workforce are actually spent caring for family members. Additionally, current law leads to a reduction in benefits for aged surviving spouses compared to when both members of the couple were alive. Some proposals suggest increasing the survivor benefit to 75% of the couple's combined monthly benefit when both spouses were alive, aiming to support lower-income households by capping the benefit amount. A 75% minimum survivor benefit provision would increase benefits for surviving spouses, with the benefit amount capped at the average retired-worker beneficiary's benefit. This would result in higher benefits for both one-earner and two-earner couples, with the surviving spouse's benefit increasing to 112% and 75% of the couple's combined benefit, respectively. A 75% minimum survivor benefit provision aims to improve equity between one-earner and two-earner couples by rewarding the second income. Currently, the lower-earning spouse's earnings record does not result in additional benefits upon the death of either spouse. Some suggest financing the survivor benefit by gradually reducing the spousal benefit from 50% to 33% while both spouses are alive, aligning with private annuities' structure. The proposal suggests reducing a one-earner couple's combined monthly benefit to 133% of the worker's benefit to finance a 75% survivor benefit, potentially impacting low-income couples. This adjustment aims to increase equity between one-earner and two-earner couples by rewarding the second income, similar to private annuities' structure. The proposal aims to reduce spousal benefits for divorced spouses from 50% to 33% of the primary earner's benefit, creating income volatility. The 75% survivor benefit option could benefit aged widows but may not address the needs of other vulnerable groups. Some proposals suggest capping the survivor benefit at the average retired-worker benefit to address income disparities. Social Security auxiliary benefits are crucial for older women, surviving spouses, and children of deceased workers. Concerns have been raised about the current structure, which can lead to inequities and exclude certain groups. Proposals have been made to address these issues and increase benefits for vulnerable individuals. Proposals to enhance Social Security benefits for specific vulnerable groups, such as widows and caregivers, aim to improve benefit equity and adequacy. Considerations include balancing benefits for different types of couples and addressing higher poverty rates among never-married individuals. Discussions also involve increasing benefits for spouses, survivors, and divorced spouses. The Social Security system may need to balance benefit increases for spouses, survivors, divorced spouses, and never-married individuals with other program changes to address higher costs. Benefits for spouses and widow(er)s are based on a percentage of the worker's primary insurance amount, with adjustments for age at entitlement. Spousal benefits are reduced if claimed before full retirement age to account for longer benefit receipt periods. Spousal and widow(er) benefits are based on a percentage of the worker's primary insurance amount, with adjustments for age at entitlement. Claiming benefits before full retirement age results in reduced monthly benefits to account for longer benefit receipt periods. When a widow(er) claims survivors benefits at full retirement age, their benefit is limited to prevent it from exceeding the deceased worker's retirement benefit. Other reductions may apply based on entitlement before full retirement age, such as the dual entitlement rule and the government pension offset. Under the government pension offset (GPO), a Social Security spousal or widow(er)'s benefit is reduced if the person also receives a pension from certain government positions not covered by Social Security. Benefits may be reduced to stay within the maximum family benefit amount. The Social Security retirement earnings test (RET) can also lead to reductions in auxiliary benefits for beneficiaries below full retirement age with earnings above specified thresholds. Table B-1 displays the percentage of a worker's PIA used for spousal and widow(er)'s benefits, along with eligibility age and maximum benefit reduction before FRA."
