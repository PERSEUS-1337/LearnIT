    "content": "Head Start is a federal program providing early childhood development services to low-income children and families since 1965. It includes educational, health, nutritional, and social services to prepare children for kindergarten and future success. The program serves children aged birth to three years through Early Head Start. Administered by the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Head Start grants are provided directly by HHS to local grantees, emphasizing family and community involvement for tailored programs. There is flexibility in program design and delivery methods, with variations in services, costs, and coordination with other social programs. Programs can be full or part-day, mostly during the school year. The Head Start program offers full-day and part-day sessions, with full-day enrollment defined as six or more hours per day. The program is due for reauthorization, last reauthorized in December 2007. Early Head Start (EHS) was established in the 1994 Head Start reauthorization legislation to serve infants and toddlers who are too young for regular Head Start. The EHS program received increased funding through legislative changes, with set-asides of 7.5% in FY1999, 8% in FY2000, 9% in FY2001, and 10% in FY2002 and FY2003. This 10% set-aside was maintained until the 2007 reauthorization legislation. The 2007 reauthorization (P.L. 110-134) changed the funding allocation structure for Early Head Start (EHS), eliminating the designated percentage set-aside. The new formula provides base funding for current grantees and allows for additional expansion dollars if funds are available after set-asides for various purposes. Existing Head Start grantees can convert some preschool slots to serve infants and toddlers with HHS approval. Early Head Start (EHS) grants, totaling $47 million, were awarded in September 1995, with nearly $1.268 billion used to support EHS programs in FY2012. These projects funded enrollment slots for approximately 113,566 low-income families with children under age three. EHS programs must provide education, home visits, parent education, comprehensive health services, and ongoing parental support. Head Start can serve children of any age before compulsory school. Head Start and Early Head Start programs target low-income children and families. Head Start serves children before compulsory school age, with most being three- and four-year-olds. Early Head Start serves children under age three and pregnant women. Programs require at least 90% of children to come from families with income at or below the federal poverty guideline. The Head Start program serves low-income children and families, with eligibility criteria including being from a family receiving public assistance, in foster care, or homeless. Up to 10% of children served may exceed poverty guidelines, and programs can fill up to 35% of slots with children from families with income between 100% and 130% of the poverty line. Priority is given to homeless or below poverty children. In FY2012, Head Start enrolled children based on primary eligibility types, with 3% eligible with income between 100% and 130% of poverty, 5% from families exceeding poverty, and 93% from families below poverty or categorically eligible. Low-income children in Head Start can maintain their status for another program year. Head Start participants can remain classified as low income for an additional program year. Grantees have flexibility in determining family income for eligibility. Regulations mandate that at least 10% of slots be reserved for children with disabilities, who must still meet income criteria. \"Funded enrollment\" refers to funded Head Start slots, not total children served. In FY2012, there were funded enrollment slots for 956,497 children, with roughly 12% for Early Head Start programs. Reasons for underenrollment in Head Start programs vary, with grantees required to maintain waiting lists to fill vacancies quickly. The 2007 reauthorization law requires Head Start agencies to report monthly enrollment to ensure full utilization of funds. Persistent underenrollment triggers technical assistance, with potential grant reductions for chronic underenrollment. HHS is working to standardize enrollment reporting for grantees. HHS collects monthly online enrollment data from Head Start grantees to ensure full fund utilization. On average, 0.8% of funded slots for Head Start children were unfilled in FY2012, impacting approximately 7,270 children. The 2007 reauthorization law incorporated governance rules into statute, giving power to governing bodies and policy councils in Head Start programs. The law outlines the composition and responsibilities of governing bodies and policy councils in Head Start programs. Governing bodies have legal and fiscal accountability, with specific requirements for board members. Policy councils are responsible for program design and operation, with a majority of members being parents of children enrolled in the program. The Head Start program requires the policy council to have a majority of its members from the program's community, including parents of former enrollees. Disputes can arise when the governing body and policy council cannot agree, necessitating written internal dispute resolution procedures. The 2007 reauthorization law increased the degree requirements for Head Start staff. In 2007, the reauthorization law increased staff qualification requirements for Head Start. HHS provided funding opportunities for training and technical assistance to help grantees meet these new requirements. For example, in April 2008, $5 million was allocated for Head Start training related to staff qualifications. In September 2008, competitive grants were awarded to support career development for Head Start teachers pursuing ECE degrees. The 2007 reauthorization law increased staff qualification requirements for Head Start, including a provision for teachers to participate in 15 hours of professional development annually. Head Start agencies must now develop professional development plans for all full-time employees providing direct services to children. These plans are to be regularly evaluated for their impact on teacher and staff performance. The Head Start Act requires HHS to conduct program monitoring reviews of Head Start grantees every three years to ensure compliance with standards. Follow-up visits are required for agencies with deficiencies or noncompliance, and unannounced site inspections may be conducted. Review teams must include individuals knowledgeable about Head Start. HHS conducts program monitoring reviews of Head Start grantees every three years to ensure compliance with standards. Review teams should include individuals knowledgeable about early childhood education, personnel management, financial accountability, and the diverse needs of eligible children and their families. Monitoring teams receive training for quality and consistency. Data gathered from monitoring are used by HHS to assess program quality and compliance. The FY2014 monitoring protocol was released in September 2013, grouping performance indicators in seven areas. The monitoring system evaluates Head Start grantees in seven areas and categorizes them based on quality levels. If deficiencies are found, HHS notifies the grantee to correct them within a year. Failure to do so constitutes a material failure to comply with funding terms. The 2007 Head Start reauthorization law established a five-year designation period for grantees, requiring them to demonstrate high-quality services or face re-competition. The Designation Renewal System (DRS) identifies grantees for re-competition, overseen by HHS and a panel of experts. In January 2008, HHS formed an Advisory Committee on Re-designation of Head Start Grantees, which released formal recommendations in a report a year later. In September 2010, HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on the DRS, receiving around 16,000 comments. The final DRS rule, issued in November 2011, established seven indicators to identify Head Start grantees not providing high-quality services. The DRS rule established seven indicators to identify Head Start grantees not meeting quality standards. Grantees with deficiencies must compete for continued funding based on criteria like school-readiness goals and classroom quality scores. The DRS rule established seven indicators to identify Head Start grantees not meeting quality standards, including license revocation, operations suspension, debarment from receiving funds, and being at risk of ceasing to be a \"going concern\" based on audits or investigations. The Designation Renewal System (DRS) became effective on December 9, 2011, with the first cohort of grantees announced for re-competition in December 2011 and a second cohort in January 2013. Competitions began in 2012, with approximately 153 grants awarded by July 2013. Congress faced a funding gap in FY2014, leading to a partial government shutdown until a short-term continuing resolution was signed into law on October 17, 2013. The CR (P.L. 113-46) funds Head Start at FY2013 post-sequester levels through January 15, 2014. Congressional action on appropriations was limited to narrow CRs targeting specific programs. The Head Start for Low-Income Children Act (H.J.Res. 84) aimed to provide temporary funding for Head Start through December 15, 2013. Shutdown caused six Head Start grantees to close centers for up to nine days. Senate Appropriations Committee approved an FY2014 appropriations bill (S. 1284, S.Rept. 113-71) on July 11, 2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an FY2014 appropriations bill (S. 1284, S.Rept. 113-71) for the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies, providing annual funding for the Head Start program at $9.621 billion, as requested by the President in the FY2014 Budget. This amount is a significant increase from the program's post-sequester FY2013 funding level. The HHS proposed Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships to increase funding for Head Start programs, aiming to serve 1,052,465 children and families in FY2014. The FY2013 funding for Head Start was $7.573 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2013 funding for Head Start was $395 million less than the previous year, reflecting various reductions including an across-the-board rescission, sequestration, and potential transfers of funds. Sequestration is an automatic spending reduction process to enforce budget policy goals under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The sequester order issued on March 1, 2013, resulted in a 5% reduction in nonexempt nondefense discretionary programs like Head Start. Approximately 57,000 children were cut from Head Start programs in FY2013, with the majority being preschoolers aged 3-5. The sequester also led to reduced services, terminated employees, and salary reductions for about 18,000 Head Start employees nationwide. The FY2013 funding level of $7.573 billion did not include supplemental funds for Hurricane Sandy relief. In FY2013, Congress provided roughly $94.977 million for Head Start programs, totaling $7.688 billion. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), allocated $8.002 billion for Head Start. The amounts in the FY2013 ACF All-Purpose Table may be adjusted further due to sequestration or internal decisions by HHS. In FY2013, Congress allocated $8.002 billion for Head Start programs, but this amount was reduced to $7.986 billion due to rescissions and sequester orders. An additional $100 million was provided for Head Start programs in states affected by Hurricane Sandy, with funds not considered part of the program's base grant in subsequent years. In April 2013, the HHS Office of Head Start issued a program instruction for emergency relief funds for Head Start agencies in states impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Funding prioritized programs with significant damage and high numbers of displaced families. The Obama Administration had requested disaster relief funding from Congress in December 2012 for states affected by Hurricane Sandy. The Obama Administration requested $100 million in supplemental Head Start funding for states affected by Hurricane Sandy. The Senate approved the request as part of a disaster supplemental package, but the House did not take action before the end of the 112th Congress. The funds were expected to support 265 Head Start centers damaged by the hurricane. Temporary funding for Head Start was provided by a six-month government-wide CR for FY2013 before the enactment of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. In FY2013, the House Appropriations L-HHS-ED Subcommittee approved a bill for full committee consideration, providing $8.014 billion in funding for Head Start activities, including cost-of-living adjustments for grantees. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill to provide $8.039 billion for Head Start in FY2013, with funds allocated for sustaining payments, COLAs for grantees, and implementation costs for the Designation Renewal System. The funds were expected to maintain services for about 962,000 children. The Obama Administration's FY2013 Budget requested $8.054 billion for Head Start, with $85 million more than the previous year. The majority of funds were to sustain services, with additional funding for COLAs and the Designation Renewal System. The requested funds aimed to maintain services for approximately 962,000 children and families. In response to the Gulf Coast Hurricanes of 2005, supplemental Head Start appropriations were provided. Congress passed a consolidated appropriations bill in December 2011, allocating $7.969 billion for Head Start in FY2012, an increase of $409 million from the previous year. Base grants for relevant grantees were to be increased by 50% of the ARRA expansion funds they received in FY2010. The FY2012 appropriations law aimed to fully sustain ARRA expansions for Head Start grantees by embedding necessary funds in their base grants. It also included a 0.72% COLA for all grantees. Temporary funding for Head Start was provided by three short-term continuing resolutions before the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act was enacted. In September 2011, bills were introduced in the House and Senate for year-long FY2012 L-HHS-ED appropriations. The House bill (H.R. 3070) proposed $8.1 billion for Head Start, while the Senate bill (S. 1599) proposed $7.9 billion. Both bills included provisions to increase base grants by 50% of certain ARRA expansion funds. The House bill also aimed to direct up to $20 million towards special enrollment expansions for AIAN and MSHS programs. The Obama Administration requested $8.1 billion for Head Start in FY2012, an increase of $865 million from FY2010. The increase aimed to support enrollment slots for 968,000 children, with most funds sustaining ARRA-funded slots. Remaining funds could be used for program expansions or quality improvement activities, pending FY2011 appropriations. The FY2011 appropriations process for Head Start concluded with a full-year CR (P.L. 112-10) providing $7.560 billion, a 5% increase from FY2010. The CR included a provision to incorporate half of the FY2010 ARRA expansion funds into base grants. Seven short-term CRs provided temporary funding until the final FY2011 CR was enacted. Prior to the final FY2011 CR, temporary funding for Head Start was maintained at $7.234 billion through several short-term CRs. The House had proposed legislation (H.R. 1) that would have reduced Head Start funding to $6.152 billion, the lowest level since FY2000, which would have been insufficient to maintain the program's services. The Senate rejected H.R. 1 and proposed funding Head Start at $7.575 billion, an increase of $341 million from FY2010. This included maintaining 50% of ARRA program expansion funds for grantees. In the 111th Congress, both the House and Senate had initiated the FY2011 L-HHS-ED appropriations process. The Senate proposed funding Head Start at $8.224 billion for FY2011, maintaining the number of children served from the previous year, including slots funded by ARRA. The bill included provisions to make ARRA expansion funds part of each grantee's base grant. The bill proposed overriding the program's allocation formula by reducing training and technical assistance funds by $5.1 million and directing remaining funds towards quality improvement activities. These provisions were part of the Obama Administration's FY2011 Budget. The House L-HHS-ED Appropriations Subcommittee approved its proposal for FY2011 appropriations, but the full House Appropriations Committee did not take action on the legislation. The House Appropriations Committee did not take action on the legislation for FY2011 L-HHS-ED funding during the 111th Congress. The L-HHS-ED Subcommittee proposed $8.1 billion for Head Start, $865 million more than FY2010, but $124 million less than the Obama Administration's request. The Obama Administration requested $8.224 billion for Head Start in its FY2011 Budget, an increase of $990 million from FY2010. The Obama Administration requested $8.224 billion for Head Start in FY2011, an increase of $990 million from FY2010. The proposed increase aimed to sustain services for children, support a 2% cost-of-living adjustment, fund specific set-asides for training and technical assistance, and provide quality improvement funds to grantees. In December 2009, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, into law, providing $7.235 billion for Head Start, which was the amount requested in the FY2010 President's Budget. This funding level reflected an increase of almost $122 million over the program's funding level in FY2009. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided almost $122 million over the program's funding level in FY2009 for Head Start. Additionally, a supplemental appropriation of $2.1 billion from the ARRA was received in that year. The Act specified that only funds used for cost-of-living adjustments would be considered part of grantees' base grants in future years. ARRA funds for program expansions or quality improvements were not included in the allocation formula. Prior to the passage of H.R. 3288, the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations process for FY2010 had been initiated by both the House and Senate. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill seeking $7.235 billion for Head Start in FY2010, while the House passed a similar bill with the same funding amount. Both bills aimed to serve approximately 978,000 children, including 69,000 new slots funded by ARRA. The Obama Administration's FY2010 Budget details were released in May 2009. In May 2009, the Obama Administration requested $7.235 billion for Head Start in its FY2010 Budget, an increase of $122 million from FY2009. This increase aimed to sustain the number of children served in the program. President Obama signed the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act into law on March 11, 2009, which allocated almost $7.113 billion for Head Start, including funds for Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood. This marked an increase from previous funding levels. In FY2009, Congress passed two CRs funding Head Start at $6.878 billion. The first CR (P.L. 110-329) was signed by President Bush and the second CR (P.L. 111-6) by President Obama. Additionally, Head Start received $2.1 billion from the ARRA in FY2009, with $1.1 billion directed towards Early Head Start programs. In FY2009, Head Start funding was distributed through regular Head Start formula, with an increase of $149 million requested for FY2009. The funding was intended for cost-of-living adjustments, quality activities, state advisory councils, and expansions for Head Start and Early Head Start programs. The George W. Bush Administration proposed a budget of $7.027 billion for Head Start, with plans to give programs a cost-of-living increase of 1.9% and increase enrollment in specific programs. The table displays Head Start's authorized funding levels and total funding available for each fiscal year through FY2013. Advance funding was included in appropriations from FY2000 to FY2009, but discontinued in FY2010. Increases in funding do not always result in additional Head Start slots. The 2007 reauthorization law allowed Head Start grantees to convert slots, but without additional funds, this led to reductions in funded enrollment levels. Head Start funded enrollment levels have mostly been declining over the past 12 years. During the past 12 years, Head Start program supported enrollment slots for 850,217 children in FY2001, reaching a peak of 850,450 children in FY2010 with ARRA-funded slots. However, funded enrollment levels declined to 842,931 children in FY2012. Early Head Start program supported slots for 55,018 children in FY2001, increasing to 114,746 children in FY2010, including ARRA-funded slots. The FY2012 enrollment level of 113,566 Early Head Start children reflects a substantial increase from pre-ARRA levels, with $90 million in additional funding allocated for Head Start facilities affected by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005. Of the $90 million appropriated, $74 million was awarded based on grantee requests. HHS awarded $74 million to grantees based on requests, with the remaining funds returned to the Treasury. $15 million was made available to help cover costs for displaced children and families after the 2005 hurricanes. Grantees were instructed to treat preschool-aged children from displaced families as income-eligible, with or without documentation. HHS provided guidance for requesting waivers to meet Head Start regulations for newly enrolled displaced children. Regional federal offices were asked to collect daily data and address concerns from grantees serving evacuated families. The HHS instructed regional offices to collect daily data from grantees on evacuee children in Head Start programs. Grantees receive funds directly from HHS and must provide a 20% non-federal match. The 2007 reauthorization law changed the Head Start allocation formula. The Head Start appropriations are now allocated based on a specific formula. All programs receive their base grant amount from the total funding, with a portion reserved for training and technical assistance. 20% of these funds are designated for Early Head Start programs, and the rest for Head Start programs. The Secretary allocates funds to support state-based T/TA systems, program quality, performance standards, and discretionary payments. Research, demonstration, and evaluation activities are also funded, with specific limits for impact studies. If appropriations decrease, all allocations are reduced proportionately. The Secretary allocates funds for state-based T/TA systems, program quality, performance standards, and discretionary payments. Excess funds are used for cost-of-living adjustments and special expansions in AIAN and MSHS programs. The amount allocated depends on available funding. Under Scenario 1, all grantees receive a full COLA and additional funds for enrollment increases in AIAN and MSHS programs. The Secretary allocates funds for state-based T/TA systems, program quality, and discretionary payments. Excess funds are used for cost-of-living adjustments and special expansions in AIAN and MSHS programs. If full funds are not available, a formula is applied for allocation. For Fiscal Years 2008-2010, 90% of remaining funds after Step 1 are used for COLAs of at least 50%, with the remaining 10% split between AIAN and MSHS programs for enrollment expansion. From FY2011 onwards, remaining funds after Step 1 are used for full COLAs to grantees, with any extra funds divided equally between AIAN and MSHS programs. Step 1 - Funds are allocated for state-based T/TA systems, program quality, and discretionary payments. Excess funds are used for cost-of-living adjustments and special expansions in AIAN and MSHS programs. If full funds are not available, a formula is applied for allocation. For Fiscal Years 2008-2010, 90% of remaining funds after Step 1 are used for COLAs of at least 50%, with the remaining 10% split between AIAN and MSHS programs for enrollment expansion. From FY2011 onwards, remaining funds after Step 1 are used for full COLAs to grantees, with any extra funds divided equally between AIAN and MSHS programs.\n\nStep 2 - COLAs to grantees, with any remaining funds to be divided equally between AIAN and MSHS programs for special expansions. In the event that sufficient funding is not available to fulfill the requirements outlined under Scenario 2, then the excess funds remaining after Step 1 are to be used to provide equal COLAs to all Head Start and Early Head Start grantees, with no funds made available for special expansions to increase AIAN or MSHS enrollment. Step 3 applies to any funds remaining after allocation under Step 2 (Scenario 1). Generally, of remaining funds, 40% is to be used for quality improvement purposes (including compensation) in HS and EHS programs, 45% for program expansions, and 15% for State Advisory Councils. However, no more than $100 million may be allocated toward State Advisory Councils over the course of all fiscal years. The law specifies an alternate Step 3 formula in the event that this cap is reached, which it was in FY2009. The alternate Step 3 formula specifies that 55% of remaining funds are for program expansions and 45% for quality improvement activities. Table 4 shows allocation amounts for Head Start grantees in each state and territory based on funding from FY2010 to FY2012. FY2013 allocations are not shown as they have not been released yet. In April 2013, HHS announced that FY2013 grants for Head Start programs would be 5.27% lower than in FY2012. A report by the GAO in September 2010 highlighted fraud and abuse at selected Head Start centers, with fictitious families being approved for the program despite exceeding income eligibility levels. In response, HHS issued a program instruction in May 2010 to remind Head Start employees of program requirements. The Secretary of HHS, Kathleen Sebelius, sent a letter to Head Start grantees addressing fraud issues and steps to strengthen program integrity, including new regulations on income verification and staff training. Compliance issues with health and safety requirements were identified by the HHS Office of the Inspector General. Head Start was identified as a program under the Improper Payment Information Act of 2002. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) identified Head Start as a program at risk of significant improper payments. HHS has been reporting Head Start error rates since FY2004, with payment errors defined as payments to families with income exceeding the allowable limit. Verification of family income is required before a child can participate in the program, with specific actions for Head Start employees to follow. The current status of recipients of public assistance includes income verification for eligibility in Head Start programs. Employees must sign a statement confirming review of income documents and eligibility determination based on family income. While programs are not required to keep source documentation, HHS encourages maintaining these materials in the child's record. Proposed rulemaking may make this a formal requirement. The final rule on eligibility documentation procedures for Head Start is pending. Children can apply regardless of immigration status. Social security numbers are not required. A national error rate study in FY2012 reviewed 50 programs through a random sample. Reviewers checked if children were ineligible based on their records. The FY2012 error rate for Head Start was 0.58%, resulting in $46.2 million in erroneous payments. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on eligibility documentation was released in March 2011, with proposed changes to enrollment procedures. The final rule on eligibility documentation is still pending. The NPRM proposes changes to program enrollment procedures, including requiring accurate documentation from applicants and staff, applying verification procedures to income and categorical eligibility, and mandating training on eligibility determination and fraud consequences for Head Start program staff. The Head Start Program Performance Standards mandate compliance with health and safety requirements for facilities, including daily cleaning, hazard prevention, and annual safety inspections. The Head Start Program requires grantees to conduct annual safety inspections to ensure facilities meet health and safety standards, including lead-free paint. Grantees must also perform criminal record checks on staff and provide initial health examinations. In FY2010, the HHS Office of the Inspector General conducted audits on Head Start grantees to assess children's health and safety. Auditors reviewed federal and state laws, grantee's employee files, and compliance with requirements. Over 20 audits were published on grantees' compliance with regulations. The OIG conducted audits on Head Start grantees' compliance with health and safety requirements, finding that most grantees followed regulations but had common violations such as incomplete background checks and unsafe environment for children. States play a crucial role in policies affecting low-income children and families. The 1998 Head Start reauthorization law encouraged collaboration between child care and Head Start, promoting unified early education and child care plans to increase full-time services. It also directed the Secretary of HHS to identify barriers to collaboration, provide technical assistance, and consider coordination with other child care providers for Head Start expansion grants. Agencies were authorized to charge fees for extended-day services if needed. In 1990, HHS awarded Head Start Collaboration grants to promote collaboration among agencies serving low-income children. The 2007 reauthorization law further strengthened collaboration between Head Start and early childhood programs, emphasizing smooth transitions for children into pre-kindergarten or kindergarten. Head Start agencies are expected to collaborate with local education agencies and publicly funded preschool programs in their service areas. The 2007 reauthorization law included a requirement for Head Start agencies to collaborate with preschool programs and establish State Advisory Councils on Early Childhood Education and Care. These councils aim to improve coordination across early childhood programs and involve various stakeholders. State Advisory Councils are mandated to conduct specific activities to assess the quality and availability of early childhood education. The curr_chunk discusses the objectives of a statewide needs assessment on early childhood care and education, including identifying collaboration opportunities, increasing children's participation in programs, establishing a unified data collection system, developing a professional development plan, assessing higher education support for early childhood educators, and making recommendations. The Head Start Act allowed HHS to award one-time start-up grants to states for developing high-quality early childhood education systems. $100 million was made available for these grants in FY2009, with states required to submit applications by August 2010. However, not all states applied for funds and not all applications met requirements. HHS awarded state advisory council funding to all but five states and two territories, meeting Head Start Act requirements. Funds were awarded by September 2010 for a project period from 2010-2013. States had to have a governor-designated State Advisory Council, provide non-federal matching funds at 70%, and submit a three-year state plan and application. Plans had to include a strategic report, how funds would support the council's mission, early learning standards, and goals for increasing kindergarten enrollment. The Head Start Act required states to set goals for kindergarten readiness, designate individuals for grant activities, and plan for sustainability. States awarded start-up grants had to submit interim and final reports to HHS, including updates on State Advisory Council activities. The report provides an update on State Advisory Council (SAC) activities, including projects in non-required areas like kindergarten assessments and parent engagement. It also discusses challenges states face in meeting SAC requirements and mentions the designation of exemplary Head Start agencies as Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood. Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood, known as \"Centers of Excellence,\" receive bonus grants of at least $200,000 annually for five years. They must use 15% of the grant for sharing best practices and can use the rest for various activities like providing Head Start services, professional development, and improving program coordination. The designation process is competitive and requires nomination by the governor or regional HHS office head. The Centers of Excellence program receives funding from the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, with $2 million allocated for this purpose. Funds were available until September 30, 2010, and applications were due by July 12, 2010. In 2010, 10 programs were selected to receive funding, followed by 10 new Centers of Excellence in 2011 without special funding. The Family and Children Experiences Survey (FACES) and the National Impact Study evaluate the effectiveness of the Head Start program by studying children and families in Head Start programs. FACES is a longitudinal study that examines the development of children, families, classrooms, and program staff. Cohorts have been initiated periodically since 1997. The National Impact Study, mandated by the 1998 reauthorization law, analyzes the impact of Head Start on low-income children's development and school-readiness. Data collection started in 2002 and continued until 2008, following children through 3rd grade. The latest results released in 2012 found limited sustained effects of Head Start participation on cognitive, social-emotional development, health, and parenting practices. The study found limited sustained effects of Head Start participation on children's development through third grade. While access to Head Start had a positive impact on preschool experiences, it made little difference in early elementary school. Cognitive impacts were mostly wiped out by third grade, with only reading showing a favorable impact. Social-emotional development findings were mixed for four-year-olds. The study found mixed social-emotional impacts for four-year-olds in Head Start, with parents reporting favorable effects but teachers and children reporting some negative impacts. For three-year-olds, parents consistently reported positive social-emotional impacts through third grade. Health impacts disappeared by third grade, while some favorable parenting impacts remained, such as increased time spent with the child and authoritative parenting. The study found sustained cognitive impacts for certain subgroups of children in the three-year-old cohort, including those from high-risk households and with parents reporting no depressive symptoms. Favorable cognitive impacts were also seen in children of parents with mild depressive symptoms in the four-year-old cohort. However, some unfavorable impacts on white children were identified in the social-emotional domain, which persisted through third grade. The study found that access to Head Start had positive benefits for both three-year-olds and four-year-olds in cognitive, health, parenting, and social-emotional domains. For the four-year-old group, benefits were concentrated in language and literacy elements of the cognitive domain, as well as access to dental care in the health domain. Meanwhile, the three-year-old cohort showed benefits in all four domains at the end of the program year. HHS released the results from the first grade follow-up study in January 2010, which examined the average impact of Head Start access from the child's program year through first grade. The study found that while the benefits of Head Start at age four were mostly gone by 1st grade, some benefits were sustained for children who participated at age three, such as improved parent-child relationships. Certain subgroups, like children with special needs, low cognitive skills, and those in the three-year-old cohort, experienced lasting benefits into first grade. The Head Start Impact Study evaluated the program against alternative care settings, not a \"no services\" condition. About 60% of control group children participated in child care or early education programs. There has been interest in transferring federal administration of Head Start to the U.S. Department of Education. President Carter proposed this in 1978, and the Reagan Administration attempted to include Head Start in a block grant. President George W. Bush recommended transferring Head Start to the Department of Education in his FY2004 budget to improve coordination with other programs, but Congress did not act on the proposal. Subsequent budgets did not include the transfer plan. Bush's proposal aimed to prioritize the education component of Head Start over health, nutrition, and social services. President Bush proposed prioritizing pre-reading and numeracy skills in Head Start by supporting an early childhood reading initiative. Advocates believed Head Start should remain in HHS to maintain its wide array of services beyond traditional education. Transferring the program to the Department of Education could limit Head Start's offerings. Opponents of moving Head Start to the Department of Education argued that it would compromise the program's comprehensive services and community strengths. President Bush believed the shift would prioritize literacy development and increase the chances of every child becoming a proficient reader by 3rd grade. Some argued that Head Start should remain in HHS to focus on preparing children for school. The final rule published in the Federal Register authorized HHS to issue waivers to Head Start grantees from certain transportation regulations, extending the deadline for compliance to December 30, 2006. President Bush signed legislation to equip Head Start vehicles with child safety restraints. The National Reporting System (NRS) was implemented in 2003 to assess Head Start four- and five-year-olds on educational performance measures. Recommendations were made in 2005 and 2007 to improve the system, but the 2007 reauthorization law halted further development of the NRS. The 2007 reauthorization of the Head Start program (P.L. 110-134) marked the most recent update since 1998. Reauthorization efforts in the 108th Congress were not fully successful, with the House passing a bill (H.R. 2210) and the Senate producing a different bill (S. 1940) that was never brought to the floor. The 2007 reauthorization of the Head Start program included proposals for state administration of Head Start in qualifying states and discrimination in employment based on religion. Both bills aimed to increase competition for grants and collaboration with other early childhood service providers. Staff qualifications were also proposed to be raised beyond 1998 levels. The School Readiness Act of 2003 (H.R. 2210) included amendments to the 1998 Head Start law and a new option for eight states to administer federal funds. The bill H.R. 2210 proposed state administration of Head Start funds in qualifying states, with the option limited to eight states over five years. It was reported from the Committee on Education and the Workforce and passed by the House with a one-vote margin. Representative George Miller's substitute bill aimed to retain changes to Title I but remove Title II, which proposed state demonstration projects. Key features of Title I included increased credentials for Head Start teachers and a 2% cap. Title I of the bill included increased credentials for Head Start teachers, a 2% cap on funds reserved for training, requirements for collaboration among early childhood programs, a 60% set-aside for quality improvement, 10% reserved for Early Head Start, and permission for faith-based programs to discriminate in hiring. Title II allowed up to eight states to participate in state demonstration programs for federal Head Start funding. The House proposal allowed up to eight states to administer their Head Start programs, requiring alignment with state K-12 standards, prior-year spending at 50% of federal funds, and interagency coordination. This pilot program resembled a previous proposal by President George W. Bush. George W. Bush's FY2004 proposal allowed states to administer Head Start with specific criteria. The Administration aimed to improve preschool programs for kindergarten readiness. Under the President's proposal, states can administer Head Start by coordinating with other preschool programs to focus on developing language, pre-reading, numeracy, and social skills while meeting state accountability standards. States must submit a plan outlining preschool goals, accountability measures, enrollment maintenance, spending, staff development, and program coordination. The President requested $45 million in his FY2006 budget to improve Head Start through a nine-state pilot project to coordinate with state preschool programs and federal child care grants. This coordination aims to enhance preschool programs and promote school readiness. The Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act (S. 1940) aimed to reauthorize Head Start with changes in fund allocation, including specific percentages for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Migrant/Seasonal Head Start programs. Unlike the House bill, it did not allow states to administer the program or alter non-discrimination hiring provisions. The bill proposed changes in fund allocation for Head Start programs, including specific percentages for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Migrant/Seasonal Head Start programs. It aimed to prioritize grantees in states serving the smallest percentages of eligible children and distribute funds competitively. Additionally, it included a 60% set-aside for quality improvement and maintained the percentage of funds for the Early Head Start program at 10% in FY2004, gradually increasing to 18% in FY2009. Collaboration grants would have been awarded to each state by the Secretary, with each state's governor designating a State Advisory Council for collaboration between Head Start and other entities. The bill proposed establishing a State Advisory Council to advise on collaboration between Head Start and other early child care entities. It would authorize $90 million for grants to Head Start agencies for best practices, serving more children, and staff training. The bill aimed to increase eligibility to 130% of the poverty line and required active waiting lists. Monthly enrollment reporting and technical assistance for low enrollment were also included. The bill proposed providing technical assistance for chronic underenrollment in funded enrollment. If underenrollment persisted after 18 months, the grantee's base grant could be reduced. The bill also allocated funds for training and technical assistance in early childhood education. Other provisions included increasing Head Start staff qualifications, setting school readiness goals, and commissioning a review by the National Academy of Sciences on early childhood care and education. The 109th Congress did not reauthorize the Head Start program despite legislative efforts. In the House, bill H.R. 2123 was introduced and approved with an amendment allowing faith-based Head Start providers to discriminate in hiring based on religion. On the Senate side, bill S. 1107 was approved by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee but did not reach the floor. The House bill would have reserved specified percentages of the total appropriation for American Indian and Alaskan Native Head Start programs. The House bill H.R. 2123 proposed changes to Head Start funding, including reserving funds for specific programs, increasing competition for grants, and requiring active partnerships with local educational agencies. Priority grantees would not have to compete for funding every five years if they demonstrated no deficiencies. Additionally, Head Start agencies would need to establish an independent board of directors for oversight. The proposed H.R. 2123 bill aimed to establish an independent board of directors for Head Start agencies to oversee program activities and finances. Policy councils, mainly consisting of parents, would serve in an advisory role rather than having decision-making authority. The bill also included provisions for evaluating and potentially defunding delegate agencies, as well as reducing funding for grantees with chronic underenrollment. The House bill H.R. 2123 proposed reducing funding for grantees with chronic underenrollment if enrollment did not reach 95% after receiving technical assistance. It also aimed to change grantee's rights for appealing suspensions or terminations, no longer allowing reimbursement for legal fees. Additionally, the bill required Head Start agencies to align program activities with state K-12 academic standards and enter into agreements with state and local early childhood education programs. New staff qualification standards were also included. H.R. 2123 proposed new staff qualification standards, including requiring at least 50% of Head Start teachers to have a bachelor's degree in early childhood education. S. 1107 aimed to reauthorize the Head Start Act and make changes to funding allocation. Under S. 1107, changes would have been made to the way funds are allotted among programs, with tribal programs receiving 4% and Migrant and Seasonal programs receiving 5% of the Head Start appropriation. 2% of funds would be reserved for training and technical assistance, and state allotments would be based on FY2005 amounts. Funding for Early Head Start programs would have been increased, and competition for grant funds would have been heightened. S. 1107 would have increased competition for grant funds by requiring recompetition every five years. It would have mandated governing bodies for Head Start grantees to oversee program planning, finances, and performance. Procedures for evaluating delegate agencies and defunding them when necessary would have been established. The bill also included provisions for reducing funding for underenrollment. S. 1107 aimed to improve Head Start program quality by providing funding for Centers of Excellence, requiring staff to have specific qualifications by certain deadlines, and increasing competition for grant funds through recompetition every five years. The bill aimed to improve Head Start program quality by requiring teachers to meet specific qualifications, including a B.A. degree in early childhood education by the end of FY2011. Additionally, Head Start teachers were required to attend at least 15 hours of professional development annually. Income eligibility for Head Start was increased to 130% of the poverty guideline, and homeless children were deemed eligible for the program. A National Academy of Sciences panel was commissioned to review issues related to early childhood care and education. In the 110th Congress, efforts to pass Head Start reauthorization were successful when President George W. Bush signed H.R. 1429 into law as P.L. 110-134. The bill was introduced by Representative Kildee and amended in the Education and Labor Committee. Amendments rejected included controversial provisions from previous reauthorization debates. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 1429 was signed into law as P.L. 110-134 for Head Start reauthorization. Representative Fortu\u00f1o's amendment to allow faith-based agencies to discriminate based on religion failed 19-26. Representative Price's amendment for state pilot projects also failed 18-27. The bill passed the House 365-48 on May 2, 2007, with twelve amendments offered, nine accepted. Another amendment for a demonstration program in eight states failed 165-254. In the 110th Congress, Representative Fortu\u00f1o's amendment to allow faith-based Head Start providers to discriminate in hiring based on religion was rejected. The amendment aimed to grant religious organizations equal consideration as providers, allow them to maintain their religious identity, and restrict federal funds from being used for religious activities. In the 110th Congress, Representative Fortu\u00f1o's amendment to allow faith-based Head Start providers to discriminate in hiring based on religion was rejected. A motion was made during floor debate to return H.R. 1429 to the Education and Labor Committee for further consideration of the provisions in this amendment, but it failed. The reauthorization measure, H.R. 1429 as amended, passed the House by a vote of 365-48. On the Senate side, a Head Start reauthorization bill (S. 556) was approved and reported by the Senate HELP Committee. The full Senate passed this bill under the House bill's number, H.R. 1429, by voice vote. House and Senate conferees filed a conference report resolving differences between the House and Senate versions. The conference report accompanying H.R. 1429 resolved differences between House and Senate versions of a reauthorization measure. $2.1 billion in Head Start funding from the ARRA was allocated, with $1.1 billion for Early Head Start expansion. HHS obligated $2.1 billion by the end of FY2010. HHS obligated $2.1 billion in ARRA funds by the end of FY2010, supporting new enrollment slots for Head Start children and new classrooms. Allocation amounts for Head Start grantees in each state are detailed in Table B-2 based on funding from various appropriations acts."
