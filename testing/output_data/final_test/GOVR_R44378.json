HHS is comprised of 11 main agencies, known as operating divisions, responsible for various health and human services. Additionally, there are staff divisions within the Office of the Secretary that support the department's functions. Eight of the operating divisions are part of the U.S. Public Health Service, each with diverse missions in public health support. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) oversees health care services, medical research, disease prevention, and food and drug regulation. Three HHS divisions focus on human services for vulnerable populations. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request allocated $1.145 trillion for HHS expenditures. In FY2017, HHS is estimated to spend $1.145 trillion, a $34 billion increase from FY2016. HHS accounts for nearly 28% of all federal outlays, with Medicare and Medicaid expected to make up 86% of HHS spending. Mandatory spending dominates the HHS budget, while discretionary spending only accounts for about 8%. The HHS budget for FY2017 shows that discretionary spending is only about 8% of total outlays, with HHS receiving a significant portion of discretionary funds compared to other federal departments. The President's request allocates 51% of discretionary budget authority to the Department of Defense, followed by nearly 7% to HHS. The HHS budget includes a broader set of resources beyond annual appropriations, leading to discrepancies in budget amounts. The HHS budget for FY2017 includes both discretionary and mandatory spending. Mandatory spending is provided directly by authorizing laws, while discretionary spending is controlled through annual appropriations. Some mandatory programs, like Medicaid, require funding through the appropriations process, known as \"appropriated entitlements.\" The HHS budget request considers the department as a whole, with funding divided among three appropriations bills. Discretionary spending is mainly provided through the LHHS Appropriations Act, while certain agencies receive funding from the INT and AG Appropriations Acts. Administration estimates for HHS programs may differ from congressional scorekeepers. The HHS budget materials may have different estimates for mandatory spending programs in FY2017, including proposed law and current law estimates. Proposed law estimates consider changes in mandatory spending proposed in the budget request, while current law estimates assume no policy changes. Congressional scorekeepers may have different conventions than the Administration in accounting for funding transfers between HHS agencies or to other federal agencies. The HHS budget estimates in this report reflect proposed law estimates for mandatory spending programs, but other estimates may reflect current law. Discretionary spending in appropriations bills may not include all available budgetary resources, as agencies within HHS can supplement appropriations with user fees and transfers from other sources. The HHS budget estimates include trust funds established by the ACA. Budgetary totals at the \"program level\" account for resources in the Administration estimates. HHS agencies like the FDA and AHRQ have notable differences between appropriations bills and program levels. The FY2015-2017 figures are from the HHS Budget in Brief. The FY2016 BIB provides a summary of each operating division's mission, FY2017 budget request, and links to related resources. Budget authority (BA) allows for financial obligations, while outlays are actual expenditures from the Treasury. The figures in the table represent funding provided to each HHS agency through the federal budget process.
