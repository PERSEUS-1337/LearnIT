The Act allows the Secretary of Education to make grants to States and local educational agencies to support hiring and training new prekindergarten teachers to increase their numbers and expand children's access to early education. Recipients must use the funds to pay salaries, benefits, and training costs of teachers at eligible prekindergarten providers. Eligible providers include State, local, or private non-profit or for-profit prekindergarten providers. The Act allows grants to support hiring and training new prekindergarten teachers at eligible providers meeting high-quality standards and serving low-income children. The Secretary will issue standards for determining high-quality providers within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will issue standards for high-quality prekindergarten providers, considering criteria like administration, support services, health, safety, nutrition, parental involvement, teacher training, teacher-to-student ratio, and curriculum. These standards will align with or add to existing standards under the Head Start Act. The Secretary will issue standards for high-quality prekindergarten providers under the Head Start Act. Applicants for a grant must designate a lead agency, coordinate activities with other programs, and provide matching funds.

Funds must supplement, not replace, other Federal, State, and local funding for early childhood programs. To apply for a grant, a State or local educational agency must submit an application meeting specified criteria to the Secretary. In making grants under this section, the Secretary shall prioritize States and local educational agencies with the greatest need for expanded access to high-quality early childhood education.

The term \"prekindergarten\" refers to a program for children aged 3 to 5 that focuses on pre-literacy, pre-numeracy, emotion regulation, and behavioral skills for school success. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2010."
