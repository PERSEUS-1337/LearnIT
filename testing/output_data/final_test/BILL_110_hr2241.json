The Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Act of 2007 cites findings on the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people living with diabetes has doubled in the past 25 years. The American Diabetes Association reports over 20 million Americans have diabetes, with 6 million undiagnosed cases. Additionally, 54 million have pre-diabetes, putting them at risk for developing diabetes. Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, as shown in the Diabetes Prevention Program study of 2002. Participants who made lifestyle changes reduced their risk of type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Despite successful outcomes, sustainable interventions are lacking. Insurance companies cover diabetes complications but not cheaper prevention methods. Direct medical expenditures for diabetes in 2002 totaled $91.8 billion, with a significant portion directed towards diabetes care and chronic complications. The need to increase availability of community-based lifestyle programs for diabetes prevention and encourage replication of successful programs like the Diabetes Prevention Program on a wider scale to reduce costs associated with diabetes treatment in the United States. SEC. 3. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Diabetes Translation; Diabetes Demonstration Projects. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to include a new section 317T for the CDC Division of Diabetes Translation. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish a Division of Diabetes Translation to address diabetes prevention and control. The division will conduct surveillance, research, work with states on prevention programs, coordinate education programs, and raise awareness about diabetes. The Division of Diabetes Translation will receive $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding as needed for subsequent years. \"SEC. 317U. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF DIABETES.\" The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will develop pilot projects to screen and identify individuals at high risk for Type 2 diabetes and provide them with lifestyle interventions.

The Director will require information on the risk and screening methods for targeted populations in the cooperative agreements awarded for a 2-year period, extendable for an additional 2 years. An evaluation report is due to the Committee on Energy and not later than 4 years after the enactment of the Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Act of 2007.
