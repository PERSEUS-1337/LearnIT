Eligible projects must involve multiple States or public authorities and improve access to international commerce centers like ports, aviation facilities, and rail terminals. Under the RING program, projects must support economic growth, improve intermodal connections, address capacity constraints, enhance global competitiveness, and not be currently funded for construction. The Secretary of Transportation will solicit proposals for projects within 6 months of the Act's enactment.
