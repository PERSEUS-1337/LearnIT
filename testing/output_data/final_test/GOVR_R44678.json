Managed by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), it includes biographic and sometimes biometric data on hundreds of thousands of individuals with ties to terrorism. The TSC, under the FBI, exports portions of the TSDB to other federal agencies for screening activities like background checks and encounters at U.S. border crossings. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), under the FBI, manages the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) created in response to the 9/11 attacks. It consolidates federal watchlisting efforts previously maintained separately by different agencies. The TSDB processes include Nomination, Verification of identities, and Screening for known or suspected terrorists. The TSDB is used for screening individuals against various databases for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. The screening process involves checking identities against lists like the No Fly List and the Selectee lists. Over 1.2 billion queries were made to the TSDB in FY2011. Information gathered from screening can be fed back into the TSDB. The nomination process is the first step in adding identities to the TSDB. The nomination process is crucial for adding identities to the TSDB. Originators from government agencies identify possible terrorist suspects and nominate them for inclusion in the TSDB as \"known or suspected terrorists\" (KSTs). Known terrorists are individuals involved in terrorism activities, including those charged or convicted for terrorism-related crimes. A \"suspected terrorist\" is an individual reasonably suspected to be engaged in terrorism activities, nominated for inclusion in the TSDB by government agencies. Nominated identities undergo vetting by analysts at NCTC or the FBI before verification at the TSC. NCTC handles nominations of international terrorists, maintaining a classified database called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). The NCTC maintains a classified database called TIDE, which is the U.S. government's central repository of information on international terrorist identities. TIDE contains identities of individuals involved in terrorism activities, with approximately 1.1 million people listed in late 2013. Around 25,000 of these individuals were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents linked to international terrorist organizations. Not all entries in TIDE are included in the TSDB, which held about 800,000 identities in November 2014. NCTC analysts continuously update identities in TIDE. NCTC analysts update identities in TIDE, which is a key resource for counterterrorism professionals. FBI analysts process nominations for the TSDB, with international nominations reviewed by NCTC before inclusion in TIDE. Domestic terrorist nominations are sent directly to the TSC for review. The TSC vets individuals nominated as suspected terrorists based on reasonable suspicion criteria and sufficient identifiers, ensuring each record in the TSDB contains only identifiers without derogatory or classified information. In cases where facts alone are insufficient for nomination, rational inferences are made by investigators and analysts. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) vets nominations for the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) based on reasonable suspicion criteria and sufficient identifiers. Analysts must use rational inferences to determine ties to terrorist activity, ensuring that individuals are not designated as terrorists based solely on protected activity or personal characteristics. Minimum biographic criteria, such as a last name and additional identifying information, are required for inclusion in the TSDB. Most nominations for the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) are approved, with only about 1% rejected. The TSDB information is quickly shared with five major U.S. Government agencies for near-real-time screening. Each agency receives a tailored portion of the TSDB based on their mission and legal requirements. The Department of State and Transportation Security Administration use TSDB information for screening purposes. The No Fly List, Selectee List, and Expanded Selectee List are compared to passenger records through Secure Flight for aviation security. Individuals on the No Fly List are prohibited from boarding commercial aircraft flying into or out of the United States. The Selectee List includes individuals who must undergo additional security screening before boarding a commercial aircraft. The criteria for inclusion on the No Fly List and Selectee List are more stringent than the TSDB's known or reasonably suspected standard. In 2014, there were approximately 800,000 identities in the TSDB, with only about 8% on the No Fly List and 3% on the Selectee List. The TSA developed an extra security measure in response to a failed terrorist attempt on a U.S.-bound flight in 2009. It screens against TSDB records using a person's first and last name and date of birth. The Expanded Selectee List is used during heightened terrorism threats, but TSA has not publicly explained when it is used. Customs and Border Protection uses TECS to screen travelers at the border, which accepts nearly all TSDB records. Additionally, CBP uses the Automated Targeting System as a decision support tool. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) is a support tool that compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance information against law enforcement and intelligence data for risk-based targeting scenarios. ATS-P focuses on passengers for identifying potential threats and is used by CBP personnel at borders and ports of entry. The FBI manages the National Crime Information Center's (NCIC) database, which is an electronic clearinghouse of crime data. The NCIC database is a vital tool for domestic law enforcement screening, containing 21 files including the \"Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist File\" with TSDB records. The Department of Defense uses TSDB information to screen individuals entering military bases. Screeners from various law enforcement agencies check identities against the TSDB either in-person or through official forms, such as when CBP officers screen individuals at ports of entry or when state or local police conduct screenings. Every year, more than 1 billion queries are made against the TSDB for screening individuals at various points of entry and during interactions with law enforcement. Screeners receive notifications of possible matches, known as \"encounters,\" and contact the TSC for further investigation. TSC analysts have access to additional datasets and intelligence to assist in making conclusive identifications. The FBI's Terrorist Screening Operations Unit coordinates the government's response to positive matches or inconclusive analysis from the TSDB. They may deploy agents to interview or apprehend subjects. Information collected is sent to the TSC to enhance existing entries. TSDB information is used by federal agencies to prevent terrorists from entering the US through visa screening and general air traveler screening. The Immigration and Nationality Act bars foreign nationals engaged in terrorist activities from entering the United States, regardless of whether the activities are directed against the US or pose a threat to US security. Membership in organizations deemed subversive to national security can also lead to exclusion. The Immigration Act of 1903 and subsequent laws have included grounds for excluding individuals based on membership in subversive organizations. The Immigration Amendments Act of 1990 and later legislation added terrorism-related grounds for exclusion. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the REAL ID Act of 2005 expanded national security-related grounds for exclusion for visa applicants, who are either immigrants seeking permanent residency or nonimmigrants seeking temporary stay in the United States. Visa applicants must provide personal information, photographs, and fingerprints, along with certified documents depending on the visa category. All prospective lawful permanent residents must undergo physical and mental evaluations. All prospective lawful permanent residents and nonimmigrants must undergo physical and mental examinations to ensure eligibility for visas or admission under INA Section 212(a) grounds for inadmissibility. Visitors can enter the US through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) without a visa, vetted through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) against the TSDB. CBP inspectors at the port of entry conduct background checks and admissibility reviews for all foreign nationals. Consular officers use name-searching algorithms to check visa applicants against the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database, which contains a subset of the TSDB. About 70% of CLASS records come from other agencies like DHS, FBI, and DEA. DOS also runs an automated search algorithm to screen all visa applicants. The automated CLASS search algorithm checks visa applicants against the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for prior visa applications, refusals, or issuances. The CCD stores biometric and biographic data of all visa applicants since 2001, including photographs and 10-finger scans. The Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) system requires further review of selected visa cases by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Visa Viper procedures for alerting officials about suspected terrorists began after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The Visa Viper program, established after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, allows consular officials to send concerning information about foreign nationals to the National Counterterrorism Center. Additionally, consular officers can send suspect names to the FBI through the Visa Condor program. The \"Terrorist Exclusion List\" includes individuals associated with terrorist-supporting organizations. The \"Kingfisher Expansion\" initiative was launched in 2013 for interagency counterterrorism screening of visa applicants. The Kingfisher Expansion (KFE) program involves screening visa applicants by submitting their electronic applications to the NCTC for comparison with the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). A hit in KFE triggers a Washington-based interagency review of the visa application, with post-issuance reviews conducted for emerging threats. The number of aliens denied visas on terrorist grounds has increased since the 1990s and mid-2000s, with FY2012 being the peak year for immigrant denials based on national security grounds. In implementing the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), CBP uses the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) as a security vetting tool to review travelers from VWP countries for law enforcement or security risks before they board flights to the United States. DHS expanded the information collected from VWP travelers through ESTA in response to concerns about terrorists entering the US from VWP countries. ESTA has been effective in denying travel under the VWP to thousands of prospective travelers posing a risk to the US. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) uses the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to screen travelers for security risks before boarding US-bound flights. ESTA has been effective in denying entry to thousands of risky travelers. DHS has enhanced ESTA data elements and security criteria for VWP countries. Legislation in 2015 established new eligibility requirements for the VWP, including collecting modified data via ESTA. All VWP travelers now must use e-Passports. TSA has also implemented additional security measures. In 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act authorized TSA to establish requirements for trusted passenger programs and expedited screening using available technologies. TSA focuses on identifying threats by comparing passenger information to No Fly and Selectee lists, allowing expedited screening for low-risk travelers to prioritize unknown or elevated risk passengers. The TSA's risk-based initiatives include the PreCheck program, a trusted traveler program where participants undergo background checks and can use expedited screening lanes. The program costs $85 for a five-year membership and aims to process 50% of passengers efficiently. The PreCheck program costs $85 for a five-year membership and aims to process 50% of passengers efficiently. TSA estimates annual savings of $110 million in screener workforce costs due to improved screening efficiency. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 includes provisions to expand PreCheck by involving private-sector entities in marketing and enrollment. The PreCheck program aims to process passengers efficiently and save on screener workforce costs. Concerns include the lack of encryption on boarding passes, leading to potential security threats. The DHS recommended exploring encryption and deploying credential authentication technologies at screening checkpoints. Other issues raised include the lack of biometric identity authentication in the program. The PreCheck program previously used managed inclusion to route selected travelers through expedited screening lanes, but this practice was phased out in 2015. TSA is now focusing on offering expedited screening only to PreCheck program enrollees, with selections based on evaluations by canine explosives detection teams. TSA has developed programs like known-crewmember and passenger behavior detection to expedite security screening for airline flight crews and identify potential threats based on behavioral characteristics. Despite questions about effectiveness, the programs have been expanded with almost 3,000 Behavior Detection Officers deployed at 176 airports by FY2012. Despite concerns about the effectiveness and potential for profiling, Congress has not taken specific action to eliminate or revamp the behavioral detection program. TSA has been directed to provide justification for the program's utility and effectiveness, but legislation to shut down the program has not been approved. After the failed bombing attempt in 2009, TSA implemented changes to security directives, including faster checks against the No Fly List and transferring watchlist checks to TSA through the Secure Flight program. By November 2010, 100% of passengers flying to or from U.S. airports were being vetted using Secure Flight. International flights coordinate with CBP's National Targeting Center-Passenger for watchlist checks. TSA also conducts risk-based assessments. TSA uses risk-based analysis of passenger data through CAPPS and Secure Flight to determine screening procedures at airport checkpoints. The use of Secure Flight for expedited screening has been discontinued due to security concerns. The DHS Office of Inspector General investigated an incident where a convicted domestic terrorist received expedited airport screening. Laws required TSA and DHS to establish appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated DHS to create an Office of Appeals and Redress for those wrongly identified as threats. DHS must maintain records of misidentified passengers. The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address misidentification issues for passengers. The program allows individuals to file complaints online or by mail, with a 30-day deadline for supporting information. Filers receive a control number to track their inquiry status. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS provides steps to resolve the issue. The DHS has revised the redress process for individuals on the No Fly List, allowing them to appeal decisions and receive initial response letters with options for further information. Foreign citizens do not have the same legal rights to redress. The DHS has updated the redress process for individuals on the No Fly List, providing options for further information and appeal. Foreign citizens do not have the same legal rights for redress. If requested, DHS TRIP will forward case details to the TSC Redress Office, which will then request an unclassified summary of information supporting placement on the list. Recipients can seek further review of their status and submit information to challenge their placement. The TSC Redress Office reviews materials provided by federal agencies and the redress seeker to recommend whether an individual should be removed from the No Fly List. The TSA Administrator makes the final decision to remove, maintain, or further investigate the case. If removed, the TSC updates the TSDB with the relevant information."
