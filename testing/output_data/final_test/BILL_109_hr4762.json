    "content": "The \"Second Chance Voting Rights Act of 2006\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that the right to vote is fundamental in a democracy, citizen participation in elections ensures representation, over 500,000 ex-offenders have completed their sentences, voting is a civic duty for all citizens, and allowing ex-offenders to vote promotes civic rehabilitation and participation. The States and the District of Columbia automatically restore voting rights upon completion of sentence, including parole. The US should ensure Federal voting rights are restored upon unconditional release from prison. Federal voting rights for individuals convicted of a criminal offense shall not be denied upon release from incarceration and completion of sentence. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals affected by violations can notify the state election official and seek relief through a civil action if the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. Individuals affected by violations of the Act can bring a civil action to obtain relief without providing notice to the state election official if the violation occurs close to an election for Federal office. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"election\" to include various types of elections and \"Federal office\" to include positions like President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prohibit states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act do not supersede the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act."
