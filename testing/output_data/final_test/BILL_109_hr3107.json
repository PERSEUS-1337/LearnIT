    "content": "Carlie's Law, also known as the Act, aims to coordinate efforts among the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor overseas sex offenders upon their return to the United States. The State Department notifies Customs and Border Protection agents of US citizens convicted of child predatory crimes abroad. Customs and Border Protection agents then inform the FBI when these individuals enter the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security notifies the FBI when a US citizen convicted of a child predatory crime enters the country. The FBI ensures this information is entered into the National Sex Offender Registry. The term \"child predatory crime\" includes crimes where a child is exploited for sexual purposes or is a victim of a felony. SEC. 3 expands the National Sex Offender Registry to include individuals convicted of exploitation or trafficking of minors. SEC. 4 addresses criminal forfeiture of property for those convicted of exploitation or trafficking. Any person convicted of a violation of a Federal law relating to exploitation or trafficking in persons shall forfeit to the United States any proceeds obtained as a result of the violation and any property used to commit or facilitate the violation. The court shall order the forfeiture of such property in addition to any other sentence imposed for the offense. In cases where a defendant profits from an offense, they may be fined up to twice the gross profits. The Controlled Substances Act provisions on criminal forfeiture apply to such convictions. States must have laws similar to federal laws on forfeiture, or risk losing Department of Justice assistance. SEC. 5. ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE AGAINST A MINOR AGE 12 OR UNDER. Individuals convicted of a criminal offense against a minor age 12 or under may be subject to lifelong electronic surveillance, with exceptions during imprisonment and after being deemed no longer a threat to the community. The United States Marshals Service and the Bureau of Prisons are responsible for electronic surveillance of individuals convicted of a criminal offense against a minor age 12 or under. Surveillance must use approved devices, and states must have comparable laws to receive Department of Justice assistance. SEC. 6. RECLASSIFICATION OF TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AS CRIME OF VIOLENCE UNDER FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission will amend guidelines to treat trafficking in persons as a crime of violence. SEC. 7. REVOCATION OF PROBATION OR SUPERVISED RELEASE. Amendment to probation and supervised release guidelines in cases involving felony crimes of violence or crimes of violence against minors under the age of 16. The curr_chunk refers to facilitating unlawful sexual contact with a person under 16 years old. The Attorney General will standardize information in the National Sex Offender Registry by specifying required fields. States must provide all specified information. A report on these regulations must be submitted to Congress within 120 days. Additionally, individuals convicted of trafficking in persons may face property forfeiture. The court must order forfeiture of property from individuals convicted of trafficking in persons, including any property used or obtained as a result of the violation. The court must order forfeiture of property used in or derived from trafficking in persons violations to the United States. This includes any real or personal property connected to the offense. Forfeiture of property related to trafficking in persons violations to the United States is mandated by the court."
