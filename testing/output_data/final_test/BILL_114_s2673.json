The Water Technology Acceleration Act of 2016, also known as the \"Water Technology Acceleration Act,\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include provisions for the deployment of innovative water technologies, such as green technologies and resource recovery in water and wastewater treatment systems. The Water Technology Acceleration Act of 2016 includes provisions for water reuse, recovery of valuable materials, green infrastructure, and technical assistance programs for financial assistance. The Administrator is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the financial assistance provided by states. The Water Technology Acceleration Act of 2016 includes provisions for financial assistance from State water pollution control revolving funds for innovative water technologies, addressing barriers to their use, and highlighting cost-saving potential for cities and future infrastructure investments. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act authorize appropriations for these purposes. The Water Technology Acceleration Act of 2016 authorizes $100,000,000 annually for innovative water technologies through State water pollution control revolving funds. SEC. 3. INNOVATION IN DRINKING WATER STATE REVOLVING FUNDS. Section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to provide financial assistance and loans to public water systems for innovative water technologies. The amendment to Section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water Act allows funds to be used for innovative water technologies, such as improving water quality and providing real-time water quality information to users. The amendment authorizes $100,000,000 annually for deploying innovative water technologies to enhance water quality and provide real-time water quality information to users. The Administrator is required to provide technical assistance programs to support the deployment of innovative water technologies for improving water quality and real-time water quality information for users. Additionally, an annual report to Congress must detail the financial assistance provided by State drinking water funds for innovative technologies, barriers to their use, and potential cost savings for cities from emerging technologies. The Innovative Water Technology Grant Program is established under Section 4. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will carry out a grant program for eligible entities to develop innovative water technologies addressing water challenges. Eligible entities include public utilities, municipalities, private entities, institutions of higher education, research institutions, states, regional organizations, and nonprofit organizations. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide grants to eligible entities for projects that involve public-private partnerships and deploy emerging water technologies. The grants will also fund technical assistance to increase adoption of innovative water technologies in municipal water systems and areas served by private wells, with a focus on reducing costs over time. The Administrator will target investments to improve water quality, safety, and security of drinking water systems, minimize contamination, and enhance the quality and timeliness of water tests, especially for lead, bacteria, and nitrates. In making grants under this section, the Administrator will prioritize projects that can provide cost savings or improve human health and the environment. The Federal share of the cost for activities funded by these grants will not exceed 70 percent. The maximum grant amount for projects under this section is $5,000,000, with a federal share not exceeding 70 percent.
