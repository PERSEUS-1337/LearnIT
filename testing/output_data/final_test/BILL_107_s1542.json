    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act\". Congress finds that the Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium should be extended, states should simplify sales tax systems, and equal taxation for all sales transactions is necessary. States simplifying tax systems may correct current inequities. The states should be authorized to require sellers to collect taxes on in-state sales, regardless of the seller's location. States have the expertise to develop fair and efficient sales tax systems. Online consumer privacy is crucial for electronic commerce growth. The Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits states from imposing taxes on Internet access or multiple taxes on electronic commerce between specific time periods. It also provides definitions for the Act. The Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits states from taxing Internet access services, defining them as services enabling users to access Internet content. It also includes wireless web access services for accessing content, information, and other Internet services. The Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits states from taxing Internet access services, including wireless web access services, which are defined as services used to access the Internet over the Internet. SEC. 5. STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX SYSTEM. Development of Streamlined System: Congress encourages States and localities to collaborate on creating a centralized, multi-state sales tax system with uniform definitions, rules, and procedures for remote sales. The streamlined system for sales and use tax rates includes a uniform format for tax returns, consistent electronic filing methods, state administration of taxes, uniform audit procedures, reasonable compensation for tax collection, exemption from use tax for remote sellers below $5,000,000 in sales, and consumer privacy protections. The system described includes consumer privacy protections and other features deemed necessary by States to promote simplicity, uniformity, neutrality, efficiency, and fairness. Congress believes that this system will not unduly burden interstate commerce or hinder the growth of electronic commerce. Additionally, a study should be conducted to determine the cost of collecting and remitting State and local sales and use taxes to ensure reasonable compensation for sellers. SEC. 6. INTERSTATE SALES AND USE TAX COMPACT. The States are authorized to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact with Congress's consent. The Compact must establish a uniform sales and use tax system and expire if not formed by January 1, 2006. Congressional consent is withdrawn if the Compact is disapproved within 120 days. The Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact must be formed within 120 days after the adopting States transmit it to Congress, as per the Trade Act of 1974. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION TO SIMPLIFY STATE USE-TAX RATES THROUGH AVERAGING. SEC. 8. Authorization for states to impose a single, uniform state-wide use-tax rate on remote sales, with an option for remote sellers to collect actual applicable state and local use taxes annually. States that adopt the Compact system can require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on remote sales to purchasers in the state. States not adopting the system cannot enforce this requirement. This authority does not affect the determination of nexus for sellers. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement allows states to require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on remote sales. This authority does not impact the determination of nexus for sellers in other tax matters. States are not permitted to license, regulate, or impose unrelated state taxes on sellers under this agreement. Before the conclusion of the 107th Congress, legislation should be enacted to determine factors for establishing nexus for State business activity tax purposes. The Act limits the application of franchise taxes, income taxes, and licensing requirements of States or political subdivisions without affecting their authority to impose such taxes. The Act defines key terms such as \"State\", \"goods or services\", \"remote sale\", and \"particular taxing jurisdiction\" for interstate commerce taxation purposes. A remote sale is a sale of goods or services attributed to a specific taxing jurisdiction."
