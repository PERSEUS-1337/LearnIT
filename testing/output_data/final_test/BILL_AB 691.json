    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Part 20 of the Probate Code, known as the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, defines terms like \"account\" and \"carries\" related to digital assets. It also includes a definition for \"catalogue of electronic communications.\" The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act defines terms related to digital assets, including \"content of an electronic communication,\" \"court,\" and \"custodian.\" The court has exclusive jurisdiction over proceedings related to digital assets of deceased users. A custodian is a person who carries, maintains, processes, receives, or stores a user's digital asset. The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act defines terms related to digital assets, including \"designated recipient,\" \"digital asset,\" \"electronic,\" \"electronic communication,\" \"electronic communication service,\" and \"fiduciary.\" The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act defines key terms such as fiduciary, information, online tool, person, personal representative, and power of attorney. The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act defines terms like record, remote-computing service, terms-of-service agreement, trustee, user, and will. This part applies to various entities including custodians and users. This part of the act applies to fiduciaries, personal representatives, trustees, and custodians of digital assets for users in the state. It does not apply to digital assets used by an employee in the course of their employer's business. A user can use an online tool to direct the custodian regarding disclosure of digital assets. If no online tool is available, the user can give direction in a will or other record. This direction overrides any contrary provisions in terms-of-service agreements. This part clarifies that a custodian or user's rights to access digital assets are not affected. It also states that a fiduciary or designated recipient's rights are limited to those of the user. The user can modify or eliminate access to digital assets, and the custodian can grant full access to the user's account when disclosing digital assets. The custodian can grant full or partial access to a fiduciary or designated recipient for digital assets. A reasonable administrative charge may apply for disclosing digital assets. Deleted digital assets by the user are not required to be disclosed. A custodian is not required to disclose digital assets deleted by a user. If disclosing some digital assets would impose an undue burden, the custodian can petition the court to disclose a limited subset, all assets to the fiduciary, none of the assets, or all assets to the court for review. The custodian must disclose the deceased user's digital assets to the court for review if directed. The personal representative needs to provide a written request, death certificate, appointment letter, and consent evidence for disclosure of electronic communications. The custodian may disclose a user's digital assets upon request, including unique identifiers, evidence linking the account to the user, and a court order confirming the account's existence and consent for disclosure. This disclosure may be necessary for estate administration. The custodian must disclose electronic communications and digital assets of a deceased user to their personal representative upon request, with necessary documentation such as a written request, death certificate, and proof of representation. The custodian must disclose electronic communications and digital assets of a deceased user to their personal representative upon request, with necessary documentation such as a written request, death certificate, and proof of representation. Additionally, a custodian shall disclose the content of electronic communications to a trustee not an original user of an account if certain conditions are met, including a written request for disclosure. The trustee must provide a written request, death certificate, trust instrument, trustee certification, and account information to the custodian for disclosure of electronic communications and digital assets. The custodian must disclose electronic communications and digital assets to a trustee of a trust upon request, with necessary documentation including a written request, death certificate, trust instrument, trustee certification, and account information. The legal duties of a fiduciary managing digital assets include the duty of care, loyalty, and confidentiality. A fiduciary's authority over digital assets is subject to terms-of-service agreements, other laws such as copyright law, and the scope of their duties. If requested, a custodian must provide unique identifiers and evidence linking the account to the trust. A fiduciary with authority over a decedent or settlor's property has the right to access any digital asset not held by a custodian or under a terms-of-service agreement. They are authorized users for computer-fraud and unauthorized-computer-access laws. The fiduciary also has the right to access tangible personal property and any digital assets stored within it. No custodian is required to share passwords or decrypt protected devices. A fiduciary can request a custodian to terminate a user's account by providing necessary documentation, including a death certificate and proof of authority over the account. A custodian must comply with a request from a fiduciary to disclose digital assets or terminate an account within 60 days. Failure to comply may result in the fiduciary seeking a court order for compliance, which must not violate federal law. A custodian may notify a user of a request for disclosure of digital assets or to terminate an account. The custodian can deny such a request if they are aware of any lawful access to the account after the user's death. The custodian's ability to require a court order for disclosure or account termination is not limited by this part. The court order must confirm ownership of the account and sufficient consent from the deceased user. This part provides immunity to custodians and their personnel for acting in good faith under this law. It also addresses the modification of the federal Electronic Signatures Act but does not affect certain sections of that act. Disclosure of deceased user's account to fiduciary subject to same terms as deceased user. Invalidity of provision does not affect other parts."
