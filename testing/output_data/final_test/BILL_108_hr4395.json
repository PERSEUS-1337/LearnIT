    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ephedrine Alkaloids Regulation Act of 2004\". The Congress recognizes the increasing danger of methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse in the United States. Methamphetamine is highly addictive and easily made from store-bought products and online recipes, leading to a rise in clandestine labs. These labs pose a significant threat to public health and safety due to the toxic chemicals involved, endangering first responders, law enforcement, and the community. Methamphetamine production has spread from the West Coast to the Midwest and East Coast, specifically New York and Florida. Abuse of methamphetamine is widespread across different demographics. Efforts to restrict access to pseudoephedrine, a key ingredient in meth production, have not been successful. As methamphetamine production spreads across the country, efforts to restrict pseudoephedrine access have not been successful. Liquid forms of pseudoephedrine are not used in meth production, prompting the need for a uniform standard for distributing pseudoephedrine tablets. Controlled substances; addition of ephedrine alkaloids to Schedule V. Upon enactment of this Act, ephedrine alkaloids will be listed in schedule V of controlled substances. Pseudoephedrine in liquid or gel form lawfully marketed in the US is exempt from this classification. Upon enactment of this Act, ephedrine alkaloids will be listed in schedule V of controlled substances. Pseudoephedrine contained in products lawfully marketed in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will be considered a listed chemical. Regulation of transactions involving listed chemicals; exemption for certain dosage forms of pseudoephedrine. Amendment to the Controlled Substances Act includes changes to the definition of Regulated Transaction for products containing pseudoephedrine in liquid or gel form. Amendment to the Controlled Substances Act now limits the sale of phenylpropanolamine products to 9 grams in a single transaction, with package sizes not exceeding 3 grams. The definition of Ordinary Over-The-Counter Pseudoephedrine or Phenylpropanolamine Product has been updated to include liquid or gel forms."
