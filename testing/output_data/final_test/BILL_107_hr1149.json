    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Education Technology Corps Act\" or the \"NET Corps Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of Internet-accessible computers in schools for enhancing educational opportunities. Despite the increase in computer acquisition by educational agencies, there is a lack of focus on providing information technology training for teachers and staff. The CEO Forum on Education and Technology study found that schools allocated only five percent of their IT budget for teacher training in the 1997-1998 school year. Additionally, a Department of Education report in 1999 revealed that only 33 percent of public school teachers felt adequately prepared to integrate computers and the Internet into their instruction. As new technologies are introduced in classrooms, teachers will require regular professional technology training. The Corporation for National and Community Service has a successful track record in this area. The Volunteers in Service to America program, known as VISTA, administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service, aims to eliminate poverty by expanding information technology in schools, libraries, and community centers in low-income areas. The National Education Technology Corps is created as part of VISTA under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973. The Director establishes a National Education Technology Corps under the VISTA program to improve information technology use in schools, provide training for teachers, and offer technical support to administrators. The National Education Technology Corps under the VISTA program recruits volunteers with IT expertise or readiness for training to support schools, libraries, and community centers. Participants in the Americorps program may also serve in the National Education Technology Corps if they meet eligibility criteria. Volunteers in the National Education Technology Corps are assigned to projects utilizing volunteers for various activities, administered by public or private nonprofit agencies, community-based organizations, and education agencies. The National Education Technology Corps assigns volunteers to schools and educational institutions, prioritizing those with technology plans outlining goals and complying with guidelines set by the Director. The Director gives priority to programs in urban or rural areas with high illiteracy and low-income populations, or schools lacking assistance for IT improvements. Partnerships with nonprofit organizations are encouraged to support schools, libraries, and community centers. Coordination with the Department of Education is required for training. The Director shall coordinate with the Secretary of Education for training volunteers in the National Education Technology Corps to align activities with school needs. Agreements with the private sector can be made for employees to assist the Corps and training programs without financial compensation. In any fiscal year with reduced services under this part, services under this section will be proportionately reduced. SEC. 4. INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR ASSISTANCE TO NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY CORPS.
