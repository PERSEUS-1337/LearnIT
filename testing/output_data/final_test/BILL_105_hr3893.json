    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Common Sense Prison Work and Victim Restitution Act of 1998\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that work is essential to society, promotes values like responsibility and respect, and should be expanded for prisoners to reduce recidivism and provide restitution to victims and communities. Prisoners should reimburse the government for their incarceration costs and make restitution to crime victims. Prisoners should make monetary restitution to a fund benefiting crime victims, be prohibited from certain unhealthy activities, and not have access to unnecessary amenities. Federal laws should remove barriers to prisoner labor and strengthen work requirements for successful rehabilitation. Shock incarceration can be effective when implemented properly. Shock incarceration programs, or \"boot camps,\" can effectively instill offenders with personal responsibility, confidence, self-discipline, and improve their chances of successful reintegration into society while maintaining a safe environment for corrections personnel. SEC. 3. WORK REQUIREMENT FOR FEDERAL PRISONERS. The Crime Control Act of 1990 is amended to require inmates to work for at least 50 hours weekly, participate in job-training and educational programs. If opportunities for inmate work are insufficient, prisoners can provide services to nonprofit entities. Authorities making grants to nonprofits must inform them of this availability. The Attorney General will establish rules for inmate services to nonprofits. The Attorney General will establish rules for inmate services to nonprofits and private entities, including the payment of wages. Legislative recommendations will be submitted to Congress to allow federal prisoners to work for private employers while minimizing economic impact. Revenues from prison labor will be placed in a Fund after taxes and withholdings. The Fund, under guidelines from the Attorney General, will allocate one third for prisoner incarceration costs, one third for victim restitution, one tenth for individual prisoner accounts upon release, and the remainder to benefit dependents of prisoners in correctional facilities operated by States and local jurisdictions. The Attorney General determines that state and local correctional facilities have similar prison work requirements and conditions as federal prisons. The Bureau of Prisons enforces strict rules for Federal prisoners, including restrictions on possessing pornographic materials, regular drug testing, prohibition of certain appliances and entertainment, and limitations on music and TV content. Additionally, prisoners are not allowed to engage in sexual activity. SEC. 5. REPORT ON DRUG TESTING COSTS.\n\nThe Attorney General, with the General Accounting Office, will report to Congress the anticipated annual costs of implementing a monthly drug testing program for Federal prisoners for the next 5 years.\n\nSEC. 6. DRUG DETECTION DOG PROGRAM.\n\nThe Attorney General will establish a program using drug detection dogs in inmate areas to detect narcotics, with an appropriation of $10,000,000.\n\nSEC. 7. ELIMINATION OF SENTENCING INEQUITIES FOR DRUG OFFENDERS. The Attorney General will ensure eligible prisoners undergo substance abuse treatment programs with incentives and sanctions. Amendments are made to the treatment requirement and eligibility criteria for prisoners within 24 months of release. The Attorney General ensures eligible prisoners participate in substance abuse treatment programs with incentives and sanctions, as per the Bureau of Prisons' designation for residential treatment programs. SEC. 8. BOOT CAMP REQUIREMENT. Section 4046 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to require inmates to participate in shock incarceration, with specific guidelines on duration and confinement for those who do not successfully complete the program. Inmates who do not complete shock incarceration program will be confined to their cell for 23 hours a day and lose all privileges except those required by law."
