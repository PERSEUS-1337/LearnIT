    "content": "The K-12 teacher workforce in the U.S. is large, with nearly 4 million teachers employed in elementary and secondary schools each year. Teacher turnover is high, with about 1 in 10 teachers leaving their jobs in 2018, following a trend of increasing attrition since the 1980s. Policymakers are concerned about recruitment and retention issues, addressed in the Higher Education Act through grant support for new teacher preparation and financial incentives for staying in the profession. The HEA was last comprehensively amended in 2008. The Higher Education Act (HEA) was enacted in 1965 to address teacher recruitment and retention through programs like the Teacher Corps. Despite expired authorities, appropriations for related programs continue. Congressional discussions are ongoing to potentially reauthorize the HEA, with various bills introduced to amend current law. This report outlines the history of federal teacher recruitment and retention policy, current policies, and potential issues for Congress to consider during reauthorization. The Teacher Corps program was funded in FY1966 and phased out in FY1981 under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. In 1967, it became the Education Professions Development Act (EPDA), which reauthorized the program and introduced new teacher development programs. EPDA programs were funded starting in FY1969 or FY1970. The Education Amendments of 1976 repealed all of the EPDA except for the Teacher Corps program. The Education Amendments of 1976 renamed Title V as Teacher Corps and Teacher Training Programs, extended the Teacher Corps program authorization, and authorized a new Teacher Centers program. Teacher Centers provided in-service training to the teaching force and were phased out in FY1981. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships, enacted in 1984, provided $5,000 scholarships to outstanding high school graduates who committed to teaching for two years at the K-12 level for each year of scholarship assistance. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships required recipients to teach for two years at the K-12 level for each year of scholarship assistance, with possible reductions for those in shortage areas. Federal funds were allocated to states. The program was funded from FY1986 to FY1995. The National Talented Teacher Fellowships, later renamed Christa McAuliffe Fellowships, provided one-year awards to experienced teachers for sabbaticals to develop innovative projects, with recipients required to return to their prior employment for two years. The program was funded from FY1987. The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 rewrote Title V as Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Development, extending and renaming scholarship and fellowship programs. Two new programs were added: Mid-Career Teacher Training and Minority Teacher Recruitment. Mid-Career Teacher Training provided grants to prepare individuals with job experience in education-related fields, specifically in preschool and early childhood education. Eligibility required a baccalaureate or advanced degree. Initial planning grants were up to $100,000 for IHEs. The Minority Teacher Recruitment program awarded grants to partnerships between IHEs and education agencies to recruit and train minority students to become teachers. It also funded teacher preparation programs and supported teacher placement in schools with high minority student enrollment. The program was initially funded for FY1993 and received its last appropriation for FY1997. State Grants, Partnership Grants, and Recruitment Grants were authorized to receive appropriations for Title II-A. State Grants and Partnership Grants were allocated 45% of the funds for activities related to teacher preparation and certification, while Recruitment Grants received 10% for recruiting highly qualified teachers. These grants have been funded since FY1999 and continue to support various education initiatives. The Teacher Quality Partnership program, established under the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), provides support services for postsecondary education completion, follow-up services for new teachers, and activities to recruit highly qualified teachers. The program aims to address K-12 teacher issues by improving teacher preparation, recruitment, and training through grants and reporting requirements. Additionally, the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants encourage students to pursue teaching careers. The Teacher Quality Partnership program, authorized by the Higher Education Act (HEA), offers grants to improve teacher quality in high-need schools and early childhood education programs. Partnerships must include a high-need LEA, school or program, partner IHE, and aim to recruit highly qualified individuals into the teaching force. Loan forgiveness options are available for teachers through the Title IV Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Teacher Quality Partnership program, under the Higher Education Act, provides grants to improve teacher quality in high-need schools. Partnerships must involve a high-need LEA, partner IHE, and aim to recruit qualified individuals into teaching. Grant funds can be used for Pre-Baccalaureate Preparation, Teacher Residency, or Leadership Development programs. Grants support a variety of reforms in teacher preparation programs. Grants are provided to implement reforms in teacher preparation programs and early childhood educator programs. Reforms include curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, high-quality clinical education, induction programs, increased compensation for educators with degrees, professional development, and alternative routes to state certification. Grants support teacher residency programs to recruit qualified individuals into teaching profession, strengthen literacy teaching skills, and prepare teachers for success in high-need schools. Programs offer rigorous graduate-level coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for professional collaboration. Grants are provided to develop effective school leadership programs for individuals preparing for careers as superintendents, principals, or other school leaders. Programs focus on promoting strong leadership skills, understanding teaching and assessment techniques, using data for evaluation and improvement, managing resources, engaging parents and community stakeholders. The HEOA amendments established new programs in HEA to enhance teacher education, including Preparing Teachers for Digital Age Learners, Hawkins Centers of Excellence, Teach to Reach Grants, Adjunct Teacher Corps, and Graduate Fellowships. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act established TEACH Grants to provide aid to postsecondary students training to become teachers. TEACH Grants provide up to $16,000 for bachelor's studies or $8,000 for master's studies to postsecondary students training to become teachers. Recipients must commit to teaching high-need subjects in low-income schools for at least four years within eight years of graduating. Current teachers, retirees, and those with alternative certification routes are also eligible for the grants to cover the costs of obtaining graduate degrees. Teachers who fail to fulfill their service obligation in low-income schools and high-need subjects must repay their TEACH Grant as an Unsubsidized Direct Loan with interest. Loan forgiveness for teachers has been available since the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which aimed to improve the quality and quantity of teachers in the U.S. The Federal Perkins Loan Program, incorporated into the Higher Education Act, allows qualified teachers to receive relief from up to 100% of their loan balance based on years of service. New Perkins Loans are no longer available. Loan forgiveness for teachers has been expanded to include loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan and Direct Loan programs by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. For individuals who teach for five years in eligible low-income schools, up to $5,000 may be canceled. The Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004 increased the maximum amount of loan forgiveness to $17,500 for special education teachers and those teaching mathematics or science in secondary schools. Teachers may also qualify for student debt relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, individuals may qualify to have their Direct Loans forgiven after making 120 full, scheduled, monthly payments while employed full-time in public service, including teaching. The 116th Congress is expected to consider reauthorizing the Higher Education Act (HEA) with bills addressing teacher recruitment and retention. Potential issues include modifying grant partnership structures and targeting support to specific teachers. The 116th Congress is expected to consider reauthorizing the Higher Education Act with bills addressing teacher recruitment and retention. Potential changes include modifying grant partnership structures, targeting support to specific teacher shortage areas, and expanding teacher preparation program accountability requirements. Policymakers may also consider allowing non-IHE-based teacher preparation providers to serve as grantee sponsors in the Teacher Quality Partnership program. The Teacher Quality Partnership program requires LEAs and schools to be designated as \"high-need\" to be grant partners. There are debates on whether the thresholds for high-need designation are too low and if funds should be reserved for very low-income schools. Suggestions include broadening support to additional subject areas and hard-to-staff schools, as well as including non-instructional staff like counselors and librarians in targeted positions. Some proposals aim to support staff in leadership roles, such as school counselors, librarians, and literacy specialists. Suggestions include creating career ladders and incentives for master teachers, establishing principal residency programs, and allowing Title II funds for state grants for leadership training. States must report performance data for teacher preparation programs, including pass rates on certification exams and program evaluations. Few programs are identified as \"low-performing.\" Some policymakers argue that current accountability provisions for teacher preparation programs are inadequate, especially for non-IHE-based programs. They believe all programs should be judged by outcome measures beyond certification exam passage, including graduates' professional readiness, employment rates, retention in teaching, and student performance. The TEACH Grant program faces administrative challenges and congressional scrutiny, with suggestions for changes like extending service requirement completion time for grant recipients. Some observers suggest making TEACH Grants available to junior and senior college students or master's degree candidates. Teachers have various loan relief options under federal law, but conflicting benefit requirements may limit eligibility for multiple programs. Some argue that loan forgiveness programs for teachers have complex requirements, leading to administrative issues similar to the TEACH Grant program. Policymakers may need to simplify these requirements to improve the effectiveness of loan forgiveness as a teacher retention tool."
