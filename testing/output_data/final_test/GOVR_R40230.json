Consumers now expect a wide range of services from both traditional and nontraditional providers, moving beyond basic voice connectivity to demand diverse fixed and mobile services. This shift has led to a greater need for flexibility in accessing content across various technologies. The telecommunications sector has evolved significantly in the past decade due to rapid technological growth and market changes. Consumers now expect a wide range of services from both traditional and nontraditional providers, moving beyond basic voice connectivity to demand diverse fixed and mobile services. The trend towards sharing information, such as music, movies, or photographs, is growing, requiring networks to transition into converged next-generation wireline and wireless broadband networks. Policymakers are debating a \"national broadband policy\" to address broadband availability, adoption, and the long-term impacts of next-generation networks on consumer Internet use. In the late 1990s, American homes started accessing the Internet at higher speeds through cable modem broadband and DSL services offered by cable television and telephone companies. The Federal Communication Commission tracked the growth of high-speed lines in the United States from December 1999 to December 2007, showing a steep increase in broadband deployment. The Federal Communication Commission reported a significant growth in high-speed lines in the United States from December 1999 to December 2007, with 121.2 million lines in total, 74.0 million serving residential users. The primary residential broadband technologies deployed are cable modem and DSL. A 2008 survey found that 57% of Americans have broadband at home, with less than 10% of households having no access to any broadband provider. Broadband adoption rate is close to 60% while availability is over 90% of households. About 30% of households have access to terrestrial broadband services. 30% of households have access to terrestrial broadband but do not subscribe due to reasons like lack of computers, price, lack of content, and availability at work. Non-broadband users are typically older, have lower incomes, struggle with technology, and may not see the relevance of the Internet in their lives. Low-income Americans and African Americans showed no significant growth in broadband adoption between 2007 and 2008. Pew found that one-third of adults without broadband cite price and availability as reasons, while two-thirds cite usability and relevance. Broadband speeds and prices are crucial factors. Broadband speeds and prices are crucial factors that determine technology deployment and application enablement. The FCC's latest report anticipates increasing demand for higher bandwidth services and applications. Tables show broadband speed ranges and technologies currently available. Industry and policymakers often discuss national broadband policy distinctions. The distinction between \"current generation\" and \"next generation\" broadband is important in broadband policy discussions. \"Current generation\" includes cable, DSL, and wireless systems, while \"next generation\" offers faster download and upload speeds through fiber technologies. Faster connection speeds enable more sophisticated applications. The FCC's broadband status report highlights the evolution of broadband networks to meet increasing demand for higher bandwidth services. The competition between broadband platform providers is driving higher speed technologies and service offerings to the marketplace, leading to more ubiquitous coverage as technologies mature. As innovative applications become enabled, the impacts on consumers, the economy, and society become more profound. Consumers are demanding similar services for personal use after experiencing advanced services at work. Consumers are now demanding similar advanced services for personal use as they experience at work. The evolution of the Internet from a government experiment to a consumer \"destination\" has led to the importance of access to e-mail, text messages, and social networks. President Obama's reliance on his Blackberry highlighted the shift towards constant access to information in today's society. Americans have become reliant on constant access to information, exemplified by Tina's morning routine of checking emails, texts, Facebook, calendar, and weather forecast on her Blackberry before work. This reflects the trend towards 24-7 connectivity in society. Tina utilizes technology for flexible work arrangements, accessing various websites and applications. She can work from home using cloud computing tools like Google Docs. This allows her to continue working after a technician installs a new speaker system in her house. Tina uses her desktop computer in her home office for work, saving her files on Google Docs for access later. In the evening, she socializes online with friends through Facebook, plays games, and watches TV. She also manages her finances and shops online. Tina uses her desktop computer for work, socializing online, managing finances, shopping, and watching TV. She pays bills, shops for clothes and groceries, researches health information, accesses e-government sites, does research for a distance learning class, and searches for flight deals online. Always-on broadband enables consumers to search for and obtain information, services, and products without the need for a middleman. For example, the Pew Internet Project found that 75-80% of Internet users look for health information online, with broadband users being twice as likely to do health research compared to dial-up users. Consumers with chronic conditions are more likely to make health decisions based on online information. Newly diagnosed individuals and those who have had a recent health crisis also rely on online information for medical advice. Many consumers use mobile devices to search for information while away from home. Consumers use mobile devices to stay connected while away from home, relying on social media, email, text, and GPS for communication and navigation. The Internet serves as a social, educational, and entertainment medium, allowing users to socialize with friends and access information easily. The Internet, accessed through web browsers like Mosaic in 1993, transformed from a domain of researchers to a user-friendly platform for socializing, research, entertainment, and work. In the early days of the Web, most people accessed it at work via high-speed connections. Dial-up access at home was slow, with limited content available. The early Web focused on national, local, and technology news, lacking broad appeal. The Web evolved from a one-way street to interactive platforms with higher speed dial-up access after the FCC removed a regulatory barrier in 2002. Telephone and cable companies also increased the number of subscribers during this time. During this time, telephone and cable companies were increasing the number of subscribers to their digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable modem services. The Web became more interactive as consumers gained access to the Internet at work and at home, leading to the popularity of personal websites, interactive news sources, online shopping, blogs, and photo-sharing sites. Home adoption of high-speed Internet service grew as consumers became accustomed to faster speeds at work, surpassing dial-up subscribers in early 2005. During the growth of home-based Internet access and faster wireless services, the demand for Internet-ready wireless devices increased. The use of smartphones and non-smartphones with Internet access also rose significantly between 2004 and 2008. Consumers expected seamless access to information across multiple devices, leading to increased demand for advanced services and technologies by 2008. By 2008, consumers rapidly adopted communication technologies, including smartphones and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. The development of cloud computing applications allowed for real-time access to information and sharing from anywhere, setting new expectations for cross-platform accessibility. The emergence of \"Web 2.0\" has transformed the Internet, allowing users to not only consume but also produce content. Industry and policymakers face decisions on technology, user authentication, privacy, and more, which will shape the future Internet. The implementation of IPv6 will revolutionize the future Internet by enabling a vast number of devices to have unique IP addresses, allowing for enhanced connectivity and the realization of concepts like the \"smart home.\" Policymakers may need to consider new regulations to support this next stage of connectedness. Policymakers may need to assess new directions for regulation to encourage innovation while protecting consumers in the evolving broadband technologies and applications landscape. The policy debate in Congress is likely to focus on the characterization and structure of a national broadband policy, addressing issues such as access to fast and affordable broadband, regulation of new telecommunications infrastructures, and management of societal impacts of new applications. Stakeholders have called for a \"national broadband policy\" to guide these efforts. A \"national broadband policy\" is being called for by stakeholders to ensure ubiquitous broadband coverage in the United States, particularly in economically disadvantaged areas. There is a debate on the specific policies and measures the federal government should take to achieve universal broadband access, with concerns about government intervention in the private sector deployment of broadband. Support for a national broadband policy varies depending on how it is defined. The definition and support for a \"national broadband policy\" depend on how it is characterized and the public policies adopted to shape it. Broadband encompasses various technologies, applications, and policy issues, with specific industries and interest groups influencing the deployment of technologies like wireless broadband. Deployment of broadband technologies like wireless and fiber can be influenced by spectrum policies, regulatory issues, and intellectual property management. E-commerce and entertainment applications are also impacted by privacy and security concerns. Additionally, technology-neutral policies such as financial assistance, data mapping, and community broadband can enhance broadband deployment overall. A national broadband policy can be framed in response to these various issues. A national broadband policy can address challenges in deploying broadband to all Americans and consider how broadband will impact the economy and society. Stakeholders may support or oppose the policy based on its definition and elements. There are areas of agreement and controversy in the ongoing broadband debate. Broadband is seen as vital public infrastructure crucial for economic growth and attracting businesses and residents. The future of a community's economy, employment opportunities, and opportunities for individuals with disabilities are directly linked to broadband availability. Quantitative data on the impact of broadband on economic growth has been collected and evaluated in recent years. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in February 2006 found that communities with broadband experienced faster growth in employment and businesses. A report from the Brookings Institution in June 2007 projected that for every one percentage point increase in broadband penetration, employment would increase by 0.2 to 0.3% per year, potentially adding 300,000 jobs to the U.S. economy. The disparity in broadband service between urban/suburban and rural areas persists, with rural areas lagging behind due to lower population density and higher deployment costs. Access to affordable broadband service in rural areas is crucial for economic development, allowing businesses and individuals to compete globally while living locally. Data on broadband deployment in the United States is lacking, hindering policymakers' understanding of the situation. The United States lacks adequate data on broadband service availability, hindering policymakers' understanding. Efforts at the state and federal levels, such as the Broadband Data Improvement Act, aim to improve data collection and mapping. As data improves, a more detailed picture of broadband access is hoped for. Looking forward, with improved broadband data, a more detailed picture is expected to emerge regarding broadband deployment shortfalls and potential government intervention. Stakeholders are divided on the level and nature of government involvement in the broadband marketplace, balancing federal assistance for unserved areas while minimizing negative impacts on competition and private sector investment. Supporters of increased government intervention suggest setting a formal national goal for broadband penetration or speed. Setting a formal national goal, expanding universal service, and mandating an \"open\" Internet are essential for a competitive broadband economy. Advocates for limited government intervention believe markets and the private sector can deploy broadband effectively. The debate over current versus next-generation broadband raises questions about defining \"underserved\" areas that may require government intervention. The debate over government intervention in broadband markets revolves around the need for minimum speed thresholds and the extent of government involvement. Supporters argue for increased government intervention to improve broadband deployment, while opponents raise concerns about marketplace disruption and private sector efforts. Comparisons with other nations also fuel the discussion on the effectiveness of broadband deployment in the United States. Supporters of increased government intervention in broadband policy argue that the United States is falling behind in broadband penetration, speeds, and pricing compared to other nations, impacting economic competitiveness. Opponents claim that data on broadband deployment is flawed and that cross-country comparisons are problematic. The debate centers on the need for a national broadband policy to address unserved and underserved regions and populations in the US. A national broadband policy is crucial for addressing the challenges of broadband deployment and consumer applications in the US. Regulators must adapt to the evolving telecommunications environment and establish a regulatory framework to manage the complexities of advancing broadband technologies. The 1996 Telecommunications Act focused on creating a regulatory structure to promote competition in the telecommunications sector amidst technological advancements like Internet technology and the integration of data, voice, and video services. Trends include the shift from circuit switched to packet switched networks. The challenge for policymakers is to create a regulatory environment that can adapt to current and future technological changes, such as the transition to broadband networks and the growth of applications and devices. The 1996 Telecommunications Act needs updating to address these unforeseen developments. The regulatory challenges posed by the global nature of the Internet and the need for a balanced regulatory environment in the broadband sector as it transitions from monopoly to competition are key considerations for policymakers. The policy debate surrounding regulations in the broadband sector, whether they are necessary for competition and consumer benefits or overly burdensome, remains a major focal point. Key issues include applying legacy regulations to traditional and new providers, determining the role of regulators at different levels, and addressing concerns over federal preemption. The goal is to level the playing field and promote marketplace benefits. Regulators are urged to develop policies that promote competition in the marketplace, which can involve subjecting providers to similar regulations, protecting new competitors, addressing the entrance of new services, or removing regulations from incumbents. Technological advances and increased competition have impacted market structure and regulatory frameworks, leading regulators to address a variety of issues such as modifying universal service goals and ensuring access to services. Regulators are urged to develop policies promoting competition by addressing new services, ensuring access to infrastructure, and implementing technology-neutral regulations. Legacy policies are strained by technological advances, leading to the need for updated regulatory frameworks. The evolution of technology in the telecommunications industry is blurring the lines between traditional services, leading to the integration of voice, video, and data over Internet protocols. Regulators face the challenge of adapting regulatory frameworks to accommodate new services like VoIP while promoting competition and ensuring access to infrastructure. Legacy regulations must evolve to support the development of next-generation broadband networks. The growth in interactive applications on next-generation broadband networks is increasing demands on infrastructure, with services shifting to more data-dependent two-way applications. Peer-to-peer activity and the popularity of bandwidth-intensive services are causing congestion, leading regulators to address capacity and network traffic management issues to balance subscriber and supplier needs. The curr_chunk discusses the need for regulators to balance the needs of subscribers, suppliers, and network operators in the context of wireless broadband networks. It highlights the importance of establishing a policy framework to manage network capacity shortages, protect users, and encourage innovation and investment. Additionally, it mentions the expansion of services offered by wireless providers beyond traditional voice and ringtones. The need for effective spectrum management and connectivity among networks is crucial as wireless broadband applications and expectations increase. The FCC is responsible for allocating spectrum among users, with a growing demand for wider contiguous bandwidths to support advanced broadband services. Effective policies are needed to ensure reliable high-quality service for individual consumers, businesses, and government users. The allocation of spectrum among various users, block sizes, and considerations for specific entities in spectrum auctions are key policy issues. Harmonizing spectrum allocations globally enables economies of scale and interoperability. Seamless connectivity among providers is essential for mobility, with the ability to roam without signal degradation. Interconnection is vital in the mobile world for sharing networks and enhancing the mobile experience. The ability to interconnect networks is crucial for mobile providers to offer nationwide coverage through roaming agreements with other carriers. Without favorable agreements, rural subscribers may face limited or costly services. Regulatory concerns have been raised, especially by small and regional carriers, regarding the negotiation of these agreements. Regulators are urged to intervene to protect carriers' ability to negotiate \"reasonable\" roaming commitments, especially in light of industry consolidations. Concerns include potential termination or degradation of existing roaming agreements during ownership changes, lack of roaming obligations among in-market carriers, and the application of roaming commitments to data. The concept of \"open access\" is a focal point in debates, emphasizing the importance of suppliers and users having unfettered access to networks, content, applications, devices, and consumers. The recent debate over open access has focused on gaining access to content, applications, and services on the Internet. The ability of subscribers and service providers to access the Internet and ensure equal access is known as \"net neutrality.\" The residential broadband market is dominated by cable and landline providers. The concept of \"net neutrality\" involves the principle that network owners should not control how consumers use the Internet or discriminate against content providers. The FCC has outlined four principles to encourage broadband access while balancing network management and nondiscriminatory access. The FCC adopted a policy statement with four principles to encourage broadband access and preserve an open internet. These principles include consumer entitlement to access lawful content, run applications of their choice, connect legal devices, and have competition among providers. The debate over \"net neutrality\" and broadband regulation has become a focal point in policymaking and oversight activities. The debate over broadband regulation and net neutrality is a focal point in policymaking. Some argue against new regulations, fearing they will hinder internet access and innovation. Others raise concerns about discriminatory behaviors by broadband providers. The focus has historically been on wired networks, but with the rise of wireless broadband, pressure is increasing to apply open access principles to wireless networks. The current regulatory environment for wireless carriers providing broadband access is not subject to broadband access policies. The move towards an open wireless network may occur through industry efforts, technological advancements, or regulatory mandates. Regulators may play a role in ensuring wireless networks are open like wired networks. Open access principles have also been applied to devices in the debate over attaching equipment to the telephone network. The 1968 Carterfone Decision resolved the issue of consumers attaching their own equipment to the telephone network. The FCC allowed the Carterfone device, developed by Thomas Carter, to connect a two-way mobile radio system to the network. AT&T, the parent company of the Bell System, initially denied this citing concerns about foreign devices harming the network. The FCC's decision challenged AT&T's monopoly over devices and the transmission platform. The FCC's Carterfone Decision allowed consumer-supplied equipment to be connected to the public telephone network as long as it was \"privately beneficial, but not publically harmful.\" These rules were later codified as Part 68 of the FCC's regulations, giving consumers the freedom to attach any equipment meeting these standards. Some are advocating for similar rules to be applied to wireless networks, which may become more feasible as technologies converge. The FCC has taken steps to encourage opening up the wireless broadband network. The FCC has mandated open access for devices and applications on the wireless broadband network, specifically in the 700 MHz C Block. Consumers can use their choice of devices and legal software as long as it does not harm the network. This requirement was reaffirmed in an order adopted on November 4, 2008. The FCC mandates open access for devices and applications on the wireless broadband network, specifically in the 700 MHz C Block. Industry players are starting to embrace openness principles, with Clearwire operating a nationwide network based on WiMax technology, allowing consumer choice in applications and devices. Sprint Nextel and Clearwire proposed voluntary commitments for open access based on FCC approval. The new Clearwire, approved by the FCC, is committed to open access for devices and applications on its WiMax network. Despite progress, the wireless industry still faces issues like handset locking and exclusivity agreements. Regulatory focus is on economic aspects like competition and innovation, as broadband's importance grows in society. Regulators are considering applying social goals to the broadband world, including universal service goals, emergency services, access for disabilities, and consumer protection. There is debate on whether universal service objectives should include universal access to broadband service. Universal service in telecommunications means providing a range of telecommunications goods nationwide at a reasonable price. The importance of broadband services is increasing, leading to a consensus on the need for universal access. As broadband services become more essential, there is a debate on expanding universal service goals to include access to advanced services. Concerns exist about the costs and uncertainties of mandating nationwide deployment of broadband services. Ensuring quality 911 emergency access across different types of connections is also a focus, especially as technology transitions from analog to digital. Policymakers are working to provide enhanced 911 capabilities for accurate location tracking regardless of technology used. There is a consensus that a modernized emergency system should incorporate IP networks and standards. The net neutrality debate has led to a focus on consumer protection, including transparency in broadband speeds and usage caps, consumer monitoring of usage, and protection of consumer information. Policymakers are also addressing social goals such as accessibility for those with disabilities, protection from identity theft, and safeguarding minors from inappropriate content. Policies for achieving social goals in a broadband environment may be controversial and complex, including protection of minors from inappropriate material."
