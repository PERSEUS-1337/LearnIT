    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Science Over Politics Act\". The Congress finds that emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), approved by the FDA, can reduce the risk of pregnancy by up to 89% if taken within 72 hours of contraceptive failure. ECPs do not cause abortion but prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation, fertilization, or implantation. Increased use of ECPs could halve unintended pregnancies and abortions. Over-the-counter sales of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) could significantly reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions, with ECP use preventing up to 43 percent of the decline in abortions between 1994 and 2000. This could benefit sexual assault victims, as timely access to ECPs could prevent an estimated 88 percent of pregnancies resulting from rape. Numerous organizations support the availability of ECPs, including the American Nurses Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The American Public Health Association, Medical Association, and Association of Reproductive Health Professionals support over-the-counter access to emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs). Product manufacturers submitted an application to the FDA to switch Plan B from prescription-only to over-the-counter status. ECPs meet FDA criteria for over-the-counter status, are safe and effective, easily self-administered, and do not harm existing pregnancies or lead to riskier behavior. The FDA staff and experts approved Plan B for over-the-counter sale, citing its safety and effectiveness for women of all reproductive ages. The joint panel voted unanimously in favor of making Plan B available without a prescription. The Prescription Drugs Advisory Committee recommended FDA approval for over-the-counter Plan B for all ages, despite FDA's rejection in 2004. Evidence suggests political influence on FDA's decision. FDA denied over-the-counter status for emergency contraceptive drug Plan B, with the possibility of review by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will review the FDA's decision on Plan B and affirm that it was not politically influenced, based on sound science, and followed FDA procedures. The affirmation under subsection (a) must be published in the Federal Register."
