    "content": "The \"Fuel Price Fairness Act\" defines terms such as \"Commission,\" \"integrated oil company,\" and \"refinery.\" It also declares an energy price emergency. The Commission, with the Secretary of Energy, can declare a national or regional energy price emergency due to shortages of crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, or home heating oil, or pricing anomalies in energy markets. The Secretary of Energy allows the Commission to access information for monitoring oil supplies during an emergency. A declared price emergency will end within 30 days at the Commission's discretion. During a national or regional energy price emergency, integrated oil companies or refineries must disclose crude oil and wholesale prices to the Commission within specific timelines. Additionally, unreasonable pricing is prohibited during such emergencies. During a national energy price emergency, it is unlawful to sell gasoline, diesel fuel, or home heating oil at an unreasonable price at retail. Integrated oil companies or refineries are also prohibited from selling crude oil or refined products at an unreasonable price. The Federal Trade Commission will determine what constitutes an unreasonable price within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. Enforcement actions can be taken against retailers for violations. Enforcement actions can be taken against retailers for violations of subsections (a) and (b). Violators of subsection (a) will be treated as violating an unfair or deceptive act or practice rule under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Violators of subsection (b) can face fines up to $2,000,000 or imprisonment for up to 2 years. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct a study on the effects of increased trading of oil and gasoline futures contracts on the rising cost of commodities. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment."
