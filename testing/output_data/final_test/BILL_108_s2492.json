    "content": "The Act titled \"Improving Access to Nurse-Midwife Care Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that Medicare covers approximately 2 million women with disabilities of childbearing age, who give birth to 50,000 children annually. These women lack appropriate access to primary care services, with long intervals between gynecological visits and lower rates of receiving mammograms. Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs) serving these women are reimbursed at a lower rate, leading to financial challenges in providing care. CNMs face financial challenges due to rising professional liability premiums, forcing some to leave the marketplace. Despite being highly educated, they struggle to subsidize care for women with disabilities of childbearing age. Medicare payment for certified nurse-midwife and midwife services is addressed in Section 3. Certified midwife services are defined as services provided by a certified midwife who has completed specific education and clinical experience requirements. These services must be legally authorized by the state and are payable under Medicare similarly to physician services. The heading in section 1861(gg) of the Act is amended to meet guidelines prescribed by the Secretary or certified by a recognized organization. The heading in section 1861(gg) of the Act is amended to include \"Certified Nurse-Midwife Services; Certified Midwife Services\". Certified midwife services are now included in the Medicare Act, allowing patients to receive care from certified nurse-midwives or certified midwives. Certified midwife services are now covered under the Medicare Act, allowing certified nurse-midwives or certified midwives to provide inpatient hospital services at teaching hospitals. Certified nurse-midwives or certified midwives can provide inpatient hospital services at teaching hospitals under the Medicare Act, with the hospital electing to receive payment for their services. Certified nurse-midwife services or certified midwife services can be provided in a hospital with a teaching program under the Medicare Act, allowing for payment under specific sections. Under the Medicare Act, certified nurse-midwife services and certified midwife services are eligible for payment under specific sections, including amendments to payment amounts and assignment of payment. Under the Medicare Act, payment for certified nurse-midwife services and certified midwife services can be designated to the provider or entity chosen by the certified nurse-midwife or certified midwife under an agreement. Amendments have been made regarding payments for these services in teaching hospitals. Amendments have been made to payment provisions for certified nurse-midwife and certified midwife services in teaching hospitals, specifying conditions for services provided in hospitals without approved teaching programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must create regulations within 180 days to implement the amendments related to payment provisions for certified nurse-midwife and certified midwife services in teaching hospitals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue interim regulations within 6 months of the enactment of the Act to implement amendments promptly."
