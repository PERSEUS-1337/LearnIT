    "content": "The \"Homeowner Disaster Relief Act of 2014\" allows for a waiver of the 10-percent penalty on qualified natural disaster distributions from qualified retirement plans. The \"Homeowner Disaster Relief Act of 2014\" waives the 10% penalty on qualified natural disaster distributions from retirement plans. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code define and provide rules for these distributions. The \"Homeowner Disaster Relief Act of 2014\" allows penalty-free distributions from retirement plans for individuals affected by federally declared disasters, with specific criteria to qualify for the distribution. The aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual as qualified natural disaster distributions for any taxable year with respect to a federally declared disaster is limited to $100,000 minus the total amount received in prior years. Plan distributions are also subject to specific treatment. The plan shall not violate any requirement merely because it treats a distribution as a qualified natural disaster distribution, as long as the total amount from all employer plans to the individual does not exceed $100,000. The term 'controlled group' refers to a group treated as a single employer under specific sections. An individual who receives a qualified natural disaster distribution can repay it within a 3-year period by contributing to an individual retirement plan. The usual dollar limitations on contributions do not apply in this case. The term 'federally declared disaster' refers to disasters warranting federal assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, determined by the President. The term 'disaster declaration date' refers to the date of determination for a disaster. The amendments apply to distributions made after the enactment of the Act."
