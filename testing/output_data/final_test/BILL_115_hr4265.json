    "content": "The \"Sugar Policy Modernization Act of 2017\" is the short title of this Act, which focuses on the sugar program. The \"Sugar Policy Modernization Act of 2017\" focuses on the sugar program, amending loan rates for domestically grown sugarcane and sugar beets. Loan rates for raw cane sugar range from 18.75 to 18.00 cents per pound for different crop years. Loan rates for sugar beets are set at 128.5 percent of the raw cane sugar loan rate. The \"Sugar Policy Modernization Act of 2017\" adjusts loan rates for domestically grown sugarcane and sugar beets for various crop years. It aims to ensure adequate sugar supplies at reasonable prices and avoid forfeitures. Additionally, it includes provisions for the assurance of no net cost and the recovery of net costs. The program established under the \"Sugar Policy Modernization Act of 2017\" may result in a net cost to the Federal Government. In such cases, the Secretary will recover the net cost from processors of domestically grown sugarcane and sugar beets through single or multiple payments as defined in regulations. In the context of the \"Sugar Policy Modernization Act of 2017,\" the term 'net cost' refers to Federal expenditures exceeding receipts under the program. The Secretary will issue regulations for implementation starting from the 2019 crop year. Additionally, the effective period of the Act is extended until 2023. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to extend the feedstock flexibility program for bioenergy producers until 2019 and terminate it for 2020 and subsequent crops. Additionally, marketing allotments for sugar are extended for two years, with subsequent administration of tariff-rate quotas. The marketing allotments for sugar are extended until 2020, with adjustments to tariff-rate quotas to ensure a final ratio of sugar stocks to total. The final ratio of sugar stocks to total sugar use at the end of a crop year will be approximately 14.5 percent for fiscal year 2019 and 15 percent for fiscal year 2020. Stocks of raw cane and refined beet sugar will be adequate throughout the crop year to meet marketplace needs. Effective October 1, 2020, part VII of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 is amended. \"Administration of tariff-rate quotas for sugar is addressed in part VII of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938.\" The Secretary shall establish tariff-rate quotas for raw cane sugar and refined sugar to ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices, complying with international trade agreements. Adjustment authority is granted to maintain a 15.5 percent ratio of sugar stocks to total sugar use annually. Stocks of raw cane and refined beet sugar will be managed accordingly. The Secretary will establish tariff-rate quotas for raw cane sugar and refined sugar to ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices. Stocks of raw cane and refined beet sugar are sufficient to meet marketplace needs, including efficient cane refining capacity. Regulations will promote full use of quotas and allow for voluntary transfers of quota shares between countries. The subsection allows transfers between parties with a voluntary agreement, valid for the fiscal year only. No impact on quota share for the following year. Effective until 2023 for sugar crops. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 provisions for sugar crops will continue to apply for the 2019 and 2020 crop years. The sense of Congress is that the President should prioritize eliminating subsidies benefiting sugar production/export and focus on trade agreements for global sugar trade liberalization to benefit the US economy."
