    "content": "Banks vary in business models, including balance sheet size, products offered, funding sources, and risk appetite. Regulations are tailored based on criteria like asset size thresholds. Debates exist on how regulations should vary and be implemented, especially post-financial crisis responses like Dodd-Frank. Bank regulation, such as Dodd-Frank and Basel III Accord, aims to achieve benefits like better risk management and consumer protection, but may also lead to reduced credit availability and slower economic growth. Tailoring regulations to banks based on characteristics like risk appetite and systemic importance is crucial for effective implementation. Designing effective bank regulation involves tailoring regulations to different types of banks. For example, regulations aimed at reducing systemic risk may be more beneficial for large, complex institutions compared to smaller, single-branch banks. Determining how regulations should vary between banks is a complex task, as seen in the Dodd-Frank mandate for enhanced prudential regulation for bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets. The U.S. regulators have established classifications for bank holding companies based on asset size, with stricter requirements for advanced approaches banks and globally systemically important banks. Small banks have their own classifications, with exemptions for certain thresholds. Different terminology, like community bank and Wall Street, is used in discussions on bank regulation. This report focuses on selected classifications of banks, discusses legislation amending the tailoring system, and analyzes differences in size, business activities, and reliance on capital funding among banking organizations. The debate on tailored regulation is complicated by diverse terminology used to describe banks and the need for specific classification criteria for regulatory purposes. The curr_chunk discusses different types of bank classifications, including unofficial, official, and proposed classifications based on alternative criteria. These classifications are used to determine appropriate levels of regulation for banks based on their business models. The terms used for classification can be subjective and may need improvement for practical regulatory application. The terms \"community bank\" or \"Main Street bank\" are used to refer to banks that focus on simple deposit-taking and loan-making for a specific community. Identifying these banks based on size can be challenging as there is no consensus on the specific threshold. Small banks differ from large banks in various ways besides asset size. Community banks, identified by metrics beyond asset size, focus on core commercial bank activities like loans and deposits. They operate in smaller geographic areas and practice relationship lending. Proponents argue they play a crucial role in providing credit. Proponents of community banks argue that they are vital credit sources for local communities and underserved groups. Small banks have fewer employees, resources for regulatory compliance, and pose less systemic risk compared to large banks. Wall Street banks are very large and complex, involved in various business lines beyond traditional banking activities. Wall Street banks are large, complex institutions with billions or trillions of dollars in assets. They have a global presence and are involved in underwriting and trading securities. The term \"Too Big To Fail (TBTF) bank\" refers to these large institutions that meet specific criteria. A TBTF bank is one that policymakers judge as crucial to the financial system, leading the government to intervene to prevent its failure. This belief can create moral hazard, where market participants take excessive risks assuming protection from losses. Moral hazard can lead to excessive risk-taking by banks, lax risk monitoring, and unfair funding advantages, potentially resulting in government bailouts. The effectiveness of policy reforms like Dodd-Frank and Basel III in addressing these issues is debated. Regional and mid-size banks typically have a simple business model focusing on deposits and loans, serving a specific region. Banks, whether regional or larger, are heavily regulated in the United States due to their crucial role in the economy and potential risks. All banks, regardless of size, must comply with federal and state laws related to banking, lending, consumer protection, and money laundering. Banks in the United States are heavily regulated to ensure consumer protection, prevent money laundering, and maintain financial stability. Regulations include maintaining minimum capital levels, FDIC insurance, and regulatory supervision. Different banks face varying regulatory regimes based on their characteristics. The regulatory classification of banks in the United States is based on size-based asset thresholds, which determine the level of regulation they are subject to. Small banks, with assets less than $1 billion, are considered to pose less risk to the financial system. This report focuses on prominent classifications facing banks and proposed changes, rather than providing an exhaustive examination of all regulatory classifications and exemption thresholds. Small banks with assets below $1 billion are exempt from certain regulations, allowing for less frequent examinations and simpler reporting forms. These banks can take on more debt for mergers and have different capital requirements under the Small-Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. Additionally, they are evaluated under the Community Reinvestment Act for their community involvement. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) subjects banks to evaluations on meeting community credit needs. Compliance examination is simpler for banks below a threshold slightly over $1 billion, with variation in bank characteristics. Data analysis focuses on 617 banking organizations above the $1 billion threshold, with the next major regulatory threshold at $10 billion. As of June 30, 2017, 502 bank organizations held between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets, while 115 held more than $10 billion. Banks exceeding $10 billion in assets are subject to additional regulation due to potential harm to the economy. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversees compliance for these banks, which must also conduct annual stress tests. The Federal Reserve caps interchange fees for banks using debit cards under the Dodd-Frank Act. Banks with assets over $10 billion face stricter regulations, with a major threshold at $50 billion. BHCs with over $50 billion in assets are subject to enhanced prudential regulation to prevent destabilizing the financial system. BHCs exceeding the $50 billion threshold must submit balance sheet and income data to the Federal Reserve for stress tests. They must also submit a resolution plan and hold highly liquid assets to meet cash flow needs during stress events. Additionally, they must meet liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratio requirements. The Basel II Accords were created in 2004 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel II Accords, created in 2004, established a framework for bank regulators to use internal risk measurement systems at internationally active banks to determine capital requirements. In 2007, U.S. bank regulators implemented enhanced regulations for advanced approaches in calculating capital requirements, covering banks with $250 billion in total assets or $10 billion in total foreign exposures. As of the end of 2016, 15 U.S. BHCs, including 8 globally systemically important banks, were subject to these regulations. The advanced approaches framework for large and complex banks in the United States involves regulatory ratio requirements to ensure financial stability, following the Basel III framework. These requirements aim to produce risk-based capital requirements that are more sensitive to risks and build on improvements in risk assessment approaches adopted by many large banks. BCBS's revised Basel III framework includes requirements for advanced approaches banks to calculate ratios related to minimum capital requirements, include off-balance sheet exposures, meet countercyclical capital buffers, and adhere to liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements. Basel III also designates globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in the United States. The Federal Reserve designates banks as globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in the United States based on a scoring system using two methods to measure systemic importance. The scoring methods include indicators of interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and funding market usage. Size is just one of many indicators measured. The eight U.S. banks designated as G-SIBs are subject to stringent regulations and supervisory expectations, including holding additional capital known as the G-SIB surcharge. They must also meet certain quality requirements for capital and debt to ensure they have adequate total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) in case of failure. The classifications for banks, except for G-SIB designations, are primarily based on total assets. Some proposals suggest adjusting thresholds to better tailor regulations. However, focusing solely on size may not capture other important characteristics like complexity and risk. Alternative methods for classification include examining a bank's activities, capital levels, or giving regulators more discretion. This section explores alternative criteria for classifying banks based on their activities and capital levels, rather than just total assets. It discusses how regulating banks solely based on size may not address risks posed by complex activities like wholesale funding, securities market making, and derivatives hedging. The distinctions are simple in theory but challenging in practice. Banks face challenges in determining which activities to engage in, with examples including securities and derivatives trading. These activities can expose banks to additional risks due to market volatility and sudden changes in underlying asset values. Derivatives trading can expose banks to large losses and increased cash obligations. Thomas Hoenig proposed a new classification for banks to qualify for regulatory relief. Thomas Hoenig proposed a new classification for banks to qualify for regulatory relief based on specific criteria related to trading assets, derivatives positions, and total notional value of exposures. This classification aims to exempt certain banks from regulations like Basel III and Dodd-Frank requirements, separating them into low-risk and high-risk groups. Opponents argue that separating traditional banking from other activities may not necessarily pose greater risks to bank solvency and financial stability compared to traditional banking activities like mortgage lending. Diversifying risks in different markets could potentially make a bank less likely to fail. Proposed legislation in Congress aims to establish activities-based criteria for regulatory relief for banks. Banks secure funding through issuing liabilities or raising capital, with liabilities being deposits and borrowings owed to savers and creditors. Capital, raised through methods like issuing equity, can absorb losses without repayment. Prudential regulation aims to prevent bank failures by setting minimum capital requirements based on a bank's size and funding choices. Capital requirements for banks can be met through leverage ratios or risk-weighted ratios. Leverage ratios treat all assets equally, while risk-weighted ratios assign a risk weight based on asset riskiness. Tailoring regulations using capital-based criteria involves setting a benchmark ratio for well-capitalized banks to qualify for exemptions. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 proposes exemptions for strongly capitalized banks with a minimum capital ratio, allowing them to be exempt from various regulations. This includes exemptions from other capital ratios, certain liquidity requirements, and stress-test requirements. Supporters argue that high leverage ratios make banks safe from failure, while opponents believe a single ratio is insufficient for regulation. Opponents argue that using a single ratio to exempt banks from regulations weakens necessary prudential regulation. Without risk weighting, banks may be incentivized to hold riskier assets. Policymakers debate between rules-based and principles-based regulations, with the former minimizing ambiguity in regulation application. Rules-based approaches to regulation may pose challenges as rule makers may not anticipate all relevant circumstances. For instance, a $51 billion bank with a safe business model and a $49 billion bank with a risky one could face different regulatory burdens due to a set regulatory threshold. This can lead to inconsistencies and \"cliff effects\" in regulation application. Regulators could avoid \"cliff effects\" by granting additional authority to tailor regulations, as seen in the Dodd-Frank Act. This allows for differentiation among companies based on various risk factors, rather than a set threshold. Additionally, regulators can exercise discretion in supervising different institutions. Some policymakers and industry participants advocate for exempting more bank organizations from regulations and allowing regulators to designate additional ones based on certain analyses. They argue that giving technical experts wider authority to determine regulatory applicability would lead to more effective regulation. Opponents prefer a bright line approach for certainty and transparency in regulatory treatment. Legislation such as the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act and the TAILOR Act aim to tailor regulation for banks based on their characteristics and risks. Understanding the differences between banks that meet classification criteria is important to assess the effectiveness of existing and proposed regulations. IDIs at the depository subsidiary level are relatively homogenous in commercial banking activities. The report examines differences in size, business activities, and capital levels of U.S. bank organizations at the consolidated top-parent company level. It compares organizations meeting certain criteria with those that do not. Metrics include total assets, balance sheet items, and capital ratios. Existing official regulation classifications are mostly size-based, with advantages and disadvantages. The report analyzes U.S. bank organizations based on size, activities, and capital levels. Official regulations are mostly size-based, leading to clarity but overlooking other bank characteristics. The efficacy of asset-based criteria depends on the correlation between size and other characteristics. The largest banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America hold assets exceeding $1.8 trillion, showing clear differences compared to smaller institutions. The largest U.S. banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, hold assets exceeding $1.8 trillion. Citigroup is twice as large as Goldman Sachs, and there is a significant drop in size between the sixth and seventh largest banks. These large institutions have lower concentrations in deposit-taking and lending compared to smaller banks. Trading assets and liabilities make up less than 1% of the average bank's assets. The top four largest banks have trading assets accounting for 5% to 16% of total assets and trading liabilities between 2% and 8% of total liabilities. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are more focused on investment banking activities, with deposits making up 15% and 19% of their liabilities, and loans 11% and 16% of assets. Trading assets represent 34% and 31% of their total assets, while trading liabilities make up 15% of total liabilities for both firms. Identifying clear cutoff points for different bank business models becomes subjective as asset sizes decrease. The business models of banks vary in terms of deposits, loans, and trading assets. Larger organizations show significant deviations from industry norms, with outliers in various asset sizes. Despite these variations, certain correlations exist among different bank business models. The largest banking organizations, with assets totaling $43 billion and $30 billion, show deviations from industry averages in terms of concentrations in loans, deposits, trading assets, and liabilities. Grouping banks into cohorts based on size reveals trends, with the largest organizations having below-average concentrations in loans and deposits but above-average trading assets and liabilities. It is not until the fourth cohort, consisting of banks with assets between $26 billion and $19 billion, that averages align with the rest of the industry. The largest banking organizations deviate from industry averages in terms of concentrations in loans, deposits, trading assets, and liabilities. Larger institutions in stricter regulatory classifications are less reliant on deposits and loans and more involved in trading activities. Simple leverage ratio generally decreases as institutions get larger. Averages of bank organizations may obscure outliers within any group. In recent decades, the banking industry has consolidated significantly, with a decline in small institutions and an increase in large banks holding industry assets. As of June 30, 2017, nine insured depository institutions with over $250 billion in assets accounted for more than 50% of industry assets, up from two institutions 20 years earlier. The number of institutions with less than $1 billion fell from 10,630 to 5,035, with their share of industry assets decreasing from 22% to 7%. Critics attribute this consolidation to regulatory changes. The banking industry has consolidated significantly in recent decades, with a decline in small institutions and an increase in large banks holding industry assets. Critics argue that regulatory burden on small banks drives them to merge with larger institutions. However, other factors like deregulation of branching and banking across state lines and economies of scale also contribute to industry consolidation. The banking industry has consolidated in recent decades, with a decline in small institutions and an increase in large banks holding industry assets. Some thresholds for banks are not indexed to inflation, causing fixed thresholds to decline over time in real asset value. Critics argue that asset size thresholds do not reflect a bank's activities accurately. Critics argue that asset size thresholds do not accurately reflect a bank's activities, which may lead to inappropriate regulation for banks engaged in simple deposit-taking and loan-making. FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig proposes three activities-based criteria for regulatory relief for traditional banking organizations. According to Vice Chairman Hoenig, traditional banking organizations that meet certain criteria would need to establish separate intermediate holding companies for specific activities. About 90% of commercial banks would qualify, with 454 out of 617 banks over $1 billion in assets having no trading assets or liabilities. Banks with trading activities tend to be larger than those without. In Table 4, banks with trading activities are larger, less concentrated in loans and deposits, have more derivatives exposure, and lower capital ratios than banks without these activities. Of the 617 organizations with over $1 billion, 75% have derivative positions, with only 59 having positions in non-interest rate or exchange rate derivatives. Banking organizations without derivative positions are smaller, focused on loans and deposits, and have higher capital levels. The average banking organization with trading activities is larger, less concentrated in loans and deposits, and has more derivatives exposure. Organizations with interest or exchange rate derivatives are more leveraged, while those with equities and commodities derivatives are larger and more engaged in trading. Banks with only interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives have smaller derivative positions compared to those with more extensive holdings. In May 2017, FDIC's Vice Chairman Hoenig amended the proposed criteria to qualify as a TBO, which allows an approximation of qualifying banks using available metrics. This section compares banks meeting specific criteria related to trading assets, liabilities, derivatives positions, and leverage ratios. The liabilities-to-equity ratio is used as an approximation of a 10% leverage ratio. Out of 617 banking organizations with at least $1 billion in assets, 41% met the modified TBO criteria. TBOs have smaller assets and higher regulatory capital ratios compared to non-TBOs. The average leverage ratios also differ between the two groups. The difference in risk-based ratio between TBOs and non-TBOs is notable. More than half of non-TBO banks are \"traditional\" without trading activity, similar to TBOs. Capital held by a bank indicates its ability to absorb losses. The capital held by a bank is an indicator of its ability to absorb losses, leading some to argue that capital levels should heavily influence bank regulation. Proponents suggest setting a capital ratio threshold, with banks above 10% leverage ratio potentially qualifying for regulatory relief. Banks must meet various capital ratios based on what is counted as capital, exposure items, and risk weighting. This report does not delve into the technical details but groups banking organizations based on a single measure. The report groups banking organizations based on the Tier 1 leverage ratio, an un-risk-weighted measure of capital. Comparisons show that less-capitalized banks are less concentrated in loans and more involved in trading activities. Highly capitalized banks have lower deposit concentration and a high risk-weighted ratio. The relationship between leverage, size, and derivative position is not straightforward. The report groups banking organizations based on the Tier 1 leverage ratio, showing that less-capitalized banks are less concentrated in loans and more involved in trading activities. Highly capitalized banks have lower deposit concentration and a high risk-weighted ratio. The relationship between leverage, size, and derivative position is not straightforward, with higher leverage ratios associated with fewer assets and smaller derivative positions. The report examines characteristics of banking organizations above and below a 10% threshold for Tier 1 leverage ratio. Banks above the threshold have an average of $10.4 billion in assets, while banks below have $50.1 billion. Highly capitalized banks have higher loan and deposit concentrations, lower trading assets and liabilities, smaller derivative positions, and higher risk-weighted capital ratios. Congress has various legislative options for tailoring bank regulations. The report examines characteristics of banking organizations above and below a 10% threshold for Tier 1 leverage ratio. Banks above the threshold have an average of $10.4 billion in assets, while banks below have $50.1 billion. Congress has various legislative options for tailoring bank regulations, including bills that would raise asset thresholds for more stringent regulation. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Examination and Reporting Threshold Act of 2017 would increase the threshold for CFPB supervision from $10 billion to $50 billion. The Community Bank Relief Act (S. 1284) and H.R. 1948 aim to raise the threshold for small-bank holding companies, exempting them from certain regulations. S. 1284 would raise the threshold to $5 billion, while H.R. 1948 proposes raising it to $10 billion. Other bills, like the Community Lending Enhancement and Regulatory Relief Act (S. 1002), would create new exemptions for banks below certain asset thresholds, such as exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker Rule and certain lending escrow requirements. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) and the Traditional Banking Regulatory Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 4647) propose exemptions for banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain regulations, including the Volcker Rule. Banks with less than $1 billion in assets may also be exempt from specific management assessments. The Pension, Endowment, and Mutual Fund Access to Banking Act (H.R. 2121) proposes criteria for defining \"custodial banks\" based on specific activities, such as revenue generated from custodial businesses and assets under custody. Banks meeting this definition would be exempt from counting central bank deposits as exposure for meeting leverage requirements. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (FCA; H.R. 10) offers regulatory relief to banks by allowing them to choose a higher 10% leverage ratio in exchange for exemptions from various regulations such as risk-weighted capital ratios, liquidity requirements, stress-test requirements, and merger restrictions. This relief applies to all banks and larger banks with assets over $50 billion. The Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act (H.R. 3312 and S. 1893) aims to amend Dodd-Frank Act provisions for banks with over $50 billion in assets, focusing on globally systemically important banks for enhanced regulation. The Federal Reserve could extend this regulation to additional banks with approval from the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act of 2017 (H.R. 1116 and S. 366) aims to tailor bank regulations based on individual institutions' risk profiles and business models to limit regulatory burden. Policymakers agree that regulations should be tailored to different banks' characteristics to increase benefits and decrease costs of regulation. Small and traditional banks serving community credit needs may warrant less regulatory stringency. Determining how tailoring should be achieved for bank regulations is a contentious issue. Policymakers and observers disagree on whether simple \"bright line\" rules based on certain criteria are effective. Data suggests that asset size, business activities, and capital levels are correlated, but not perfect indicators. Thousands of banks vary in their business models and risk profiles. The debate over achieving bank regulatory tailoring continues due to the diverse nature of banks. The criteria for classifying banks as Traditional Banking Organizations (TBOs) may not align with FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig's proposal. Data from June 30, 2017 is used, but bank balance sheets change over time, leading to alterations in criteria. FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig's proposal includes criteria such as no trading assets or liabilities. Traditional Banking Organizations (TBOs) are banks that meet specific criteria, including holding no trading assets or liabilities except permissible derivatives, having limited derivative exposures, and maintaining a minimum equity-to-assets ratio of 10%. FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig's proposal for bank regulatory tailoring includes similar criteria. The bank must maintain an equity-to-assets ratio of at least 10%, with equity defined as assets minus liabilities. Possible discrepancies may arise if a bank has trading assets and liabilities exclusively consisting of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, or if the ratio of equity-to-assets differs significantly from the ratio of assets minus liabilities to equity. Different calculations for the leverage ratio may also impact qualification criteria. Vice Chairman Hoenig's proposal suggests using the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles equity-to-assets ratio. The Financial CHOICE Act defines the leverage ratio for traditional banking organizations as total assets divided by tangible equity. For banking organizations that do not qualify as TBOs, the leverage ratio is defined as total leverage exposure divided by tangible equity."
