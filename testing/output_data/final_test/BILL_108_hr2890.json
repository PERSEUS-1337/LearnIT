    "content": "The \"Freedom to Fish Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Congress finds that recreational fishing is popular with over 50 million participants and contributes $116 billion annually to the national economy, supporting over 1.2 million jobs. Recreational anglers support fisheries management laws and regulations, contribute over $500 million annually to State conservation programs, and practice catch-and-release fishing. Federal policy allows public access to public lands for recreational purposes. The National Forest Management Act of 1976, the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, the Wilderness Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 reflect federal policy on recreational fishing. Management measures like size requirements and possession limits can maintain fishery resources without restricting public access. Comprehensive standards are needed to show effective management of recreational fishing without unnecessary closures of marine waters. SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\nThe policy of Congress in this Act is to create standards for marine protected areas, ensure open access for recreational fishing, involve anglers in regulatory procedures, and restrict fishing areas only as necessary for conservation.\n\nSEC. 4. MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT AMENDMENT. Section 303(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a provision that areas closed to recreational fishing can only be established if recreational fishermen are identified as the cause of a specific conservation problem and less severe conservation measures are deemed inadequate by the Regional Fishery Management Council. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require that closed areas for recreational fishing must have measurable conservation benefits, be based on scientific information, and be periodically reviewed every 3 years. The closed areas should be reopened when the basis for closure no longer exists."
