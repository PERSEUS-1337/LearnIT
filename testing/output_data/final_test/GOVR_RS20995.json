    "content": "In May 1998, India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests, leading to U.S. economic sanctions under the Arms Export Control Act and Export-Import Bank Act. The tests jeopardized their non-nuclear-weapon state status, resulting in restrictions on U.S. relations including termination of foreign assistance, defense sales, and financial assistance. Since 1990, Pakistan has faced U.S. sanctions due to the Pressler amendment, which requires the President to ensure Pakistan does not have nuclear weapons before providing assistance. In 1995, the requirement was narrowed to only apply to military aid, making Pakistan eligible for other forms of assistance. The Clinton Administration changed sanctions to only apply to military assistance to Pakistan, allowing for other foreign aid. Congress passed the Agriculture Export Relief Act to exempt Department of Agriculture-backed funding from sanctions, benefiting U.S. wheat growers. The India-Pakistan Relief Act of 1998 authorized the President to waive sanctions related to U.S. foreign assistance for a year. President Clinton quickly utilized new authority granted in 1998 to restore certain transactions and support. Permanent waiver authority was provided in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, FY2000, allowing the President to waive all economic sanctions imposed against India and Pakistan, including military assistance and high technology exports. President Clinton utilized new authority in 1998 to restore transactions and support, waiving sanctions for India and Pakistan, including military assistance and high technology exports. He waived nonmilitary restrictions for India on various financial and trade support programs, and for Pakistan on USDA credits. During the Bush Administration, efforts were made to normalize relations with India and Pakistan. Various high-level visits and discussions took place between the United States and both countries, with a focus on military relations, trade talks, and regional issues like Afghanistan. After the terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, policymakers recognized the urgency of mending U.S.-Pakistan relations due to Pakistan's unique position regarding Afghanistan. The President lifted nuclear test-related economic sanctions against both countries on September 22, 2001. Today, the only remaining vestige of the sanctions is the listing of certain entities on the Commerce Department's list. Pakistan's leader, General Pervez Musharraf, seized power in 1999 and declared himself President in 2001. Due to a military coup, Pakistan was ineligible for most U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan also faced restrictions for falling into arrears in debt payments to the United States. In 2001, Pakistan's international debt was $30.7 billion, with $2.38 billion owed to the United States. Steps were taken to relieve the prohibition on U.S. foreign aid, including rescheduling $379 million of debt and passing a bill to exempt Pakistan from certain restrictions on foreign assistance.

Funding related to democracy and debt arrearage remains available through FY2003, provided the President determines that it facilitates the transition to democratic rule in Pakistan and is important to U.S. efforts against international terrorism. President Bush provided $50 million in Economic Support Funds to Pakistan in September 2001 and another $50 million in October 2001, as part of a proposed $600 million assistance package. Additionally, $25 million in Emergency Migration and Refugee Funds was released to Pakistan around the same time. In October 2001, President Bush allocated $100 million for the Afghan refugee crisis, with $50 million for food assistance and $50 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance. Pakistan also received $135 million from the International Monetary Fund to complete a $600 million loan disbursement. In FY2003 budget proposal, President allocated $100 million for Afghan refugee crisis and $135 million for Pakistan to complete $600 million loan disbursement. Relations with India and Pakistan were confirmed."
