The \"Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2013\" amends Chapter 12 of title 11, United States Code, to address governmental claims arising from the disposition of property used in a farming operation. These claims are treated as unsecured claims, not entitled to priority, provided for under a plan, and discharged according to section 1228. Additionally, governmental units may file a proof of claim for a claim that arises after the petition is filed. The debtor must serve notice of a tax claim on the governmental unit if a tax return is filed after the petition, including details of the petition, court location, claim amount, and supporting documentation. The governmental unit has 180 days to file a proof of claim after receiving notice. If they fail to do so, the debtor or trustee can file a claim consistent with the notice. Any claim filed will be determined and allowed or disallowed as if it had arisen before the petition was filed. Technical and conforming amendments are made to chapter 12 of title 11 of the United States Code. The United States Code is amended to provide for the treatment of any claim by a governmental unit as described in section 1232(a).
