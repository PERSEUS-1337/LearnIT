    "content": "The Act titled \"Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2012\" aims to reform consent decrees and settlements. The provisions of this section apply to consent decrees or settlement agreements in actions compelling agency action related to regulatory actions affecting private parties' rights or State, local, or Tribal government entities. In actions resolved by a consent decree or settlement agreement, the complaint, statutory basis, terms, and attorneys' fees must be published. Parties cannot file a motion for a consent decree or dismissal until affected parties have had the opportunity to intervene. The court must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the interests of affected parties are relevant when considering a motion to intervene. When a State, local, or Tribal government entity files a motion to intervene in an action, the court must consider if they administer the same statutory provisions as the defendant agency or if their regulatory authority would be preempted. If the court grants the motion to intervene, all parties involved must be included in settlement discussions. The defendant agency must conduct settlement efforts through court mediation or alternative dispute resolution programs. They must publish proposed consent decrees for public comment for at least 60 days before filing with the court. The agency must also respond to public comments received. The defendant agency must publish proposed consent decrees for public comment for at least 60 days before filing with the court. When moving for court approval, they must inform the court of the statutory basis, submit a summary of public comments and agency responses, certify the administrative record, and make it fully accessible to the court. The court shall include this information in the judicial record. The court must include the agency's certified administrative record in the judicial record. If a consent decree or settlement agreement requires agency action by a specific date, the agency must inform the court of any uncompleted mandatory duties not addressed, explain how the agreement affects those duties, and justify the public interest in the agreement's impact on the agency's discharge of duties. The court will presume, unless proven otherwise, that these actions are in the public interest. The court must ensure that amicus participation is allowed for parties who filed public comments on the consent decree or settlement agreement. The proposed agreement should provide sufficient time for the agency to comply with relevant statutes and executive orders. The defendant agency may hold a public hearing on entering into the consent decree. The Attorney General or head of the defendant Federal agency must certify approval of any proposed consent decree or settlement agreement with specific terms. A public hearing may be held to decide on entering into the agreement, and the court must receive a summary and full record of the proceedings.

The curr_chunk outlines restrictions on settlement agreements that interfere with an agency's rule-making authority or require the agency to spend funds not authorized by Congress. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on settlement agreements that force agencies to spend unauthorized funds or interfere with their rule-making authority.
