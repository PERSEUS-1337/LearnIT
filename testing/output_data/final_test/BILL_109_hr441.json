It also introduces a new section for tax credits related to elementary and secondary education expenses. The \"Education, Achievement, and Opportunity Act\" introduces a new section for tax credits related to elementary and secondary education expenses. Tax credits are allowed for qualified education expenses paid by an individual for each qualifying child. The credit amount per child is $2,500 for elementary school and $3,500 for secondary school in a taxable year. In any taxable year, if a child meets specific requirements, the allowable credit amount cannot exceed the sum of those amounts. The credit is reduced by $50 for each $1,000 by which the taxpayer's income exceeds the threshold amount of $150,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for others. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income plus any excluded amounts under specific sections. Marital status is determined under section 7703. Definitions include 'qualifying child' as defined in section 24(c) and 'qualified education expenses' covering tuition and fees for student enrollment. The curr_chunk discusses qualified education expenses that include enrollment at an educational institution, computers, software, books, tutoring, special needs services, and transportation fees to a private school. The curr_chunk discusses transportation fees charged by schools and excludes special fees for nonacademic purposes. A qualified educational institution includes elementary or secondary schools, private, parochial, or religious schools. The curr_chunk discusses adjustments for Coverdell Savings Account distributions and technical amendments related to education laws. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding new items. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
