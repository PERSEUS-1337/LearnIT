    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1464 of the Penal Code is amended to levy a state penalty of ten dollars for every ten dollars imposed for criminal offenses, excluding parking offenses. The Penal Code imposes a state penalty of ten dollars for every ten dollars imposed for criminal offenses, excluding parking offenses. Bail schedules may include penalties for fines and surcharges, but certain penalties are exempt, such as restitution fines and parking offenses. The state penalty for multiple offenses is based on total fines or bail. Deposited bail for applicable offenses must include the state penalty. Judges have the discretion to waive the state penalty if payment would cause hardship. After court determination of amount due, penalty collected by court clerk and transmitted to county treasury. Portion for Chapter 12 of Government Code deposited in county fund, 70% balance to State Treasury (State Penalty Fund), 30% remains in county general fund. State Penalty Fund moneys distributed accordingly. The State Penalty Fund distributes deposited moneys as follows: 0.33% goes to the Fish and Game Preservation Fund for employee education/training, and 32.02% goes to the Restitution Fund in accordance with the Government Code. Once a month, a percentage of state penalty funds is transferred into various training funds: 23.99% to the Peace Officers\u2019 Training Fund, 25.70% to the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund, and 7.88% to the Corrections Training Fund. Money in the Corrections Training Fund is not continuously appropriated and requires Budget Act approval. Once a month, a percentage of state penalty funds is transferred into various training funds. 0.78% of the funds goes to the Local Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders Training Fund, capped at $850,000 per fiscal year, with the excess going to the Restitution Fund. Additionally, 8.64% of the funds is transferred to the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund. Once a month, 0.66% of state penalty funds are transferred to the Traumatic Brain Injury Fund, capped at $500,000 for the 1996-97 fiscal year. Funds for subsequent years will follow this requirement. The State Department of Mental Health can use funds from 1997-2000 for existing or new projects related to traumatic brain injuries. The State Penalty Fund will utilize moneys from assessments made under the Vehicle Code after the repeal of a specific Welfare and Institutions Code chapter. A new Title 14 in the Penal Code establishes a grant program for local law enforcement to purchase body-worn cameras and related equipment. The State Penalty Fund will use assessments from the Vehicle Code to create a grant program for local law enforcement to buy body-worn cameras. A matching grant program will allow the state to apply for federal funds or reimburse local law enforcement for camera purchases. The Body-worn Camera Fund is established for this purpose. The Board of State and Community Corrections will adjust the grant program to maximize state and local competitiveness in obtaining federal funds for body-worn cameras. The Department of Justice is appropriated funds to match federal funds available for local law enforcement to purchase cameras and related equipment."
