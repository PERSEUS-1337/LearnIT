Waste that generates toxic gases due to cyanide presence at specific pH conditions is prohibited. A study will be conducted to assess risks to human health and the environment from hazardous waste managed under specific paragraphs. The Administrator will evaluate risks associated with hazardous waste management and may impose additional requirements to protect human health and the environment. Treatment standards will consider land-based units as part of a treatment system.

The Solid Waste Disposal Act exempts certain landfill units from ground water monitoring requirements if they dispose of less than 20 tons of waste daily and show no evidence of contamination. Landfill units serving communities with transportation interruptions or limited waste management alternatives may still be subject to monitoring for ground water protection. The Solid Waste Disposal Act allows for exemptions from ground water monitoring for landfill units disposing of less than 20 tons of waste daily and showing no contamination evidence. States may require alternative methods for monitoring and must take corrective action if contamination is found. The Director of an approved State can suspend monitoring requirements if the landfill operator proves no potential for hazardous constituent migration. The Solid Waste Disposal Act allows exemptions from groundwater monitoring for landfills disposing of minimal waste if no contamination evidence is found. A qualified groundwater scientist must certify a demonstration of no potential for hazardous constituent migration, approved by the State Director. The Administrator will issue guidance for small communities to use the no migration exemption. Alaska Native villages can be exempt upon the Governor's certification. The Native Claims Settlement Act allows exemptions for small, remote Alaska village landfill units disposing of less than 20 tons of waste daily.

The Administrator will revise guidelines to provide flexibility for landfills receiving 20 tons or less of waste per day. Alternative requirements for daily cover application, methane gas monitoring, final cover layers, and financial assurance must consider climatic and hydrogeologic conditions while protecting human health and the environment. The intent is to reinstate subpart E of part 258 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations. Technical corrections are made to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, including changes to section numbers, punctuation, and spelling errors.
