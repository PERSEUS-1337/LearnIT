    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Investment Act of 2005\" is cited as the short title. It includes an amendment to Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to add a Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard. The section defines biomass as organic material from plants used for energy production, including nonhazardous waste from forest resources like mill residue, precommercial thinnings, and slash. The curr_chunk lists various types of agricultural resources and miscellaneous waste that fall under the definition of biomass for energy production. The curr_chunk defines biomass for energy production, including landscape trimmings, animal waste converted to fuel, and excludes items like municipal waste, post-consumer paper, and tires. The curr_chunk defines terms related to renewable energy sources such as distributed generation, incremental hydropower, and landfill gas. The curr_chunk defines terms related to renewable energy sources, including wind, ocean waves, biomass, solar, landfill gas, incremental hydropower, and geothermal. It also defines renewable energy as electricity generated from renewable energy sources or hydrogen produced from a renewable energy source. Retail electric suppliers must submit renewable energy credits equal to a required annual percentage of non-hydropower electricity sold to consumers each year. Unused credits can be carried over for up to two years. Retail electric suppliers must ensure that a certain percentage of the electricity they sell comes from renewable sources. Unused renewable energy credits can be carried over for up to two years. Retail electric suppliers are required to submit renewable energy credits to the Secretary to meet the specified percentage requirements each year. Credits can be issued to the supplier or obtained through purchase or exchange. The Secretary will establish a program to issue, monitor, and track renewable energy credits within a year of the Act's enactment. Entities generating electric energy from renewable resources can apply for these credits under the program. The Secretary will issue renewable energy credits for each kilowatt-hour of renewable energy generated, based on the type of resource and state of production. The Secretary will issue 3 renewable energy credits for each kilowatt-hour of distributed generation, with credits vesting with the system owner unless transferred. Eligibility requires selling or using the generated electricity, and credits are based on the proportion of renewable energy used. Credits are identified by type and date of generation. The Act allows for the sale or exchange of renewable energy credits, which can be done by the entity issued the credit or any other entity. Credits can be sold or exchanged in various ways, including on the spot market or through contractual arrangements, without conflicting with existing laws. The Secretary shall offer renewable energy credits for sale at a set price, adjusted for inflation annually. States can still enforce their own renewable energy programs. Retail electric suppliers must charge rates reflecting the cost of renewable energy generation. The supplier must not misrepresent the percentage of eligible resources in a product to meet renewable generation requirements. Failure to submit renewable energy credits will result in a civil penalty based on the number of credits not submitted. The Secretary can collect information to verify annual electric and renewable energy generation for credit applications. The Secretary may issue renewable energy credits to entities not covered by the Act if they meet its terms. Amounts from sales and other sources will be distributed to states for renewable energy grant programs. Regional equity programs must be established within a year. The Secretary will establish a program within a year to promote renewable energy production and use. Funds will be available for State energy agencies for renewable energy research, loan guarantees, and consumer rebate programs. The Secretary will establish a program to promote renewable energy production and use, with funds available for State energy agencies to support innovative renewable energy technologies and distributed generation. Preference will be given to States with a small share of renewable energy capacity and programs likely to stimulate renewable energy technologies."
