    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Revitalizing Cities Through Parks Enhancement Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that urban areas lack public open spaces for recreation and social interaction, leading to vacant lots becoming hubs for crime. Refurbishing these lots into well-maintained parks would benefit the community. Establishing community parks would create positive assets for surrounding communities, provide outlets for youth, increase property values, attract other investments, and enhance residents' quality of life. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has the authority to make grants to qualified community organizations for establishing community open spaces in urban areas. The grants cannot exceed $250,000 per organization per fiscal year. Qualified community organizations are eligible for these grants. Qualified community organizations eligible for grants under this Act must have significant activities related to improving the neighborhood, a history of serving the community, maintain accountability to residents, and comply with financial standards set by the Secretary. Eligible activities for grants under this Act include developing municipal real property for community open space, leasing or obtaining property for open space, maintaining open space, and covering administrative costs related to its establishment and management. Under this Act, grants can only use less than 10 percent of the funding for certain costs. Recipients must follow an approved development plan for activities funded by the grant. Community organizations applying for grants must involve residents and organizations in the development plan. The Act requires community organizations to involve interested parties in the development plan by making it available for examination and comments, holding public hearings, and carrying out activities under the plan if they receive funding. SEC. 6 of the Act specifies that grant funds can only be used for establishing community open space on municipal real property owned by the local government, located in urban areas, free of structures, and committed for use as open space for at least 7 years. The Secretary will accept grant applications from nonprofit organizations in a specified format to fulfill the Act's objectives. Each application must include a detailed plan for utilizing grant funds, including identifying eligible municipal property for community open space, proof of ownership, and details about the applying organization. The grant application must include details such as the organization's qualification, planned activities with grant funds, commitments to provide other assistance, the need for community open space, maintenance plans, community participation in the plan's establishment, and provisions for ongoing community involvement. The grant application must include organization qualifications, planned activities with grant funds, commitments to provide assistance, the need for community open space, maintenance plans, community participation, budget details, and any other relevant information required by the Secretary. SEC. 8. SELECTION AND GRANT AGREEMENTS. The Secretary will select community organizations for grants based on feasible development plans and community involvement. Selection criteria include community involvement and the need for open space in the neighborhood. The Secretary will enter grant agreements with qualified community organizations to ensure funds are used according to the Act for community open space development plans. The Secretary will review and approve or disapprove amendments to development plans submitted by recipients. Recipients may be required to submit reports to ensure compliance with the development plan and the Act. The Secretary will report annually to Congress on grants, recipients, and community open spaces provided with grant funds. The Act defines \"community open space\" as public recreational areas, \"nonprofit organization\" as a private entity with no earnings benefiting individuals, and \"qualified community organization\" as a nonprofit meeting specific requirements. The Act defines terms such as \"recipient\" as a qualified community organization receiving a grant, \"urban area\" as a city within a metropolitan statistical area, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and \"unit of general local government\" as any city, town, or township. The term \"general local government\" refers to various political subdivisions of a State, including cities, towns, counties, and villages. The term \"State\" encompasses the States of the United States, along with other territories and possessions. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement the Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 1995 and 1996."
