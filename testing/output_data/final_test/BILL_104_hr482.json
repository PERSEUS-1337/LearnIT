The \"Federal Benefit Integrity Act\" amends the Social Security Act to reduce aid each year for families without citizens or nationals, with the amendments taking effect after a 1-year period from the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. Provision of Supplemental Security Income benefits only to citizens and nationals of the United States. Section 1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act is amended to require individuals receiving supplemental security income benefits to be citizens or nationals of the United States. Additionally, benefits currently paid to non-citizens or nationals will be phased out over a 3-year period. Benefits for non-citizens receiving supplemental security income shall be reduced by 1/3 each year over a 3-year period. SEC. 4. USE OF ASSISTED HOUSING BY ALIENS. Amends Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 to restrict the use of assisted housing by aliens. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development cannot provide financial assistance to non-citizens after a certain period unless they were already receiving assistance. The term 'financial assistance' refers to assistance provided under specific housing acts. If financial assistance is to be terminated for an individual, the agency or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may choose to continue providing assistance at their discretion. The provision of financial assistance may be continued to prevent the separation of a family with a US citizen or national. Termination of assistance can be deferred for up to 6 months, with the possibility of renewal for a total of 3 years, to allow for a smooth transition to other affordable housing options. The agency must inform the individual and family members at the start of each deferral period. Financial assistance may not be provided to individuals unless they declare their US citizenship in writing under penalty of perjury. Documentation must also be presented to support this declaration. Family members may be informed of their ineligibility for financial assistance and offered help in finding affordable housing. The Secretary requires reasonable documentation indicating US citizenship for individuals to receive financial assistance. Amendments to the Food Stamp Act of 1977 include changes to citizenship requirements for recipients. The amendments will take effect one year after the enactment of the Act and will not apply to certification periods before the effective date."
