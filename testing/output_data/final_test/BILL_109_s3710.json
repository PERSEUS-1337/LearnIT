Congress finds that there is a shortage of qualified teachers in the nation's classrooms, with a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade. Many teachers lack adequate preparation for their jobs, leading to high rates of out-of-field teaching, especially in high-poverty schools. Teacher turnover is a significant issue, with over one-third of new teachers leaving the profession within their first 3 years. High rates of teacher attrition, especially in high-poverty schools, with 1 out of 5 teachers leaving or dropping out between 2000 and 2001. African-American, Latino, and low-income students often lack highly-qualified teachers. Effective teachers can significantly boost student learning by a full grade level. Research shows that effective professional development for teachers includes teacher-led, ongoing, and collaborative programs. Successful professional development focuses on concrete classroom applications, practice, teacher observation, critique, reflection, group support, and collaboration. Data on school reform indicates that teachers are more likely to stay in academically challenged schools when appropriate supports are in place. Only 16 states finance new teacher induction programs, with few requiring inductees to be matched with mentors in the same subject. Research shows that effective professional development for teachers includes teacher-led, ongoing, and collaborative programs. Teachers are more likely to stay in academically challenged schools with appropriate supports like high-quality induction programs, job-embedded professional development, and small classes for tailored instruction. Improving retention and professional development for public school teachers through teacher centers is addressed in an amendment to Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary may grant funds to establish or support teacher centers, with special consideration for high-need educational agencies. Grants last for 3 years and require centers to provide professional development for teachers to enhance their skills and teaching practices. Teacher centers aim to improve students' achievement by providing teachers with information on curricula, assessments, and research, offering training for new teachers, assessing professional development needs, and providing support to improve instruction in various subjects. The teacher center provides support for mentors, training for mainstream teachers serving students with disabilities and limited English proficiency, opportunities for collaborative activities, funding for release time and substitute teachers, libraries of professional materials and technology, and high-quality professional development. The teacher center offers professional development for instructional staff, helps teachers and paraprofessionals meet qualifications, develops curricula, provides online resources, funds classroom projects, forms partnerships with businesses and organizations, and establishes a teacher center site. The teacher center policy board is supervised by a teacher and consists of teacher representatives selected by teachers and other representatives designated by the school board. The teacher center policy board, supervised by a teacher, includes representatives designated by the school board, institutions of higher education, and may include paraprofessionals. To apply for a grant, an eligible entity must submit an application with required information and assure compliance with the teacher center receiving assistance. The eligible entity must establish a teacher center policy board, with specified membership and selection process, to comply with grant requirements. The term 'eligible entity' refers to a local educational agency or a consortium of agencies. 'High-need' schools have at least 65% of children from low-income families. A 'high-need local educational agency' serves a minimum of 10,000 children. The term 'teacher center policy board' refers to a board described in subsection (f). Authorization of appropriations is set at $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and necessary sums for the following 5 years.
