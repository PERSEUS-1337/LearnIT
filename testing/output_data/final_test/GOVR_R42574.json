    "content": "Credit unions have evolved with marketplace changes to offer similar financial services as banks and savings associations, but remain distinguishable due to their cooperative framework and unique charter requirements. They are nonprofit, member-owned institutions exempt from federal income tax. Credit unions are financial cooperatives exempt from federal income tax. Charters are granted based on a \"common bond\" for membership. There are three types of charters: single common bond, multiple common bond, and community-based common bond. Members elect a board of directors and savings are called \"shares.\" Credit unions have more restricted loan and investment powers compared to commercial banks. Credit unions have limited investment powers, only able to make loans to members, other credit unions, and credit union organizations. Federal credit unions are restricted to loans, government securities, deposits in other financial institutions, and certain other investments. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the federal regulator for credit unions, managing the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). As of December 31, 2011, there were 7,094 federally insured credit unions with assets totaling $961.8 billion. There was no commercial lending cap on member business loans until 1998. The Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998 (CUMAA) established a commercial lending cap for credit unions. It defined member business loans (MBL) and limited the amount of outstanding business loans to one member or group. The act also set limits on the aggregate amount of MBLs a credit union could make. Exceptions were allowed for credit unions with low-income designation. The Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998 established a commercial lending cap for credit unions, limiting the amount of outstanding business loans. Exceptions were allowed for credit unions with low-income designation or participating in the Community Development Financial Institutions program. Concerns were raised about the 12.25% lending cap being too high and potentially enabling regulatory arbitrage opportunities. The 12.25% lending cap in the legislation represented a compromise. Credit union member business lending has increased over time, accounting for a small share of total credit union lending. 30% of credit unions provided MBLs in 2011, totaling $28.47 billion, which equaled 3.2% of total credit union assets. The median MBL size was $126,316, with 82% secured by real estate. Some credit unions were heavily concentrated in agricultural loans. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to allow credit unions to expand their member business lending activities. H.R. 1418 and S. 2231 would increase the business lending cap to 27.5% of total assets from the current 12.25%. The proposed legislation aims to increase the lending authority of credit unions, requiring well-capitalized status for business member loans. It also mandates a minimum of five years' experience in underwriting and servicing member business loans. Policy issues related to the legislation are discussed, including potential risks to the financial system. The proposed legislation aims to increase lending authority for credit unions, with requirements for well-capitalized status and experience in underwriting business loans. Policy issues regarding potential risks to the financial system are also addressed. The legislation does not include firm or loan size restrictions, with definitions of small business loans varying among agencies. If enacted, credit unions would have expanded opportunities. If enacted, the legislation would allow credit unions to increase their presence in the commercial lending market by expanding their lending authority. This could incentivize more credit unions to engage in commercial lending, potentially offsetting implementation costs with increased revenues from larger loan volumes. Credit unions could become significant competitors with community banks in commercial lending due to potential increase in lending cap. Regulatory arbitrage may allow credit unions to conduct more lending with fewer regulatory requirements, creating a competitive advantage and new risks to the financial system. Safety and soundness requirements for credit unions differ from those for community banks. Community banks, defined as financial institutions with assets below $1 billion, engage in relationship banking by developing close familiarity with their customer bases in a circumscribed geographical area. This approach helps them understand local lending risks. Similarly, credit unions provide tailored financial services to their restricted memberships, relying primarily on deposits. Community banks and credit unions rely on deposits to fund their assets. Community banks are for-profit institutions without restrictions on customer base, while credit unions have unique memberships. Safety and soundness regulations differ between the two. Safety and soundness regulations for financial institutions, including credit unions and community banks, focus on maintaining sufficient capital reserves to absorb losses from loan defaults. Capital is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities, with a capital-asset ratio for banks and a net worth-asset ratio for credit unions. Insolvencies and failures are less likely with adequate capital buffers in place. Community banks must maintain a total risk-based capital-to-asset ratio of 8% to be adequately capitalized and 10% or more to be well-capitalized. Credit unions, on the other hand, need a risk-based net worth-to-asset ratio of 6% to 6.99% for adequate capitalization and 7% or higher for well-capitalization. This means that a well-capitalized credit union could hold less capital than an adequately capitalized community bank. The 8% requirement for adequately capitalized credit unions is statutory and would need congressional action to change. Differences in capital ratio requirements may not lead to significant regulatory arbitrage due to varying asset risk-weighting methodologies. A comparison in the Appendix shows that complex credit unions and smaller ones would need more capital for longer-term loans compared to banks. Credit unions may have lower capital requirements for short-term loans compared to banks, but as they increase real estate and long-term investments, their capital needs rise to reduce the risk of failure. While there may not be a capital arbitrage opportunity for credit unions in longer-term loans, factors like tax differences and compliance costs are not considered in the analysis. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was enacted to address concerns about banks not providing enough housing financing to inner cities. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 was created to address banks not providing sufficient housing financing to inner cities. It has since expanded to include rural and disaster areas, as well as consumer and business lending. CRA requires federal banking regulatory agencies to evaluate how banks meet the credit needs of their entire community, particularly low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Banks receive CRA credits for providing LMI loans or other financial services in their communities, with larger banks facing more scrutiny due to operating in diverse, larger communities. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires banks to meet the credit needs of their entire community, especially low- and moderate-income areas. Larger banks face more scrutiny, while credit unions are not covered by CRA. Banks have a reciprocal obligation to serve their communities, while credit unions are limited to serving their membership. CRA credits may not be valuable to credit unions due to their restrictions on expansion. Regulatory arbitrage opportunities remain inconclusive. Raising the credit union lending cap could increase competition with community banks in commercial lending, but differences in capital requirements, tax treatment, and compliance costs may not give credit unions a competitive advantage. Both banks and credit unions face different cost factors, with credit unions needing more capital for long-term loans. Small businesses rely on credit to finance operations until sales revenue is received, but may reduce production during economic downturns. The macroeconomic impact of raising the credit union lending cap would depend on firms' willingness to take on new loan obligations during weak sales. The Federal Reserve reports an increase in demand for small business credit, with domestic banks reporting a rise in demand for commercial loans from small firms. Increased C&I loan demand from small firms has reached its highest level since 2005. Surveyed banks noted little change in lending standards, citing a less favorable economic outlook. Credit unions may also be cautious about extending credit due to tightened lending standards. Small community banks may explore new lending opportunities outside of mortgage lending. Regulatory requirements have increased costs of servicing loans, prompting banks to seek alternative lending options. The banking industry may see a slowdown in mortgage servicing growth due to limitations on servicing rights counting towards capital reserve requirements. New mortgage lending requirements from the Dodd-Frank Act could reduce the pool of qualified borrowers. Low interest rates may prompt credit unions to adjust their investment strategies. Increasing the MBL cap could lead to intensified competition between banks and credit unions for commercial loans. The example below illustrates how capital requirements are computed for different financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions. Community banks use risk weights from Basel I, while credit unions use the Risk Based Net Worth rules. This difference can create regulatory arbitrage opportunities. Under the Risk Based Net Worth (RBNW) rules, loans with shorter maturities receive a 6% risk weight, while longer-term loans exceeding a certain percentage of the portfolio receive multiple weights. For example, MBLs representing 15% or more of total assets would receive 6% for the first 15% and 8% for the remaining amount. If MBLs exceed 25% of total assets, the excess would receive a 14% risk weight. All loans in Table A-2 are treated as newly originated based on their maturity length. A complex credit union must hold $777,700 in capital against its lending portfolio to be well-capitalized, while a typical credit union not meeting the definition of complexity would need to hold $707,000. This is required to avoid NCUA from taking Prompt Corrective Action against the institution."
