    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, approved as Proposition 47 in 2014, reduced penalties for certain nonviolent crimes. State savings are deposited in the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund to be used for prevention services, including truancy and dropout prevention. 25% of the funds go to the State Department of Education for a grant program to support at-risk students. Funding for K-12 education under the act should be used to support evidence-based programs for at-risk students, in line with local educational agencies' plans for pupil engagement and school climate. California aims to increase knowledge on effective strategies for improving pupil success and eliminating the school-to-prison pipeline. This includes providing resources to establish community schools and address attendance issues in early grades. Local educational agencies participating in the K-12 education grant program are encouraged to report outcomes using multiple measures and share successful strategies statewide. A new program, The Learning Communities for School Success Program, is added to the Education Code to support these efforts. The Learning Communities for School Success Program is established to implement the K-12 education portion of the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act. The program provides grants and assistance to local educational agencies to support evidence-based, nonpunitive programs aligned with pupil goals in local control and accountability plans. A local educational agency applying for funding under the Learning Communities for School Success Program must submit an application to the department, including information on pupil and school needs, planned activities, alignment with local goals, and outcome measurement. The department may establish requirements for grantees to meet at the end of the first and second years of funding to receive funding for the remaining grant period. Grant eligibility and distribution are based on pupil and school needs, number of pupils served, participating schools, challenges faced by the agency, and unique characteristics of small school districts. Before the initial application deadline, the department will offer targeted outreach and technical assistance to local educational agencies likely to be prioritized for grants. Assistance with application development may also be provided to any agency upon request, including support from external entities contracted by the department. The department will issue application guidelines with information on program evaluation and identifying measures for assessing pupil and school outcomes. The department will consult with stakeholders, including representatives of local educational agencies, teachers, parents, and advocacy organizations, to gather input on grant application design and review process. Stakeholders will not determine grant recipients. A local educational agency receiving a grant must use the funds for evidence-based programs to support vulnerable students, such as establishing community schools and improving attendance. Implementing restorative practices, restorative justice models, social-emotional learning, positive behavior interventions, and trauma-informed strategies to improve retention rates, reduce suspensions, and support vulnerable students. Establishing partnerships with community-based organizations to implement nonpunitive approaches and address chronic attendance problems. The department prioritizes grant recipients based on high rates of chronic absenteeism, suspension, or dropout, high crime rate in the community, and significant representation of foster youth among pupils. The local educational agency receiving a grant must have a significant representation of foster youth among its students. The agency must provide a local contribution of at least 20% of the grant award, which can be in cash or in-kind. Grant funds should be used to enhance current services and cannot be used for law enforcement activities. The department will use funding from the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act for administrative costs related to implementing the article, including grant awards, training, and evaluation. The department will provide training and technical assistance to grantees through regional workshops and experts in pupil engagement, school climate, truancy reduction, and supporting at-risk students. They may contract with providers to assist grantees and other local educational agencies. Technical assistance will align with support provided for the development of local control and accountability plans. The local educational agency receiving grant funding must evaluate and report results to the governing board and the department. The department will compile information for an overall evaluation of the grant program, assessing benefits and identifying pupil and school outcomes. Interim and final evaluation reports are due to the Legislature by January 31, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Reports must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. Section 10231.5 of the Government Code states that the section will be repealed on January 31, 2024. Definitions for \"community school\" and \"local educational agency\" are provided. The article will only be effective if funds are allocated to the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund as per the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act. SEC. 3. Sections 1 and 2 of this act will be in effect if Senate Bill No. 527 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session is enacted by January 1, 2017."
