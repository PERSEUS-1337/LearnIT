    "content": "The text introduces a new subchapter in the Internal Revenue Code imposing a carbon tax on primary fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. This includes specific taxes for each type of fuel and provisions for inflation adjustments. A tax is imposed on coal sold by the producer or importer at a rate of $18 per ton, with a phase-in period starting at $3.60 per ton in 1994 and increasing annually until reaching $14.40 per ton in 1997. In 1997, the tax rate on coal is $14.40 per ton. Definitions include lignite as coal and a ton as 2,000 pounds. If a producer or importer uses coal, they are liable for tax as if it were sold. \"Tax on petroleum is outlined in SEC. 4692.\" The tax on petroleum is imposed at a rate of $3.90 per barrel on any petroleum with a taxable event, defined as an event that would result in tax under section 4611. The tax on petroleum is imposed at varying rates per barrel for different calendar years, with the person liable for the tax determined under specific principles. Definitions for \"petroleum\" and \"barrel\" are provided for clarity. The term 'barrel' is defined as 42 United States gallons, with the tax imposed on a fraction of a barrel being proportional to the tax on a whole barrel. Rules similar to those in section 4612 apply to the tax imposed in this section. The tax on natural gas is imposed in this section. The tax on natural gas is imposed on natural gas received at a US pipeline facility or entered into the US for consumption, use, or warehousing. If domestic natural gas is used in or exported from the US without a prior tax, a tax is imposed at the specified rate. This tax does not apply to natural gas used for extracting oil or natural gas on the premises where produced. The tax on natural gas is imposed on natural gas received at a US pipeline facility or entered into the US for consumption, use, or warehousing. The tax rate is 48 cents per MCF, with a phase-in period starting at 9.6 cents per MCF in 1994 and increasing to 28.8 cents per MCF in 1996. The tax on natural gas is imposed on natural gas received at a US pipeline facility or entered into the US for consumption, use, or warehousing. The tax rate is 48 cents per MCF, with a phase-in period starting at 9.6 cents per MCF in 1994 and increasing to 28.8 cents per MCF in 1996. The tax is paid by the operator of the pipeline facility, the person entering the natural gas, or the person using or exporting the natural gas. The definition of natural gas includes natural gas liquids not treated as petroleum for tax purposes. The tax imposed on natural gas is based on the amount received at a US pipeline facility or brought into the US for various purposes. The tax rate starts at 9.6 cents per MCF in 1994 and increases to 28.8 cents per MCF in 1996. Definitions for terms like domestic natural gas, United States pipeline facility, MCF, and other terms are provided in the section. Rules similar to subsections (b), (c), and (e) of section 4612 apply to the tax imposed in this section. SEC. 4694 outlines the inflation adjustments for tax rates under this subchapter, with increases based on the CPI for the preceding year compared to 1993. The rounding rules for these adjustments are specified based on the type of tax rate. Effective Date: The amendments for the carbon tax on primary fossil fuels will be in effect on January 1, 1994."
