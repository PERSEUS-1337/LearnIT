The Congress finds that brain aneurysms are a significant health concern, with 6 million people in the US having an unruptured aneurysm and 30,000 experiencing a rupture each year. Ruptured aneurysms are fatal in 40% of cases, with survivors often facing permanent neurological deficits. Women are more likely to experience aneurysms than men. Notable individuals affected include Ellie Helton, a 14-year-old who passed away from a ruptured aneurysm in 2014. Ellie Helton, a 14-year-old, passed away from a ruptured brain aneurysm, stunning her family and friends. Lisa Colagrossi, a news reporter and mother of two, also died unexpectedly from a massive brain aneurysm at 49 years old. Lisa Colagrossi, a beloved wife, mother, and successful reporter, passed away from a ruptured brain aneurysm, leaving her family and friends in shock. Teresa Anne Lawrence, a devoted mother of three, collapsed and passed away due to hypertension complications at the age of 34. Jennifer Sedney, a 27-year-old woman, died suddenly from a brain aneurysm after experiencing a severe headache. She was a dedicated jogger, health care consultant, and blogger focused on wellness. Her family was left to raise her children whom she adored. The sudden death of 27-year-old Jennifer Sedney from a brain aneurysm left her family devastated. Despite the high societal cost of brain aneurysms, the Federal Government only spends $0.83 per year on research for each affected person. The International Study on Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms has advanced understanding of how to manage and treat this condition effectively. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke is authorized to receive $5,000,000 annually from 2018 to 2022 for comprehensive research on unruptured intracranial aneurysms. This funding is meant to supplement existing research funds for brain aneurysms."
