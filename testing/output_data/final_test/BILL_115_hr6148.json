    "content": "The \"Bullying Redress and Verified Enforcement Act\" or the \"BRAVE Act\" amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include official reporting requirements for bullying. The \"BRAVE Act\" mandates that employees of local educational agencies report bullying incidents within 7 business days, detailing the acts, any reference to protected characteristics, and the agency's response. The \"BRAVE Act\" requires employees of local educational agencies to report bullying incidents within 7 business days. An employee is not obligated to report bullying if the student requests confidentiality. The agency must designate a person to receive and record reports of bullying, informing all employees of the contact information. Within 60 days of receiving a report, the designated individual must inform employees of the acts described and the agency's response. The \"BRAVE Act\" mandates local educational agencies to report bullying incidents promptly, with quarterly reports listing the number of reports made and informing the public of their right to file complaints. Personally identifiable information about students must be excluded from these reports. Each local educational agency must annually review bullying policies for schools under its jurisdiction. Federal enforcement under SEC. 8582 is required for bullying policies in schools. As a condition of receiving federal funding under this Act, a local educational agency must annually certify compliance with the specified section and submit the 4 most recent quarterly reports. The Assistant Secretary of the Office of Civil Rights for the Department of Education must establish a procedure for complaints related to non-compliance with this section. The Assistant Secretary of the Office of Civil Rights for the Department of Education must investigate complaints of non-compliance with the specified section by local educational agencies. If non-compliance is found, actions may include withholding funds, issuing a cease and desist order, or entering into a compliance agreement. The Assistant Secretary investigates complaints of non-compliance with specified sections by local educational agencies. Within 60 days of receiving a complaint, information about the complaint is made available on the Department's website, excluding personally identifiable student information. If bullying is related to a protected characteristic, it is described. SEC. 8583 defines \"bullying\" as severe, pervasive acts causing harm or concern to another student, and \"protected characteristic\" includes race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new subpart on bullying, with sections on official reporting requirements, federal enforcement, and definitions."
