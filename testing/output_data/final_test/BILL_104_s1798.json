    "content": "The \"Irrigation Subsidy Reduction Act of 1996\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that the Federal reclamation program, in existence for over 90 years with a significant taxpayer investment, has had a major impact on water resources in western States. Irrigation water from Federal projects is a valuable resource facing increasing demands. The original purpose of providing water at reduced cost to benefit small family farms has been hindered by inadequate implementation of subsidy limits. Below-cost water prices promote excessive use. (5) Below-cost water prices in the arid West encourage excessive water use, while reasonable price increases for wealthy farmers would promote water conservation. (6) The Federal Government has started using income-based eligibility tests for entitlement and subsidy programs, aligning with the historic approach of limiting water subsidies to smaller farms in the reclamation program. (7) Implementing a means test based on gross income in the reclamation program would enhance the effectiveness of achieving the family farm goals of Federal reclamation laws. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.
