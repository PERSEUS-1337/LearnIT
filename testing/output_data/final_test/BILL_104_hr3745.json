    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Corrections Act of 1996\" allows federal agencies to purchase prison-made products. Section 4124 of title 18, United States Code, requires Federal departments and agencies to offer to purchase prison-made products. Procurement activities must solicit offers from Federal Prison Industries for specific products listed in the catalog, and contract awards must be made using competitive procedures. Federal Prison Industries may be awarded a contract if the prison-made product meets all requirements, performance is expected on time, and the price is competitive. Under a contract awarded by a Federal department or agency, Federal Prison Industries has the same rights as any other contractor. The decision of a contracting officer regarding the award or performance of a contract with Federal Prison Industries is final unless appealed. Disputes between Federal Prison Industries and a procurement activity are resolved by a board of contract appeals. The final resolution by the board of contract appeals under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 requires Federal departments to report purchases from Federal Prison Industries to the Federal Procurement Data System. Federal Prison Industries must maintain a catalog of products and services it offers for sale. Federal Prison Industries must maintain a catalog of products and services that can be revised as needed by its Board of Directors. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Chapter 307 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section defining terms related to federal procurement, including 'reasonable share of the market' and 'specific product'. The former refers to a share of total purchases by federal departments and agencies that does not exceed 20 percent of the market for a specific product, while the latter is a product designed and manufactured to meet distinct requirements. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code and the 13-digit National Stock Number are required for product classification under federal procurement. Implementation of the amendments made by this Act in the Federal Acquisition Regulation includes proposed revisions to be published within 60 days of enactment, with a 60-day public comment period. Final regulations must be published within 180 days of enactment and effective 30 days after publication, allowing for public participation as required by law. Section 5 clarifies that the amendments do not affect the rights of offerors other than Federal Prison Industries to file bid protests. Section 6 states that the Act and its amendments will take effect upon enactment, with specific applicability to product requirements after the issuance of final regulations or after March 31, 1997."
