The term 'Indian country' is defined as land within Indian reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments with unextinguished titles. The term 'Indian tribe' is defined broadly to include various Native American groups recognized by the Secretary of the Interior. Indian tribes have primary enforcement responsibilities under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, with specific criteria for recognition and authority within Indian country. \"SEC. 9010. INDIAN TRIBES.\" The Administrator may delegate primary enforcement responsibility to Indian tribes for programs in Indian country, provide grant assistance, and enter into cooperative agreements. Delegation is subject to conditions such as the tribe having a governing body with substantial governmental duties and powers. The Administrator may delegate primary enforcement responsibility to Indian tribes for programs in Indian country, subject to conditions such as the tribe having a governing body with substantial governmental duties and powers. The Indian tribe must be capable of carrying out the functions in a manner consistent with the terms and purposes of the regulations. EPA regulations specifying how Indian tribes may exercise primary enforcement responsibility must be promulgated within 12 months of the enactment of this section. The Administrator may delegate primary enforcement responsibility to Indian tribes for programs in Indian country, subject to conditions. If tribal enforcement is not feasible, the EPA can directly implement regulations to achieve the same purpose. Indian tribes cannot have less protective enforcement than states. Cost sharing is not required for Indian tribes. An Indian tribe is not required to pay for corrective actions if it would impose an undue burden. They can enter into cooperative agreements with states to jointly plan and administer requirements. A study of underground storage tanks within Indian country is also mentioned. The Administrator must conduct a study and inventory of underground storage tanks in Indian country within 12 months of this section's enactment. The study will assess tank ages, types, locations, soil conditions, water tables, hydrogeology, factors influencing releases, and the effectiveness and costs of inventory and detection systems. The Administrator will establish a Tribal Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to cover corrective action costs in Indian country, funded by deposits from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Administrator may allocate funds from the trust fund for an Indian tribe's corrective actions under a cooperative agreement. Indian tribes can recover costs for corrective actions related to underground storage tank releases in their jurisdiction if they notified the EPA and BIA of the release. Indian Affairs failed to require corrective action for underground storage tank releases in Indian country. Appropriations for regulating underground storage tanks in Indian country are mandated under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Section 2007(f)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to allocate a minimum of 1.5% of appropriations for grants to Indian tribes for underground storage tank programs. The table of contents is also updated to reflect these changes. Sec. 9010 amends the Internal Revenue Code to set aside funds for tribal leaking underground storage tank programs. For fiscal years 1995 through 1999, the Secretary shall deposit at least 3 percent of funds allocated to States into the Tribal Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for use by Indian tribes to carry out specific purposes."
