    "content": "The proposed QANet architecture for machine reading and question answering is faster than RNN-based models, using convolution and self-attention instead. It achieves equivalent accuracy while being 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference. This speed improvement allows for training with more data, including data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine translation model. Our single model, trained with augmented data, achieves 84.6 F1 score on the SQuAD dataset, outperforming the best published F1 score of 81.8. The BiDAF model combines a recurrent model and an attention component to achieve strong results on the SQuAD dataset. However, these models can be slow for training and inference, especially for long texts. In this paper, the authors propose a model called QANet that aims to make machine comprehension faster by removing the recurrent nature of models and using convolutions and self-attentions instead. The model encodes the query and context separately, learns interactions between them, and decodes the probability of answer spans. The key motivation behind the design is to address the slow training and inference of existing models, especially for long texts. QANet is designed to improve machine comprehension speed by using convolutions and self-attentions instead of recurrent models. The model encodes query and context separately, learns interactions between them, and decodes answer spans. In experiments on the SQuAD dataset, QANet is significantly faster in training and inference compared to competitive models, achieving the same accuracy in a fraction of the time. The QANet model outperforms competitive models with an F1 score of 82.7 on the dev set after 18 hours of training. By using data augmentation techniques, the model achieves an F1 score of 84.6 on the test set, surpassing the best published result. Ablation tests confirm the effectiveness of each component in improving reading comprehension. The paper proposes an efficient reading comprehension model based on convolutions and self-attentions, achieving significant speedup in training. A novel data augmentation technique is introduced to enhance accuracy on SQuAD. The model, QANet, utilizes only convolutions and self-attention, showing empirical effectiveness and making a unique contribution to the field. The paper introduces a reading comprehension model called QANet, which uses convolutions and self-attention for efficiency and accuracy on SQuAD. The model's structure includes embedding and encoder layers, context-query attention, and an output layer. The unique aspect of the model is its use of convolutional and self-attention in the embedding and modeling encoders. The QANet model utilizes convolutional and self-attention mechanisms in its embedding and modeling encoders, resulting in faster processing of input tokens. Other unpublished results show comparable performance to the model, with the best documented model achieving an 84.4 F1 score. The model architecture includes Encoder Blocks with varying numbers of convolutional layers, layernorm, residual connections, and shared weights among encoders. The QANet model utilizes convolutional and self-attention mechanisms in its encoding process, with shared weights among encoders. Positional encoding with sin and cos functions is added at the beginning of each encoder layer. The model combines convolutions and self-attention, outperforming self-attention alone by 2.7 F1 score. Convolutional layers also enable the use of regularization methods like stochastic depth, resulting in an additional 0.2 F1 gain in experiments.

Word embeddings are obtained by concatenating word and character embeddings, with out-of-vocabulary words mapped to an <UNK> token. Character embeddings are trainable vectors of dimension 200, and words are represented as the concatenation of character embeddings. The output of a word is the concatenation of its word embedding and character convolution output.

The QANet model combines convolutional and self-attention mechanisms in its encoding process, with shared weights among encoders. The context-to-query attention is constructed by computing similarities between context and query words, normalizing them, and using a trilinear function. Some models also use query-to-context attention, with DCN attention providing a slight benefit.

The model's output layer predicts the probability of each position in the context being the start or end of an answer span. The proposed model can be customized for other comprehension tasks by adjusting the output layers. During inference, the predicted span is chosen based on the model's speed, allowing for training with more data and data augmentation techniques. The approach involves using two translation models, one from English to French and another from French to English, to generate paraphrases of texts. This method aims to increase training data for language-based tasks, such as reading comprehension. The augmentation process utilizes attention-based neural machine translation models, specifically 4-layer GNMT models trained on public WMT data for English-French and English-German.

The study utilized paraphrasing techniques for data augmentation in question answering tasks on the SQuAD dataset. The approach involved splitting paragraphs into sentences, paraphrasing them, and extracting answers. A new document was created by replacing sentences with paraphrases, and answer extraction was used to identify the new answer. The quality and diversity of paraphrases were crucial for the data. The quality and diversity of paraphrases are vital for data augmentation in question answering tasks. Improvements can be made by using better translation models and enhancing diversity through sampling during beam search decoding. Combining this method with other data augmentation techniques, such as the type swap method BID30, can increase diversity in paraphrases. Experimental results show a significant improvement in accuracy, suggesting the technique's applicability to other natural language processing tasks with limited training data. In this section, experiments are conducted to evaluate the model's performance and data augmentation technique on the SQuAD dataset BID31 for question answering tasks. The dataset contains 107.7K query-answer pairs, with 87.5K for training, 10.1K for validation, and 10.1K for testing. The paragraphs are typically around 250 words long, and questions consist of 10 tokens. The test data is hidden, requiring submission to Codalab for evaluation. In experiments on the SQuAD dataset, data preprocessing involves using NLTK tokenizer, setting maximum context length to 400, and discarding paragraphs longer than that. During training, examples are batched by length and padded with <PAD>. Maximum answer length is 30, and out-of-vocabulary words are replaced with <UNK>. GLoVe 300-D word vectors are used. During training, out-of-vocabulary words are replaced with <UNK> and character embeddings are randomly initialized as 200-D vectors. Two augmented datasets are created, \"data augmentation \u00d7 2\" and \"data augmentation \u00d7 3\". Regularizations include L2 weight decay, dropout on word and character embeddings, and stochastic depth method. The model uses a survival probability of 0.9 for the last layer with hidden size and convolution filter number set at 128. Training steps vary for different data augmentation levels. The optimizer used is ADAM with specific parameters, and a learning rate warm-up scheme is implemented. The model is built in Python using Tensorflow and experiments are conducted on an NVIDIA p100 GPU. The model achieves high accuracy on an NVIDIA p100 GPU, with F1 and Exact Match metrics used for evaluation. Results are compared with other methods, showing performance on par with state-of-the-art models. Training on the original dataset outperforms documented results, especially when using augmented data. Our model achieves significant gains in F1 scores when trained with augmented data, outperforming the best documented results on the official test set. It also shows improved performance compared to other models in the \"single model\" category on the SQuAD leaderboard. The text discusses the performance of various models such as Dynamic Coattention Networks, FastQA, BiDAF, and others in a speed comparison study. The models use different numbers of layers of Bidirectional LSTMs, with results showing significant speed improvements compared to RNN-based models. Our model outperforms BiDAF in both training and inference speed, achieving a 4.3 and 7.0 times speedup respectively. It only requires one fifth of the training time to match BiDAF's best F1 score on the dev set. The validation scores on the development set show that convolutions and self-attention in the encoders are crucial components of the model, with separable convolutions also contributing significantly. Data augmentation experiments were also conducted. Data augmentation experiments were conducted to understand the impact of augmented data on performance. Increasing the training data size by adding En-Fr-En data resulted in a 0.5% increase in F1 score. Further addition of En-De-En data led to an additional 0.2 improvement in F1 score. The diversity of new data contributed to these performance gains. However, injecting more data beyond a certain point did not benefit the model. In data augmentation experiments, increasing the sampling weight of augmented data improved model performance, but beyond a certain point, it led to a drop in performance. The best results were achieved with a ratio of original data to augmented data at (3:1:1), resulting in a 1.5/1.1 gain in EM/F1 over the base model. This model was submitted for test set evaluation. The experiments conducted on the adversarial SQuAD dataset BID17 focused on the robustness of the proposed model. Two types of misleading sentences, AddSent and AddOneSent, were used to intentionally mislead the trained models. The model, originally trained on the SQuAD data, was evaluated on the adversarial server, with results compared to other models in Table 6. Our model, trained with augmented data, shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model Mnemonic and outperforms other models by a significant margin. The robustness of our model is attributed to data augmentation and injected noise during training, improving generalization and resilience to adversarial sentences. In this section, the model is tested on the TriviaQA dataset, which is more challenging than SQuAD due to longer contexts, noise, and potential unrelated context to the answer. The dataset consists of 650K context-query-answer triples authored by Trivia enthusiasts with 6 evidence documents per question on average.

The dataset consists of 650K context-query-answer triples authored by Trivia enthusiasts with 6 evidence documents per question on average. The focus is on testing the model on answers from Wikipedia, with the omission of experiments on Web data to keep training time manageable. Researchers have found that simple hierarchical or multi-step reading tricks can boost performance on TriviaQA, but this paper focuses on comparing with single-paragraph reading baselines only. The model can potentially be plugged into other multi-paragraph reading methods for similar or better performance. The Wikipedia sub-dataset used for testing contains around 92K training and 11K development examples with average context and question lengths of 495 and 15 respectively. Data processing similar to BID18 is adopted, where a window of length 256 for training and 400 for validation is randomly selected.

The speed comparison with RNN-based models on TriviaQA Wikipedia dataset demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed model. Question answering in NLP has gained importance due to publicly available datasets like SQuAD, TriviaQA, CNN/Daily News, WikiReading, and Children Book Test. Various neural network models like BiDAF, r-net, DCN, ReasoNet, Document Reader, Interactive AoA Reader, and Reinforced Mnemonic Reader have been proposed for this task.
