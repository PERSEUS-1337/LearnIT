    "content": "The \"Freedom Flat Tax Act\" allows individuals and businesses to elect to be subject to a flat tax. This Act introduces new parts in the tax code for individuals, business activities, and noncash compensation for employees not engaged in business activity. The \"Freedom Flat Tax Act\" allows individuals and businesses to make an irrevocable election to be subject to a flat tax instead of the regular tax imposed by specific sections in the tax code. An individual or a person engaged in business activity can choose to be subject to this tax under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The \"Freedom Flat Tax Act\" allows individuals and businesses to elect to be subject to a flat tax instead of the regular tax imposed by specific sections in the tax code. The \"Freedom Flat Tax Act\" imposes a tax on the taxable income of individuals who elect to be subject to this part. The tax rates are 19 percent for the first 2 taxable years and 17 percent for subsequent years. Taxable income is defined as the excess of wages received during the taxable year. The \"Freedom Flat Tax Act\" imposes a tax on taxable income of individuals in the United States. Taxable income includes wages, retirement distributions, and unemployment compensation, minus the standard deduction. The standard deduction consists of a basic amount and an additional amount, with specific values for joint returns. The standard deduction for individuals in the United States varies based on filing status: $25,900 for joint returns, $16,330 for surviving spouses, $16,330 for heads of household, and $12,790 for single individuals or married individuals filing separately. An additional standard deduction of $5,510 is allowed for each dependent who meets certain criteria. The term 'retirement distribution' includes distributions from various retirement plans such as 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408(a), 408(b), 457, governmental plans, and trusts under section 501(c)(18). The Secretary determines eligible plans, contracts, accounts, annuities, or trusts. Taxable income of dependent children under 14 is included without tax liability. Dollar amounts in subsection (c) are adjusted for inflation after 2004. The cost-of-living adjustment for dollar amounts in subsection (c) is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding calendar year compared to the CPI for the calendar year 2003. The CPI is the average of the Consumer Price Index as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the calendar year. The Consumer Price Index for urban consumers is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments. Any increase not a multiple of $10 is rounded up. Marital status is determined under section 7703. Tax is imposed on business activities under section 60B. Tax is imposed on every person engaged in a business activity who elects to be taxed under this part. The tax rate is 19% for the first 2 taxable years and 17% for subsequent years. The tax must be paid by the person engaged in the business activity, whether an individual, partnership, corporation, or otherwise. Business taxable income is defined as the income subject to this tax. The term 'business taxable income' is defined as gross active income minus specified deductions. Gross active income includes receipts from sales or exchanges of property or services in the US and exports from the US related to business activities. The fair market value is used for exchanges of property or services. The fair market value of property or services received, plus any money received, is used to determine business taxable income. Exemptions apply for activities of governmental entities and tax-exempt organizations. Deductions specified in this section are applicable. The deductions specified in this subsection include the cost of business inputs, wages paid in cash for services in the US, and retirement contributions for employees. The term 'cost of business inputs' refers to the expenses incurred for the business activity. The term 'cost of business inputs' includes amounts paid for property or services used in a business activity, as well as any taxes imposed on such purchases by government entities. It does not cover taxes imposed under chapter 2 or 21. For financial intermediation services, taxable income equals the value of services provided. Exchanges involve fair market value of property or services exchanged plus any money paid. Personal use items not for business are excluded from taxable income. The section discusses the exception for services performed as an employee in a business activity. It also explains the carryover of the credit-equivalent of excess deductions for taxable years. The section discusses the carryover of unused credit for taxable years, allowing excess credits to be applied against the tax for the following year based on the 3-month Treasury rate. The 3-month Treasury rate is determined by the Secretary based on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity of 3 months or less. SEC. 60C. TAX ON NONCASH COMPENSATION PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES NOT ENGAGED IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY. Tax is imposed on excludable compensation provided by an employer to employees, with the employer being liable for the tax. Excludable compensation excludes certain types of remuneration such as wages paid in cash, services performed outside the US, and retirement contributions. The section applies to employees of tax-exempt organizations or government agencies. A clerical amendment is made to the tax code. The Freedom Flat Tax amendments will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
