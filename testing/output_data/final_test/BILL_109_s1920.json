    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Renewable Diesel Standard Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the Renewable Fuel Program requires entities in the petroleum sector to blend renewable fuels into motor vehicle fuel, emphasizing the need for energy diversification. Nearly 140 billion gallons of the gasoline motor pool must contain a renewable fuel. Beginning in 2008, the diesel motor pool must contain at least 1% renewable fuels by volume, excluding the 40 billion gallon diesel motor pool. In 2008, the diesel motor pool must have a minimum of 1% renewable fuels by volume, excluding the 40 billion gallon diesel motor pool. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a Renewable Fuel Program for the Diesel Motor Pool, defining renewable fuel to include various sources such as animal fat, vegetable oil, and thermal depolymerization. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a Renewable Fuel Program for the Diesel Motor Pool, defining renewable fuel to include various sources such as animal fat, vegetable oil, and thermal depolymerization. The Administrator will promulgate regulations to ensure that diesel sold in the US contains the applicable volume of renewable fuel determined in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. The regulations under the Renewable Fuel Program for the Diesel Motor Pool will include compliance provisions for refineries, blenders, distributors, and importers to meet requirements without restricting geographic areas or imposing per-gallon obligations for renewable fuel use. The Renewable Fuel Program for the Diesel Motor Pool sets a .006 percent requirement for renewable fuel in diesel sold to consumers in the US for 2008 if regulations are not promulgated. Applicable volumes for calendar years 2008 through 2015 are determined according to a specified table. The applicable volume of renewable fuel in the diesel motor pool for calendar years 2008 to 2015 ranges from 250 to 2,000 million gallons. For calendar year 2016 and beyond, the volume will be determined by the Administrator. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, will determine the future production of renewable fuels based on a review of their impact on the environment, air quality, energy security, job creation, and rural economic development. This includes assessing the expected annual rate of renewable fuel production for use as a blend component or replacement in the diesel motor pool. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, will determine the future production of renewable fuels based on their impact on the environment, air quality, energy security, job creation, and rural economic development. This involves assessing the expected annual rate of renewable fuel production for use as a blend component or replacement in the diesel motor pool, with specific calculations for the applicable volume in each calendar year. The Energy Information Administration will estimate the volumes of diesel projected to be sold in the United States for each calendar year from 2007 to 2015. The Administrator will determine the applicable percentages based on these estimates. The Administrator will determine and publish the renewable fuel obligation in the Federal Register for each calendar year from 2008 to 2015 to ensure meeting the requirements. The obligation will apply to refineries, blenders, and importers. The renewable fuel obligation for each calendar year will be expressed as a volume percentage of diesel sold in the US and will consist of a single applicable percentage for all categories of persons. Adjustments will be made to prevent redundant obligations. Additionally, a credit program will be established through regulations. The regulations will allow for the generation of credits by those who refine, blend, or import diesel with more renewable fuel than required. These credits can be used or transferred to comply with regulations and are valid for one year. The regulations allow for the generation of credits by those unable to purchase sufficient credits, allowing them to carry forward a credit from a previous year under certain conditions. The Administrator may waive renewable fuel requirements based on harm to the economy or environment, after receiving a petition from one or more States. The Administrator may waive renewable fuel requirements if it would harm the economy or environment of a State, region, or the United States, or if there is an inadequate domestic supply of renewable fuel. Petitions for waivers must be approved or disapproved within 90 days. Waivers terminate one year after they are provided, unless specified otherwise. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may extend a waiver under subparagraph (A) as deemed appropriate. Amendments are made to penalties and enforcement under the Clean Air Act. Technical amendments are also made to the Clean Air Act. Amendments are made to penalties and enforcement under the Clean Air Act, including changes to subsections (i)(4), (k)(10), and (n). Subsections (r) and (s) are redesignated as (s) and (t), with adjustments to subsection (t)(1)."
