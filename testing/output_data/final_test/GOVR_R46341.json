    "content": "The 116th Congress is focused on evaluating federal support for research and development (R&D) activities. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 increased discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense, easing budget constraints on R&D decisions. The U.S. government supports a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D efforts. The federal government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D for national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security. R&D funding is distributed among various agencies with budgets developed internally and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The federal R&D budget is determined by the Office of Management and Budget and included in the President's annual budget submission to Congress. Congress plays a key role in setting R&D priorities and funding levels, with some members expressing concerns about federal spending in light of the deficit. As Congress finalizes the FY2021 appropriations, the main issues are the amount of budget allocated to R&D and how the funding is prioritized and distributed. President Trump's FY2021 budget request includes $142.2 billion for R&D, a decrease of $13.8 billion from FY2020. The report analyzes R&D funding from various perspectives and discusses budget requests of federal departments accounting for 98% of total federal R&D funding. The President's FY2021 R&D request is a 10.6% decrease from FY2020. It includes funding for existing and new programs. The report provides analyses of the request at government-wide, multiagency, and individual agency levels. The impact of COVID-19 on R&D funding and processes is uncertain. Federal R&D funding is examined from various perspectives. The report analyzes R&D funding by agency for FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021. In FY2021, eight federal agencies would receive nearly 98% of total federal R&D funding, with the Department of Defense (DOD) receiving the highest percentage. The report analyzes R&D funding for various federal agencies in FY2021. Most agencies would see a decrease in funding compared to FY2020, with the Department of Veterans Affairs being the only one to receive an increase. The agencies with the largest funding declines in FY2021 are DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and DOT. In the FY2021 request, there are significant declines in R&D funding for various agencies, including DOT (47.6% decrease), EPA (35.4% decrease), DOI (25.5% decrease), DOC (22.7% decrease), and DOE (16.5% decrease. President Trump's FY2021 request includes reduced funding for basic research, applied research, development, and facilities/equipment compared to FY2020 levels. The private sector may underinvest in basic research due to factors such as long time horizons, technical risk, and shareholder demands for short-term returns. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research, funding 42% of U.S. basic research in 2018. Business funded 29% of U.S. basic research. In 2018, business funded 29% of U.S. basic research and 54% of applied research. The federal government accounted for 34% of applied research funding. Business also provided 85% of development funding, while the federal government provided 13%. The President's FY2021 budget proposes funding for various agencies in R&D categories like basic research, applied research, and facilities/equipment. The Department of Health and Human Services, mainly NIH, would receive the most funding for basic research and applied research. The President's FY2021 budget request allocates federal funding for R&D, with DOD as the primary funder for development and DOE for facilities/equipment. Multiagency R&D initiatives like NITRD, NNI, and USGCRP are also highlighted in the budget. The President's FY2021 budget request includes federal funding for R&D, with DOD funding development and DOE funding facilities/equipment. Multiagency R&D initiatives like NITRD, NNI, and USGCRP are mentioned in the budget, with some details on funding levels and activities. The NITRD coordinates federal government investments in unclassified networking and information technology R&D across various areas. It involves 24 federal agencies and over 45 other participating agencies. The efforts are overseen by the NSTC Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology R&D. The director of NITRD is required to prepare an annual report for Congress and the President's budget request. The NITRD program, also known as a budget supplement, provides detailed information on its budget for current, previous, and proposed fiscal years. The latest annual report from September 2019 related to the FY2020 budget request, where President Trump requested $5.506 billion for NITRD research in FY2020. For more information on the program, refer to CRS Report RL33586 by Patricia Moloney Figliola or visit https://www.nitrd.gov. The U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates federal research on global change processes. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) coordinates federal research on global change processes, aiming to advance climate change science and inform human responses through coordinated federal programs. In FY2019, 10 departments and agencies received appropriations for USGCRP participation, with efforts coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Global Change Research. Each agency develops and carries out activities as its contribution to USGCRP, with funds appropriated accordingly. Additionally, there are other federal climate change or global change-related activities with programmatic missions reported separately. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 requires federal agencies to report annually to Congress on their global change research activities and budget allocations. However, budget data required by the GCRA are not included in the President's budget requests after FY2017. Additionally, in the 20 years prior to FY2018, appropriations laws mandated a comprehensive report to be submitted to the appropriations committees detailing all federal activities. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates federal agencies to report annually to Congress on their global change research activities and budget allocations. However, budget data required by the GCRA are no longer included in the President's budget requests after FY2017. In the 20 years prior to FY2018, appropriations laws required a detailed report to be submitted to the appropriations committees outlining all federal agency funding for climate change programs, projects, and activities. Data compiled by CRS from communications with departments and agencies participating in the USGCRP in FY2018 is presented in Table 5, as these are no longer reported by the Office of Management and Budget. Additional information on the USGCRP can be found in CRS Report R43227, Federal Climate Change Funding from FY2008 to FY2014. The National Nanotechnology Initiative, launched in FY2001, is a multiagency R&D initiative aimed at advancing understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act was enacted by Congress in 2003, providing a legislative foundation for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). NNI efforts are coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET). The President's FY2020 budget request included NNI funding for 15 federal departments and agencies dedicated to nanotechnology R&D. The NSET involves various federal departments and agencies responsible for health, safety, environmental regulation, trade, education, intellectual property, international relations, and other areas related to nanotechnology. The NSTC is required to prepare an annual report for Congress as per P.L. 108-153. The NSTC is mandated to provide an annual report to Congress along with the President's budget request, known as a budget supplement, detailing the program's current and proposed budgets, as well as performance data. The latest report, related to the FY2020 budget request, showed a decrease in NNI research funding. For more information on the NNI, refer to CRS Report RL34401 by John F. Sargent Jr. The President's FY2021 budget emphasizes R&D spending in various areas. Additional NNI information can be found at http://www.nano.gov. The President's FY2021 budget prioritizes R&D spending in key areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum information science, 5G/advanced communications, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. There are major increases in QIS and non-defense AI R&D, with a commitment to double Federal AI and QIS R&D investments by 2022. These investments act as innovation multipliers and employment drivers. The American AI Initiative, launched by President Trump in 2019, prioritizes investments in artificial intelligence to drive innovation and create a highly-skilled workforce. AI is transforming various sectors like healthcare, agriculture, transportation, job training, and national defense, enhancing the nation's global competitiveness and security. The FY2021 budget includes a 76% increase in AI R&D funding, with $868 million allocated to the National Science Foundation for AI-related research and the creation of National AI Research Institutes in collaboration with other agencies. Additionally, $100 million is designated for AI and machine learning research in agriculture, and $125 million for DOE's initiatives. The FY2021 budget includes significant funding increases for AI research and development. This includes $125 million for DOE's Office of Science, $50 million for NIH research on chronic diseases using AI, $459 million for DARPA AI R&D, $290 million for DOD's Joint AI Center, and over 50% increase in federal quantum information science funding. This funding also includes $230 million for NSF and $237 million for DOE Office of Science for QIS work. The President's FY2021 budget includes $25 million for DOE Office of Science for quantum internet research, funding for NIST in QIS standards, defense and intelligence community for QIS science and technology, and initial funding for NASA for space-based quantum entanglement experiment. An additional $50 million is allocated for NSF for education and workforce development in AI and QIS, with a focus on community colleges, HBCUs, and MSIs. The budget also highlights investments in national security-related R&D, including over $59 billion for advanced military activities in FY2021. The FY2021 budget includes investments in research and development activities for advanced military capabilities, national security space systems, nuclear deterrent capabilities, and cybersecurity. The Department of Defense's mission is to provide military forces for deterrence and national security. The Department of Homeland Security's R&D budget includes funding for detection and defense against various threats, resilience to disasters, first responder technologies, public safety, and cybersecurity. The Department of Defense primarily funds research, development, test, and evaluation activities to support the nation's military hardware and software. These funds are appropriated in Title IV of the defense appropriations bill and support activities such as R&D, test and evaluation, and health care delivery to DOD personnel and their families. The Defense Health Program (DHP) funds research on various medical conditions and supports health care delivery to DOD personnel and their families. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program aims to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports procurement, operation, maintenance, and research for defense purposes. The Sealift Fund supports procurement, operation, maintenance, and research for defense purposes, including a U.S. flagged merchant fleet. RDT&E funding for this effort is sometimes requested in the Navy's Procurement request and appropriated in Title V of the appropriations bill. RDT&E funds have also been used for Global War on Terror and Overseas Contingency Operations. President Trump's FY2021 budget uses the term Overseas Contingency Operations. The FY2021 OCO request is divided into direct and enduring war, and OCO for base requirements. OCO/GWOT-related requests have included funds for transfer funds like the Iraqi Freedom Fund, Iraqi Security Forces Fund, Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each fund and authorizes transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E. The Trump Administration is requesting $106.555 for FY2021. The Trump Administration is requesting $106.555 billion for DOD's Title IV RDT&E PEs for FY2021, with additional funding for RDT&E through various programs and agencies. Funding for RDT&E can be analyzed organizationally, with each military department and DOD agency receiving its own funding. RDT&E funding within DOD is allocated to various agencies and programs, categorized by budget activities such as basic research, applied research, and technology development. Different budget activities focus on specific areas like weapon system development, management support, and system improvements. Budget activity 6.8 was introduced in the FY2021 budget. The FY2021 budget includes Budget Activity 6.8 to support software and digital technology pilot programs. Congressional policymakers are interested in DOD S&T program funding for developing new technologies. Adequate support for S&T activities is crucial for U.S. military superiority. The FY2021 request for Title IV S&T funding is $14.070 billion, $1.991 billion below FY2020. Basic research (6.1) receives attention, with over half of DOD's basic research budget spent at universities. The Trump Administration is requesting $2.319 billion for DOD basic research. The Trump Administration is requesting $2.319 billion for DOD basic research for FY2021, $284.2 million below the FY2020 enacted level. DOD is a significant source of federal funds for university R&D in various engineering fields. HHS focuses on research and development to enhance health and well-being. The HHS section discusses research and development funded through NIH, which accounts for most of HHS R&D funding. Other HHS agencies supporting R&D include CDC, CMS, FDA, AHRQ, HRSA, and ACF. NIH is the primary federal agency for biomedical and behavioral research, training researchers, and disseminating health information with a mission to enhance health and reduce illness. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary federal agency for biomedical and behavioral research, with a mission to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The agency consists of the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and 27 institutes and centers (ICs) that manage their own research programs. Approximately 10% of the NIH budget supports intramural research projects conducted by nearly 6,000 NIH federal scientists. The majority of NIH's budget goes to the extramural research community. The majority of NIH's budget goes to extramural research, supporting over 300,000 nonfederal scientists at various institutions. Funding primarily comes from the LHHS appropriations act, with additional funding from the Interior/Environment appropriations act. Mandatory funding of $150 million annually for type 1 diabetes research was provided until FY2019, with a temporary extension for FY2020. No new funding will be available for this program after May 22, 2020. The LHHS appropriations act provides funding for NIH's extramural research, with additional funding from the Interior/Environment appropriations act. Funding for type 1 diabetes research was mandated until FY2019, with a temporary extension for FY2020. No new funding will be available for this program after May 22, 2020. Funding redistribution under the \"PHS Evaluation Tap\" transfer authority allows for the redistribution of appropriations for program evaluation purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. President Trump's FY2021 budget request would provide NIH with $38.694 billion, a decrease of $2.992 billion from FY2020. The proposed budget includes funding from various sources, with all existing IC accounts receiving a decrease compared to FY2020 levels. The FY2021 budget proposes an increase in LHHS budget authority for the Innovation Account to $300 million. It also suggests consolidating AHRQ into NIH to create a new institute, NISRQ, with a total appropriation of $355.1 million. This would require amendments to the PHSA due to the current limit of 27 institutes. The FY2021 budget proposes specific funding levels for programs and activities within and across the NIH accounts based on the Administration's research priorities, including funding for opioid and methamphetamine epidemic, childhood cancer data initiative, influenza research, and tick-borne diseases research. If adopted, these funding levels would likely be specified in report and/or explanatory statement language accompanying LHHS appropriations bills. The Department of Energy, established in 1977, conducts basic scientific research in various fields, including nuclear physics and environmental sciences. It also focuses on energy production, nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and defense nuclear reactors through its 17 national laboratories. The Administration's FY2021 budget request for the Department of Energy includes about $13.853 billion for R&D and related activities, a 19.1% decrease from FY2020. Funding for the DOE Office of Science would decrease by 16.6%, with reductions in major research programs, particularly in Basic Energy Sciences.

The Administration is requesting $83.6 million for Smith-Lever 3(d) programs in FY2021, a 4.8% reduction from FY2020. $69.0 million would support the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), and $3.0 million would support the Federally-Recognized Tribes Extension Program. The National Agricultural Statistics Service conducts the Census of Agriculture and provides official statistics on agricultural production. For FY2021, the Administration is requesting $177.5 million for NASS, with up to $46.3 million to support the Census of Agriculture. The Administration's FY2021 budget request includes increases for some programs and reductions for others, such as the Acreage, Crop Production, and Grain Stocks program and the Chemical Use Program. The Economic Research Service supports analysis on agriculture, rural development, and collects data on USDA programs. The Administration's FY2021 budget request for the Economic Research Service includes a 26.7% decrease in funding, attributing the reduction to discontinuing research on various agricultural policies and initiatives. This includes cutting research on farm, conservation, trade policy, energy sources, food markets, beginning farmers, and more. The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) at USDA, established in 2008, coordinates research programs across the department. It is funded through interagency agreements and has a separate budget request of $6 million and 29 staff years in FY2021. Additionally, the Department of Commerce houses major R&D programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness through measurement science, standards, and technology. NIST's research supports U.S. commerce, technological progress, product reliability, and public safety. The President is requesting $737.5 million for NIST in FY2021, a decrease of $296.5 million (28.7%). The President is requesting $737.5 million for NIST in FY2021, a decrease of $296.5 million from the FY2020 enacted appropriation. NIST's discretionary funding is provided through three accounts: STRS, ITS, and CRF. The FY2021 request includes $652 million for R&D, standards coordination, and related services in the STRS account, a decrease of $102.0 million from the FY2020 enacted level. The reductions are necessary to address the President's priorities for Industries of the Future. NIST will have significant reductions in R&D and program portfolio impacting work in advanced materials, physical infrastructure, and resilience. The budget proposes a $115.5 million reduction in funding for NIST laboratory programs, leading to the elimination of 391 employees. Funding reductions are proposed in areas such as Advanced Manufacturing and Material Measurements, and Fundamental Measurement, Quantum Science, and Measurement Dissemination. NIST will discontinue several measurement service and dissemination activities, with significant reductions in funding for various programs. This includes cuts in Advanced Communications, Networks, and Scientific Data Systems, Health and Biological Systems Measurements, Physical Infrastructure and Resilience, and NIST User Facilities. However, NIST is requesting funds for its Measurement Tools and Testbeds to Power the Industries of the Future efforts, focusing on artificial intelligence and 5G standards. The FY2021 request for the ITS account includes funding for artificial intelligence, 5G standards development, and Position, Navigation, and Timing profiles. The total amount requested is $25.3 million, a significant decrease from the previous year. Funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program would be eliminated, requiring MEP centers to become self-supporting. President Trump has previously proposed ending federal funding for MEP. The President's FY2021 budget request includes $35.3 million for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, with $11.2 million for NIIMBL, $9.1 million for a second institute, and $5.0 million for network coordination. Additionally, $60.2 million is requested for the NIST CRF account, a decrease of $57.8 million from FY2020. This decrease is partly due to deferral of projects to FY2022 and changes in funding approach for NIST Building 1 in Boulder, CO. The proposed new funding approach for the renovation of NIST Building 1 in Boulder, CO involves the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which conducts scientific research in various areas such as ecosystems, atmosphere, global climate change, weather, and oceans. NOAA was established in 1970 to unify environmental programs and protect the environment. NOAA's administrative structure consists of six line offices: NOS, NMFS, NESDIS, NWS, OAR, and OMAO. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consists of six line offices supported by Mission Support. Congress funds NOAA through two accounts for operations and procurement. NOAA's strategic plan focuses on climate adaptation, weather readiness, healthy oceans, and resilient coastal communities. The plan includes goals for stakeholder engagement, data and observations, and environmental modeling, guiding NOAA's R&D efforts. The recent R&D plan for NOAA, published in 2013, outlines objectives and targets to track progress. A draft 2020-2026 R&D plan was released in June 2019, focusing on reducing societal impacts from severe weather, sustainable use of ocean resources, and enhancing research effectiveness. President Trump's FY2021 budget request for NOAA R&D funding is $670.3 million, a decrease from the previous year. The President's FY2021 request for NOAA R&D was 14.5% of the total FY2021 NOAA requested amount of $4.634 billion. The FY2021 request includes $378.6 million for research, $94.9 million for development, and $197.0 million for R&D equipment and facilities. OAR accounts for the majority of NOAA R&D, with a requested $352.7 million in FY2021 for research in weather, air chemistry, climate, and oceans. The President requested $167.6 million for OAR labs and cooperative institutes in FY2021, a decrease from the FY2020 enacted amount. The Administration also proposed to terminate federal support for the National Sea Grant College Program and Marine Aquaculture Research program in FY2021. Congress provided funding for these programs in FY2020. The Department of Veterans Affairs is proposing $1.456 billion for VA R&D in FY2021, with priorities including increasing access to clinical trials, translating research, and utilizing VA data for veterans. Crosscutting priorities involve addressing issues like suicide risk, chronic pain, opioid addiction, PTSD, traumatic brain injury, precision oncology, and Gulf War illness. The FY2021 VA R&D funding proposal includes $787 million for the Medical and Prosthetic Research account, a decrease of $37 million compared to FY2020, and $669 million for research supported by the Medical Care Support account, an increase of $21 million compared to FY2020. Funding levels are uncertain until appropriations legislation is passed. The Medical Care Support account received a $21 million increase in FY2021, providing administrative and support for VA researchers and R&D projects. The VA R&D program aims to improve Veterans' health through various research services conducted at VA Medical Centers nationwide. Clinical Science R&D supports clinical trials for new treatments, Health Services R&D improves VA health system quality, and Rehabilitation R&D focuses on enhancing veterans' quality of life. VA researchers can also secure funding from external sources. Additional R&D resources are estimated at $540 million in FY2021. The VA's FY2021 budget request includes $540 million for additional R&D resources. Unlike other federal agencies, the VA does not have the authority to provide research grants to non-VA entities. Funding for VA R&D is detailed in tables showing amounts for Medical and Prosthetic Research, Medical Care Support, and Designated Research Areas. The Department of Transportation was established in 1966. The Department of Transportation (DOT) was established in 1966 with the primary purposes of improving mobility, reducing congestion, promoting safety, and preserving the environment. Funding for DOT R&D activities is included in appropriations line items, with a request of $593.8 million for FY2021. The Administration is requesting $593.8 million for DOT R&D activities and facilities at various agencies. Funding for FHWA, FTA, and FMCSA is not requested due to the need for surface transportation reauthorization legislation. In FY2020, FAA, NHTSA, and FHWA received 90% of DOT R&D funding. The President's FY2021 request for FAA R&D activities is $446.9 million, a decrease of $86 million from FY2020. The President's FY2021 budget request includes $170 million for the agency's Research, Engineering, and Development account, a reduction of $22.7 million from FY2020. NHTSA is requesting $62.9 million for R&D funding, focusing on automation, vehicle safety technology, crashworthiness, and alternative fuels. The President's FY2021 budget request includes funding for DOT R&D activities and facilities for various agencies, such as the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Office of the Secretary. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has responsibilities for conserving natural resources, providing scientific information, and upholding trust responsibilities to indigenous communities. The DOI has various responsibilities including mapping, geological, hydrological, and biological science, wildlife conservation, and historic preservation. The Administration is requesting $12.8 billion in funding for DOI in FY2021, with $725 million proposed for R&D, a decrease from the previous year. The U.S. Geological Survey conducts basic research within DOI. Funding for DOI R&D is often included in appropriations with non-R&D activities, making it unclear how much is specifically allocated to R&D. The President's FY2021 request for DOI components includes R&D funding allocations for various agencies, with no increases in funding for most agencies compared to FY2020. Bureau of Reclamation would receive $76 million, down $39 million (34%), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management $93 million, down $7 million (7%), Fish and Wildlife Service $15 million, National Park Service $26 million, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement $25 million, Bureau of Land Management $21 million, Bureau of Indian Affairs $5 million, and no funding requested for Wildland Fire Management for FY2021. The FY2020 estimate for Wildland Fire Management (WFM) shows no funding requested for R&D in FY2021. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) is allocated $1 million for FY2021, matching the FY2020 estimate. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified five core missions, and new technology from research and development can help achieve these goals. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is responsible for coordinating DHS R&D activities. Other components like the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, U.S. Coast Guard, and Transportation Security Administration also conduct R&D. The President's FY2021 budget request for DHS includes $439 million for R&D activities, a 19.6% reduction from FY2020. The S&T Directorate, responsible for coordinating DHS R&D, would receive $340 million, a 19.5% decrease from FY2020. R&D is conducted in various laboratories and funded by DOE national laboratories, industry, and universities to support acquisitions by other DHS components. The S&T Directorate's Research, Development, and Innovation budget would decrease, with varying amounts for different areas. Funding for university centers of excellence would also decrease. The total request for the directorate is $644 million, a 12.7% decrease from FY2020. The directorate's Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account would receive $19 million for closure of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The request for R&D in the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office is $58 million, down from $69 million in FY2019. No funding is requested for the National Technical Nuclear Forensics program ($7 million in FY2020), which the Administration is proposing to transfer to the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds R&D activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control laws. The EPA allocates funding for R&D activities through its Science and Technology appropriations account, which includes research conducted by the agency and external entities receiving grants. The exact amount of funding for EPA R&D alone is not specified in annual appropriations bills. The Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund) account funds research on more effective methods for remediating contaminated sites. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) manages R&D activities at EPA headquarters and laboratories, as well as external R&D. The FY2021 budget request proposes reductions and eliminations of funding for EPA programs and activities, totaling $6.66 billion, which is $2.40 billion less than the FY2020 enacted appropriations. The President's FY2021 budget request proposes reductions in funding for EPA programs and activities, totaling $6.66 billion, which is $2.40 billion less than the FY2020 enacted appropriations. The proposed reductions are distributed across EPA operational functions, grants for states, tribes, and local governments, with some program areas seeing constant or increased funding. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the proposed cuts to EPA scientific research programs. The President's FY2021 budget request proposes $503.8 million for EPA's S&T account, a $243.4 million decrease from the FY2020 enacted appropriations. This includes a $19.1 million transfer from the Superfund account. The FY2021 request represents a 4.8% increase compared to the FY2020 request of $480.8 million. The FY2021 budget request proposes $503.8 million for EPA's S&T account, a $243.4 million decrease from FY2020 enacted appropriations. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports have not specified funding for all subprogram areas reported in EPA's budget justifications. Some S&T subprogram areas are noted as \"NR\" (not reported). The President's budget requests have modified program area titles, generally adopted by the Appropriations Committees. The FY2021 budget request for EPA's S&T account proposes reductions in funding for various program areas and activities, with some line-item activities facing complete elimination. Program areas like Atmospheric Protection, Indoor Air Radon, and Reduce Risks from Indoor Air are affected, along with proposed reductions in funding for Research in different areas. The FY2021 budget request for EPA's S&T account proposes reductions in funding for various program areas and activities, including the proposed elimination of funding for the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program. The President's FY2021 budget request did not include funding for Research: National Priorities, continuing a trend from previous years. Congressional committee hearings have debated the size and structure of the EPA's workforce, with \"workforce reshaping\" being a topic of discussion since the FY2018 request. The FY2021 budget request for EPA's S&T account includes reductions in funding and workforce reshaping, with a proposed decrease in full-time-equivalents from 14,172.0 FTEs in FY2020 to 12,610.2 FTEs in FY2021. Funding for EPA workforce reshaping was not included in the FY2020 request or the FY2021 request."
