    "content": "The United States is party to Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) that establish the framework for U.S. military personnel operating in foreign countries. These agreements address jurisdiction over U.S. personnel, with some allowing shared jurisdiction with the host country. SOFAs do not authorize specific exercises or missions and are not mutual defense or security agreements. SOFAs are peacetime agreements that do not address rules of war or the Laws of Armed Conflict. They do not affect parties' right of self-defense and become inapplicable during armed conflict. The US has over 100 SOFAs, and terms from SOFAs may be included in other agreements with partner countries. SOFAs can be amended or canceled as contracts. A Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) is a peacetime agreement specific to individual countries, typically in the form of an executive agreement. The Department of State and Department of Defense negotiate the terms, with the NATO SOFA being the only one concluded as part of a treaty. The Senate ratified the NATO SOFA in 1970 with reservations regarding the US's right to safeguard its security. The Senate reservations to the NATO SOFA include four conditions related to criminal jurisdiction and procedural safeguards for U.S. servicemembers in receiving states. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement that applies to member countries of NATO. 26 countries, including the United States, have ratified or acceded to the agreement. Another 24 countries are subject to the NATO SOFA through the NATO Partnership for Peace program. This program involves bilateral cooperation to enhance stability and security. Through the NATO SOFA and Partnership for Peace, the United States has a common SOFA with approximately 58 countries. The United States has agreements in more than 115 countries around the world, with the NATO SOFA and NATO PfP SOFA accounting for roughly half of them. Department of Defense Directive 5525.1 outlines policies to protect the rights of U.S. personnel subject to foreign jurisdiction. Reservations to the NATO SOFA apply only to NATO member countries, but similar reservations will be applied to future SOFAs. The United States has agreements in over 115 countries, with the NATO SOFA and NATO PfP SOFA making up about half of them. Department of Defense Directive 5525.1 outlines policies to protect U.S. personnel under foreign jurisdiction. SOFAs can vary in length and content, covering areas such as criminal jurisdiction, wearing of uniforms, taxes, and customs regulations. Examples range from one-page agreements for specific activities to over 200-page agreements. The agreement with Botswana, similar to the one with Bangladesh, covers exercises, training, humanitarian assistance, and other activities agreed upon by both governments. It addresses legal protection for U.S. personnel in foreign countries, determining criminal and civil jurisdiction. The United States has various agreements with different jurisdictions, some granting exclusive jurisdiction. The United States has agreements with different countries regarding jurisdiction over U.S. personnel. These agreements can result in exclusive or shared jurisdiction, allowing the U.S. to exercise criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction. This jurisdiction may extend beyond military installations, providing immunity from the laws of the host country. The United States has agreements with countries for military exchanges, granting criminal jurisdiction to U.S. personnel in the host country. The agreement with Mongolia allows U.S. military authorities to handle criminal offenses committed by U.S. personnel in Mongolia, with the option for Mongolia to request waiver of jurisdiction for non-official criminal behavior. The NATO SOFA allows for shared jurisdiction among member countries, with each country having exclusive jurisdiction in specific circumstances. Requests for waiver of jurisdiction are considered sympathetically, but not required. Concurrent jurisdiction applies when offenses violate the laws of both countries. The United States has entered numerous SOFAs with basic rules for determining jurisdiction, often treating U.S. personnel as administrative and technical staff with immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. SOFAs grant immunity from criminal jurisdiction to U.S. personnel in the receiving country, without authorizing specific military operations. The right of self-defense is always preserved, and the agreement specifies the scope of applicability, such as military exercises, training, and security assistance programs in Belize. The SOFA agreements with Belize provide legal protections for U.S. personnel, addressing administrative and operational matters such as wearing uniforms, carrying weapons, and customs regulations. It establishes the legal framework for day-to-day operations of U.S. personnel in Belize. A SOFA is a bilateral agreement that provides the legal framework for U.S. personnel operating in a foreign country. The United States has agreements with foreign nations related to security commitments, which can include collective defense, consultation requirements, and the legal right to military intervention. A SOFA is a bilateral agreement that provides the legal framework for U.S. personnel operating in a foreign country, often included in comprehensive security arrangements with other military agreements. The United States has such agreements with countries like Afghanistan, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. Operation Enduring Freedom was initiated by the United States to combat Al Qaeda and oust the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Following the regime change, security agreements were established with the new Afghan government, including economic grants and defense assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 aims to support the economic development and security of countries worldwide. It provides assistance for long-term stability and peace, including military aid to friendly nations and international organizations. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the President to provide military assistance to friendly countries or international organizations to strengthen US security and promote world peace. This includes defense articles, services, and funds, with limitations on combat duties for US Armed Forces personnel. Agreements exist for the presence of US Department of Defense personnel in Afghanistan for various cooperative efforts. The agreement allows U.S. personnel in Afghanistan immunity from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities and criminal jurisdiction over them is granted to the U.S. government. The Afghan government cannot surrender U.S. personnel without U.S. consent. The agreement between the United States and Afghanistan grants immunity to U.S. personnel from Afghan prosecution. The Afghan government assumed responsibility for legal obligations, but the agreement does not provide immunity for contract personnel. Military operations in Afghanistan are ongoing, authorized by Congress in 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks. The U.N. Security Council authorized the deployment of ISAF to Afghanistan following the attacks. The U.N. Security Council authorized the deployment of ISAF to Afghanistan, working closely with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Security Council resolutions recognize the legitimacy of OEF's operations in addressing security threats in Afghanistan. In 2004, the United States and Afghanistan entered an agreement granting immunity to U.S. personnel from Afghan prosecution. In 2004, the United States and Afghanistan signed an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) allowing logistic support to foreign militaries. The agreement can be made with NATO countries, UN organizations, or other countries if it benefits US national security. President Hamid Karzai and President Bush issued a \"joint declaration\" on May 23, 2005, outlining a future agreement between the United States and Afghanistan. The agreement envisions a role for U.S. military troops in Afghanistan to assist in organizing, training, and equipping Afghan security forces until Afghanistan can sustain its own capacity. It also includes consultation on appropriate measures in case of perceived threats to Afghanistan's territorial integrity, independence, or security. The United States and Afghanistan have discussed the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the possibility of a status of forces agreement. President Karzai called for formal SOFAs with foreign countries after civilian casualties from U.S. airstrikes in 2008. The Obama Administration committed to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan, planning to transfer security responsibility to the Afghan government by 2014. It is unclear if formal negotiations for an updated SOFA have begun. The United States and Afghanistan have discussed the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the possibility of a status of forces agreement. In 2011, Representative Lynn Woolsey introduced the United States-Afghanistan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) Act, requiring a bilateral agreement stating the temporary presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and their withdrawal within one year. In 1951, the United States and Germany entered into an agreement related to the Mutual Security Act before Germany joined NATO in 1955. Germany joined NATO in 1955 and signed an agreement with the United States for mutual defense assistance. This agreement included implementing the NATO SOFA of 1953 and additional supplemental agreements specific to the U.S.-Germany relationship. The agreements cover the day-to-day operations of U.S. forces and personnel in Germany. In 1952, the United States and Japan also concluded a security treaty and an administrative agreement. In 1957, a member of the U.S. Army was indicted in Japan for the death of a Japanese civilian. The U.S. claimed it was in the line of duty, but Japan disagreed. After negotiations, the U.S. agreed to hand over the member to Japanese authorities. In 1957, a U.S. Army member indicted in Japan sought habeas corpus in the U.S. to avoid trial in Japanese Courts. The U.S. appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled on jurisdictional provisions in the administrative agreement regarding criminal offenses. The Court held that a sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction unless it consents to surrender it. The Supreme Court ruled that a sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction over its border unless it consents to surrender it. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, concluded in 1960, contained provisions for jurisdictional matters. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, established in 1960 and amended in 1990, grants the US the use of facilities in Japan for security purposes. A separate agreement, known as the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), governs the use of facilities and the status of US forces in Japan. This agreement has been modified multiple times since its inception. In 1954, the US and South Korea signed a mutual defense treaty granting the US the right to station forces in South Korea. This treaty led to a SOFA agreement in 1966, later amended in 2001. In 1968, a legal case questioned the US authorities' jurisdiction under the SOFA agreement. The servicemember argued that the SOFA agreement did not give the US legitimate authority to release him to South Korea for trial on charges of murder and arson. He claimed that US domestic law requires Senate approval for international agreements regarding foreign jurisdiction over US forces stationed abroad, but the court found Senate approval unnecessary as the US did not waive jurisdiction over offenses committed within its own territory. The court held that the primary jurisdiction for trying servicemen abroad lies with the nation where the crime was committed, unless the foreign nation waives its jurisdiction. In 1947, the US and the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement. The US and the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement in 1947 for a term of five years, extended in 1953. A mutual defense treaty was signed in 1951, followed by a SOFA in 1993. The US and the Philippines entered into a military assistance agreement in 1947, extended in 1953. A mutual defense treaty was signed in 1951, followed by a SOFA in 1993. This SOFA agreement was extended multiple times and amended in 2006. Another agreement was made regarding the treatment of Republic of Philippines personnel visiting the United States, addressing criminal jurisdiction. The agreement between the US and the Philippines requires Senate ratification due to its impact on US jurisdiction. Unlike other SOFAs, it does not fully waive US jurisdiction over offenses on US territory. US authorities can request waiver of jurisdiction in favor of Philippine authorities, but retain the ability to exercise jurisdiction if US interests require it. Military operations in Iraq were conducted by the US between March 2003 and August 2010. In August 2010, the US engaged in military operations in Iraq to combat threats to stability and support the post-Saddam government. A Declaration of Principles signed in late 2007 aimed to establish a long-term relationship between the US and Iraq, replacing the UN mandate that ended in 2008. The parties pledged to work towards this goal. The Declaration of Principles signed in late 2007 aimed to establish agreements between the US and Iraq in political, cultural, economic, and security spheres by July 31, 2008. It included intentions to negotiate a security agreement to support Iraqi Security Forces, fight terrorism, and provide security assurances to deter external aggression. This announcement sparked congressional interest due to statements by the Bush Administration. In late 2007, the Declaration of Principles aimed to establish agreements between the US and Iraq in various spheres, including a security agreement. This sparked congressional interest, leading to hearings and the passing of acts limiting funds for agreements subjecting US Armed Forces to Iraqi jurisdiction. After congressional interest sparked by the Declaration of Principles in late 2007, negotiations led to the signing of the Strategic Framework Agreement and the Agreement on the Withdrawal of US Forces from Iraq in November 2008. These agreements addressed security assurances, basing rights, and the status of US forces in Iraq. Several legislative proposals were introduced to require Senate approval or statutory authorization for such agreements. The agreements signed in November 2008 between the US and Iraq require the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq by December 31, 2011. The Strategic Framework Agreement covers various fields of cooperation, including security, economic, and cultural matters. The Security Agreement between the US and Iraq mandates the withdrawal of US forces by December 31, 2011. It prohibits the US from using Iraqi territory for attacks on other countries or seeking permanent military bases in Iraq. The agreement is legally binding and includes provisions similar to Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) regularly concluded by the US. The Security Agreement between the US and Iraq includes provisions on civil and criminal jurisdiction over US forces, rules on carrying weapons and wearing uniforms, approval for combat operations, and coordination with Iraqi authorities. It also allows for strategic deliberations between the parties. The Security Agreement between the US and Iraq allows for strategic deliberations in the event of threats, with the US taking appropriate measures to deter them. The agreements entered into force in 2009 without Senate approval, leading to controversy over the Executive's authority to enter into such agreements without Congress. The Security Agreement between the US and Iraq, which allows for military action in defense of Iraq, may require congressional authorization to be legally binding. However, Congress has already authorized the President to engage in military operations in Iraq, implying approval for short-term agreements with Iraq. The US withdrew its last major combat unit from Iraq on August 31, 2010. The U.S. Army's 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division completed its withdrawal from Iraq, allowing for Operation New Dawn to focus on advising and training Iraqi Security Forces. By December 18, 2011, the U.S. had fully withdrawn its forces, transferring security responsibility to the Iraqi government. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement applicable to member countries, with 26 countries included as of June 2007. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement applicable to member countries, with 26 countries included as of June 2007. It is the only SOFA concluded as part of a treaty, with 24 non-NATO countries subject to it through the NATO Partnership for Peace program. The program aims to increase stability and build security relationships through bilateral cooperation. The United States has ratified SOFAs with other countries under treaty authority. The United States has entered into Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) with various countries, including Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, under the authority of previously concluded treaties. These agreements establish the status of U.S. forces in these countries and outline general obligations. The United States has entered into military assistance agreements with Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras, citing obligations under the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty). These agreements address the status of U.S. personnel in each country and were later expanded upon with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs). Congress also approved compacts changing the status of the Marshall Islands. In 1941, the United States entered into an agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the lease of naval and air bases in various locations. The agreement included provisions for the status of U.S. personnel in the leased locations, serving a similar purpose to a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The United States and the United Kingdom signed lease agreements in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s with status protection provisions. SOFAs are entered into to support specific activities or exercises, with language limiting the scope to the activity. These agreements are sole executive agreements, not based on treaties or congressional action. For example, the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) was a training program introduced in 1997, with SOFAs signed with African countries specifically for the ACRI. The SOFAs entered into with African countries were initially for the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) activities. However, the agreements also allowed for other activities as agreed upon by the countries, ensuring their validity even if the ACRI no longer exists. Some SOFAs were broad in scope, applying to U.S. personnel either \"present\" or \"temporarily present\" in a country, with language framing the scope of activities. The SOFAs with African countries were initially for ACRI activities but also allowed for other agreed-upon activities. Some SOFAs were broad in scope, covering U.S. personnel \"present\" or \"temporarily present\" with language framing the activities."
