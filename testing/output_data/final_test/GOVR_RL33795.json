    "content": "Avian influenza (AI) viruses exist worldwide in various strains, infecting both wild and domestic birds, and sometimes animals and humans. This report focuses on the impact of avian flu on agriculture and wild birds, particularly highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu. Avian flu can be low pathogenic (LPAI) causing mild illness, or highly pathogenic (HPAI) which is extremely contagious with high mortality rates. Pathogenicity is determined through genetic sequencing and monitoring mortality in healthy chicks. Mortality rates for HPAI can range from 30%-100%, while LPAI is usually less than 20%. Strains are designated by letters H and N, referring to surface proteins on the virus. The strain designations for avian influenza viruses are based on surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 16 H subtypes and nine N subtypes, resulting in 144 possible strains. Some strains, particularly H5 and H7, can mutate from low pathogenicity (LPAI) to highly pathogenic (HPAI). Low pathogenicity outbreaks in poultry are common, with recent cases of H7N2 in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey, and H2N2 in Pennsylvania in 2004. In the United States, there have been recent outbreaks of avian influenza strains H7N2 in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey, as well as low pathogenicity H2N2 in Pennsylvania. Additionally, an H5N2 strain was found in Texas in 2004, classified as highly pathogenic genetically but not causing high mortality. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread globally since 2003, affecting poultry and wild birds primarily, with limited human cases through close contact with infected birds. No current outbreaks of avian flu are reported in domestic poultry in the US. The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu has not reached North America in wild birds, poultry, or humans. Surveillance of wild and migratory birds is increased by the USDA and DOI, particularly in Alaska where migration routes could spread the virus from Asia. Concerns about the virus spreading through North American flyways were high in 2006 and may return in 2007 as H5N1 continues to circulate in Asia. In 2007, the possibility of highly pathogenic H5N1 returning to North America remains due to its circulation in Asia. Over 107,000 samples have been collected from wild birds since April 2006, with 19% from Alaska and the rest from the lower 48 States. While no highly pathogenic H5N1 has been found in North America, low pathogenicity strains have been detected, such as in two wild mute swans in Michigan in August 2006. These strains do not pose a threat to poultry or humans and were already known to exist in North America. Preliminary testing of birds can show positive results for H5N1 due to various reasons. The presence of H5 and N1 strains of avian influenza can result in a positive test, requiring further testing to confirm the presence of the H5N1 viral type. Low pathogenicity H5N1 strains are common in North American wild bird populations and do not pose a human health risk. Highly pathogenic H5N1 has not been reported in the Americas, with all cases found so far being low pathogenicity. The first official report of H5N1 in humans was in 1997 in Hong Kong. The H5N1 outbreak in humans began in 1997 in Hong Kong, transmitted from domestic poultry. It was contained initially but re-emerged later. Since 2003, multiple Asian countries have reported outbreaks in poultry. The virus spread to wild birds in China in 2005 and then to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in subsequent years. The outbreak has caused significant international responses and economic impacts. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that over 250 million poultry have died or been culled internationally due to the avian flu outbreak. Some countries hesitated to acknowledge the disease for economic reasons, while others lacked compensation for affected farmers, discouraging early reporting of outbreaks. Wild birds are the primary reservoir for Influenza A viruses, with transmission occurring through fecal material. The H5N1 strain appeared in Qinghai province, China in May 2005, posing a significant risk to wild bird populations. Avian influenza outbreak in Qinghai province, China in May 2005 posed a significant risk to wild bird populations. Highly migratory species are at greatest risk due to crowded conditions facilitating disease transmission. HPAI outbreak could harm bird populations already threatened by habitat loss or excessive harvests. Domestic poultry can be infected by contact with wild birds and their excretions, as avian flu is highly contagious in crowded conditions. Avian flu is spread in poultry through contact with infected feces, nasal, or eye excretions. The virus can be shed from live poultry for up to 21 days. Strict biosecurity measures are adopted by U.S. commercial poultry farms to prevent the spread of avian flu and other infections. Avian flu viruses have been common in live bird markets, but outbreaks concern commercial growers who practice tighter biosecurity. USDA has focused on these markets. The USDA has focused on live bird markets due to insufficient biosecurity, allowing birds and equipment to intermingle and spread disease. States with live bird markets include New York, New Jersey, and Texas. In Asia, a larger network of live bird markets and backyard farms has made eradication difficult. Transportation of roosters for cockfighting is a suspected route of disease transmission. Pathogens can spread across borders naturally, accidentally, or intentionally. The ability of H5N1 to spread via migratory birds has been a topic of discussion. The USDA has implemented measures to prevent the entry of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza into the United States, including blocking imports of poultry products from affected countries and increasing smuggling interdiction efforts. These viruses are considered a select agent under bioterrorism rules and are subject to restrictions for possession, use, and transportation. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service determines import restrictions and issues health regulations. APHIS enforces import restrictions on live animals and animal products, employing smuggling interdiction units internationally. DHS Customs and Border Protection inspects passengers, cargo, and conveyances at ports of entry. Some believe poultry imports in Central and South America pose a greater risk for the spread of avian influenza into the Western Hemisphere. Officials are concerned about the potential spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu into the United States. The virus can infect humans through close contact with poultry, leading to severe effects such as viral pneumonia and organ failure. Fatality rates are high, with over 55% of infected individuals dying. There is worry that the virus could mutate and allow for efficient human-to-human transmission, potentially causing a pandemic. If H5N1 is found in the Americas, it could signal a significant threat. The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu virus, if found in the Americas, does not indicate an immediate global human pandemic as it has not yet mutated for human-to-human transmission. Properly cooked poultry is safe as the virus is killed at conventional cooking temperatures. However, the virus can spread through contaminated raw poultry, emphasizing the importance of following standard food safety practices recommended by the CDC and USDA. In the United States, poultry production is mainly done in large-scale commercial farms with strict veterinary control to prevent diseases like Salmonella and E. coli. Infected poultry are rarely in the food chain due to avian flu testing programs. Backyard flocks and live bird markets have less inspection but make up less than 1% of poultry consumption. Avian flu in poultry is controlled through prevention and eradication measures. In the United States, avian flu in poultry is controlled through prevention and eradication by farmers, industry associations, and government agencies. Internationally, FAO and WHO have a joint response plan for the current outbreak, aiming to prevent a human pandemic by swiftly controlling the virus in poultry. OIE updated its reporting standards for avian flu in 2006 to include all strains, not just highly pathogenic ones. The USDA updated reporting standards for avian flu in 2006 to include low pathogenicity strains of H5 and H7. Biosecurity practices, such as preventing contact between wild birds and poultry, are crucial for preventing outbreaks. Small farms without biosecurity measures have posed challenges for disease control. Biosecurity practices and surveillance are crucial for preventing avian flu outbreaks. In 2006, APHIS issued new regulations for controlling low pathogenicity H5 and H7 avian influenza in poultry, with incentives for participation in surveillance programs. Diagnostic surveillance of live poultry and state-level response plans are key components of the regulations. Active surveillance of slaughtering plants for poultry and egg-laying flocks is essential. While vaccination can be used, it is not always considered a sufficient control method due to trade implications and potential virus spread if not administered correctly. Vaccination is more likely to be used for breeding poultry and higher value birds in the United States. In September 2006, USDA's National Veterinary Stockpile had 110 million doses of avian influenza vaccine available for poultry, with plans to acquire up to 500 million doses. The most common method of control in an outbreak is to establish quarantines, restrict movement, and cull infected flocks. Buildings and equipment are rigorously disinfected following depopulation. After depopulation, buildings and equipment are disinfected before new birds are introduced. The virus can be killed by disinfectants or heat. Carcass disposal options include composting, burial, incineration, or rendering. Affected flocks may be marketed under strict conditions after waiting periods and testing. The USDA conducts confirmatory tests on the virus. Restrictions on U.S. exports are limited to affected areas, and lifted once the outbreak is eradicated. USDA works to lift restrictions on exports once outbreaks are eradicated. States lead depopulation and quarantines during domestic outbreaks, with support from APHIS. APHIS provides equipment and personnel to supplement state resources. In highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks, APHIS may take a larger role and has a response plan in place. Compensation programs are in place to encourage reporting and cooperation with control programs. USDA provides indemnification for avian flu outbreaks, with 100% compensation for highly pathogenic cases. States manage indemnification for low pathogenicity outbreaks, with some industry associations offering compensation funds. USDA's program pays up to 100% indemnity for market value, destruction, and disposal of poultry, as well as cleaning and disinfection. Participation in federal and state surveillance plans is required for full compensation, with small growers eligible for 100% compensation. The compensation rate for avian flu outbreaks is typically 25%, but small growers can receive 100% compensation regardless of participation in surveillance plans. Most producers and states are expected to qualify for full indemnification in H5 or H7 outbreaks. Funds for indemnities would likely come from the Secretary's authority to transfer money for animal health emergencies. Avian flu can have significant economic impacts, with direct costs including culling birds and quarantining farms. International trade bans can also affect farms outside the quarantine area. No quantitative economic estimates are provided for an H5N1 outbreak in the United States. The 1983-1984 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu in the United States resulted in the destruction of 17 million birds and cost $65 million. In the small 2004 domestic outbreak, about 400,000 chickens were culled. The potential economic impact of a highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. could be significant. Global consumer confidence is at stake in the current H5N1 outbreak, affecting poultry demand. Weak consumer confidence may depress poultry prices and increase demand for substitute meats like beef or pork. Consumer demand for poultry dropped in Europe and Africa in 2006 due to avian flu concerns. Lower shipments to Eastern Europe and Central Asia also affected U.S. poultry prices in 2005. Poultry production is tied to demand for feed like corn and soybean meal, accounting for about one-third of world feed use. The global impact on feed has been limited so far, with quick production recovery in contained outbreaks. The United States is the largest producer and exporter of poultry meat, with broilers worth over $23.3 billion annually. Poultry production in the United States is significant, with broilers accounting for $15 billion, eggs $5 billion, and turkeys nearly $3 billion annually. Five states, including Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and North Carolina, contribute to 60% of U.S. production. Internationally, the H5N1 outbreak has impacted poultry farms, feed suppliers, and processors, particularly in Asia. Developing countries rely on poultry farming for income and protein, but outbreaks can lead to nutritional problems. Assistance programs are needed to support early reporting and containment efforts. The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 in Asia has led to three hearings on avian flu in poultry by Congress. The Senate Agriculture Committee held a hearing on May 11, 2006, reviewing avian flu preparedness and funding use. Both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees also held hearings in November 2005 on avian influenza prevention and control efforts. Funding for avian flu is spread across various agencies, with APHIS being the primary agency for poultry and wild birds, along with other agencies like ARS, CSREES, and FWS. The Administration is requesting $82 million for avian flu in FY2008, with $77 million for APHIS and $5 million for agricultural research. Within APHIS, $57 million is for HPAI monitoring and surveillance, and $17 million for LPAI disease management. USDA is operating at FY2006 levels for FY2007 under a continuing resolution. APHIS received a $30 million increase for all programs due to avian flu concerns. The USDA budget for avian flu in FY2008 includes $37 million for HPAI monitoring and surveillance, $11 million for LPAI disease management. In previous years, funding for avian flu programs ranged from $1 million in FY2004 to $91.4 million in emergency supplemental funds in FY2006. In FY2004, APHIS received a $1 million appropriation for HPAI. USDA transferred $13.7 million in emergency funds during the 2004 outbreak. FWS General Operations proposed $7.4 million for HPAI in FY2008. The program covers study, monitoring, and early detection of HPAI, focusing on North American species and geographic areas like Alaska and the Pacific Flyway. USGS is conducting investigations related to HPAI, with targeted surveillance for early detection in wild birds since 2005. A steering committee was formed in 2006 to coordinate efforts. The Administration requested $36.8 million for FY2008 for Terrestrial and Endangered Resources. The Administration requested $36.8 million for FY2008 for Terrestrial and Endangered Resources, an increase of $5.3 million over FY2006. The House-passed bill and Senate Appropriations Committee bill approved these increases. No separate figure was provided for HPAI-related investigations within the sub-activity."
