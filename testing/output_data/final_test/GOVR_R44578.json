    "content": "The report discusses the Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition workforce, its current size, past efforts by Congress to improve it, and potential areas for further exploration. Despite ongoing reform efforts, issues like cost overruns and schedule delays persist in defense acquisitions. In recent years, there has been a renewed consensus on the importance of improving the acquisition workforce as a critical part of acquisition reform efforts. A 2014 report highlighted the need for cultural change and improved incentives for the workforce, as well as the importance of training and recruiting. Recent legislation, such as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, has emphasized the need for a robust and effective acquisition workforce. Two-thirds of contributors believe training and recruiting must be improved, while nearly half feel DOD should establish realistic requirements at the start of major acquisition programs. Strong accountability and leadership throughout the life-cycle of weapon systems are also seen as crucial. The acquisition workforce in the Department of Defense consists of uniformed and civilian personnel responsible for managing goods and services to support the military. They are designated under various acts and instructions to contribute significantly to the acquisition process. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (10 U.S.C. \u00a71705) requires the Secretary of Defense to designate acquisition positions and include acquisition-related positions in specific fields. DOD instruction 5000.66 implements this law and governs the establishment and management of the acquisition workforce, directing the identification of career paths for civilian and military personnel in terms of education, training, and experience. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund mandates the designation of acquisition positions and includes acquisition-related positions in specific fields. The heads of DOD components must designate positions within the acquisition workforce, as outlined by Defense Acquisition University. The Director, Acquisition Career Management in each military service tracks acquisition workforce personnel data in the central AT&L database DataMart. The term acquisition workforce, as defined by 10 U.S.C. \u00a71705, includes personnel who significantly contribute to the acquisition process, even if not in a designated position. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund mandates the designation of acquisition positions and includes acquisition-related positions in specific fields. Personnel designated as temporary members for training purposes are not included in the total count of the acquisition workforce. Activities critical to successful acquisitions may be performed by personnel outside the formal acquisition workforce. Stable capability requirements and funding are crucial for successful program execution according to DOD Instruction 5000.02. Successful program execution requires close collaboration between personnel responsible for processes at the DoD level and within DoD Components to adapt to changing circumstances and resolve issues early. Non-acquisition personnel and contractors play important roles in supporting program offices and acquisition processes. The recent Senate report emphasizes the significance of these individuals in successful acquisitions. Themes in the report focus on the culture, management, and specific shortcomings of the acquisition system. The acquisition system faces challenges beyond the control of the workforce, such as developing realistic requirements and the need for strong leadership. Reform efforts should consider a broader definition of the acquisition workforce to include those who influence the process. The defense acquisition workforce consists of 156,457 personnel, with approximately 90% being civilian. The acquisition workforce consisted of 156,457 personnel, with 90% civilian and 10% uniformed. Between FY1989 and FY1999, the workforce decreased by 50% due to congressionally mandated reductions. This downsizing led to shortages in properly trained personnel. Workforce downsizing in the 1990s caused shortages in trained personnel, impacting defense acquisitions. Despite workforce growth, concerns remain about workforce size keeping up with workload complexity. DOD increased acquisition workforce by 24% between FY2008 and FY2016, meeting objectives set in 2009 despite challenges like sequestration and furloughs. Despite challenges like sequestration and furloughs, the Department of Defense (DOD) has seen significant growth in its workforce, with over 150,000 employees in 2011 increasing to over 96 percent meeting certification requirements and 83 percent having a bachelor's degree or higher. The acquisition workforce has increased by approximately 21% from 2001 to 2015, with DOD contract obligations rising by approximately 43% over the same period. Historical data on the acquisition workforce size prior to FY2005 may have inconsistent measures. Historical data on the acquisition workforce size prior to FY2005 may have inconsistent measures. Trends show that as spending increased (FY2001-FY2008), the acquisition workforce shrunk, and as spending declined (FY2008-FY2015), the acquisition workforce grew. It is important for the size of the workforce to expand along with spending increases for long-term workforce planning. Congress has made efforts to improve the capability and performance of the acquisition workforce. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) was enacted in 1990 to address knowledge and skill deficiencies in the acquisition workforce. It established professional development requirements, hiring and pay flexibilities, a dedicated fund for workforce improvement, and strategic planning for workforce development. These tools aim to enhance training, recruitment, and retention of acquisition personnel. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) established career paths for acquisition positions with education and training requirements. The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) provides standardized training and certifications for acquisition career fields, such as Contract Administration at the Defense Contract Management Agency. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) established career paths for acquisition positions with education and training requirements. To obtain certification, employees must complete nine contract-related DAU courses, have two years of contract experience, and meet education requirements. DAU certifications are only available to DOD employees in DAWIA-coded positions. Hiring and pay flexibilities are authorized to enhance recruitment and retention of qualified personnel in the acquisition workforce. Hiring flexibilities simplify and accelerate the hiring process, while pay flexibilities provide higher or additional compensation. These flexibilities can be government-wide or agency-specific. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) established career paths for acquisition positions with education and training requirements. Hiring and pay flexibilities can be government-wide or agency-specific, with some authorized exclusively for the acquisition workforce. DAWDF, enacted in 2008, provides funding for education, training, recruitment, and retention initiatives for the acquisition workforce. For example, in FY2015, DAWDF funds were used for recruitment and training activities, with DOD crediting $560 million to the fund instead of the required $700 million. The NDAA for FY2016 required DOD to credit $500,000 to the fund, which can be reduced to $400,000 if the Secretary of Defense determines that the lower amount is sufficient. The House version of the NDAA for FY2017 includes language that would allow the Secretary to credit $0 to the fund in FY2017, addressing an overfunding issue. Congress required DOD to submit a biennial strategic workforce plan aimed at shaping and improving the acquisition workforce. The workforce plan report highlighted acquisition workforce issues, but key sections were blank or outdated. DOD aims to release an updated strategic plan by FY2016-FY2021, facing challenges in workforce performance improvement. Congressional action may play a role in DOD's success in this area. The workforce plan report identified acquisition workforce issues, with DOD aiming to release an updated strategic plan by FY2016-FY2021. Congressional action may be crucial in improving workforce performance, with DOD Instruction 1100.22 outlining policies for determining the workforce mix. The acquisition workforce faces challenges in developing an appropriate mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel due to budgetary and regulatory constraints. Congress may need to consider oversight questions regarding workforce size, contractor roles, hiring flexibilities, DAU's effectiveness, and staff training gaps. The challenges faced by the acquisition workforce in maintaining a well-qualified and professional workforce, including issues with training and development, incentives alignment, and prioritization of acquisition-related duties for non-acquisition personnel, may require amendments to the university's authorizing statute. The 2015 GAO report highlighted concerns about the strategic planning for the acquisition workforce in DOD. Key questions for Congress include the strategic development and management of the acquisition workforce, difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, and gaps in skills of senior acquisition professionals. The 2015 GAO report raised concerns about strategic planning for the acquisition workforce in DOD. Key questions for Congress include workforce development, recruitment challenges, skills gaps, and the authority of the Under Secretary for AT&L."
