    "content": "The \"Military Call-Up Relief Act\" allows for a waiver of early withdrawal penalty for distributions from qualified retirement plans to individuals called to active duty during the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001. The waiver for certain distributions under the Military Call-Up Relief Act includes exempting individuals on national emergency active duty from the 10-percent additional tax on early withdrawals from qualified retirement plans. The waiver for certain early withdrawals from retirement plans exempts individuals on national emergency active duty from the 10-percent additional tax. This amendment applies to distributions made after September 13, 2001, and allows catch-up contributions for certain individuals. The deductible amount for an individual who received a distribution under section 72(t)(2)(G) shall be increased by the aggregate amount of such distributions over the amount previously taken into account. Catch-up contributions for certain distributions are addressed in the amendments to the Code. An applicable employer plan can allow additional elective deferrals without failing to meet requirements. There is a limitation on the amount of additional deferrals permitted by the plan. The plan limits additional elective deferrals based on the participant's compensation and other deferrals made without this provision. The applicable dollar amount is determined for each participant. The plan limits elective deferrals based on compensation and other deferrals. The amount for each participant is calculated by subtracting previous distributions not attributable to earnings. Rules for contributions are similar to subsection (v). Definitions for 'applicable employer plan' and 'elective deferral' apply. The amendments made by this subsection apply to contributions in taxable years ending after December 31, 2001."
