Bush increased counternarcotics aid to Colombia through the 1989 \"Andean Initiative\" as coca leaf cultivation and cocaine production rose in the Andean region. The United States substantially increased State Department support for Colombian counternarcotics efforts and provided equipment to Colombian security forces. In 1991, Congress enacted \"Section 1004\" of the 1991 National Defense Authorization Act, providing the DOD with authority to support foreign law enforcement agencies for counter-narcotics purposes. Funding for Colombia dropped in the first two years of the Clinton Administration budgets but began to increase in FY1997. In 1998, Congress established a new authority, Section 1033 of the 1998 NDAA, for the U.S. military to provide non-lethal equipment and maintain counter-drug equipment. Total funding from FY1989 - FY1999 was $1,066.7 million. In FY1999, funding for Colombia increased significantly under President Clinton's administration, with $173.2 million in supplemental appropriations for upgrades and assistance. In FY2000, Congress approved $1.3 billion for the region-wide \"Plan Colombia,\" with $860.3 million earmarked for the initiative. In FY2000, Congress approved $1.3 billion for the region-wide \"Plan Colombia,\" with nearly half of the funding dedicated to setting up and training Colombian Army Counternarcotics battalions. This assistance aimed to help Colombia counter threats from illegal narcotics trafficking. The Bush Administration expanded the scope of Clinton's \"Plan Colombia\" policy through the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) in FY2002, with increased assistance to states bordering Colombia. Congress provided $380.5 million for Colombia in State Department counternarcotics funding, with human rights conditions and a cap on military personnel and private contractors. The Administration sought authority and funding to expand military assistance through emergency supplemental appropriations in February 2002. The Bush Administration sought authority and funding to expand military assistance in Colombia through emergency supplemental appropriations in February 2002. The requests included funds for training Colombian soldiers to defend infrastructure from guerrilla attacks, anti-kidnapping techniques, and broadening authorities to support the government's campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist activities. Congress approved almost all of the requested funding before President Alvaro Uribe took office in August 2002. Congress provided supplemental funding in FY2002 to support Colombia's unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist organizations. The funding did not extend to activities involving other national security threats. In FY2003, Congress extended the authority for State Department funding under the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. In FY2003, Congress approved $537 million for Colombia, including $433.2 million in CN funding and $93 million in FMF funding. Additional funding of $105 million was included in the FY2003 supplemental appropriations. The aid is conditioned on human rights and environmental restrictions. For FY2004, the Bush Administration requested $573 million for Colombia, with $463 million in ACI funds and $110 million in Foreign Military Financing. The Administration's request for funding for Colombia is not specified for a particular purpose, unlike previous requests. The aid is intended to support counter-terrorism operations and protect key infrastructure. Tables 1 and 2 show aid to Colombia from FY2000 through FY2003 and FY1989-FY1999, respectively. The United States also provides a small amount of DOD Excess Defense Articles to Colombia. The United States provides assistance to Colombia, including DOD Excess Defense Articles. There are limitations in accurately capturing the full extent of U.S. aid due to various factors such as funds spent on counternarcotics and other activities not always accounted for. Inconsistencies among sources and constraints on data gathering may result in the actual assistance being higher than reported. The State Department provides funding for various programs such as International Narcotics Control and Andean Counterdrug Initiative. Figures on funding from different sources are obtained from Congressional presentations and budget documents. Funding for INC Air Wing supports eradication efforts in Colombia. DOD funding is also provided for FY2000-2004. Non-DOD Plan Colombia funds are assigned to the State Department. Non-DOD Plan Colombia funds for State Department INC (FY2000 and FY2001) or ACI (FY2002 and thereafter) account are transferred to agencies like Department of Justice and USAID for programs in Colombia. USAID figures for FY2000 and FY2001 are Economic Support Funds (ESF) and do not include INC account funds. Data on U.S. Aid to Colombia FY1989-FY1999 is drawn from various sources including U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants, Foreign Military Sales, and Military Assistance Facts books. In the Military Assistance Facts book, data from the Department of Defense Security Cooperation Agency, State and Defense departments, and General Accounting Office (GAO) for 1996-1998 is used. GAO data is preferred in case of contradictions. Some yearly totals may be inaccurate before FY1997 due to possible lack of data or inaccuracies. Section 1004 assistance to Colombia may have started in FY1992, but public breakdown is available from FY1997 onwards."
