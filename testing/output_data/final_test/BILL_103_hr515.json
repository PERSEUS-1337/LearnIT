It includes details like the offender's personal information and a description of the crimes committed. The \"National Child Abuser Registration Act of 1993\" defines terms related to criminal child abuse laws of a State, including information useful for identifying child abusers and the National Crime Information Center's role in providing information to law enforcement authorities. The term \"State\" in the National Child Abuser Registration Act of 1993 refers to States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Congress recognizes the increasing number of children abused by repeat offenders, the link between child abuse and issues like runaway behavior, substance abuse, and juvenile delinquency, the cycle of abuse perpetuated from one generation to the next, and the lack of a centralized national database for law enforcement to access data on child abuse cases. The Congress acknowledges the need for a national database for law enforcement to access data on child abuse cases to prevent repeat offenders from committing crimes in different states. The Act aims to establish a national system for obtaining information on individuals who commit child abuse crimes, prevent repeat offenses by providing data to child welfare organizations, and provide statistical data on child abuse in the US to relevant parties. SEC. 5. REPORTING BY THE STATES. States must report all convictions for child abuse to the FBI as per the guidelines set by the Attorney General. The AG will also publish an annual summary of this information. SEC. 6. STATE COMPLIANCE. Each State has 3 years to implement the provisions of section 5. States not complying with section 5 will have their funds reduced by 25% after 3 years, with the unallocated funds reallocated to compliant States."
