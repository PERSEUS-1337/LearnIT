    "content": "During the Obama Administration, the United States considered two mega-regional free trade agreements: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the U.S.-European Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The TPP was signed by 12 countries in February 2016 but required ratification. President Trump later withdrew the U.S. from the TPP and halted T-TIP negotiations. The remaining 11 TPP partners concluded a revised agreement without U.S. participation. The TPP was concluded without U.S. participation, leading to the formation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Trump Administration is focused on renegotiating NAFTA and the U.S.-South Korea FTA, with a strong emphasis on trade enforcement and skepticism towards past trade agreements. President Trump views the U.S. trade deficit as a key indicator of trade policy success or failure, linking it to issues such as unemployment, slow wage growth, and income inequality. The administration criticizes existing trade agreements as unfair. The Trump Administration views U.S. trade agreements as unfair and detrimental to the economy, sparking a debate over the impact of FTAs on U.S. trade balances with its partners. There are concerns that the cost of U.S. global leadership may outweigh the benefits, leading to calls for renegotiation and cost-sharing. Data on U.S. trade with FTA partners present varying conclusions, highlighting the complexity of the issue. The report analyzes U.S. trade data with its FTA partners to show the impact on trade balances. It includes information on bilateral trade with 20 FTA countries, excluding Israel, Canada, and Mexico. The U.S. has entered into 14 FTAs with 20 countries between 1985 and 2011. The U.S. Census Bureau provides official data on import and export statistics. The Census Bureau data on U.S. total merchandise exports and imports, including services for FTA countries, show that U.S. trade with FTA partners accounts for a significant portion of exports and imports. The U.S. has consistently experienced a merchandise goods trade deficit since 1980, with a sharp drop in exports and imports in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and economic recession. Since 2012, global trade volumes have recovered due to an increase in global GDP, while trade values have been volatile due to commodity prices and exchange rates. The fluctuation in trade value can be attributed to changes in commodity and oil prices, reflecting shifts in China's economic policies. The slowdown and subsequent increase in trade volumes indicate progressive economic growth since 2012 in developed and developing economies. The United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $734.3 billion in 2016. In 2016, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $734.3 billion and a services surplus of $247.7 billion, resulting in a combined total deficit of -$486.6 billion. The U.S. ran a merchandise trade deficit of -$71.3 billion with 20 FTA partner countries and a services surplus of $68.9 billion, leading to a goods and services deficit of -$2.5 billion. The U.S. trade deficit with FTA partners has decreased by almost half from 2007 to 2017. Trade with the European Union resulted in a goods deficit of -$146 billion and a services surplus of $54.8 billion, leading to a combined deficit of -$91.5 billion. The U.S. had a goods trade deficit of -$172 billion with proposed TPP countries in 2016. In 2016, the United States had a deficit in goods trade of -$172 billion with Japan, Mexico, and Vietnam, and a services surplus of $75 billion, resulting in a combined total deficit of -$97 billion. U.S. trade with 20 FTA partner countries accounted for $677 billion in goods exports and $749 billion in goods imports. Trade data with FTA partners has been expressed in various ways, including excluding trade with Israel, Canada, and Mexico. In 2016, the United States had an overall merchandise trade deficit of -$83 billion with Israel, Canada, and Mexico, and a services surplus of $30 billion. The US also had a merchandise trade surplus of $12 billion and a services surplus of $38.8 billion with the other 17 FTA partners, resulting in a combined goods and services surplus of $51 billion. U.S. FTA partners accounted for 9.7% of the total U.S. merchandise trade deficit, with the largest share in trade with Israel, Canada, and Mexico. Trade surpluses and deficits with the other 17 FTA partners are relatively small compared to total U.S. trade. From 2003 to 2017, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit with all 20 FTA partners decreased significantly. Trade deficits with Canada and Mexico have also declined, despite steady or slightly increased oil imports from these countries. The U.S. has the largest deficit in crude oil and petroleum trade with Canada, accounting for a significant portion of the overall trade deficit in oil and petroleum products. The U.S. trade deficit in oil and petroleum products was $80 billion in 2015, with Mexico accounting for $1.2 billion of the energy trade deficit. Canada made up 60% of the U.S. crude oil trade deficit in 2015, a significant increase from 20% in 2008. The decline in the U.S. oil trade deficit was mainly due to the drop in petroleum prices in 2014 and 2015. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) assesses the economic effects of U.S. trade agreements, with a report in June 2016 showing that bilateral and regional trade agreements increased U.S. aggregate trade by about 3% in 2012, while impacting U.S. real GDP and employment by less than 1%. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) reported that bilateral and regional trade agreements increased U.S. aggregate trade by 3%, real GDP and employment by less than 1%, and bilateral trade with partner countries by 26.3%. The ITC also found that agreements focusing on specific industries had larger impacts on trade in those industries. Economists question the usefulness of using bilateral trade balances as indicators of trade relations or the effectiveness of trade agreements. Economists argue that trade balances are not a reliable measure of trade agreements, as macroeconomic forces like domestic saving and investment levels determine overall trade deficits or surpluses in large open economies like the United States. Floating exchange rates and liberalized capital flows drive cross-border capital flows, rather than trade balances being indicative of trade agreement effectiveness. The demand for and supply of capital drive cross-border capital flows, influencing the international exchange value of the dollar and the U.S. trade balance. Economists argue that liberalized trade benefits consumers and producers, leading to overall economic gains that outweigh costs. International trade promotes efficiency and offers consumers a wider variety of goods and services at different price points. Trade agreements can have a positive effect on an economy by enhancing production and employment. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by various economic activities at the micro level, such as economic development, raw materials abundance, technological change, and inflation rates. Trade agreements can impact national economies and trade balances through various factors such as technological change, productivity, inflation rates, commodity prices, and exchange rates. It is challenging to determine the cause and effect relationships within the economy, making it difficult to attribute movements in bilateral trade balances to specific trade agreements. For example, movements in international exchange rates can have a significant impact on trade, as seen in the case of the peso decline in 1994 affecting U.S.-Mexico trade more than anticipated by NAFTA. The appreciation of the dollar is expected to impact U.S. exports and imports, potentially reducing the trade deficit in the short run. Global trade has been affected by events like the 2008-2009 financial crisis, leading to a decline in trade. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by various factors, including trade agreements and macroeconomic events. U.S. FTA partners have diverse economies, with some being highly developed like Canada, while others are small developing economies in Central America. Trade with these countries is often concentrated in a few items, such as raw materials and processed goods. In many cases, the top 10 export and import commodities account for a significant portion of total bilateral trade, exceeding 90% in some instances. Bilateral trade heavily relies on raw materials, agricultural commodities, and energy items, especially in U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico. Variations in trade structures make it challenging to compare trade agreements and their impact on trade balances. The composition of trade relationships differs between countries, affecting bilateral trade relations and balances. Trade agreements set rules for trade and offer incentives like lower tariff rates, but consumer and firm behavior also plays a significant role in trade outcomes. Consumer and firm behavior determine the impact of trade agreements on bilateral trade. The responsiveness to incentives varies by goods categories, with luxury goods being highly responsive to price changes. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes U.S. merchandise trade into six major end-use categories. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes U.S. merchandise trade into six major end-use categories: supplies, capital goods, automotive vehicles and parts, consumer goods, and other goods. Trade in food, agricultural commodities, industrial supplies, capital goods, and other goods are greater as a share of U.S. exports than imports. However, U.S. imports of automotive vehicles and parts and consumer goods are a greater share of imports compared to exports, shaping bilateral trade relationships and contributing to the annual U.S. merchandise trade deficit. The subject of interest to academic economists is the way U.S. trade flows respond to changes in national incomes and prices, known as trade elasticities. Studies show that U.S. demand for foreign imports is more sensitive to changes in income and prices than foreign demand for U.S. exports. The estimated price and income elasticities show that a 1% increase in U.S. GDP leads to a 2.11% increase in imports by U.S. consumers, while a 1% increase in GDP among U.S. trading partners results in a 1.86% increase in consumption of U.S. goods. The disparity in responsiveness is influenced by the larger share of consumer consumption in the U.S. economy, suggesting that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit may worsen over time. The trade deficit is expected to worsen over time due to different impacts on U.S. and foreign demand for services. The U.S. surplus in services is expected to increase over time, and global value chains are blurring the distinction between domestic content value of exports and imports. Trade balances reflect trade relationships, with exports and imports benefiting the economy by allowing specialization in goods and services. Global value chains and intra-industry trade have blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign firms and goods. Global value chains have blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign firms and goods, with foreign value added accounting for a significant portion of global exports. Developed countries have about 31% foreign value added in exports, while developing countries in East and South-East Asia and Central America have high shares due to processing industries. Traditional trade measurement methods may not accurately reflect the sources of goods and services in value chains. The global value chains have blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign firms and goods, with foreign value added accounting for a significant portion of global exports. Trade in intermediate goods means that imports may be essential for exports, and countries imposing trade measures restricting imports may negatively affect their own exports. The role of services in international trade has expanded, creating more jobs tied to international trade. Bilateral trade balances are often used to measure the success of Free Trade Agreements, but economists argue that they may not fully capture the benefits of recent FTAs. Most economists argue that bilateral trade balances are incomplete measures of trade relationships due to recent FTAs including services, investment provisions, and trade facilitation. They believe liberalized trade creates overall positive effects on the economy, outweighing any negative impacts on trade balances. International trade enhances efficiency and offers a wider variety of goods and services to consumers. Economists believe it has a positive long-term effect on production and employment. Trade agreements being negotiated by the United States could have significant economic impacts, especially for developing economies. Negative effects like job losses and lower wages are acknowledged, but they are often distributed disproportionately. Trade agreements can lead to job losses and lower wages, disproportionately affecting some workers and firms. Governments implement programs to help those negatively impacted by trade agreements. Bilateral merchandise trade balances are not a reliable basis for comparing the merits of FTAs, as each trade relationship is unique and influenced by various factors. The composition of bilateral trade relationships affects trade balances differently, making it challenging to compare the U.S. experience with individual FTAs. Trade liberalization and the growth of global value chains have blurred the distinction between exports and imports, impacting bilateral trade balances. Cross-border trade in intermediate goods has increased, expanding the role of services in international trade. Policies affecting imports also impact exports, as imports are essential inputs for exports. Countries restricting imports end up negatively affecting their own exports. The blurring of distinction between exports and imports due to trade liberalization and global value chains complicates bilateral trade balances. Congress may consider examining data collection methods for U.S. exports and imports in light of mega-regional free trade agreements like TPP and T-TIP. This analysis could also extend to data on workers and industries. The impact of trade agreements on the economy can be assessed by examining data collection and analysis on workers, industries, and states vulnerable to economic dislocations. The role of global value chains in assessing the impact of exports and imports on resource allocation should also be considered. NAFTA is cited as an example of unexpected outcomes in trade agreements. China's accession to the WTO in 2001 had significant effects on U.S. trade relations and NAFTA partners. It reduced barriers to trade and investment, increasing trade between the U.S. and China and boosting U.S. investment in China. This led to a shift in U.S. imports from other countries to China, impacting trade with Canada and Mexico as well. Between 1989 and 2017, U.S. imports and exports with Canada, Mexico, and China fluctuated. In 1989, these countries accounted for $88 billion, $27 billion, and $12 billion of total U.S. imports, respectively. By 2000, these figures had increased to $231 billion, $136 billion, and $100 billion. Canada's share slightly rose, Mexico's doubled, and China's nearly quadrupled. From 2000 to 2017, Canada's share decreased, Mexico's slightly rose, and China's more than doubled to 21.4% of total U.S. imports. The data show that Canada's share of U.S. imports grew little under NAFTA until 2000, then fell, while Mexico's share peaked between 1995-2000. Imports from China steadily increased, especially after joining the WTO in 2001. Similarly, U.S. exports to Canada declined after 2000, while exports to China steadily rose. The share of U.S. exports to Mexico dipped before the 2008-2009 recession but rebounded after 2010. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by various factors, making it difficult to determine the impact of trade agreements on trade balances. Appendix B provides data on the top 10 U.S. export and import commodities with FTA partner countries in 2014."
