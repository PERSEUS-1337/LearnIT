    "content": "The \"Save for Success Act\" is also known as the American Opportunity Tax Credit Savings Credit. The Save for Success Act, also known as the American Opportunity Tax Credit Savings Credit, includes special rules for eligible college savings contributions. These contributions are considered qualified tuition and related expenses, with a limit of $250 per individual per taxable year. The Save for Success Act, or American Opportunity Tax Credit Savings Credit, includes rules for eligible college savings contributions. The dollar amount in subparagraph (A) is reduced based on the taxpayer's household income in excess of 133 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved. Terms like 'family size', 'household income', and 'poverty line' have specific meanings. The term 'eligible college savings contribution' refers to the excess of taxpayer contributions to qualified college savings accounts over distributions from those accounts in a taxable year. A 'qualified college savings account' is defined as an account under a qualified tuition program or a state-established program for college tuition payments. The text discusses the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for college tuition expenses. It mentions a portion of the credit being refundable and a lifetime limitation on the credit amount. The text introduces a pilot program for periodic payments of college expenses incurred by eligible students, jointly established by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education. The pilot program allows for payments of college expenses for eligible students, with the total amount capped at the allowable credit based on the taxpayer's income. The credit for a taxable year is reduced by payments made under the program for expenses that would otherwise qualify for the credit. The program established under this paragraph allows for voluntary participation by students and educational institutions, excluding taxable institutions. It applies to expenses for academic periods within a 5-year period starting 1 year after enactment. Payments made under this program are not considered as resources for financial aid. Payments made under this program are not considered as resources for financial aid and should not reduce other forms of aid available to eligible students. Educational institutions must provide notices about the program to parents and students, which are not considered tax advice under federal law. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for reporting on the program. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education will submit annual reports to Congress on the program established under this subsection. Additionally, a taxpayer awareness program will be established to inform the public about the American Opportunity Tax Credit. A taxpayer awareness program will be established to inform individuals about the availability of the American Opportunity Tax Credit through various means of communication, including displaying information on specified forms for reporting qualified tuition expenses. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, should take additional steps to promote awareness of the American Opportunity Tax Credit, including through the data retrieval tool, student aid report, financial aid shopping sheet, volunteer income tax assistance program, and Federal TRIO. The Opportunity Tax Credit in the Federal TRIO and GEAR UP programs, as outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2016."
