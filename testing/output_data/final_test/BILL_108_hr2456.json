    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Research and Care Act\". Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare genetic disorder that causes severe anemia in infancy due to a lack of red blood cell production. Patients have an increased risk of leukemia, tumors, and bone marrow failure. Half of patients are born with birth defects, and treatments like blood transfusions and steroids can lead to long-term side effects like osteoporosis and impaired growth. The only cure for Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a bone marrow transplant, which is risky and only an option for about 25% of patients due to lack of donors. Federal investment in research for this genetic disorder is crucial for understanding blood disorders, cancer predisposition, and birth defects. SEC. 3. DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA. This section addresses DBA-related activities of NIH. The Director of NIH, along with other institutes, will expand research on Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Grants and contracts will support a comprehensive research initiative to find better treatments and a cure. Research may include exploring links to chronic diseases. The CDC will focus on DBA-related activities, including red cell differentiation, the pathophysiology of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, its relationship to cancer predisposition, and congenital anomalies in patients. Registry and clinical care center established for Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The Secretary will maintain and expand the Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Registry and establish a comprehensive clinical care center for the disease. The center will gather extensive data on Diamond-Blackfan anemia for research initiatives. The government research initiatives focus on gene discovery, ribosomal protein function, genetics of birth defects, blood cell formation, cancer predisposition, and therapeutic treatments. They also aim to provide thorough examinations and clinical care for Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients."
