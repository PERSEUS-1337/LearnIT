    "title": "SB 1406",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 54.27 of the Civil Code requires attorneys to include their State Bar license number in prelitigation letters sent to education entities and to send a copy of the letter to the California Commission on Disability Access. Attorneys must also provide information about complaints in a standard format to the commission within five days of sending or serving a complaint against an education entity. Attorneys must notify the California Commission on Disability Access within five business days of judgment, settlement, or dismissal of a complaint, providing specific information about the outcome and remediation of alleged accessibility violations. Attorneys must notify the California Commission on Disability Access within five business days of judgment, settlement, or dismissal of a complaint. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action by the State Bar. Attorneys are not required to send subsequent prelitigation letters or amended complaints to the California Commission on Disability Access unless they allege a new construction-related accessibility claim. The Commission will review and report on all prelitigation letters, complaints, and case outcomes it receives. Attorneys employed or retained by qualified legal services projects or support centers are exempt from certain requirements when asserting construction-related accessibility claims. These organizations are regulated by the State Bar of California and have not been found to abuse demand letters or complaints. The small number of construction-related accessibility cases brought by these programs justifies their exemption from reporting requirements to the California Commission on Disability Access. The exemption of regulated legal services programs from reporting to the California Commission on Disability Access will not impact the commission's tabulation of other construction-related accessibility claims. For construction-related accessibility claims, this section does not apply to claims against a public entity under Division 3.6 of the Government Code. The term \"complaint\" refers to a civil complaint filed with a court regarding construction-related accessibility claims. The term \"construction-related accessibility claim\" refers to violations of accessibility standards in public buildings or facilities of education entities. Education entities include the University of California Regents, California State University Trustees, California Community Colleges, K-12 school districts, and local education agencies. A prelitigation letter alleging violations of construction-related accessibility standards is provided to education entities, without a claim for money or damages. The commission is required to compile and post data on demand letters, prelitigation letters, or complaints related to accessibility standards. The commission must identify and tabulate construction-related physical access violations alleged in demand letters and complaints. Every six months, they must post a list of the 10 most frequent types of accessibility violations on their website. The commission is required to track and report the number of demand letters and complaints received, specifying whether they were filed in state or federal court. This data must be posted on their website every six months starting July 31, 2013. Additionally, an annual report must be submitted to the Legislature and Judiciary Committees by January 31 of each year, detailing the tabulated data from the previous calendar year."
