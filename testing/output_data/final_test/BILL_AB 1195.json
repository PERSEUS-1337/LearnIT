    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amends Section 8869.80 of the Government Code regarding private activity bonds. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 sets a volume ceiling based on state population, while the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 establishes bond authority for each state. Section 142(k) of the Internal Revenue Code sets a volume ceiling for qualified education facility bonds based on state population. States must allocate this volume ceiling according to a specified formula unless a different procedure is established. Each state has the authority to determine the allocation of the volume ceiling. Therefore, a state agency and allocation system must be designated to administer the volume ceiling for promoting housing for lower income families and individuals. The text discusses the public benefits of preserving existing governmental assisted housing, providing federal assistance for teachers in high priority schools to purchase homes, and constructing educational facilities for children. It also mentions the enactment of a chapter to implement state volume limits for federal tax laws. Section 8869.82 of the Government Code is amended to define key terms related to the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee, including \"Committee,\" \"Fund,\" \"Internal Revenue Code,\" \"Issuer,\" and \"Local agency.\" The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (MBTCAC) is defined as per Section 50199.8 of the Health and Safety Code. Private activity bonds are bonds required to obtain a portion of the state's volume cap for tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code, including various types such as exempt facility bonds, qualified mortgage bonds, and qualified student loan bonds. The \"private activity bond limit\" refers to the state ceiling allocated to state or local agencies in California. The state agency includes all state entities authorized to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds. The state ceiling is determined by Section 146(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. The state ceiling in California is allocated among state and local agencies for private activity bonds issuance, governed by specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Any allocated portion becomes the private activity bond limit for the issuer. Each state agency in California must apply to the committee for allocation of a portion of the state ceiling for private activity bonds issuance. The committee will determine the terms and conditions of the allocation. Local agencies can apply to the committee for an allocation of the state ceiling for private activity bonds, but only for specific projects or programs. The committee will determine the terms and conditions of the allocation. Any allocation made under this section is irrevocable upon bond issuance, and cannot be used for carryforwards unless expressly allowed by the committee. No allocation made under this section can be transferred to another state or local agency without the committee's permission. State or local agencies can transfer their private activity bond limit to another agency with written permission, and the transfer must be irrevocable upon bond issuance. Transferees must keep a record of the transfer for the duration of the bonds issued. Private activity bonds can be transferred without payment of cash, property, or other valuable items. Section 8869.86 of the Government Code allows state and local agencies to use their private activity bond limit for issuing bonds, making carryforward elections, or transferring to other agencies with committee approval. Prior to issuing private activity bonds, the issuer must designate a portion of the bond limit in the bond resolution. The designation is irrevocable upon bond issuance. State and local agencies must notify the committee after issuing private activity bonds or transferring bond limits. The committee must be notified by state and local agencies after issuing private activity bonds or transferring bond limits. The Treasurer or designee is designated as the state official to certify compliance with the Internal Revenue Code for private activity bonds."
