    "content": "On June 5, 2017, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported S.Res. 18 (Coons), reaffirming the U.S.-Argentine partnership and recognizing Argentina's economic reforms. This aligns with H.Res. 54 passed by the House in April 2017. President Trump hosted Argentine President Mauricio Macri at the White House on April 27, 2017, discussing deepening relations in trade, investment, combating illicit activities, cyber policy, and collaborating on the situation in Venezuela. President Trump delivered declassified documents on human rights abuses in Argentina during the military dictatorship. Argentina has had civilian democratic rule since 1983 after the military's Dirty War in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The country returned to civilian democratic rule after the Falkland Islands war in 1982. In 1983, Argentina transitioned to civilian democratic rule with the election of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn as president. Carlos Menem, who won the 1989 elections, transformed the economy to embrace free market principles. However, high unemployment and corruption led to the defeat of the Peronists in 1999. The economic crisis in 2001-2002 led to widespread unrest and the resignation of President de la R\u00faa. After President de la R\u00faa resigned during the 2001-2002 economic crisis in Argentina, an interim government defaulted on nearly $100 billion in public debt. President Eduardo Duhalde stabilized the economy, followed by President N\u00e9stor Kirchner who further enhanced political and economic stability, restoring faith in democracy through popular policy moves. In 2005, the government began restructuring its defaulted private bond debt. The government offered a restructuring of its defaulted private bond debt with a low recovery rate. Despite political popularity, failure to repay arrears to official creditors hindered access to international capital markets. Legislative elections in 2005 showed strong support for Kirchner, who supported his wife Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's candidacy in 2007. Fern\u00e1ndez completed two terms as president, winning her first term in 2007. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez completed her second term as president in December 2015, becoming the first woman in Argentine history to be elected president. Despite initial success, her presidency faced challenges such as an energy crisis and farmers' strikes. The Kirchners suffered setbacks in the 2009 legislative elections, losing control of both houses. After former President Kirchner's death, Fern\u00e1ndez ran for reelection and won a second mandate in October 2011. In October 2011, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez won a second mandate with 54% of the vote, the largest percentage since Argentina's return to democratic rule. Despite initial popularity, her support waned due to public protests against corruption, crime, economic policies, and government interference in media and judiciary. In the 2013 legislative elections, her party retained control of both houses of Congress. In 2014, President Fern\u00e1ndez's party gained seats in the Chamber of Deputies and retained a majority in the Senate. Despite not securing two-thirds majorities for a constitutional reform, her government achieved approval for various initiatives. The impasse with private creditors intensified due to U.S. court rulings. In 2014, Argentina faced challenges with private creditors due to U.S. court rulings. In early 2015, the government dealt with the aftermath of the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who accused President Fern\u00e1ndez of whitewashing an investigation into a bombing. In April 2015, allegations related to Iran were dismissed. President Fern\u00e1ndez's popularity fell after Nisman's accusations but later increased to 50%. Mauricio Macri of the Let's Change coalition won the 2015 presidential race, defeating Daniel Scioli of the FPV. Macri, a center-right leader, won with 51.4% of the vote. Mauricio Macri, a center-right leader with a business background and experience as president of Boca Juniors, completed his second term as mayor before running for president in 2015. Despite concerns about his party's limited reach, he shifted towards the center during the campaign to appeal to a wider audience. Macri emphasized unity among his coalition parties and supported protests against government policies. He finished second in the first round of the presidential election, behind Daniel Scioli, but ultimately won the presidency with 51.4% of the vote. In Argentina's 2015 presidential election, Mauricio Macri faced Daniel Scioli in a runoff after no candidate secured 45% of the vote in the first round. Macri's strong performance in the initial round gave him momentum going into the second round. Scioli, a close ally of President Kirchner, received her endorsement despite not being close to her. Scioli was burdened by his association with the Kirchners, leading to fatigue among voters. President Fern\u00e1ndez faced growing fatigue from Argentines due to her strong governing style and reports of corruption by her supporters. Macri's victory in the 2015 election was seen as a political upheaval and a rebuke to Kirchnerismo. The close race reflected a divided electorate, with Macri's coalition winning the presidency but only a minority of seats in Congress. The FPV, Fern\u00e1ndez's leftist Peronist faction, retained the largest bloc of seats in the lower house and a majority in the Senate. President Macri quickly implemented changes in economic and foreign policies after taking office in December 2015. President Macri swiftly ushered in changes in the government's economic and foreign policies, ending the 12-year run of Kirchnerismo. Despite facing a minority in Congress, he received backing for key elements of his legislative agenda. Sergio Massa's centrist Peronist bloc pledged support for Macri. The FPV, a leftist Peronist bloc, has faced defections due to corruption scandals under the Fern\u00e1ndez government. Former President Fern\u00e1ndez is facing corruption charges and has established a new political party. Macri's economic policy changes caused a rapid devaluation of the Argentine peso. The Macri government's economic policies led to a 30% devaluation of the Argentine peso, aimed at addressing capital flight and attracting foreign investment. They also reduced export taxes on agricultural products, gradually eliminating them, and removed subsidies on utilities, a move praised by the IMF but unpopular politically. The Macri government implemented economic policies that devalued the Argentine peso by 30% to address capital flight and attract foreign investment. They also reduced export taxes on agricultural products and removed subsidies on utilities, actions praised by the IMF but unpopular politically. Additionally, the government reformed the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC) to improve the accuracy and transparency of economic data, impressing an IMF technical mission in July 2016. Macri promised to resolve the dispute with remaining holdout creditors during the electoral campaign. President Macri's new government successfully reached agreements with holdout creditors in 2016, resolving a longstanding issue that had kept Argentina out of international financial markets. In addition, he implemented measures to combat organized crime, particularly drug trafficking, by declaring a national security emergency in January 2016. President Macri declared a one-year national security emergency to combat drug trafficking, deploying additional federal security at borders and authorizing the armed forces to shoot down suspicious aircraft. He also established a new drug agency and signed a decree to expedite the deportation of foreign residents who commit crimes. In foreign policy, Macri's government aimed to improve relations with Brazil, Uruguay, and the United States. President Macri has improved relations with Brazil, Uruguay, the United States, and pro-market countries of the Pacific Alliance. He has criticized the Venezuelan government's repression of political opponents and supported OAS actions against Venezuela. Argentina suspended Venezuela from Mercosur due to democracy setbacks. Macri also announced not to appeal a court ruling on Iran. President Macri's government decided not to appeal a 2014 Argentine court ruling that declared a 2013 agreement with Iran unconstitutional for jointly investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing. Additionally, Macri strengthened relations with the UK, focusing on South Atlantic issues such as the Falkland Islands. In 2016, Argentina and the UK agreed to maintain the sovereignty dispute over the Falkland Islands. They also pledged to address obstacles hindering economic growth and establish more air links. Progress has been made on DNA identification for Argentine soldiers buried on the islands, led by the International Committee of the Red Cross. In December 2016, the ICRC led a forensic team with Argentine participation for exhumation work starting in June 2017. President Macri visited China in May 2017 for the \"One Belt, One Road\" summit, resulting in over $16 billion in Chinese investments in Argentina. The upcoming October 22, 2017, legislative elections will be a crucial test for the Macri Administration amidst protests against the government's economic austerity program. The government has faced protests over economic reforms, including strikes by teachers and a general strike organized by the General Labor Confederation. President Macri's approval ratings initially dropped but later rebounded, with one poll showing a 6-point increase to 53% in April 2017. Observers believe Macri's coalition may have minority representation after the October elections, despite strong Peronist presence nationwide. The formation of a new party by former President Fern\u00e1ndez, splitting from the Peronist party, could weaken the PJ as a political force. The new party, Citizen's Unity, may serve as a platform for Fern\u00e1ndez to potentially launch a presidential bid in 2019. An open primary for all political parties is scheduled for August 13, 2017. An open primary for all political parties is set for August 13, 2017, with efforts to prosecute Military-Era Human Rights Violations in Argentina since the overturning of amnesty laws in 2003. Over 700 people, including former military and police officials, have been convicted for atrocities committed during the Dirty War under military rule from 1976 to 1983. In May 2016, former Argentine dictator Bignone was convicted for human rights abuses in Operation Condor. In August 2016, 38 former military officers were convicted for their roles in torture center killings during the dictatorship. Argentine authorities are still investigating and prosecuting cases of human rights abuses from the Dirty War. Over 120 children taken from their parents have been identified. President Obama announced declassification during his 2016 visit to Argentina. In March 2016, President Obama announced the declassification of additional U.S. documents from Argentina's military rule era. In May 2017, Argentina's Supreme Court applied a \"two for one\" law to reduce the sentence of a convicted kidnapper and torturer, sparking public outrage and protests. Argentina's Congress quickly passed a bill prohibiting the \"two for one\" rule in cases of crimes against humanity, despite opposition from political parties and President Macri. Human rights groups criticized the Fern\u00e1ndez government for press freedom issues, including withholding public advertising from critical media outlets. The Macri government later established criteria for advertising funds. The Fern\u00e1ndez government in Argentina faced criticism for its handling of media issues, including battles with the Clar\u00edn media group. A controversial law was enacted in 2009 to regulate broadcast and print media, with the government aiming to promote competition in the media market. Argentina's Supreme Court upheld key provisions of the law in 2013, leading Clar\u00edn to present a plan to the government to break up its assets. Clar\u00edn presented a plan to break up its holdings into six companies, approved by AFSCA but later rejected. The government accused Clar\u00edn of violating the media law's spirit. President Macri amended the law in 2015, abolishing AFSCA. The Macri government replaced the regulatory bodies overseeing telecommunications with the National Communications Entity, citing politicization under the Fern\u00e1ndez government. Critics protested the changes to the media law in 2016, arguing it removed limits on media concentration and threatened freedom of expression. Relations between the United States and Argentina have been strong since 1983, with occasional tensions, such as during Argentina's political and financial crisis in 2001-2002. During the political and financial crisis in 2001-2002, the United States supported cutting off IMF assistance to Argentina until a sustainable economic plan was in place, causing tensions. In 2011, bilateral relations were strained due to incidents following the exclusion of Argentina from President Obama's South America trip. Argentine Foreign Minister criticized the then-mayor of Buenos Aires for sending police officials to a U.S.-backed academy in El Salvador, and Argentine officials seized U.S. government equipment related to joint training activities. In 2011, tensions arose between the U.S. and Argentina after incidents related to joint training activities. Argentine officials seized U.S. government equipment, leading to a tough period in bilateral relations. The seizure was supervised by then-Foreign Minister Timerman and was ultimately ruled as a customs clearance issue by an Argentine court. Assistant Secretary of State Jacobson acknowledged the strained relations but expressed hope for resolution. Argentina's debt issue with private creditors is a matter for the courts to decide. President Fern\u00e1ndez accused the United States of interference in Argentine politics in 2014. The U.S. Ambassador emphasized the importance of a strong partnership with Argentina for global issues in 2015. In July 2016, Ambassador Mamet praised President Macri's leadership, stating that Argentina is back on the global stage. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Argentina on its successful elections and expressed confidence in continued cooperation on regional security and prosperity. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs urged President Obama to prioritize relations with Argentina, recommending actions to revitalize bilateral relations. Since Macri's election, U.S. relations with Argentina have notably improved, with meetings between Vice President Biden and President Macri. During a sideline meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2016, President Macri and U.S. leaders discussed strengthening bilateral relations through increased cooperation on commercial and trade ties, defense and security issues, and educational exchanges. The Department of the Treasury announced a policy change to no longer oppose lending to Argentina from multilateral development banks due to Argentina's progress on key issues and positive economic policy trajectory. President Obama's visit to Argentina in March 2016 aimed to further enhance bilateral relations, particularly in trade. During his visit to Argentina in 1997, President Obama aimed to strengthen bilateral relations in trade, investment, security, and defense. The two countries announced agreements on preventing serious crime, counterterrorism, promoting entrepreneurship, and combating money laundering. They also signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) to address economic issues. The trip coincided with the 40th anniversary of the military coup in Argentina. President Obama's visit to Argentina coincided with the 40th anniversary of the military coup in 1976. He announced efforts to declassify more U.S. documents from that era in response to President Macri's request and to support the victims' families. The United States had already released 4,700 partially declassified documents, but more, including military and intelligence records, would be declassified. President Obama emphasized the importance of confronting the past with honesty and transparency, acknowledging the controversy surrounding U.S. policy during that period. The United States delivered 1,000 declassified records to Argentina in August 2016, including 500 newly declassified records. A High-Level Dialogue was launched to strengthen bilateral relations in various areas. The dialogue covered issues like democracy, human rights, security cooperation, and climate change. In a joint statement, Kerry and Malcorra reaffirmed their commitment to peace, democracy, and human rights in the Americas. They urged Venezuelan authorities to set a timetable for the presidential recall referendum and supported dialogue for the Venezuelan people. U.S.-Argentina bilateral relations remain strong under the Trump Administration, with President Trump and Vice President Pence expressing concern over the political situation in Venezuela during phone calls with President Macri. President Trump emphasized the enduring ties between their countries and praised President Macri's leadership in the region. President Macri visited the United States on April 27, 2017, and met with President Trump at the White House. They discussed deepening the partnership between the two countries, expanding trade and investment, resolving agricultural issues, combating illicit finance activities, and launching a Cyber Working Group for security and economic interests. During the meeting between President Macri and President Trump, they discussed the situation in Venezuela, democratic institutions, and the Global Entry Trusted Travelers Program for Argentine citizens. President Trump also declassified documents on human rights abuses in Argentina. Trade issues, including access to the U.S. market for Argentine lemons, were also addressed. After the Trump-Macri meeting, the U.S. Department of Agriculture lifted a stay on a rule allowing Argentine lemons into the United States. U.S.-Argentine relations have been a focus for Congress, with support for strengthened ties. The House approved H.Res. 54, reaffirming the partnership and non-NATO ally status of Argentina. The U.S. commends Argentina for economic reforms and resolving business disputes at the World Bank. Encourages Argentina to continue investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing and 2015 death of AMIA Special Prosecutor. Senate and House resolutions also show support for Argentina's efforts in combating terrorism. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere amended and reported a resolution on May 24, 2017, providing small amounts of assistance for Argentina's strategic trade control compliance and enforcement. The Trump Administration requested $500,000 in assistance for Argentina in FY2018, with $300,000 for IMET and $200,000 for the EXBS program. The United States had a $3.9 billion trade surplus with Argentina in 2016. In 2016, the United States had a $3.9 billion trade surplus with Argentina, exporting $8.6 billion in goods and importing $4.7 billion. Argentina was the 30th largest export market for the U.S. and the U.S. was Argentina's third-largest trading partner. The U.S. Trade Representative's report highlighted technical and sanitary barriers to U.S. imports in Argentina. The United States and Argentina signed a TIFA in March 2016 to address trade and investment issues. The U.S. requested full market access for beef products in Argentina. Argentina has been on the USTR's Special 301 Priority Watch List since 1996 due to intellectual property rights enforcement issues. The USTR's 2017 report highlighted deficiencies in IPR protection and enforcement in Argentina, particularly in physical counterfeiting, piracy, and patent protection in various sectors. Argentina has made efforts to improve IP protection and enforcement, including legislative initiatives and bilateral engagement mechanisms. They seek access to the U.S. market for beef and lemons, as well as reinstatement of trade benefits under the GSP program. Argentina was suspended from GSP in 2012 for not paying arbitration awards to U.S. companies. The La Salada market in Buenos Aires is known as South America's largest black market for counterfeit products. Argentina was suspended from the GSP program in 2012 for failing to pay arbitration awards to U.S. companies but settled the disputes in 2013. In 2016, Argentina requested GSP designation again, citing economic reforms. U.S. officials expressed concerns about IPR protection and trade restrictions. In 2015, the WTO ruled against the U.S. for banning fresh beef imports. The U.S. banned fresh beef imports from Argentina due to a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. In 2015, the USDA allowed the import of fresh beef from Argentina after determining their food safety system was equivalent to the U.S. Some members of Congress opposed lifting the ban over concerns of FMD threatening the U.S. cattle supply, but the FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure did not include provisions to block the import. The FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure (P.L. 114-113) did not include a provision to block the import of fresh beef from Argentina due to foot-and-mouth disease. However, a provision required APHIS to establish a prioritization process for audits of countries with animal health recognition status. Another trade concern is the U.S. ban on lemon imports from northwest Argentina since 2001, which USDA proposed to lift in 2016. The USDA faced opposition from U.S. citrus growers regarding the import ban on lemons from Argentina due to the risk of spreading citrus disease. Despite efforts to block the importation rule in the FY2017 Agriculture appropriations bill, a final rule was issued by APHIS in December 2016. The Trump Administration temporarily delayed the rule twice in 2017 but ultimately allowed it to proceed in May 2017 after a meeting between President Trump and President Macri. The USDA faced opposition from U.S. citrus growers regarding the import ban on lemons from Argentina. Despite challenges, Argentine lemons were allowed to enter the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, with restrictions on the region. U.S. companies have significant investments in Argentina, with the Macri government implementing reforms to improve the investment climate. Under the Macri government, Argentina implemented reforms such as currency devaluation, reduction of import restrictions, and removal of export duties. Positive measures were taken by the Fern\u00e1ndez government, including settling international arbitral awards and reaching agreements with creditors. Argentina also settled outstanding awards with private creditors and an energy company in 2016. The 2001 default remains a significant issue in relations with the United States. Argentina's long-standing debt issue with the United States stemmed from an economic crisis in 2001, leading to a default on nearly $100 billion of debt. Over a decade, Argentina repaid the IMF in 2006 and other governments in 2014. President Macri prioritized resolving the default, reaching an agreement with holdout creditors in 2016 and paying $9.3 billion. Argentina resolved its default on debt owed to the Paris Club countries in 2016 by paying $9.3 billion to holdout creditors, ending a 15-year default. The Paris Club is a group of creditor governments that negotiates debt repayment with other countries. Argentina had previously defaulted on its Paris Club debt in 2001 and attempted negotiations in 2008 and 2010 without success. In 2014, facing economic difficulties, Argentina proposed a repayment plan to the Paris Club countries, leading to a multilateral agreement in May of that year. Argentina resolved its default on debt owed to the Paris Club countries in 2016 by paying $9.3 billion to holdout creditors, ending a 15-year default. A multilateral agreement was reached in May 2014 between the Argentine government and the Paris Club countries, setting out repayment terms for the outstanding $9.7 billion debt, including $608 million to the United States. Following the agreement, the United States signed a bilateral implementing agreement with Argentina in February 2015, lifting restrictions on assistance to Argentina. Argentina resolved its default on debt owed to the Paris Club countries in 2016 by paying $9.3 billion to holdout creditors, ending a 15-year default. Most of the defaulted debt held by private creditors was resolved through bond exchanges offered by the Argentine government in 2005 and 2010, with bondholders agreeing to participate despite unfavorable terms. In 2014, Argentina estimated that holdouts, mainly hedge funds, sought $15 billion in repayment for bonds bought at discounts after the 2001 default. Legal battles, primarily in the US, focused on bond contract interpretation. The consequential ruling in 2012 favored holdout creditors who argued that paying exchange bondholders while repudiating holdout bonds breached the pari passu clause. The ruling, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014, required Argentina to pay both groups to transfer interest payments. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, the Argentine government faced a difficult decision - pay the holdouts and exchange bondholders, or default on the exchange bonds debt. Despite transferring funds to pay restructured bondholders, intermediary banks couldn't process the payments, leading to a default declaration in 2014. The Fernandez government refused to negotiate with holdout creditors in June 2015. In 2015, the Argentine government refused to negotiate with holdout creditors, citing \"unwarranted attacks\" and legal actions against diplomatic assets. President Macri's administration in December 2015 shifted policy, aiming to strengthen the economy, attract foreign investment, and settle with holdouts. By early 2016, Argentina settled with Italian bondholders for $1.35 billion and two hedge funds for $1.1 billion, restarting negotiations with remaining holdouts. Argentina appealed to Judge Thomas Griesa to lift the injunction on paying holders of restructured bonds, citing willingness to negotiate with hedge funds. Griesa agreed, increasing pressure on holdouts to reach a deal. Argentina reached a deal with four hedge funds, including Elliott Management, providing 25% less than claimed but a significant gain. This brought agreements to 85% of disputed debt, with 115 individual creditors also settling with Argentina. Creditors holding defaulted sovereign bonds reached a settlement with Argentina in mid-March, requiring legislative action to repeal laws preventing payments to holdouts. The Argentine Congress approved the repeal in March, enabling the government to sell $16.5 billion in bonds on international markets in April. $9.3 billion of the proceeds were used to pay holdout creditors, leading to the lifting of injunctions by Griesa. Analysts see this as resolving Argentina's 15-year default, although it will impact the country's credit rating. Argentina's government sold $7 billion in bonds in January 2017, meeting most of its financing needs for the year. Demand was strong, but the government did not sell more bonds to maintain market credibility. Congress has expressed concern over the investigation of the 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires. H.Res. 201 would express support to the government. The House resolution in support of Argentina's investigation into the Israeli embassy bombing calls for U.S. assistance in bringing the perpetrators to justice. It also includes provisions for visa restrictions and asset blocking sanctions against those responsible for the 1994 AMIA bombing. Argentine Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was appointed in 2004 to lead the AMIA investigation, overcoming previous obstacles in prosecuting the perpetrators. The 1994 bombing prosecution was hindered by government mishandling. In 2004, a new investigation led by Alberto Nisman resulted in arrest warrants for Hezbollah militant Imad Mughniyah and Iranian officials. INTERPOL issued Red Notices for Mughniyah and five Iranians. In 2009, Argentina issued arrest warrants for Iranian officials and a Colombian citizen linked to the AMIA bombing. Argentina shifted its stance in 2011, willing to engage in dialogue with Iran despite their refusal to hand over suspects. Talks with Iran were held in 2012. In 2012, Argentina reached an agreement with Iran to establish a joint Truth Commission to review the AMIA bombing case. Despite opposition from Jewish groups and US Congress members, the agreement was approved by Argentina's Congress in February 2013. In May 2013, Nisman issued a report alleging Iran's involvement in the bombing. In May 2013, Nisman issued a report alleging Iran's extensive intelligence operations in Latin America, with Mohsen Rabbani as the key figure coordinating activities in multiple countries. The report linked the 1994 AMIA bombing to Iran's regional strategy of establishing intelligence bases through political, religious, and cultural institutions. An Argentine court later declared the joint investigation agreement with Iran unconstitutional in May 2014. The court declared the agreement with Iran to investigate the AMIA bombing unconstitutional. Special Prosecutor Nisman accused the government of interfering with the judiciary. President Fern\u00e1ndez supported the agreement and planned to appeal the ruling. Nisman later accused Fern\u00e1ndez of trying to cover up the investigation for economic gain. Following the court's declaration of the Iran agreement as unconstitutional, Special Prosecutor Nisman accused the government of interference. President Fern\u00e1ndez supported the agreement and faced accusations of a cover-up for economic gain. Nisman's sudden death, believed by many to be murder, led to calls for the dissolution of Argentina's Intelligence Secretariat and the establishment of a new intelligence service. In the aftermath of Nisman's death, Argentina's attorney general appointed a team of four lawyers in February 2015 to continue the work of the AMIA investigation. Court proceedings began in Buenos Aires in August 2015 against 13 former officials alleged to be involved in efforts to cover up the 1994 bombing investigation, including former President Carlos Menem and other officials. President Macri dropped an appeal started by the Fern\u00e1ndez government after his election in 2015. President Macri dropped an appeal against a 2014 court ruling declaring the agreement with Iran to jointly investigate the AMIA bombing unconstitutional. He established a special unit to investigate the bombing and Judge Fabiana Palmaghini took over the investigation of Nisman's death in December 2015. President Macri ordered the declassification of all state documents on the anniversary of Nisman's death in January 2016. President Macri declassified state information related to Nisman's death in January 2016. Judge Palmaghini ruled the case should be elevated to federal courts after Stiuso testified Nisman was killed by a group with ties to former President Fern\u00e1ndez. The case went back and forth between jurisdictions until September 2016 when it was elevated to federal courts again. Macri believes Nisman was murdered and calls for a definitive investigation by Argentina's justice system. President Macri declassified state information related to Nisman's death in January 2016. An Argentine court reopened the case against former President Fern\u00e1ndez and other officials for whitewashing Iran's involvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing. Macri's government implemented market-friendly economic policies, triggering an economic downturn in 2016 but leading to more sustainable growth in 2017. In 2016, Argentina's GDP declined by 2.3%, but there is a forecast for 2.2% growth in 2017 under President Macri's reform agenda. The government may face challenges due to a minority in Congress, especially with upcoming legislative elections in October 2017. Macri's administration has improved relations with neighboring countries and the UK, while also addressing the situation in Venezuela. U.S.-Argentine relations have significantly improved compared to the previous administration. The Macri government has shown a strong commitment to positive bilateral relations with the US, highlighted by President Obama's visit in 2016 and President Macri's visit to the White House in 2017. Relations have continued to be positive under the Trump Administration, with discussions on trade, investment, cyber policy, and Venezuela. Members of Congress have expressed support for the partnership between Argentina and the United States. The resolution in June upheld the partnership between Argentina and the United States, urging the State Department to coordinate a new strategy for increased cooperation in various areas. Congressional documents and reports on human rights and terrorism were referenced. The curr_chunk provides links to various reports on Argentina, including Country Reports on Terrorism, Doing Business in Argentina, International Religious Freedom Report, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, and Investment Climate Statement. The curr_chunk contains links to reports on Argentina's investment climate and foreign trade barriers in 2016 and 2017 by the Department of State and the Office of the United States Trade Representative."
