    "content": "The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution sets the convening date for a new Congress at noon on January 3 in odd-numbered years, unless specified otherwise by law. Recent Congresses have often started on dates other than January 3, with the 113th Congress setting the convening date for the 114th Congress as January 6, 2015. Congressional leaders planned for the 115th Congress to convene on January 3, 2017, and the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. The 107th, 113th, and 115th Congresses began on January 3, while other Congresses started on different dates. The Vice President presides over the Senate's first session, leading the Pledge of Allegiance and announcing the election certificates of Senators. The first order of business in a new Senate is the swearing-in of Senators elected or reelected in the most recent general election and of newly appointed Senators. The Vice President lays the certificates of election and appointment before the Senate, and Senators take the oath in alphabetical order. Senators are sworn in by taking an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. The oath is the same for Representatives and appointees, and is mandated by Article VI of the Constitution. Senators raise their right hand and repeat the oath after the Vice President. Some Senators hold a family Bible or another item during the ceremony. After Senators are sworn in with an oath to support the Constitution, they may hold a Bible or another item. Photography is not allowed on the Senate floor, but photographers are present for the ceremonial swearing-in. The Vice President then calls for a roll call to establish a quorum for conducting business. The majority leader notifies the President and the House that a quorum is present in the Senate to conduct business. The President pro tempore, chosen by the Senate, presides in the absence of the Vice President. When there is a change in party control or a vacancy, a new President pro tempore is elected by simple resolution. The Senate elects a new President pro tempore by simple resolution, who is then sworn in by the Vice President. Changes in Senate party leadership occur in party conference meetings before opening day or at another time, without the need for floor votes. Senate officers do not need to be reelected at the start of a new Congress, but new officers are approved by the full Senate in case of party control change or vacancy. The Senate elects new officers at the beginning of each Congress, including the President pro tempore and party secretaries. Changes in leadership are made through party conferences. Legal counsel and deputy legal counsel are appointed every four years. The Senate notifies the President and the House of these appointments. The Senate conducts organizational business at the start of each Congress, including the election of officers and adoption of standing orders. These orders address various procedures such as time limits for roll-call votes and additional speaking time for party leaders. The Senate conducts organizational business at the start of each Congress, including the election of officers and adoption of standing orders. This includes allowing Senators to designate staff members for floor access, referring treaties and nominations upon receipt, and introducing bills and resolutions by taking them to the desk. The Senate operates as a continuing body with staggered six-year terms for Senators. The Senate, as a continuing body, does not need to re-adopt its rules with each new Congress. Specific activities, such as joint sessions to count electoral votes, may occur on the first day of a new Congress. In the 106th Congress, announcements and discussions were made regarding the pending impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. The Senate might address the legislative schedule and other issues, adopt resolutions, and set dates for introducing bills and considering legislation. In the 112th Congress, the Senate passed resolutions honoring Senator Barbara Mikulski and allowing the Capitol Rotunda to be used for a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address. Additionally, a working group was established to streamline the confirmation process for nominees to lower-level executive branch positions. The Senate follows a tradition of reserving bill numbers S. 1 through S. 10 for the majority party and S. 11 through S. 20 for the minority party. In the 114th Congress, Senator John Hoeven introduced S. 1 with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's support, addressing party priorities for economic, energy, health, social, and national security policies. The majority leader immediately began proceedings to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. The Senate adjourned before convening, and there was a failed attempt to make initial assignments to a committee. A resolution was passed to honor former Senator Edward W. Brooke III. The Senate will proceed with organizational proceedings and other activities after completing its tasks. Following the sine die adjournment of the preceding Congress, the Senate receives messages from the House, President, and executive departments. New messages are also received, such as from the House on its convening and election of officers. Administrative notices and records appear in the opening-day Congressional Record. Negotiations over committee sizes and assignments begin before the new Congress convenes, mainly within party groups. The only visible action on the chamber floor is the adoption of simple resolutions. On the opening day of the 107th Congress, committee assignments were made for Senators from each party. This included designating committee chairs due to the special circumstance of a split Senate. Committee funding resolutions are typically considered later in February or early March. In years with a new President, Senate committees start hearings on Cabinet secretaries before formal nominations are submitted."
