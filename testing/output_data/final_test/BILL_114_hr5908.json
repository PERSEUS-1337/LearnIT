    "content": "The \"Federal Employee Accountability Act of 2016\" or \"FEAA\" allows for reduction in grade, pay, or removal of civil service employees for misconduct or poor performance. The \"Federal Employee Accountability Act of 2016\" defines an employee as an individual in the civil service, excluding certain positions like those in the Executive Schedule or Senior Executive Service. The \"Federal Employee Accountability Act of 2016\" defines key terms such as grade, misconduct, and pay. It also specifies that the subchapter applies to reductions in grade or pay, and removals, with exceptions for certain situations outlined in sections 7512, 7521, 7532, 3592, 3595, 7543, and 713 of title 38. Section 7553 of title 38 allows the head of an agency to remove, reduce grade, or reduce pay of an employee. Appeals for such actions can be made to the Merit Systems Protection Board within seven days. Upon receipt of an appeal under subsection (c), the Merit Systems Protection Board shall refer the appeal to an administrative judge who will expedite the case and issue a final decision within 45 days. The agency must provide necessary information for the appeal process. The decision of the administrative judge is final and not subject to further appeal. The administrative judge must issue a final decision within 45 days of receiving an appeal. If this deadline cannot be met, any reduction in grade or pay or removal is final. The Merit Systems Protection Board must report to Congress within 14 days in such cases. No stay is allowed on any reduction in grade or pay or removal. Employees appealing a removal cannot receive pay or awards until a final decision is made.

The text chunk provides definitions and actions covered under subchapter VI of chapter 75, including reduction in grade or removal of an employee. Conforming amendments are made to Title 5, United States Code, to reflect these changes. The text chunk amends sections in Title 5, United States Code, to include actions such as reduction in grade or pay, and removal under subchapter VI of chapter 75."
