    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12814.6 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require provisional licensing for drivers aged 16 to under 21, with specific program components. Upon application for an original license, the applicant shall be issued an instruction permit under Section 12509. The permit allows the person to operate a motor vehicle, excluding motorcycles or motorized bicycles, while taking driver training instruction or practicing it under the supervision of a licensed driver 25 years or older. The person must hold the instruction permit for at least six months before applying for a provisional driver's license. To obtain a driver's license in California, a person must complete approved courses in driver education or training in a secondary school, or an integrated program approved by the department. The program must include 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours of behind-the-wheel training. To obtain a driver's license in California, completion of six hours or more of behind-the-wheel instruction by a licensed driving school or instructor, along with an accredited course in automobile driver education in a secondary school or equivalent professional instruction meeting department standards, is required. This exempts the individual from needing to fulfill additional requirements to graduate from high school. A student must complete driver education before taking driver training instruction, with exceptions outlined in subparagraph (B). The person must complete 50 hours of supervised driving practice, including 10 hours of driving during darkness, before getting a provisional license. A certification from a parent, spouse, guardian, or driving instructor is required for the license application. If the person doesn't have a guardian, a licensed driver 25 years or older can provide the certification. This requirement does not apply to motorcycle practice. During the first 12 months of having a provisional license, the licensee must not drive between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or transport passengers under 20 years old unless accompanied by a licensed adult. During the first 12 months of having a provisional license, the licensee must not drive between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or transport passengers under 20 years old unless accompanied by a licensed adult. Exceptions include medical necessity with a physician's statement and schooling or school-authorized activities when transportation facilities are inadequate. The licensee must have a signed statement from the school principal or employer with a probable completion date for schooling or employment. Licensees aged 18-20 can use a class or work schedule as documentation. This is necessary when transportation facilities are inadequate and driving is essential for employment. The licensee can operate a vehicle if transportation is inadequate for themselves or immediate family members, with a signed statement from a parent or legal guardian. Emancipated minors are also allowed to drive. Law enforcement cannot stop a vehicle solely to check for violations of driving restrictions. Upon violation of driving restrictions, the court may impose community service or fines. Community service hours must be completed as ordered by the court. If community service hours are not completed within 90 days, fines of up to $35 for a first offense and up to $50 for subsequent offenses may be imposed. A conviction under certain circumstances will not be disclosed or count as a violation point. Driving privileges may be suspended until notifications are cleared. A 30-day restriction is imposed on drivers with two or more violation points in 12 months, requiring them to be accompanied by a licensed driver 25 years or older. A six-month suspension and one-year probation is imposed for three or more points, with conditions including no law violations and remaining accident-free. The person must remain accident-free and can request a hearing within 10 days if the department takes action due to a motor vehicle accident. If the department's action is based on a reportable conviction, the person does not have the right to a hearing. The department requires proof of financial responsibility from a person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege, to be submitted before reinstatement and maintained for three years. The department may issue distinctive driver's licenses to individuals aged 16-18 and 18-21 with unique features for immediate recognition. Changes in license format can be made under new production contracts. The Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997 requires the original issuance date of the provisional driver's license to be included on the license. No reimbursement is needed for this act as it pertains to creating new crimes or infractions."
