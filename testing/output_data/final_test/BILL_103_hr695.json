This office focuses on conducting research on women's health issues. The Office of Research on Women's Health is established within the NIH to identify and support research projects on women's health, including multidisciplinary research and focusing on the aging process in women, with priority given to menopause. The Director of the Office promotes coordination and collaboration among research entities. The Office of Research on Women's Health at NIH supports research projects on women's health, encourages research by funded entities, recommends research agendas, promotes resource allocation, ensures women's representation in clinical research, and establishes a Coordinating Committee on Research on Women's Health. The Coordinating Committee on Research on Women's Health, composed of Directors of national research institutes, assists in identifying research needs and coordinating activities for women's health research. The Director of the Office serves as the chair of the Committee. The Coordinating Committee on Research on Women's Health, composed of Directors of national research institutes, assists in identifying research needs and coordinating activities for women's health research. The Director of the Office serves as the chair of the Committee. The extramural multidisciplinary activities include supporting the development of methodologies for obtaining data specific to women in clinical trials, expanding clinical trials for treatments and therapies, and encouraging national research institutes to conduct and support such research. An Advisory Committee is established to assist in these efforts. The Director of the Office establishes an Advisory Committee on Research on Women's Health, composed of 12-18 individuals with expertise in women's health research. The majority of the committee members must be women, and the Director serves as the chair. The Advisory Committee advises the Director of the Office on research activities related to women's health, gender differences in drug trials, disease etiology and treatment, obstetrical and gynecological health, and multidisciplinary women's health conditions. The Advisory Committee advises the Director on research activities related to women's health, gender differences in drug trials, disease etiology, and treatment. They provide recommendations on Office activities, assist in monitoring compliance with including women in clinical research, and prepare biennial reports on their findings. The Advisory Committee advises the Director on research activities related to women's health, gender differences in drug trials, disease etiology, and treatment. They provide recommendations on Office activities, assist in monitoring compliance with including women in clinical research, and prepare biennial reports on their findings.

The term 'women's health conditions' refers to diseases, disorders, and conditions unique to, more serious, or more prevalent in women, with different medical risk factors or interventions. Research on women's health involves studying these conditions and addressing the lack of clinical research and data on women. Research on women's health includes studying conditions unique to women and preventing such conditions. The National Data System and Clearinghouse on Research on Women's Health is established under SEC. 486A. This system aims to centralize and disseminate research findings on women's health conditions and prevention efforts. The Director of NIH, in consultation with the Office Director, establishes a data system for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating information on women's health research. This system includes a registry of clinical trials for experimental treatments, detailing subject criteria, demographics, and trial locations. The Director of NIH, in consultation with the Office Director, establishes a data system for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating information on women's health research. Principal investigators of clinical trials must provide trial site locations to the registry within 30 days. After completion, they must report trial results and any associated adverse effects. Additionally, a program will be created to provide information on research and prevention activities related to women's health. \"SEC. 486B. BIENNIAL REPORT.\" The Director of the Office of Women's Health must prepare a biennial report on research progress, professional status of women physicians and scientists, expenditures, and recommendations for legislative and administrative initiatives. The Director of the Office of Women's Health prepares a biennial report on research progress, professional status of women physicians and scientists, expenditures, and recommendations for legislative and administrative initiatives, which is submitted to the Director of NIH for inclusion in a report to the President and Congress. \"Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Women's Health.\" The text authorizes appropriations for research on women's health at the National Institutes of Health, ensuring sufficient allocation of resources for such projects. The National Institutes of Health authorizes appropriations for research on women's health, including establishing an obstetrics and gynecology program within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development."
