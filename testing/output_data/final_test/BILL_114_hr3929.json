The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was America's first strategic intelligence effort during World War II, laying the foundation for modern American intelligence and special operations. OSS founder General William J. Donovan, the only person to receive the nation's four highest decorations, was praised as a hero by President Eisenhower. Donovan also served as an emissary to Great Britain at the request of President Roosevelt. The OSS, America's first strategic intelligence effort in WWII, had military branches contributing personnel. Special Operations Forces, U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Army Special Forces, and Air Force Special Operations Command trace their lineage to the OSS. Marines like Sterling Hayden and Col. William Eddy were part of the OSS. The OSS, precursor to Marine Special Operations Command, played a crucial role in WWII by organizing resistance groups in Europe and Asia. General Eisenhower praised their covert efforts in France, equating it to an extra military division. Four future CIA directors served as OSS officers. Women, including Virginia Hall and Julia Child, played a significant role in the OSS during WWII. Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat, became America's top spy against the Nazis. Leading scientists and scholars like Ralph Bunche and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. served in the OSS Research and Analysis Branch. The OSS, which included future presidents of historical and economic associations, as well as Nobel laureates, had its roots in the OSS Research and Analysis Branch. James Donovan, General Counsel of the OSS, negotiated the release of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. The OSS also developed new technology through its Research and Development Branch, including the invention of SCUBA by Dr. Christian Lambertsen. The OSS, known today as SCUBA, pioneered unconventional warfare in Burma with a large guerrilla army. It had the highest kill/loss ratio in American military history and received a Presidential Unit Citation. The X-2 branch established modern counterintelligence and built enduring Cold War alliances. Operation Torch in French North Africa was aided by OSS networks and information. During World War II, the OSS conducted daring rescue missions and saved thousands of lives, including downed airmen in Yugoslavia and Allied prisoners of war from Japanese execution. General Donovan praised the OSS members for their bravery, but they have not received collective recognition for their heroic service. The OSS members during World War II conducted daring rescue missions and saved thousands of lives, including downed airmen and Allied prisoners of war. General Donovan praised their bravery, but they have not received collective recognition for their heroic service, leading to the proposal of a Congressional Gold Medal. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to honor the members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) for their exceptional service during World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the gold medal, and it will be given to the Smithsonian Institution after the award ceremony. The gold medal awarded to the Office of Strategic Services will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and available for research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other relevant locations. The Secretary is authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering all costs. The medals are considered national medals and numismatic items under specific codes."
