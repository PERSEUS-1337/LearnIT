However, ecological conditions have deteriorated due to various factors like land-use changes, pollution, overfishing, and invasive species, leading to economic impacts and habitat loss. The Chesapeake Bay has faced ecological deterioration due to factors like pollution, habitat loss, and overfishing. Restoration efforts began in the 1980s, led by federal agencies and the EPA. Congress continues to monitor restoration progress towards 2025 goals. The Bay serves as a model for estuary restoration in the US. The Chesapeake Bay watershed spans six states and DC, covering 64,000 square miles with over 100,000 streams and rivers flowing into the Bay. It has a unique land-to-water ratio of 14:1 and an average depth of 26-33 feet, with some troughs reaching 174 feet deep. The Bay's waters are a mix of freshwater and saltwater, with the Susquehanna River alone supplying 45% of the Bay's freshwater. The Chesapeake Bay watershed is home to over 3,600 species of plants, fish, and animals, including many threatened or endangered species. The Bay region attracts at least 140 species of birds and 1 million waterfowl annually. With a growing population expected to reach 20 million by 2030, the Bay's economy relies on seafood, tourism, recreation, and real estate. The Chesapeake Bay contributes significantly to the economies of Maryland and Virginia through industries like commercial fishing, shipbuilding, tourism, and real estate. Reports estimate the Bay's economic value at $678 billion annually, with the commercial seafood industry alone landing over 440 million pounds of seafood valued at nearly $300 million in 2016. Additionally, the Chesapeake Bay watershed provides ecosystem services valued at $107 billion per year, including food production, climate stability, water supply, and recreation. The Chesapeake Bay's aesthetic value is worth over $38 billion per year, the largest component of its total economic value. The Bay has undergone natural and man-made changes, with trends towards loss of forests, wetlands, and underwater vegetation, and increases in agricultural, urban, and suburban development. Forest, wetlands, and underwater vegetation play crucial roles in regulating water flow, providing habitat for wildlife, and filtering contaminants. The watershed was once fully forested but became primarily used for agriculture by the early 1900s. Forested areas now cover about 55% of the watershed, with the remaining land cover divided between agricultural and urban/mixed uses. The Chesapeake Bay has seen a decline in wetlands and underwater vegetation since the 1960s, but this trend is now reversing. In 2017, scientists found the highest amount of submerged aquatic vegetation in the Bay since 1984, estimated at over 100,000 acres. Deforestation, agriculture, and urban development have led to increased sediment loads and nutrient pollution in the Bay, affecting its water resources. Land-use changes have reduced the Bay ecosystem's ability to regulate and filter sediment, accelerating water flow into water bodies. Land-use changes in the Chesapeake Bay accelerate water flow, increase erosion, and transport sediment, leading to higher sedimentation rates. Sediment can lower light penetration, transport contaminants and excess nutrients, and cause navigational hazards. Excess nutrients from sources like agricultural and urban runoff can lead to algae blooms and harmful algal blooms, posing threats to human and aquatic health. The decomposition of algal blooms can lead to dead zones harmful to aquatic life due to low oxygen levels. Changes in land use can increase nutrient concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay, with high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus added during periods of heavy rain. Since 1985, an annual dead zone of 1.7 cubic miles has been observed, with a forecasted larger dead zone of 1.9 cubic miles in 2018 due to increased nutrient loads from high spring rainfall. Chesapeake Bay waters and sediments contain various contaminants, including potentially toxic metals. Chemical contaminants, such as metals and organics, in Bay waters and sediments can harm humans and wildlife. They can lead to infectious diseases, endocrine disruption, and impaired reproduction in wildlife. These contaminants can accumulate in fish tissue, posing a risk to humans who consume fish. Mercury and PCBs are commonly found contaminants. Industry, vehicle air pollution, runoff, and wastewater discharge contribute to the presence of these toxic chemicals in the Chesapeake Bay. Approximately 80% of the Bay's tidal-water segments were impaired in 2014. Annual commercial harvests of fisheries species in the Chesapeake Bay doubled between 1950 and 1990 but have since decreased. Factors like changes in gear technology, regulations, and environmental conditions may have influenced the fluctuation in harvests. Oysters, a popular recreational fishery and economic resource, were worth over $46 million in commercial harvests in 2016. They also play a vital role in improving ecological conditions in the Bay. The oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay rose steeply in the late 1800s, reaching over 120 million pounds, but began to decline in the early 1900s due to diseases, habitat loss, and overfishing. By the 1990s and 2000s, harvests were less than 1 million pounds, but since 2007, landings have increased to almost 5 million pounds in 2016. Blue crabs, commercially and recreationally harvested, have also been affected by habitat loss and overharvesting, with commercial harvests reaching a high of over 110 million pounds in 1993 and a low of approximately 42 million pounds in 1955. The Chesapeake Bay and its watershed are home to thousands of plant and animal species, including many threatened or endangered species. The Bay faces challenges such as habitat loss, disease, and toxins, impacting wildlife populations. Efforts are being made to address invasive species like nutria, which have negative effects on native plants and wildlife. Efforts by NGOs to remove invasive nutria from the Chesapeake Bay began in 2002 and were completed by 2016, with ongoing monitoring. Restoring the Bay ecosystem is complex due to its large watershed, involving various stakeholders and jurisdictions. Cooperation between federal and state agencies, tribes, local governments, NGOs, and private stakeholders is crucial for successful restoration efforts. Congressional involvement in Bay restoration dates back to the 1960s, driven by public and stakeholder pressure. Government involvement in Bay restoration began with Congress ordering reports from the US Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA to address issues such as fisheries decline, water pollution, and water quality control in the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) was established in 1983 to coordinate federal restoration activities, with Congress codifying it in 1987 under the Clean Water Act. The CBP is a partnership of federal, state, and local agencies, tribes, academic institutions, and NGOs, with restoration activities implemented through individual agency programs and state authorities. The CBP's organization is driven by individual agency program authorizations and state involvement. The program's structure has evolved over time to adapt to changing partners, agreements, and priorities. The Executive Council leads CBP activities, supported by the Principals' Staff Committee and five groups working towards Agreement goals. Three Advisory Committees provide additional input, with federal agency representatives involved at all levels of the organization. Federal agency representatives are actively involved in various committees within the CBP organization, including the Executive Council, Principals' Staff Committee, Management Board, Goal Implementation Teams, and Science, Technical Analysis, and Reporting group. EPA is considered the lead federal agency for implementing the program as directed by Congress. The EPA Chesapeake Bay Program office is staffed by employees from federal and state agencies, academic institutions, and NGOs. Federal agencies partner with EPA through formal memoranda of understanding and coordinate through the Federal Leadership Committee. These agencies have authorities to implement restoration programs and activities in the Bay. Federal agencies have authorities to implement restoration programs and activities in the Chesapeake Bay. State restoration efforts are coordinated through the CBP Executive Council, with EPA aiding states in developing action plans. Congress continues to assess the federal role in Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts. Efforts for Chesapeake Bay restoration are ongoing, and Congress may need to consider the federal role, funding availability, and progress. Questions arise about federal involvement in the multi-jurisdictional ecosystem restoration initiative. Despite various frameworks and agreements, there is no comprehensive plan for coordination of restoration efforts. The ecosystem restoration plan aims to coordinate efforts for Chesapeake Bay restoration. There are three guiding documents and one draft plan in place, each covering different jurisdictions and varying in implementation. The extent to which these plans guide restoration efforts is unclear, with differences in leadership and relation to each other. The 2018 USACE draft comprehensive plan lacks specific timelines, goals, or objectives, unlike the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement which aligns with the 2010 E.O. strategy. Stakeholders use the plans differently, with some suggesting the 2018 draft USACE plan could guide federal restoration efforts. The future role of the 2010 E.O. strategy is uncertain under the Trump Administration. Some stakeholders have differing views on the effectiveness of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement compared to the 2010 TMDL. Congress may need to consider if the current plans integrate efforts effectively and if changes are needed in leadership and enforcement. Congress may examine the federal government's role in restoration efforts in the Chesapeake Bay, including partnerships with state and local stakeholders. The roles of federal and state agencies in Bay restoration are not clearly defined by law, unlike other initiatives. The federal government's role in managing restoration of the Chesapeake Bay has been challenged by some stakeholders and Members of Congress, who argue that it has overreached its authority. This contrasts with other restoration initiatives, like the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration, where the State of Florida has formal duties under law. Coordination in the Chesapeake Bay is largely achieved through voluntary agreements, leading to disputes over the extent of the EPA's authority in regulating land use. The Third Circuit of Appeals found that the EPA acted within its authority regarding the TMDL. The FY2019 House appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit EPA funding for actions against watershed states and DC if TMDL goals were not met. The Trump Administration urged the Chesapeake Bay states and DC to continue restoration efforts, while some stakeholders support federal government involvement and increased funding for restoration activities. The federal government conducts restoration activities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed under various authorities, but Congress has not authorized restoration work under a single comprehensive law. Some restoration work is authorized under Chesapeake Bay-specific laws and regulations, such as the EPA maintaining the Chesapeake Bay Program and offering restoration-related grants. Congress has also authorized federal agencies to perform general activities applicable to the Chesapeake Bay, like the Clean Water Act. Some stakeholders argue for specific federal authority and organizing structures to enhance efficiency in Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts, citing examples like the Great Lakes Task Force and South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. Others believe coordination among federal agencies is unnecessary as restoration activities are already authorized under general authorities. Congress is considering funding allocation for Chesapeake Bay restoration, complicated by multiple federal programs and states involved. Tracking federal spending on restoration has been challenging due to discretionary funding and lack of specific allocation for the Bay. The federal government allocated between $460 million and $570 million per year for Chesapeake Bay restoration activities from FY2014 to FY2017, as reported in the Chesapeake Bay crosscut reports. Congress enacted the Chesapeake Bay Accountability and Recovery Act in 2014 to track costs related to Bay restoration. The federal government allocated between $460 million and $570 million per year for Chesapeake Bay restoration activities from FY2014 to FY2017. EPA and USDA provided the most funding, with EPA distributing two-thirds through grants to state and local partners. Stakeholders have differing views on funding levels for Chesapeake Bay restoration. Some stakeholders argue that federal funding is crucial for successful Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts, while others believe that states should take financial responsibility. The Trump Administration proposed cutting EPA funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program in FY2018, suggesting that states and local entities should fund restoration efforts. In FY2019, the Administration requested $7.3 million for state and local water quality monitoring and science coordination activities. The Chesapeake Bay restoration effort may have a higher chance of consistent funding if the authorization for funding is current. Stakeholders argue that federal restoration efforts could receive more funding if all activities were organized under one law. Great Lakes restoration received significant appropriations between FY2012 and FY2016. Some disagree, suggesting that consolidating all restoration activities under one authorization could make them a target for funding decreases. Having restoration efforts spread across several authorities could be more advantageous for funding. Cost estimates for restoring the Bay range from $7 billion for individual states to $28 billion for the entire watershed, with additional annual maintenance costs. Stakeholders believe the social and economic benefits will justify the cost, which is likely to be less now than in the future. Some stakeholders question the justification for funding Bay restoration due to lack of comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. Progress towards goals in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement is periodically evaluated, but it remains unclear if goals are being met. Stakeholders are concerned about the progress of restoring the Chesapeake Bay. The progress of Chesapeake Bay restoration is periodically evaluated through various assessments with differing results. Goals set in past agreements have been largely missed, prompting the need for ongoing tracking and evaluation. In 2016-2017, progress was made in five goals for Chesapeake Bay restoration, including sustainable fisheries. The EPA's midpoint assessment in July 2018 showed progress in phosphorus and sediment reductions but not in nitrogen reduction. Non-federal evaluations have been critical of the restoration progress, with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation rating the Bay at 34 out of 100 in 2016. The Chesapeake Bay has shown some improvement in nutrient levels, but water clarity and nitrogen levels remain a concern. Stakeholders have varying opinions on the progress of Bay restoration efforts, with some seeing stable or minor improvements as positive, while others believe more needs to be done despite the current ratings. Some stakeholders believe the Chesapeake Bay has shown progress in maintaining a stable ecosystem despite challenges like population growth and nutrient loads. However, there are differing opinions on the pace of improvement and the possibility of restoring the Bay to a pristine level. Oversight on Bay health and restoration efforts has been provided by Congress, GAO, and the EPA Office of Inspector General since 1983. The oversight on Chesapeake Bay health and restoration efforts by various entities like Congress, GAO, and EPA OIG has led to recommendations for independent evaluation and periodic assessments. Stakeholders have suggested the creation of an outside review group or internal audit committee within the CBP to ensure accountability. The use of a one-time National Academy of Science evaluation in 2011 was seen as insufficient for long-term accountability. Congress directed EPA to appoint an independent evaluator in 2014. In 2014, Congress directed EPA to appoint an independent evaluator to report findings and recommendations to Congress biannually under the Chesapeake Bay Accountability and Recovery Act (CBARA). The implementation of an independent evaluator was put on hold in June 2018 pending direction from the Principle Staff Committee."
