    "content": "Congress is considering legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which could impact the competitiveness of energy- or greenhouse gas-intensive industries. Competitiveness is a complex and evolving concept influenced by various factors such as productivity, market demand, resource costs, and government policies. Changes in cost structures and industry profitability are common in a market-based economy. The profitability of Australia's labour-intensive traded industries is affected by domestic policies and international competition, making it challenging to compete with foreign producers. Industries face price sensitivity and increased manufacturing costs, such as carbon emission reduction requirements, which impact competitiveness. Energy-intensive industries face additional challenges due to varying energy price increases among competitors. The addition of a carbon control regime to competitive dynamics in industries may lead to concerns about the impact on energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. If the United States adopts a carbon control policy, industries controlling emissions or facing rising energy costs may become less competitive globally, potentially leading to a shift in production and undermining U.S. carbon reduction efforts. The potential shift in production due to carbon control policies may lead to \"carbon leakage,\" where U.S. carbon reductions are offset by increased production in less regulated countries. Legislation has included strategies to address this issue, such as providing assistance to greenhouse gas-intensive industries and imposing tariffs on certain imported goods. H.R. 2454 contains both of these strategies. The report examines the dynamics of this issue, including the EU's cap-and-trade program. The EU has been implementing a cap-and-trade program for four years, with a third reduction phase finalized from 2013 to 2020. The report reviews the EU's efforts to address concerns about energy-intensive industries and analyzes the House-passed American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454) provisions. There are concerns about potential WTO implications of the border measure in H.R. 2454. The report analyzes the potential WTO implications of implementing a subsidy or border measure under H.R. 2454. The EU's Emissions Trading System covers energy-intensive facilities across 27 Member countries, including various industries. Aviation is also being phased into the ETS. Covered entities emit a significant portion of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions, excluding certain sectors like transportation. The EU's Emissions Trading System aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 20% of the EU's total emissions. It operates in phases, with Phase 1 from 2005-2007, Phase 2 from 2008 (Kyoto Protocol period), and Phase 3 starting in 2013. The EU-ETS was established in 2003 to meet Kyoto Protocol targets, with the objective of achieving a reduction of 3.3 percentage points of the required 8% reduction by 2012. The system's importance increased with the accession of 12 additional countries to the EU from 2004-2007. The EU's Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and operates in phases. The overall emissions cap for the EU-27 is set at 2.08 billion metric tons of CO2 annually for the Kyoto compliance period. The second phase of the ETS builds on the experience gained from the first phase, establishing critical infrastructure for a functional emission market. The European Commission believes that the \"learning by doing\" exercise in Phase 1 prepared the community for achieving the reduction requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. The ETS experienced early challenges due to inadequate emissions data infrastructure, but Phase 1 improved critical elements for Phase 2 implementation. The ETS also helped boost project-based mechanisms like the CDM and JI under the Kyoto Protocol. External credits from the Linking Directive invigorated CO2 reduction projects in developing countries. Phase 1 also influenced corporate behavior, with stakeholders incorporating the value of allowances in decision-making, especially in the electric utility sector. The value of allowances is crucial in decision-making, especially in the electric utility sector. 70% of firms price allowances into daily operations and 87% into future pricing decisions. Various manufacturing activities in the UK are sensitive to carbon pricing, with industries like lime, cement, and steel covered by the ETS. The cost impact of a 20 euro carbon price on manufacturing processes is outlined in Figure 1. The European Union's pricing policy for carbon emissions includes a 20 euro carbon price impacting direct and indirect costs in different sectors. Nine eastern European Member States initially opposed auctioning 100% of allowances, leading to some free allocation during Phase 3 starting in 2013. The ETS will cover petrochemicals, ammonia, aluminum, nitrous oxide, and perfluorocarbon emissions. The European Union's pricing policy for carbon emissions includes a 20 euro carbon price impacting various sectors. Industries like petrochemicals, ammonia, aluminum, nitrous oxide, and perfluorocarbon emissions will be added to those already covered. Most industries will receive some free allocation of allowances under the Phase 3 agreement, except for electric powerplants. Certain eastern European Member States may receive a temporary derogation allowing for free allocation of allowances for powerplants meeting specific criteria. The European Union's pricing policy for carbon emissions includes a 20 euro carbon price impacting various sectors. Industries will receive some free allocation of allowances under the Phase 3 agreement, except for electric powerplants. The allocation for most covered entities will decline gradually, reaching zero by 2027. Energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries will have provisions for free allocation decreasing each year, aiming for no free allocation by 2027. Phase 3 of the EU's carbon pricing policy includes provisions to assist energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries with emissions control costs. Eligible installations will receive allowances to cover 100% of their direct emissions if using efficient technology. The EC will review its decision by June 30, 2010, and propose any necessary adjustments. The EU's Phase 3 carbon pricing policy aims to assist energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries with emissions control costs. Member States may provide assistance for indirect emissions costs, compensating installations at risk of carbon leakage. Allowances have been allocated free to entities under the ETS, with the option to auction a percentage in each phase. The EU's Phase 3 carbon pricing policy aims to assist industries with emissions control costs. Only four countries used auctions in Phase 1, with Denmark auctioning the full 5%. There is opposition to significant auctioning due to the preference for free allocation of allowances. Despite concerns about windfall profits, little change in allocation philosophy is seen. In Phase 2, most countries do not propose auctioning allowances, citing concerns about equity and potential economic impacts. Studies show that the ETS had no competitiveness impact during Phase 1, according to the International Energy Agency. The International Energy Agency (IEA) explains that the lack of leakage in sectors like steel, cement, aluminum, and refineries under the EU-ETS is attributed to free allocation of allowances, long-term electricity contracts, and price booms in traded products. The short time span of these policies hinders observation of their full effects on industry. The Carbon Trust also notes that the current free allocation of emissions allowances offsets potential impacts. The Carbon Trust and The Climate Group for The German Marshall Fund echo that free allocation of emissions allowances offsets additional costs of the ETS. The EC believes the ETS has led to the incorporation of carbon prices in EU corporate decision-making. A survey by Point Carbon shows companies are factoring in the long-term price of carbon in their future investment decisions, with the power and pulp and paper sectors considering it most decisive. The Point Carbon survey of EU-ETS companies shows that while some industries have considered moving production due to carbon pricing, over 80% have not. The EU has extended free allocation of allowances to energy-intensive sectors. The Climate Group's analysis also confirms that costs are increasing for some firms, but the overall impact is limited. The survey found that while costs are increasing for some firms, there is little evidence of impact on competitiveness. Concerns remain about the future as free allowances decrease and CO2 costs affect electricity prices. Aluminum smelters are sensitive to electricity costs, and the pass-through of CO2 costs could influence future production decisions. Companies have not relocated or reduced their workforce due to carbon pricing. A market price for carbon has had a low impact on top management, but companies are integrating EU-ETS into their strategic planning. The effects of carbon pricing on strategic planning vary in the short, medium, and long term. Some industries could be significantly impacted by higher carbon prices in Phase 3. The cement, steel, and aluminum industries are most exposed to higher carbon prices under Phase 3. EU policies aim to support these industries with free allowances while negotiating an international response. The EC compiled a list of 164 subsectors and sectors based on criteria for carbon leakage risk. The criteria for significant risk of carbon leakage include assessing whether a sector's costs would increase production costs by at least 5% and the intensity of trade with third countries is above 10%. This is in accordance with Directive 2003/87 and aims to prevent market share loss to less carbon-efficient installations outside the EU. The significant risk of carbon leakage criteria include a high increase in production costs of at least 30%, based on a sector's trade intensity with third countries and a qualitative assessment of factors like market characteristics and profit margins. The eligibility criteria for companies under a carbon policy depend on factors like greenhouse gas intensity, ability to pass on costs to consumers, and carbon emission mitigation. The EC's criteria focus on trade-exposure and do not consider the impact of carbon control. This results in 117 out of 164 sectors being eligible. The EC's eligibility criteria for companies under a carbon policy focus on trade-exposure, resulting in 117 out of 164 sectors being eligible. This includes sectors like manufacturing wines and textiles, which are not considered greenhouse-gas intensive. The EC's qualitative analysis of the \"Finishing of textiles\" sector (NACE code 1730) highlights data difficulties in setting up a comprehensive program to address carbon leakage. The assessment showed a drop in textile production, low profit margins, and limited capacity for investment and emission reduction, leading to a significant risk of carbon leakage. The \"Finishing of textiles\" sector is not covered by the ETS, making concerns about profit margins somewhat irrelevant currently. The sector's primary impact from controlling emissions is increased electricity costs. The UK textiles finishing sector is not trade-exposed, with indirect emissions accounting for less than 5% of its gross added value. Data difficulties exist in determining eligibility of domestic industry sectors for carbon price impacts. The list should consider third countries' commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in exposed sectors. The EC criteria for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in certain sectors are challenging due to data limitations and lack of global data. Legislation has addressed carbon leakage with strategies like free allocation of allowances. Title IV of H.R. 2454 aims to address carbon leakage by implementing strategies such as free allocation of allowances and an international reserve allowance scheme. The purpose is to prevent potential shifts of production and investment from the United States to countries without carbon controls, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize concentrations in the atmosphere. The new Title VIII aims to prevent carbon leakage by implementing a free allocation scheme for greenhouse gas emissions costs in domestic eligible industrial sectors. The scheme also includes a rebate system to reward energy efficiency improvements and reduce distribution of emission allowances when no longer necessary. The IRA scheme under the new Part F aims to prevent carbon leakage from eligible industrial sectors by inducing foreign countries to take action on greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring compliance with international agreements. Additionally, a rebate program for energy-intensive industries affected by emissions reduction costs would be established. EPA would publish a list of eligible sectors and allowances. The EPA will publish a list of eligible industrial sectors and allowances to be rebated per unit of production for the next two years by June 30, 2011. Presumptively eligible sectors will be determined based on energy or greenhouse gas intensity criteria and trade exposure criteria. Data sources will be specified for these determinations. The bill specifies data sources for determining intensity criteria for eligible industrial sectors. EPA will determine additional sectors based on greenhouse gas, energy, and trade intensity criteria. The bill allows entities to petition for inclusion of their subsector. Coverage is focused on primary products like iron, steel, aluminum, and cement, excluding petroleum refining. Eligible companies will receive rebates based on emissions per unit of output over the most recent four years. The bill specifies criteria for eligible industrial sectors based on emissions per unit of output over the most recent four years. Entities may receive rebates for direct and indirect emissions, with allocations adjusted if needed. Allowance rebates are phased out over a 10-year period starting in 2026. Facilities ceasing qualifying activities lose their allocations. The President may modify the phase-out schedule for sectors with 15% or more of U.S. imports still produced in countries with inadequate carbon policies. The designation of six-digit NAICS codes adds precision to the program. Less than 50 out of 450 manufacturing sectors may be deemed eligible under the detailed requirements. Energy-Intensive Manufacturers' Working Group provided testimony on energy and trade intensity of the U.S. manufacturing sector during deliberations on H.R. 2454. The Working Group analyzed data on 47 sectors covered under subpart 1, which includes criteria related to greenhouse gas intensity, cost implications, market share, and carbon emissions mitigation. The EPA has a similar list of covered sectors, with exceptions for paperboard mills. Under H.R. 2454, energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries are allocated a percentage of available allowances from 2012 to 2025. They also receive allowance value for electricity rebates from local electric distribution companies. Eligible industries purchased between 295 billion and 315 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2006, representing 29% to 31% of retail sales to the industrial sector. The allocation of allowances to energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries and local electric distribution companies (LDCs) under H.R. 2454 represents about 2.4% to 2.6% of available allowances. After 2025, these allocations are phased out over a 10-year period for industries and a five-year period for LDCs. EPA and the Working Group estimate that eligible industries will need 738 million to 828 million allowances annually from 2014 through 2025 to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions. The Working Group has higher estimates for certain industries like paperboard, cement, plastics, iron and steel processes, and phosphates and soda ash. The Working Group recommends including an additional 10% as a reserve for individual showings of need and methodological uncertainty, raising their estimate to 910 million allowances annually. H.R. 2454 provides 13.4% of available allowances from 2015 through 2025, compensating between 82% and 92% of industries' projected costs. All industries are eligible for the pass-through of allowance value via local electric distribution companies. Based on EPA and CRS data, H.R. 2454 allocates 13.4% of allowances for cost relief to energy-intensive industries, with estimates varying between 2.4% to 5%. The bill's allocation scheme may be sufficient if EPA's estimates are accurate, but may fall short if Working Group's estimates or individual showings of eligibility prove significant. The language of H.R. 2454 is clear in providing energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries with their share of the electricity rebate. LDCs must submit an annual report on implementation, ensuring compliance with the requirement to provide allowance value to these industries. The effectiveness of this reporting requirement and EPA enforcement in influencing decision-making is questioned by the Working Group. The Working Group is skeptical about state public utilities commissions passing on savings to industries instead of residential consumers. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) urged the Senate to be cautious about limiting state regulators' authority, emphasizing that state commissions are more accountable to ratepayers than federal bureaucracies. State commissions in Washington are more efficient at developing clean energy programs and should have more leeway in distributing allowance proceeds for consumer benefit. The EPA and EIA have analyzed the impact of H.R. 2454's free allowance allocation to energy-intensive industries, showing a potential increase in manufacturing output with the allocation scheme. The free allocation scheme phases out in the 2020s, benefiting energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries by reducing the impact of H.R. 2454. Industries receiving permits experience less impact from increased energy prices, leading to smaller output reductions compared to overall manufacturing impacts. This is shown in past EIA analysis where energy-intensive industries typically suffer larger losses. The overall effect of the free allocation can be seen over time in Figure 9. The free allocation scheme benefits energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries by reducing the impact of H.R. 2454. The allocation has a positive effect in alleviating any disadvantage these industries may face from international competition. However, production costs could increase due to compliance-related costs passed on by upstream producers. The significance of these costs depends on the ability of suppliers to pass them on. H.R. 2454 phases out allowance rebates over 10 years starting in 2026, with a shorter schedule for LDCs. The President can adjust the phase-out for sectors with inadequate carbon policies. The EIA analysis predicts declining output for energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The implementation of Title IV, subpart 2 of H.R. 2454 in 2026 would lead to declining output for energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. It would require importers of greenhouse gas-intensive products to submit international reserve allowances, creating a de facto tariff. The EPA is required to establish an international reserve allowance system for covered goods from eligible industrial sectors, including allowance trading, banking, pricing, and submission requirements. Importation of goods from covered countries may require allowances, including manufactured items for consumption. The program would establish an international reserve allowance system for covered goods from eligible industrial sectors, ensuring compliance with U.S. commitments under international agreements. The EPA would adjust the allowance requirement based on allocated allowances and may not be used to comply with domestic emissions cap. The program does not apply to imports before January 1, 2020. The President is required to notify non-exempted countries about seeking international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exemptions are provided for least developed countries and those with minimal emissions and export trade with the US. Environmental and economic elements are outlined for negotiations. The United States aims to negotiate an international greenhouse gas reduction agreement, with a report due to Congress on the effectiveness of emission rebates and recommendations for improvement. The report will assess cost increases in industrial sectors receiving rebates and suggest ways to enhance the purposes of the agreement. Additionally, recommendations will be made for improving subpart 2, including the feasibility of an IRA program for eligible industrial sectors. The President must determine the feasibility and usefulness of an IRA program for eligible industrial sectors, considering carbon leakage and competition in third country markets. Alternative actions may be identified if an IRA program is not beneficial. The report must also evaluate assistance provided to industrial sectors in other developed countries for GHG reduction. The President must establish an international reserve allowance program for eligible sectors unless determined not beneficial. Approval by Congress needed within 90 days. Presidential determination and congressional concurrence required before June 30, 2018, and every four years thereafter. Beginning June 30, 2018, the President must determine if more than 85% of U.S. imports of \"covered goods\" in each eligible industrial sector are produced in countries meeting specific criteria related to greenhouse gas emissions. No specific timeframe is mentioned in the bill. The bill requires the President to assess carbon leakage in industrial sectors if more than 85% of U.S. imports are from countries with specific greenhouse gas criteria. If the threshold is not met, the President must evaluate rebates and IRA programs, making adjustments as needed. If the threshold is exceeded, the President is prohibited from applying certain measures. The President is prohibited from applying a sectoral IRA program if the threshold is exceeded. The international reserve allowance program would be established for eligible sectors unless Congress approves a multilateral agreement reducing greenhouse gases. Once the program is established for a sector, the President cannot alter the rebate formula or apply an IRA program without congressional approval. The bill prohibits IRAs from being collected on goods imported into the United States before January 1, 2020 if the 85% threshold for the sector is not exceeded. Section 768 requires specific elements in EPA regulations for an IRA program, including concurrence from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Regulations must establish an IRA program for covered goods and ensure pricing equivalence to auction clearing prices for emissions. The bill requires the establishment of a general methodology for calculating the quantity of IRAs for imported goods, specifying procedures for declaration and entry into U.S. customs territory, and preventing circumvention of IRA requirements for goods manufactured in multiple countries. EPA must include an adjustment based on rebates in the calculation of required IRAs for covered goods. The EPA would adjust IRAs for imported goods based on rebates and benefits received by the industrial sector. Countries meeting emission reduction standards, LDDCs, and de minimis emitters are exempt from border IRA requirements. The bill requires the EPA to establish an International Reserve Allowance (IRA) program for de minimis emitters responsible for less than 0.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and less than 5% of U.S. imports in an eligible industrial sector. The program must align with U.S. international agreements. A flow chart outlines the IRA scheme, but there has been limited analysis on its trade impact. EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on a similar scheme in a previous Congress. EPA's sensitivity analysis on the impact of international emission commitments showed that maintaining 2015 levels by 2025 and returning to 2000 levels by 2050 would not cause emission leakage. However, in a scenario with no international actions until 2050, emissions from countries without commitments could rise significantly. EPA's 2008 analysis considered the potential triggering of International Reserve Allowance provisions due to lack of international action. The International Reserve Allowance (IRA) program aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 2030 and 2050, with minimal impact on leakage. Without IRA provisions, emissions would increase significantly. Imports from countries without commitments would rise, but under IRA provisions, imports would decrease. U.S. exports declined as countries utilized more domestic manufacturing capacity. EPA projections suggest a differential effect on emissions reduction. If EPA projections for S. 2191 apply to H.R. 2454, the IRA provisions could create trade and emissions leakage issues if challenged at the WTO. International trade dynamics can be affected by public policy, leading to unexpected consequences like increased costs for domestic industries due to trade sanctions on primary goods. Countries may shift exports from raw materials to finished products to avoid sanctions, impacting industries like steel and automobiles. South Korea could adjust its industrial policy to focus on automobile exports over raw steel to avoid sanctions. Downstream companies using greenhouse gas-intensive goods may face competitiveness challenges. Lack of data hindered the EC from assessing carbon efficiency in foreign installations, leading to potential trade issues. The lack of reliable emission data in many countries hinders the comparison of foreign GHG-reduction programs with the United States. This may also affect the executive branch's ability to assess conditions in foreign countries and make determinations based on different quantitative bases. Countries may be excluded from import requirements based on data availability and quality. Uncertainties in emission inventories, like China's 1994 submission to the UNFCCC, can be attributed to difficulties in obtaining accurate data. China, like many non-Annex 1 countries, faces challenges in estimating GHG emissions due to constraints in funding and time. Emission data troubles are common among these countries, as reported by the UNFCCC. China, like many non-Annex 1 countries, faces challenges in estimating GHG emissions due to inadequate capacities for reporting obligations under the Convention. Data-related issues, such as outdated emission data for China in 1994 compared to more recent data for industrial production in 2005, may lead to uneven results between countries. For example, South Korea's latest emissions inventory submission to the UNFCCC is for 2001, highlighting disparities in data availability and reporting timelines. The EPA's ability to create necessary data for implementing an emissions reduction scheme becomes problematic when considering differences in reporting capacities between countries. H.R. 2454 allows the President to decide against establishing an IRA program for certain industrial sectors if it is not in the national interest. This decision could potentially affect export-dependent sectors, although the bill does not explicitly restrict the President's authority in this regard. The bill allows the President to exclude certain industrial sectors from the cap-and-trade program based on trade exposure. Congressional approval may be harder to secure for sectors concerned about imports from countries without GHG-reduction programs. There is no provision for the President to establish an IRA program for a sector once Congress has approved its exclusion, raising questions for other countries in GHG-reduction negotiations. The bill allows the President to exclude industrial sectors from the cap-and-trade program based on trade exposure. An IRA program would apply to \"covered goods\" for eligible industrial sectors with a trade intensity level of 15% or more. The producers must demonstrate technical feasibility for IRA allowances greater than zero. EPA must determine the appropriateness to achieve the purposes of Part F. The bill requires the sector producing the good to meet the same trade intensity level as an eligible industrial sector for inclusion as a \"covered good\" under an IRA program. However, energy and GHG intensity levels are treated differently, with existing levels being a factor for the EPA to consider in determining feasibility and appropriateness of applying IRAs. H.R. 2454 aims to expand the definition of \"eligible industrial sector\" for IRA inclusion by allowing manufactured items for consumption to be considered as covered goods. The legislation assumes an existing IRA program for the sector producing similar inputs, but the criteria for what constitutes a \"like\" input is unclear. The bill does not specify how different imported inputs can be from domestic goods to qualify for inclusion. The bill aims to include manufactured goods for consumption in an IRA program, but criteria for eligibility are unclear. Producers must provide strong factual basis for EPA to determine feasibility. Energy and GHG intensity standards are not required for eligibility, and other factors could influence EPA's decision. Extending benefits to manufactured goods could pose challenges. The bill aims to extend IRA program benefits to manufactured goods for consumption, potentially facing challenges due to unclear eligibility criteria. It emphasizes the need for international agreements to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The bill aims to reach an \"internationally binding\" agreement where all major GHG-emitting countries contribute equitably to reducing global emissions. It includes provisions to address competitive imbalances that lead to carbon leakage and provide remedies for parties failing to meet GHG reduction obligations. This objective does not require the US to alter emission allowance rebate distribution. The bill aims for an internationally binding agreement on GHG reduction, addressing competitive imbalances and non-compliance. If the US is not part of such an agreement by January 1, 2018, the President must establish IRA programs for eligible industrial sectors. The existence of a multilateral GHG-reduction agreement would influence the application of IRA programs for specific sectors. H.R. 2454 would use the legislative approval process to determine if an international agreement meets negotiating objectives. If the executive branch confirms consistency with these objectives, the agreement will be considered consistent upon Senate consent or legislation enactment. The agreement may not be treated as consistent for establishing IRA programs or new section 768. EPA would issue regulations under this section. EPA would issue regulations implementing an IRA program for eligible industrial sectors if no qualifying agreement is in place by January 1, 2018. Regulations must exclude goods from countries with GHG-reduction commitments as stringent as the US. The agreement must also enter into force for the US to be considered consistent with legislative negotiating objectives. The agreement must enter into force for the United States, requiring the deposit of instruments of ratification or accession. Implementing legislation may be necessary to fulfill treaty obligations under domestic law. Further legislative action may be needed to implement the treaty or agreement, potentially delaying its entry into force for the United States. Questions regarding approval and implementation of sectoral agreements may also need to be addressed. H.R. 2454 is more lenient on sectoral agreements compared to multilateral GHG-reduction agreements. H.R. 2454 allows for sectoral agreements with weaker GHG-reduction commitments. Increasing the percentage on U.S. imports could make it harder to meet the threshold. There is a risk of unintended consequences, such as other countries imposing tariffs on U.S. exports in response. The EU may target the United States with tariffs due to the lack of a reduction target comparable to theirs. Developing countries could also use a different metric for comparability, such as per capita greenhouse gas emissions, to their advantage. Developing countries like China and India could potentially impose tariffs on U.S. goods based on their lower emissions compared to the United States. This raises concerns about U.S. obligations under WTO agreements regarding free emission allowances and border measures. Legislation providing free allowances to carbon-intensive industries may be seen as a subsidy under WTO rules. The bill also requires the EPA to establish a border measure program consistent with international agreements. The curr_chunk discusses the potential implications of requiring importers to purchase International Reserve Allowances (IRAs) under U.S. trade agreements. Such a requirement could be considered a prohibited import surcharge or quantitative restriction under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT), requiring justification under a GATT exception to survive a WTO challenge. Earlier GATT and WTO cases may provide guidance, but measures are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, especially for novel and complex measures affecting various imported products, production processes, and trading partners. The negotiating objectives in H.R. 2454 consider the possibility of addressing trade-related competitive imbalances in a multilateral GHG-reduction agreement. This agreement could establish principles or obligations regarding emission allowances allocation by WTO Member countries and the imposition of border measures. A \"peace clause\" limiting dispute initiation could be included, and the agreement might be negotiated separately from climate change talks. WTO Members could seek a waiver for these provisions or incorporate binding commitments. The possibility of a binding WTO-related climate change accord is uncertain, and without broad adherence by WTO Members, disputes may be resolved through the WTO dispute settlement process. Disputes under WTO agreements are heard under the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), with special rules prevailing in certain agreements like the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The WTO dispute settlement process involves three stages: consultations, panel and possibly Appellate Body proceedings, and implementation. If a defending Member is found to have violated a WTO obligation, they are expected to withdraw the violative measure within a reasonable period. If they fail to comply, the complaining Member may seek compensation or request authorization to impose measures. The WTO dispute settlement process allows for compensation or countermeasures if a defending Member fails to comply with a ruling. Countermeasures are considered a last resort and can be imposed until the violation is rectified or the dispute is settled. Certain actions by the DSB are automatic unless all Members agree otherwise. The WTO dispute settlement process has a timeline of 18 months from panel establishment to compliance determination. Dispute settlement is Member-driven, with parties deciding on actions like requesting a panel or authorization for countermeasures. While pressure to comply exists, compensation or retaliation may be used as temporary remedies if Members do not comply. Members have managed disputes at the implementation stage in various ways. In WTO dispute settlement practice, Members can challenge measures of other Members \"as such\" or \"as applied.\" An \"as such\" claim challenges a measure as violative of a WTO agreement independently of its application. Panels have used the \"mandatory/discretionary distinction\" to determine if a measure violates WTO obligations. If found discretionary, the measure would need to be challenged \"as applied.\" In WTO dispute settlement practice, measures can be challenged \"as such\" or \"as applied.\" The distinction should not be applied in a \"mechanistic fashion,\" and discretionary elements in a statute may not shield it from an \"as such\" challenge. Emission allowances permit the emission of carbon dioxide. Recipients include entities subject to emission caps and other industrial entities emitting GHG gases. Allowances may be allocated by the government free of charge. The government may allocate emission allowances to capped fuel producers either free of charge, through auctions, or a mixed system. Capped entities use allowances to cover emissions up to their cap, purchase more if needed, or sell unused allowances. Non-capped entities can sell their allowances to capped entities or trade them in carbon markets. The situation of the recipient varies based on being capped or non-capped, and the sufficiency of the original allowance allocation. The Congressional Budget Office characterizes emission allowances as 'cash-like' due to their tradability in a secondary market. CBO suggests that distributed allowances should be treated as outlays similar to cash grants, while the creation of allowances by the government should be recorded as revenues, regardless of whether they are sold or given away. Allowances in a cap-and-trade system are seen as valuable financial instruments. The government distributes emission allowances, which are considered valuable financial instruments due to their tradability. Whether sold or given away, these allowances hold significant value for recipients, who can either sell them or use them to avoid emission mitigation costs. The Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation view the distribution of allowances as equivalent to cash grants or taxing capped entities. Sound budgeting principles dictate that equivalent transactions should be treated the same way. The Joint Committee on Taxation considers emission allowances to be tradable and \"cash-like,\" similar to commodities. They also resemble licenses granted by the government in other contexts. Different analogies can lead to varied tax implications for emission allowances. The Joint Committee on Taxation views emission allowances as tradable and \"cash-like,\" similar to commodities or government licenses. Different analogies can result in varied tax implications for emission allowances, with three alternatives for taxing them identified by the Committee. The provision of emission allowances may be seen as a subsidy to the recipient entity, but for it to qualify as a subsidy in WTO terms, it must meet specific criteria. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures governs the provision of subsidies by WTO Members, outlining detailed obligations and the imposition of countervailing duties on subsidized products causing harm to domestic industries. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures governs subsidies provided by WTO Members, allowing for challenges in dispute settlement proceedings or the imposition of countervailing duties on subsidized products causing harm to domestic industries. The SCM Agreement defines a subsidy as a financial contribution by a government or public body that confers a benefit, without specific exceptions to deviate from agreement obligations. The SCM Agreement defines a subsidy as a financial contribution by a government that confers a benefit, including direct transfers of funds, foregone revenue, provision of goods or services, and payments to a funding mechanism. This provision has not been extensively cited in GATT or WTO jurisprudence. The SCM Agreement defines a subsidy as a financial contribution by a government that confers a benefit. To be challenged in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding, the subsidy must be specific to an industry or enterprise. Prohibited subsidies are considered specific per se, and may be specific in law or in fact. The SCM Agreement categorizes subsidies into prohibited and actionable types. Prohibited subsidies include those contingent on export performance or the use of domestic over imported products. Specificity in subsidies is not allowed unless objective criteria are strictly followed. The SCM Agreement distinguishes between prohibited and actionable subsidies. Actionable subsidies, as defined by the WTO, can be challenged if they cause adverse effects to another Member's interests. Adverse effects can include injury to domestic industries, nullification of WTO benefits, or serious prejudice. Serious prejudice occurs when a subsidy displaces imports of a similar product. Prejudice occurs when a subsidy displaces imports of a like product, impedes exports, causes significant price undercutting, and increases the world market share of the subsidizing Member in a particular product. Defining the \"like product\" and affected market is crucial in determining if serious prejudice exists. The SCM Agreement's special dispute settlement rules state that if a subsidy causes adverse effects to another Member, the subsidizing Member must take steps to remove the effects or withdraw the subsidy within six months. If not, the complaining Member can take countermeasures unless the Dispute Settlement Body rejects the request. The time period can be extended by mutual agreement. The SCM Agreement's rules require a subsidizing Member to address adverse effects of a subsidy within six months. If not resolved, the complaining Member can take countermeasures. The provision of emission allowances as a financial contribution is unclear under this definition, and the nature of an allowance is elusive for subsidy issues. Emissions are considered valuable but the exact characterization is uncertain. The provision of emission allowances as a financial contribution by private parties may not constitute a direct transfer of funds by the government. Emission allowances have been seen as a license or commodity, potentially constituting the provision of goods. The exact nature of allowances in relation to subsidy issues remains uncertain. The government grant of a license for harvesting timber on government lands was found to constitute the provision of a tradable product. In contrast, the provision of a free allowance for emitting carbon dioxide would not be a salable good like timber. Emission allowances, being a right to take a particular action rather than a tangible product, may not qualify as a government financial contribution. Subsidies may be considered once emission allowances are auctioned by the government. The provision of emission allowances without charge to a U.S. firm may be considered a subsidy once emission allowances are subject to government auction. The concept of revenue that is \"otherwise due\" under the SCM Agreement requires a standard against which a tax exemption is measured, implying a comparison with a defined normative benchmark. The future tax treatment of distributed allowances may also result in foregone revenue. The tax treatment of distributed allowances may result in foregone revenue, which could be considered a subsidy. WTO jurisprudence focuses on tax measures, but the provision is not limited to taxes. Past cases have found that tax exemptions confer a benefit, such as in the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation statute. The United States did not raise arguments against the benefit issue in a case involving tax exemptions. A new statute allows taxpayers to exclude certain income from taxation, resulting in a tax benefit. This tax treatment confers a benefit by reducing the amount of tax owed to the US government. The tax treatment in the Act confers a benefit by reducing the amount of tax owed to the US government. The WTO panel found that an exemption from import duty constituted a subsidy as it provided an advantage to manufacturer beneficiaries by not having to pay customs duties. Panels must focus on the recipient of the financial contribution to determine if a benefit is conferred. The provision of free allowances as a subsidy under the SCM Agreement would not be prohibited as long as it is not contingent on export performance or use of domestic products. However, it could be subject to challenge if it causes adverse effects and is specific to an industry or group of industries. Further development by WTO panels and the WTO Appellate Body is needed in this matter. H.R. 2454, if passed, would require importers to submit emission credits for products entering the US from a domestic industrial sector with an established IRA program. The specificity of free allowances as subsidies could be challenged if they benefit a particular industry or group of industries. The proposed regulations under H.R. 2454 would exempt products from border IRA requirements if they are imported from certain countries with GHG-reduction agreements or low emissions intensity. EPA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection would establish the program with statutory requirements and discretionary powers. The proposed regulations under H.R. 2454 would exempt products from border IRA requirements for imports from countries with GHG-reduction agreements or low emissions intensity. The U.S. importer would need to submit a quantity of IRAs based on a general methodology, with the discretion to adjust requirements and reduce them to zero based on emission allowances. The IRA requirements would not apply to goods entering the U.S. before January 1, 2020, as specified in the statute. The most-favored-nation obligation of the GATT requires trade-related benefits granted to one country to be granted to all WTO Members immediately and unconditionally. The GATT national treatment article covers importation, exportation, levying duties, rules, formalities, internal taxation, and regulation. Article II prohibits tariff surcharges and border fees on imports to maintain negotiated rates. Each Member's tariff commitments are listed in a Schedule with the highest bound rate. Products imported from WTO Members should be exempt from customs duties exceeding those in the importing Member's Schedule. Article II of the WTO agreements prohibits tariff surcharges and border fees on imports, while Article III, the GATT national treatment article, prohibits discrimination between domestic and imported products in terms of internal taxes and regulations. If an internal tax or regulation is applied at the border to an imported product, it is considered an internal measure subject to Article III obligations. III:1 of the GATT 1994 prohibits internal taxes and laws that protect domestic production, while Article III:2 states that imported products should not face higher internal taxes than domestic products. A strict test is applied to determine any excess tax on imports compared to domestic products. Article III:2 of the GATT 1994 prohibits any excess tax on imports compared to domestic products, requiring a comparison of actual tax burdens. WTO reviews consider not only tax rates but also taxation methods and rules for tax collection. The policy purpose behind a tax is generally viewed as irrelevant as long as it does not violate GATT or other WTO obligations. Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 mandates national treatment in internal regulation, ensuring imported products receive treatment no less favorable than domestic products. Panels use criteria like product properties, end-uses, consumer preferences, and tariff classification to determine if products are \"like.\" GATT/WTO case law does not allow differentiation based on processing and production methods unrelated to product characteristics. The GATT/WTO prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and exports, stating that products should not be subjected to different requirements based on processing and production methods unrelated to product characteristics. This ensures that imported goods are not treated less favorably than domestic items. The GATT/WTO prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and exports, ensuring equal treatment for domestic and imported goods. Article XX allows for exceptions based on public policy grounds in GATT disputes. The WTO Appellate Body views measures falling within Article XX exceptions as permissible under the GATT, including those related to climate change. Article XX(b) covers protection of life or health, while Article XX(g) covers conservation of natural resources. Any law justified under these articles must not discriminate between countries or act as a disguised restriction. The manufacture of certain products results in direct and indirect carbon emissions due to energy-intensive production processes. Emission caps on energy producers and manufacturers of carbon-intensive products may impact competitiveness. The implementation of emission caps on energy producers and manufacturers of carbon-intensive products may lead to a loss of competitiveness for firms, potentially causing them to move production to countries without greenhouse gas reduction controls, resulting in increased emissions or \"carbon leakage.\" This could also lead to increased production by foreign facilities, contributing to higher global demand for their goods. A border adjustment requirement considering greenhouse gas emissions in the production of imported products in relation to domestic regulations may be necessary to address this issue. A border requirement proposed under H.R. 2454 aims to address carbon leakage by imposing conditions on imported products from countries with insufficient GHG reduction efforts. This may implicate GATT articles such as most-favored-nation treatment, prohibition of added duties, national treatment of imports, and restrictions on quantitative imports. Importers would incur costs in meeting the requirements for importation. Importers may face costs in meeting the requirements for importation under H.R. 2454, which could be considered as charges imposed on imported items subject to tariff rates bound under GATT Article II. These charges may be prohibited under GATT rules, as seen in previous cases where interest charges and other costs related to importation were deemed inconsistent with GATT obligations. The importer subject to the IRA requirements may incur costs to obtain allowances for importation, potentially falling within the scope of GATT Article II:1(b) prohibition on import charges. The IRA program's failure to comply with requirements may prohibit product imports into the US, potentially conflicting with GATT Article XI:1 on quantitative restrictions. Discriminatory treatment of products from non-exempted countries could violate the most-favored-nation obligation of GATT Article I. The US could potentially avoid quantitative restrictions under Article XI if the IRA requirement is part of an internal regulatory regime. The United States may be able to prohibit imports that do not meet U.S. regulatory requirements without violating GATT Article XI. However, fitting a border program like H.R. 2454 within GATT Article III:4 parameters may be difficult. Regulation of products based on carbon emissions raises issues on distinguishing like items under current WTO law, potentially leading to problematic regulatory requirements based on production emissions. H.R. 2454 may face challenges in fitting within GATT Article III:4 parameters due to potential issues in distinguishing like items based on carbon emissions. The bill places emission caps on domestic producers, not on the sale, purchase, or use of carbon-intensive goods, which could lead to less favorable treatment of imported goods. The absence of a regulatory program for domestically produced goods could make import prohibitions under the IRA program vulnerable to scrutiny. Import prohibitions under the IRA program in the United States could be challenged under Article XI. In a WTO dispute, a trade-related GHG reduction measure violating GATT can be justified under Article XX(b) or XX(g) exceptions. These exceptions require measures to protect life, health, or conserve natural resources without arbitrary discrimination between countries. The justification of a measure under Article XX(b) or XX(g) exceptions in a WTO dispute involves a complex analysis to avoid discriminatory or protectionist applications. Article XX(b) requires a showing of necessity for health protection, while Article XX(g) only requires a relationship to a conservation goal. It may be easier for a measure to qualify under XX(g) than XX(b). The WTO dispute analysis involves complex requirements for justifying measures under Article XX(b) or XX(g) exceptions. Qualifying under XX(g) may be easier than under XX(b), as it requires a relationship to a conservation goal. The extent to which H.R. 2454 addresses health or conservation goals is crucial for determining if it falls within the relevant exception. Successful invocation of Article XX(b) necessitates showing that the measure aims to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, and is necessary for achieving this goal. The WTO Appellate Body has suggested that health protection could be a goal of a domestic climate change program. The jurisdictional issue in a climate change case may arise due to the prevention of carbon leakage and the unclear territorial reach of Article XX(b). The global impact of climate change may be sufficient to establish a local nexus. The Appellate Body's test for necessity involves weighing relevant factors and exploring less trade-restrictive alternatives. If necessity is preliminarily found, the panel confirms it. The WTO Appellate Body evaluates the necessity of a measure by comparing it with less trade-restrictive alternatives that can achieve the same objective. The measure must be apt to make a material contribution to the goal, with the importance of the values at stake taken into consideration. It does not need to be indispensable but should not provide a marginal or insignificant contribution. Immediate impact is not required to be shown. The WTO Appellate Body evaluates the necessity of a measure by comparing it with less trade-restrictive alternatives that can achieve the same objective. The measure must make a material contribution to the goal, with the importance of the values at stake considered. Immediate impact is not required to be shown. For Article XX(g) to apply to a GATT-inconsistent climate change measure, the WTO Member would need to show that conservation of an exhaustible resource is necessary. In the context of climate change measures, the WTO Member must demonstrate that the measure relates to the conservation of an exhaustible natural resource and is effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic consumption or production. The WTO Appellate Body has interpreted exhaustibility broadly to include all types of exhaustible resources, whether living or non-living. This includes resources like the atmosphere or a species, regardless of renewability. In the climate change context, a measure must be primarily aimed at conserving exhaustible natural resources, with a substantial relationship between the measure's design and the conservation goal. The focus is on preventing carbon leakage to conserve natural resources. The WTO Appellate Body has indicated that a GATT-inconsistent climate change measure may not need to establish immediate effects to invoke a GATT exception. However, credible studies questioning leakage prevention may complicate showing the program's aim at preserving at-risk natural resources. Panels would assess if restrictions on imported products align with domestic items and are \"even-handed\" in approach. H.R. 2454 allows border measures on imported manufactured items for consumption. The WTO Appellate Body focuses on preventing abuse of Article XX exceptions, finding a balance between Member rights and GATT obligations. In a 2007 case, Brazil\u2014 Measures Affecting Imports of Retreaded Tyres (Brazil Tyres), the WTO Appellate Body examined cases involving discrimination and disguised trade restrictions. The prohibition aims to prevent protectionist effects, as seen in the U.S. Gasoline case where unjustifiable discrimination was found in the pollution reduction program. In the U.S. Gasoline case, foreign refiners were subject to a statutory baseline while U.S. counterparts had more favorable baselines. The United States did not explore cooperative arrangements with affected exporting countries and failed to consider costs for foreign firms. In U.S. Shrimp, the Appellate Body found unjustifiable discrimination in the coercive effect on foreign government policy decisions. The U.S. program prohibiting shrimp importation from countries not certified by the United States as maintaining a regulatory program with a comparable sea turtle protection rate was found to have a coercive effect on foreign government policy decisions by the Appellate Body. The requirement for exporting countries to have essentially the same policies as the U.S. and the prohibition of shrimp caught with unacceptable methods led to discrimination according to the Appellate Body. The Appellate Body found discrimination in the U.S. program prohibiting shrimp importation from countries without comparable sea turtle protection. They emphasized the need for diplomatic negotiations before enforcing import prohibitions and highlighted the importance of good faith efforts in reaching international agreements. The length of the phase-in period for foreign compliance was also considered by the Appellate Body. The Appellate Body emphasized the importance of flexibility in implementing regulatory programs for foreign compliance, avoiding arbitrary discrimination by allowing exporting Members to adopt programs suitable to their specific conditions. The Appellate Body stressed the need for flexibility in regulatory programs for foreign compliance to avoid arbitrary discrimination. Importing Members should provide transparent and predictable regulatory processes, allowing exporting countries to explain their situation and receive a reasoned explanation for any denials. The focus should be on identifying disguised restrictions on international trade. The Appellate Body emphasizes the need for flexibility in regulatory programs to prevent disguised trade restrictions. Compliance with Article XX exceptions may be considered an abuse if it conceals trade-restrictive objectives. The design and structure of a measure can reveal its protectionist aims. Discrimination and protectionist objectives should be carefully examined to identify disguised trade restrictions. The focus is on the possible protectionist objectives of the measure and its impact on domestic and foreign producers. The United States would need to address issues such as engaging trading partners for negotiations, using flexible regulatory standards, and addressing leakage and administrative problems in implementing the program. The focus is on the creation of a flexible regulatory standard allowing comparability in foreign program effectiveness, providing exporting Members a voice in resolving market access issues, allowing a phase-in period for import requirements, and importing goods compliant with regulations to avoid penalization. Negotiating objectives include seeking multilateral GHG-reduction commitments, addressing competitive imbalances, and potentially seeking data cooperation agreements. Seeking data cooperation agreements is important for the regulatory program to rely on foreign emissions and production statistics. The quality of such data is crucial for assessing emissions-reduction activity and determining the application of border adjustments. Reliable foreign data may be difficult to obtain, raising questions about nondiscriminatory border requirements under Article XX of the WTO agreement. In the absence of a WTO agreement, exporting countries may be hesitant to provide emissions or production data to EPA for IRA program determinations. Unlike U.S. Gasoline, carbon-intensive goods subject to IRA requirements would not directly harm the environment in the U.S., potentially leading foreign entities to be less willing to provide data. Issues may arise in penalizing compliant imports based on their contribution to GHG emissions, especially when determining emissions from goods produced in multiple countries with different processes. The challenge lies in accurately attributing emissions to imported products and ensuring fair treatment under border emission credit requirements. The type of products produced domestically or by eligible industrial sectors may impact whether a program is seen as a disguised restriction on international trade."
