    "content": "Agriculture is a source and sink of greenhouse gases, with emissions entering the atmosphere and carbon dioxide being removed through photosynthesis and stored in vegetation and soils. Despite some offsetting through sequestration in farmland soils, the U.S. agriculture sector remains a net source of GHG emissions. Estimates of GHG emissions and sinks for the U.S. agriculture sector are published annually by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, based on data from various government departments. The U.S. agriculture sector contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, with data from various federal departments like USDA, EPA, and others. The EPA-published data undergo rigorous peer reviews and are expressed in million metric tons of CO2-equivalents. The USDA supplements EPA's Inventory with more detailed state-specific information on emissions from agricultural activities. Total GHG emissions from U.S. agricultural activities have averaged 514 MMTCO2-Eq. in recent years, representing about 7% of total U.S. GHG emissions. Emissions have been increasing since 1990, with EPA reporting both direct and indirect emissions. Other types of emissions like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides are not included in these estimates. The agricultural sector in the United States contributes to national GHG emissions, with fossil fuel combustion being the leading source. Methane and nitrous oxide are key gases emitted from agricultural activities, mainly from livestock operations and soil management on croplands. These gases have a greater warming effect than CO2. The U.S. agriculture sector is a significant source of N2O and CH4 emissions, accounting for about two-thirds and one-third of all reported agricultural emissions, respectively. Direct emissions from agricultural activities totaled 530 MMTCO2-Eq. in 2007, with a steady increase since 1990. Emissions are primarily from agriculture soil management, including nitrous oxide emissions from farmland. Agriculture soil management practices contribute to nitrous oxide emissions from farmland soils through activities like fertilization, irrigation, cultivation, and livestock manure application. Methane emissions from livestock operations are linked to the animals' digestive process and feed efficiency. Agriculture practices contribute to nitrous oxide emissions from farmland soils through activities like fertilization, irrigation, and livestock manure application. Methane emissions from livestock operations are linked to feed efficiency. Manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural residue burning also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural emissions are mainly from the crop sector (70%) and livestock sector (30%). On-farm energy use, such as tractors, also contributes to CO2 and other gas emissions. These emissions are a small part of the total sector emissions, estimated at 30 MMTCO2-Eq. Emissions from electricity use in agriculture have been steady or decreasing since 1990. Food processing and distribution emissions are grouped with transportation and industrial sectors. Land use and forestry activities have a smaller impact on emissions. Emissions from forestry activities in the United States are minimal, accounting for less than 1% of total estimated greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are based on forest fires, land use changes, and management practices. Agricultural activities may also emit indirect greenhouse gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, but these are not included in EPA's Inventory estimates as they contribute indirectly to climate change through tropospheric ozone. Agricultural activities also release other air emissions regulated under the Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act regulates emissions of ammonia, volatile organic compounds, hydrogen sulfide, and particulate matter from agricultural activities. EPA's estimates are based on USDA data and site-specific factors such as location, climate, soil type, crop type, livestock management, and waste practices. Emissions can vary yearly based on growing conditions. EPA-reported data reflect the most recent information and methodological changes. The EPA's Inventory reflects recent data and historical updates following IPCC guidelines. There is potential to lower GHG emissions from U.S. agricultural facilities through adoption of conservation practices. Options to reduce nitrous oxide emissions include improved soil management and more efficient fertilization. Intensive agriculture has caused a soil carbon loss of 30%-50% in the past 100 years. Conservation tillage practices in the U.S. reduce soil disturbance, carbon emissions, and enhance carbon sequestration. Nearly 40% of planted areas use some form of conservation tillage. Methane emissions from livestock can be reduced through improved manure and feed management, such as installing anaerobic digesters or lagoon covers. Installing an anaerobic digester to capture emissions from livestock operations not only traps various air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act but also improves water quality by reducing nutrient runoff. Manure management systems offer additional benefits like controlling flies, producing energy, and enhancing fertilizer value, but they can be costly to maintain due to high start-up and operating costs. The initial capital cost of anaerobic digesters with energy recovery at dairy and hog operations ranges from $0.25 million to $1 million. Operating costs are around $36,000 annually. Costs are influenced by site-specific conditions, with higher costs in colder regions requiring additional heating. Incentives are available to assist producers in implementing these systems. Incentives such as cost-sharing, low-interest financing, and grants are available to assist livestock producers in implementing practices to reduce GHG emissions. Funding for anaerobic digesters at U.S. livestock operations is available under various farm bill programs, but adoption remains low. Improved feed strategies can also help lower methane emissions at livestock operations. Agriculture can reduce GHG emissions by implementing practices like substituting forage crops for feed grains, genetic improvements in animals, and managing nutrition. Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils can offset emissions by storing carbon in soil through roots, litter, and manure. Loss of soil carbon can occur with land use changes and soil erosion. Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is crucial for climate change mitigation. Programs promoting land retirement, grassland restoration, and conservation practices like afforestation and conservation tillage help capture and store carbon. The report \"Conservation Practices that Promote Mitigation\" provides more information on sequestration rates for farm and forestry. The Forestry Sectors report summarizes carbon sequestration rates for farm and forestry practices in the U.S. Total carbon sequestration from agricultural activities averaged 44 MMTCO2-Eq. annually during 2003-2007, accounting for less than 10% of agriculture-based emissions. Carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector has decreased significantly since 1990, offsetting only about 5% of reported GHG emissions each year. The agriculture sector in the United States remains a net source of GHG emissions, with forests and trees accounting for a majority of carbon uptake. Land use and forestry practices contribute significantly to annual carbon storage, offsetting about 16% of total U.S. GHG emissions each year. Carbon sequestration from these activities has increased over the years, from 660 MMTCO2-Eq. in 1990 to 1,105 MMTCO2-Eq. in recent years. The forestry activities have increased carbon storage from 660 MMTCO2-Eq. in 1990 to 910 MMTCO2-Eq. in 2007. Carbon sequestration by agriculture and forestry sectors is part of the overall debate, with biological sequestration having less potential than direct sequestration. EPA's Inventory estimates carbon uptake in agricultural soils based on various practices like conservation tillage and organic fertilizer use. The effectiveness of carbon sequestration in agricultural soils depends on various site-specific factors and the implementation of conservation and land management practices. Estimates of carbon sequestration may vary based on the amount of site-specific information included and the methodology used for calculations. The success of adopting these practices also depends on the type of practice, its implementation, and the duration of its implementation. Time is needed for benefits to accrue, such as the buildup of carbon in soils. The effectiveness of conservation and land management practices for carbon sequestration in agricultural soils depends on various site-specific factors. The duration of implementation is critical for benefits to accrue, such as carbon buildup in soils. However, not all practices are equally effective in all settings, as factors like soil type and moisture regime can impact their success. Concerns arise regarding the impermanence of these practices and their limited storage value for sequestering carbon. The potential for carbon sequestration on farmlands depends on landowners adopting conservation practices. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of additional practices and the cost-effectiveness compared to other climate change mitigation strategies. Financial incentives from the current farm bill are crucial for implementing these practices and technologies. USDA reports that agricultural soils have a significant potential for carbon uptake. USDA forecasts a significant increase in carbon sequestration on U.S. agricultural lands by 2012, with potential for a doubling of current levels. This additional uptake is expected through improved soil and manure management, as well as land-retirement sign-ups. Longer-term estimates suggest a potential for annual net increases in carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector, which could offset 8% to 14% of total national emissions. The U.S. agriculture sector has the potential to store between 15% and 25% of total annual U.S. emissions. Studies by the USDA and EPA provide estimates of additional carbon storage potential for agricultural and forestry activities. Current sequestration rates in these sectors are already substantial, with the bulk through growth in forest stocks. The estimates account for current and expected costs in modeling landowners' decision-making regarding carbon storage potential in agriculture and forestry activities. Results show a range of carbon prices and the relationship between prices and investment in mitigation activities. The estimates are reported nationally and by U.S. regions, with a focus on afforestation and soil sequestration potential at different carbon prices. The low end of the price range indicates carbon sequestration potential with cropland management, while higher prices are linked to land retirement and conversion. EPA's analysis includes estimates of mitigation activities, such as forest management. USDA reports potential net increases in carbon sequestration through afforestation and agricultural soils, ranging from 0 to 587 MMT CO2-Eq. per year. Sequestration levels could increase by 587 MMT CO2-Eq. annually at a price of about $30/MT CO2-Eq. USDA projects a potential increase in sequestration levels by 587 MMT CO2-Eq. annually, with a double mitigation potential compared to current estimates for agricultural activities. EPA estimates a higher sequestration potential for the U.S. agricultural sector, ranging from 160 MMT CO2-Eq. to 990 MMT CO2-Eq. per year across different carbon prices. Afforestation is the main contributor to uptake potential, while agricultural soil carbon sequestration plays a smaller role at the high end of the estimated range. For more information on these estimates, refer to CRS Report RS22964. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported varying estimates of future mitigation potential from afforestation and cropland soil sequestration. EPA updated its model in 2009, reflecting changes in estimates for carbon mitigation potential from farm and forestry practices. EPA's analysis of the House-passed climate bill, H.R. 2454, includes the effects of the bill's carbon offset program on agriculture and forest lands. The EPA's analysis predicts that mitigation potential from agriculture soil carbon activities may be outweighed by other types of activities like forest, manure, and crop management. There is potential to increase carbon capture in U.S. agricultural lands through conservation and land management practices, which can sequester carbon in farmland soils and reduce emissions. Representative carbon sequestration rates for farm and forestry practices are provided in CRS Report RS22964. The main carbon sinks in the agriculture sector are cropland conversion and soil management, including improved manure application. More than half of all carbon sequestered on U.S. agricultural lands is through voluntary land retirement programs and programs that convert or restore land. Afforestation and cropland conversion have the greatest potential to store the most carbon per acre annually compared with other types of systems. Conservation tillage practices, such as no-till, account for about 40% of carbon sequestered by U.S. agriculture. These practices improve biomass retention and reduce soil disturbance, leading to decreased oxidation. No-till stores about 30% more carbon than reduced tillage and over five times more than intensive tilled croplands. Livestock operations are not commonly associated with carbon uptake but installing manure management systems can help mitigate emissions. Manure management systems, like anaerobic digesters, can capture methane emissions from livestock operations, serving as a form of direct sequestration. Carbon offset programs promote these systems to store methane at dairy operations, potentially generating carbon offset credits and renewable energy. Estimates of uptake are challenging due to limited anaerobic digester availability. Improved dietary and feed management can also reduce methane emissions from livestock by lowering intestinal methane levels. Ongoing research explores these strategies further. Research in this area is ongoing and involves strategies like adding supplements to animal diets, substituting forage crops for feed grains, and genetic improvements to lower methane emissions. Conservation and farmland management programs at federal and state levels encourage practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon. These programs were initially for other production or environmental purposes. Some USDA and state-level programs are starting to focus on reducing emissions and storing carbon in agriculture and forestry. Practices include land retirement, conversion to grasslands, wetlands, or rangelands, cropland tillage practices, soil management, and precision agriculture. Conservation programs encourage farmers to implement various sustainable farming practices such as soil supplements, precision agriculture, cropping techniques, manure and feed management, grazing management, bioenergy substitution, and energy efficiency. These programs offer financial incentives and technical support for adoption, administered by USDA and state agencies. Farmers have the option to voluntarily participate in these programs. Conservation programs offer financial incentives and technical support for farmers to implement sustainable practices. Participation is voluntary, and effectiveness depends on the type and implementation of practices. A conservation plan developed with USDA or state extension staff is necessary for program participation. Forestry practices that reduce emissions and sequester carbon include afforestation, reforestation, forest management, pruning, and fertilization. Conservation programs under USDA focus on land management practices such as logging, sustainable forestry, pruning, and avoided deforestation. These programs aim to improve land management on working lands through Title II of the 2008 farm bill. Major programs include land retirement/easement programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and working lands programs. The USDA's Farmland Protection Program (FPP) supports improved land management and farm production practices through programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). These programs offer cost-sharing, incentive payments, and technical assistance. The Conservation Innovation Grants program under EQIP aims to accelerate technology transfer and adoption of innovative conservation technologies. The USDA has expanded farmland conservation programs to encourage emission reductions and carbon sequestration through pilot projects and field trials. Grants have supported various approaches, such as reducing ammonia emissions from poultry litter and promoting conservation tillage and solar energy technologies. Programs like EQIP and CSP prioritize projects that promote anaerobic digestion, nutrient management plans, and other cropland practices to reduce net emissions. The USDA has made reducing emissions a national priority for conservation programs, affecting funding and project ranking. Changes in scoring now prioritize vegetative covers that sequester carbon, with initiatives to plant bottomland hardwoods for carbon sequestration. Marketable credits can be generated from these programs, with over $5 billion in annual funding. The USDA's conservation programs receive over $5 billion annually, with voluntary land retirement and land conversion/restoration programs accounting for 37% of spending. Cost-sharing and technical assistance programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA make up 21% of funding. Conservation technical assistance and extension services receive one-fourth of the budget. State-level decisions determine how funding is allocated, with the 2008 farm bill increasing funding for programs that enhance carbon storage, reduce emissions, lower energy consumption, and boost agricultural production. The 2008 farm bill increased funding for EQIP and CSP, expanded eligibility to include private forest lands, and addressed air quality concerns from agriculture operations. Changes to CRP aim to establish native vegetation cover and promote tree planting for habitat improvement and carbon uptake. FPP and GRP saw expanded eligibility for forest lands and grasslands enrollment. The 2008 farm bill included expanded grasslands enrollment and emphasized long-term and permanent easements. It also introduced a new conservation provision to facilitate farmers' participation in carbon and emissions trading markets. Other farm bill programs encourage agricultural practices that reduce GHG emissions and sequester carbon, including forestry, energy, and research programs. Renewable energy projects receive additional funding across multiple farm bill titles. The 2008 farm bill provided funding for renewable energy projects through various titles, including Conservation, Energy, and Research. One program, the Rural Energy for America Program, offered grants for energy audits and renewable energy development. Another program, the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, supported the development of renewable energy feedstocks like cellulosic ethanol. The 2008 farm bill included provisions for research on renewable fuels, feedstocks, and energy efficiency, as well as forestry programs administered by USDA's Forest Service. One program with agroforestry benefits is the Healthy Forests Reserve Program, which helps restore and enhance forest ecosystems. Funding for these programs is limited, but new programs like the Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program were created with potential agroforestry benefits. The 2008 farm bill introduced programs like the Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program to protect and restore forests threatened by conversion to non-forest uses. State-level agriculture conservation programs offer assistance to farmers in implementing practices to increase carbon storage capacity on forest lands. Many states offer cost-share programs providing financial assistance to landowners for conservation projects benefiting forests, fish, and wildlife. Some states also offer low-interest financing to farmers for implementing conservation practices. Buffer strip programs may provide rental payments to landowners for creating vegetative buffer strips near water bodies. Several states promote conservation improvements by maintaining vegetative buffer strips on croplands near water bodies. States with taxing authority for conservation purposes, like Nebraska, Missouri, and Oregon, have stable funding and staffing for these efforts. The Pew Center on Global Climate Change has identified state programs promoting carbon storage and emissions reduction in the agriculture sector, such as methane recovery and biofuels generation from livestock waste in Oregon, Wisconsin, Vermont, and North Carolina. Other initiatives include promoting switchgrass as a biomass energy crop in Iowa, providing state income tax credits for biomass combustion in Maryland, and leasing no-till equipment to farmers in Georgia. Several states have formed advisory committees to investigate carbon sequestration potential, with California developing an accounting program to track future GHG mitigation costs in agriculture. State programs and initiatives focus on climate change mitigation strategies, including the development of climate action plans by the Center for Climate Strategies. These plans incorporate emissions reduction goals in sectors like agriculture and forestry, with activities ranging from forest and land use management to soil carbon management. California is actively developing programs to support emission reductions legislation, including strategies in agriculture such as manure digester protocols, research on reducing nitrogen emissions, replacing diesel engines with electric motors, and evaluating measures for dairy barns. California is implementing early action strategies to reduce methane emissions at dairies, including modified feed management and manure removal strategies. These efforts complement existing programs like the state's manure digester cost-share program and other agriculture projects focused on carbon sequestration, energy conservation, biofuels, and renewable energy. Regional climate initiatives like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) are also in place to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and set economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions targets. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) have set economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions targets. Both programs include agricultural projects for trading emissions, such as carbon sequestration and methane emission reduction from manure management. Actions considered for inclusion cover forestry protocols, manure digester protocols, dairy barn measures, feed management, soil sequestration, and replacing diesel engines with electric motors. The voluntary carbon offset market allows businesses and individuals to purchase carbon credits generated from projects that prevent or reduce carbon emissions. Companies and individuals buy credits to reduce their carbon footprint or bank reductions for future mandatory GHG reduction programs. In the United States, the current offset framework is voluntary due to the lack of federal requirements to curtail GHG emissions. Some states and regional initiatives may limit the use of carbon offsets. GHG reduction initiatives may limit the use of carbon offsets, but voluntary carbon offset exchange programs involving U.S. farmers and private landowners are growing rapidly. The National Farmers Union and Iowa Farm Bureau operate programs with thousands of producers across multiple states, covering millions of acres of farmland. Practices like no-till crop management are included in these programs. Farmland enrolled in programs covering various practices like no-till crop management, grassland conversion, forest restoration, and renewable energy use. Similar initiatives in Illinois, Indiana, and the Northwest also aggregate carbon credits for sale on the Chicago Climate Exchange. Farmer participation helps offset costs for emissions controls and carbon sequestration practices. Congress is considering energy and climate policy options that may impact agriculture and forestry sectors. While current proposals do not mandate GHG emission reductions in these sectors, they could increase farm input costs. However, farmers could offset these costs by participating in carbon offset and renewable energy programs included in the legislation. This includes provisions for tradeable allowances and a carbon offset program for carbon storage activities. The omnibus 2008 farm bill included provisions for renewable energy and carbon storage activities, aiming to expand the market for biofuels and energy crops. These bills are currently being debated in Congress, with a focus on facilitating farmers' participation in environmental services markets, particularly in carbon storage. The 2008 farm bill provision aims to establish technical guidelines for measuring environmental benefits from conservation and land management activities to incentivize agriculture and forestry to reduce emissions, adopt energy efficiency measures, and produce renewable energy feedstocks. The 2008 farm bill provision requires the establishment of guidelines for measuring environmental benefits from conservation and land management activities. It also mandates the creation of a protocol and registry to report and maintain these benefits. The USDA is directed to consult with various agencies and stakeholders, but funding for this provision is not specified. This inclusion in the farm bill is expected to broaden the scope of conservation programs to address aspects of the climate change debate. The 2008 farm bill provision mandates guidelines for measuring environmental benefits from conservation activities. It also requires the creation of a protocol and registry to report these benefits. The provision aims to promote markets for ecosystem services, including carbon trading, to mitigate climate change. The committee advising the board will consist of various stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers, and tribal representatives. USDA is establishing the Office of Ecosystem Services and Markets to support the development of markets for ecosystem services in agriculture and forestry. The House Agriculture Committee issued a climate change questionnaire to gather input on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting concerns and market opportunities for farmers and landowners. The House Agriculture Committee discussed market opportunities and issues for farmers and landowners in relation to pending climate legislation. Some groups question if agricultural operations could be included in emissions cap proposals, while others argue that climate legislation will increase energy and production costs for the farming sector. The agricultural and forestry sectors are actively debating participation in an offset and allowance program within pending climate legislation. A broad-based industry coalition, including agricultural groups and former Senators Bob Dole and Tom Daschle, supports the inclusion of agriculture and forestry offsets and allowances in a cap-and-trade scheme. Most groups, including environmental organizations, generally support the integration of carbon offset projects in such a program. The inclusion of agriculture and forestry offsets in a cap-and-trade scheme is supported by many groups, but remains controversial due to concerns about measurement, verification, and flexibility in meeting emission reduction goals. The EU's Emission Trading System does not currently allow for these types of projects. Concerns about biological sequestration offsets include issues with Permanence/Duration, Measurement/Accounting, and Effectiveness. Land uses can change over time, making it difficult to measure and account for sequestration. The success of mitigation practices depends on implementation, management, and duration. Concerns about biological sequestration offsets include issues with Permanence/Duration, Measurement/Accounting, and Effectiveness. Land uses can change over time, making it difficult to measure and account for sequestration. The success of mitigation practices depends on implementation, management, and duration. Additionally, questions may arise regarding Additionality/Double Counting and Leakage in the agriculture and forestry sectors as part of the broader climate change debate. The curr_chunk discusses the potential options for reducing GHG emissions in the agriculture sector, including incentives for emissions reductions and challenges with cost concerns in adopting manure and feed management strategies. It also raises questions about the upper limits and storage value of carbon capture and storage initiatives in agriculture. The curr_chunk discusses the federal role in expanding conservation programs and creating new market opportunities for farmers through a carbon credit trading system. It also addresses concerns about measuring carbon sequestered in agricultural soils and implementing guidelines for environmental benefits in agriculture and forestry. The curr_chunk discusses the potential challenges and considerations of implementing a carbon credit trading system in the agriculture and forestry sectors, including measuring stored carbon, compensation availability, required management practices, and accounting methodologies. It also explores opportunities to expand federal conservation programs for greater emissions reduction and carbon sequestration in agriculture, while integrating these goals with other conservation objectives. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of bioenergy promotion on land management and conservation strategies to increase carbon uptake in agricultural lands. It also raises questions about the potential effects of increased agricultural production in response to corn-based ethanol on broader climate change goals. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impacts of increased corn production for ethanol on emissions, carbon sequestration, and energy efficiency in agriculture. It also addresses the need to safeguard U.S. agricultural production from the effects of climate change such as increased variability and environmental hazards. The curr_chunk discusses the need for additional initiatives in the U.S. agriculture sector to prepare for the effects of global climate change on agricultural production and food security. It raises questions about which regions and crops may be \"winners\" or \"losers\" and how transitions can be eased."
