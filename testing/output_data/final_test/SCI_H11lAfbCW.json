    "content": "The paper reframes architecture selection as understanding how data determines the most expressive and generalizable architectures. It suggests using algebraic topology to measure data complexity and shows that a network's ability to express dataset complexity limits its generalization. Empirical analysis reveals topological phase transitions and stratification in neural networks, connecting theory to architecture choices for single hidden layer networks in deep learning. The paper discusses the importance of selecting architectures for single hidden layer neural networks in deep learning. It highlights the challenges in choosing optimal architectures that leverage the data structure effectively, especially in domains like computer vision. Despite advancements in developing novel network topologies, there are no general principles for architecture selection in arbitrary settings. This lack of guidance hinders the scalability of deep learning. The importance of selecting architectures for deep learning in arbitrary settings is discussed. Understanding architecture selection is crucial for scaling deep learning to new domains without expert designers. Theoretical analysis has explored how neural network properties relate to expressivity and generalization capability. Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hyperparameter search that aims to yield powerful architectures, but interpreting the resulting architectures can be challenging. A third alternative to NAS is proposed. Data-first architecture selection is proposed as a third alternative to neural architecture search (NAS). The key idea is to characterize neural architectures based on their ability to learn on a particular dataset's complexity. This approach simplifies architecture selection by computing data complexity and choosing the appropriate architecture for a given dataset. The data complexity is distilled to choose the appropriate architecture for datasets. Dataset D1 has positive and negative examples from disks, while D2 has points from disks and rings with holes. Single layer neural networks need more hidden units for complex datasets like D2 compared to simpler datasets like D1. In this paper, the authors explore the relationship between geometric complexity of datasets and neural network architecture selection. They introduce the concept of 'topological capacity' using persistent homology to characterize the capacity of neural networks in relation to their ability to generalize on data. Their method provides empirical insights into the optimal architecture for datasets with varying geometric complexities. Persistent homology is used to analyze the learnability of different neural network architectures as data complexity increases. The method generates conjectures that refine theoretical bounds on network expressivity and aids in architecture selection by computing the persistent homology of datasets like CIFAR-10 and UCI datasets. Topology is employed to define the geometric complexity of datasets based on connectivity, grouping neural networks by their capacity. Topology is used to understand the relationships between different spaces of points through continuous maps. Two spaces are considered equivalent if there is a continuous function with an inverse that is also continuous, making them homeomorphic. For example, a coffee cup and a donut are homeomorphic because one can be continuously deformed into the other without tearing or gluing. If the donut had two holes, it would not be equivalent to the mug. Topology differentiates sets in a geometric way, discarding irrelevant properties like rotation and translation. Non-topological properties, such as curvature, can further refine architecture selection. Grouping neural networks by 'topological capacity' provides a powerful minimality condition. If an architecture cannot express a decision region equivalent in topology to training data, it is not feasible. Algebraic topology provides tools to measure geometric complexity and compare decision boundaries and datasets by assigning algebraic objects to topological spaces. Homology is a powerful and computationally feasible tool in algebraic topology for this purpose. Homology is a key tool in algebraic topology for measuring geometric complexity by assigning algebraic objects to topological spaces. It helps define the number of 'holes' in a space, known as Betti numbers. By computing homology, we can determine the complexity of different datasets and decision boundaries. Homology is a key tool in algebraic topology for measuring geometric complexity by assigning algebraic objects to topological spaces. It helps define the number of 'holes' in a space, known as Betti numbers. Performing computations on different datasets reveals the complexity of spaces, with the homology of a hollow donut demonstrating this concept. The homology of a space contains valuable information about its topological complexity. The theorem highlights the power of homology in grouping topologically similar spaces and neural networks with similar decision regions based on the number of 'holes'. Persistent homology, introduced in BID30, avoids trivializing computation of dataset homology by providing an algorithm to calculate the homology of a filtration of a space. This allows for the computation of homology directly from the data, capturing meaningful topological information. Persistent homology, introduced in BID30, provides an algorithm to calculate the homology of a filtration of a space, capturing meaningful topological information. In a specific example, the Betti numbers of the homology of X change as balls of different sizes grow, forming holes of varying dimensions. The changes in homology can be summarized in a persistence barcode diagram, where each bar represents a 'hole' of a certain dimension. Persistent homology, introduced in BID30, provides an algorithm to calculate the homology of a filtration of a space, capturing meaningful topological information. When calculating the persistent homology of datasets, diagrams are frequently used. With established algorithms, we can now study the capacity of neural networks using algebraic topology. Applying persistent homology, we can empirically characterize the power of certain neural architectures by measuring homological complexity as a powerful differentiating factor. The Homological Principle of Generalization states that if a model architecture cannot handle a certain level of homological complexity, then there will always be a set of data points on which the model will fail, regardless of how the model is obtained. This principle applies to binary classifiers and their decision regions, indicating that misclassification will occur on a specific set of data points. The Homological Principle of Generalization suggests that even if a model learns to classify data accurately, there will always be counterexamples in the true data. This principle reduces the search space for architecture selection by eliminating smaller architectures that cannot express the 'holes' in the data. The goal is to find neural network architectures that can handle the homological complexity of the data. The homological complexity of neural network architectures is characterized by the sum of the number of holes they can express. BID1 analyzes how the maximum sum of Betti numbers changes with variations in width, depth, and activation functions. However, it remains unclear how these bounds relate to individual Betti numbers, such as the number of connected components or 1-dimensional holes. Tighter bounds are suggested to be crucial for improving results in understanding the expressivity of neural architectures. The homological complexity of neural network architectures is characterized by the number of holes they can express. Improvements in understanding neural network expressivity are tied to unsolved problems in algebraic topology. By training different architectures on datasets with known homologies, we can determine how the homology of data affects expressive architectures. The number of hidden units in a neural network can impact its homological capacity, with certain activation functions showing polynomial results. In an experiment, architectures with varying hidden units were trained on datasets with different homological complexities. The datasets were generated by combining balls, rings, and other shapes randomly. The study aimed to determine if individual Betti numbers have a polynomial dependence on the capacity of neural networks. The study trained neural networks with varying hidden units on datasets with different homological complexities. A topological phase transition in convergence was observed, dependent on the data's homological complexity. The best test error and convergence time were ordered based on the number of hidden units required to express the data's homology. In Figure 4, the best test error of architectures with varying hidden units on example datasets is plotted. Each architecture falls into its own band of optimal convergence before the phase transition point, indicating that additional hidden units contribute to the topological capacity consistently. The study uses topological phase transitions to analyze the expressive capacity of architectures, providing insights into the convergence requirements for neural networks on datasets with different homological complexities. The study uses topological phase transitions to analyze the expressive capacity of architectures, providing insights into the convergence requirements for neural networks on datasets with different homological complexities. Conjectures on the capacity of hidden units are made based on empirical analysis of convergence probabilities, with claims about the convergence to zero error on datasets with specific characteristics. Topological stratification is observed in neural networks during training, with the application of persistent homology to decision boundaries revealing changes in homologies as training progresses. During training, neural network architectures stratify into two groups based on their capacities, with some unable to express complex topological properties. Topological stratification is observed in networks with less than 6 hidden units, showing a consistent correlation between Betti numbers. This stratification aligns with a topological phase transition, occurring when the number of hidden units is slightly less than a specific phase. Persistent homologies up to dimension 2 of real world datasets like CIFAR-10 are computed using the Python library Dionysus. To handle high dimensional data, the dataset is embedded in R3 using local linear embedding with 120 neighbors. A sample of 1000 points from the dataset is then taken for analysis. After embedding the dataset in R3 with 120 neighbors, a sample of 1000 points from the 'car' class is used to construct a Vietoris-Rips complex. The resulting complex has 20833750 simplices and took 4.3 min to generate. The homology of three low dimensional UCI datasets is computed without dimensionality reduction. The persistence barcode shows significant loops and connected components in the Yeast Protein Localization Sites dataset. Topological data analysis in machine learning literature reveals non-trivial findings. Topological data analysis in various fields yields non-trivial computations, such as the discovery of exotic topological objects like Klein Bottles in collections of natural images. Researchers have also found non-trivial dataset homologies in biological, natural language, and other domains. This work is placed in the context of deep learning theory to understand the expressivity of neural architectures. Previous studies have analyzed the relationship between the depth and width of architectures and their complexity. BID16 analyzed the relationship between depth and width of architectures in expressing sublevel sets. BID1 translated this into Pfefferian functions, bounding the sum of Betti numbers. Guss (2016) discussed how topological assumptions on input data impact architecture expressiveness. BID8 showed analytically that some functions cannot be expressed by two-layer neural networks without exponential dependence on input dimension. This led to Poole et al. (2016) reframing expressivity in a differential geometric lens. The work presented here introduces the first empirical method for deriving expressivity results, complementing the differential geometric perspective. Our work establishes a connection between neural network expressivity and architecture selection, improving neural architecture search by computing capacities of different architectures based on their generalization capabilities with respect to the homological complexity of learning problems. This empirical approach provides tighter characterizations of architectural power in relation to decision boundaries' algebraic topology. The method involves developing tighter characterizations of neural network architectures by computing persistent homology on real data. Future research avenues include characterizing networks with many layers and studying how data's topological complexity changes in deeper architectures. Persistent homology is used to analyze data changes in deeper architectures. Homology is described using category theory, with exact sequences and connecting homomorphisms. For a topological space X and open subspace X+, if F contains f such that H S(f) = H(X+), then there exists A subset of X for each f in F. For all f in F where H S(f) = H(X+), there exists a subset A of X such that f maps A \u2229 X+ to {0} and A \u2229 (X \\ X+) to {1}. This contradicts the assumption that H S(f) = H(X+) for all f in F, leading to a contradiction in the topology, completing the proof."
