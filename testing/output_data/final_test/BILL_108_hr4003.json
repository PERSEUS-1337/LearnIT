Recent studies show that children aging out of foster care face challenges like teen parenthood, reliance on public assistance, substance abuse, homelessness, and involvement in the criminal justice system. Foster care children have poorer academic outcomes compared to those not in foster care, even after considering factors like poverty. Studies have shown that youth aging out of foster care face challenges such as lower academic achievement compared to their peers, with African American males in foster care scoring significantly lower than other groups. They are also less likely to enroll in college preparatory classes and have a higher likelihood of not completing high school. Foster care youth have higher dropout rates and academic challenges compared to non-foster care peers. Studies show they are more likely to repeat grades, fail classes, and have lower academic performance overall. Additionally, fewer foster youth go on to college after high school graduation. A study at the University of California, Berkeley found that 39% of foster care youth attending community college from 1992 to 2000 earned 1-17 credits, while 40% earned no credits. Many opted for non-credit classes instead of credit classes. SEC. 3. FOSTER CARE YOUTH OUTREACH AND HOUSING SERVICES. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to add a new chapter providing technical assistance and support services for foster care youth. The Secretary shall provide grants to institutions of higher education to offer technical assistance and services to foster care youth. These services include academic and financial aid counseling, as well as other support services. Institutions must submit applications with assurances to evaluate their services for foster care youth. The institution must assess current programs for foster care youth and improve outreach and retention services. They should report to the Secretary on efforts to increase foster care youth attendance and graduation rates. Additionally, student governing boards should include a former foster care youth to advise on student life issues and barriers to postsecondary education. The Secretary will select institutions of higher education for grants based on their ability to successfully implement programs for foster care youth and expand higher educational opportunities. The institutions must coordinate with State social services and child welfare departments to provide outreach and technical assistance for prospective students who are foster care youth. Additional information and assurances may be required by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide grants to institutions of higher education to ensure housing for foster care youth during the academic year. Institutions must submit applications and will be selected based on their ability to support the program and expand educational opportunities for foster care youth. The Secretary will coordinate activities with the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and ensure services for foster care youth in TRIO and GEARUP programs. Eligible foster care youth will receive supportive services. An individual qualifies as a foster care youth for services and benefits if they are under state responsibility for placement, care, or supervision, including those in foster homes, group homes, or kinship care. Additionally, high school seniors or postsecondary students over 18 who were in state care until age 18 are also eligible. Kinship care eligibility requires state intervention and a court order of dependency. To qualify for kinship care, a court order of dependency must have been issued and the youth must be placed in legal kinship care by the State or a licensed entity. Residing with relatives in other situations does not make a youth eligible for kinship care. Authorization is granted for technical assistance and outreach services under section 408A and housing for foster care youth under section 408B for fiscal year 2005 and the following 5 years. Fair treatment for foster care youth in financial need is also addressed. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include additional financial assistance for foster care youth, equal to 50 percent of living expenses. Additionally, the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance undergoes amendments. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to provide financial aid for foster care youth, simplifying the application process. Data elements in FAFSA will now identify foster care youth eligible for services. The Education Act of 1965 is amended to include retention rates of emancipated foster care youth starting from the 2004-2005 academic year."
