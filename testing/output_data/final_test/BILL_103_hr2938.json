    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"At-Birth Abandoned Baby Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that thousands of babies are abandoned shortly after birth in the United States, leading to a lack of bonding with parents and hindering healthy personality development. The February 1990 report by Human Services recommends legislation to facilitate placement of drug-exposed infants in foster care and adoptive homes. Experts highlight the challenges in terminating parental rights for abandoned babies, hindering their adoption. Special emphasis is placed on the welfare of babies abandoned shortly after birth, advocating for expedited placement for those seeking to adopt and bond with them. The report recommends legislation to expedite placement of abandoned babies for adoption, emphasizing the need for quick placement with suitable caregivers. The Act aims to expedite the adoption process for babies abandoned at birth by appointing preadoptive parents to provide a loving home and initiate legal proceedings for adoption. State courts will make the final decision considering the rights of all parties involved. The Act requires State laws to be in place for the approval of State plans for foster care and adoption assistance, including finding preadoptive parents for babies abandoned at birth within 30 days and placing the baby with them. During the 90-day period after a baby abandoned at birth is placed with preadoptive parents, they have the right to petition the courts to terminate parental rights of others and become the adoptive parents. The courts must not make negative assumptions based on the petitioner's foster parent status. If the preadoptive parents fail to file the petition, further actions may be taken. If preadoptive parents fail to file a petition within 90 days, the State will revoke their designation and find new preadoptive parents for the baby within 30 days. The term 'baby abandoned at birth' refers to a child who has been physically abandoned by parents or legal guardians during a critical period, which ends when the child is 18 months old. The critical period starts at birth and ends either 3-6 months after birth as per state law or when the child turns 6 months old if no specific date is specified. In accordance with state law, provisions and rules enacted under this subsection do not affect existing laws on child abandonment unless in direct conflict. Section 471(b) of the Act is amended to include subsection (c). Babies abandoned at birth are treated as children with special needs for adoption assistance purposes under Section 473 of the Act. For adoption assistance purposes, a child abandoned at birth is considered a child with special needs, regardless of subsection (c). This amendment does not apply to children over 18 months old before the Act's enactment. The effective date for the amendment is specified in Section 5. The amendments made by this Act apply to payments under title IV of the Social Security Act for calendar quarters starting after the enactment of this Act, with a delay permitted for State legislation requirements. The Act applies to payments under title IV of the Social Security Act for calendar quarters starting after its enactment, with a delay allowed for State legislative sessions. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
