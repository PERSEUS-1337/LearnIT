    "content": "The Bush Administration views coal as a key component of the National Energy Strategy due to its low cost and abundance. Legislative issues related to coal in the 109th Congress include energy security, clean air concerns, technology R&D funding, coal gasification projects, and the Abandoned Mine Land program. Coal has the largest domestic reserve base and energy production share in the U.S., with minimal reliance on imports. Energy security discussions emphasize the importance of reliable and affordable energy sources, with coal playing a significant role. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that coal imports will remain negligible through 2025, with a growing reliance on foreign sources for other fuels. Coal is forecasted to be the largest source of domestic fuel production, supplying 22% of U.S. energy demand and over 50% of energy for the electric power sector. The sector consumes 90% of all coal in the U.S., with the remaining 10% used in industrial and commercial sectors or coke plants. Coal use in the electric power sector has maintained a share greater than 50% for the past two decades. The EIA forecasts a 1.9% annual growth in electricity consumption through 2025, to be met by new coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plants. The competitiveness of coal and natural gas for power generation will be determined by fuel prices, capital costs, and plant efficiencies. Natural gas supply is expected to fall short of demand, leading to increased imports. Per-well reserve additions are projected to decline, and despite efforts to increase natural gas supply, coal is forecasted to remain the dominant fuel source for power generation. Power plant development is primarily driven by economics, favoring lower-cost and more efficient operations. The cost dynamics of power plant economics for advanced coal and natural gas-fired plants are crucial. Fuel costs, operation and maintenance, and capital expenses play a significant role. Coal-fired plants have lower fuel costs compared to natural gas facilities, but new plant capital costs favor natural gas. Capital costs for coal-fired plants are higher, making natural gas more cost-effective for electric production. Electricity generation from new plants (2003 mills/Kwh) saw a significant increase in natural gas-fired capacity from 2000 to 2003, with 175 GW of new capacity added. This build-up has resulted in excess capacity, which is expected to decrease after 2010. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a total of 281 GW of new capacity will be needed by 2025, with natural gas facilities accounting for 60% of the new capacity. Total new coal capacity of 87 GW is also expected to come online by 2025. New coal capacity of 87 GW is expected to come online between 2004-2025, accounting for 33% of new capacity after 2011. Coal becomes more competitive with natural gas between 2016-2025. High capital costs may limit advanced coal IGCC facilities to 16 plants or 6 GW by 2025. Rising natural gas prices will lead to more coal-fired facilities from 2010-2025. Natural gas prices of $4-$6 per million Btus make coal competitive, with natural gas expected to increase to 24% of total electricity by 2025. In 2025, renewables are projected to rise to 489 billion Kwh, while coal maintains a 50% share of the electricity market. An estimated 43 GW of fossil fuel capacity is expected to be retired from 2004 to 2025. Long-term investment in clean coal could pay off due to greater coal capacity needs beyond 2016. Factors to watch include natural gas prices, capital costs for IGCC plants, and stricter environmental regulations for coal-fired plants. Proposed Clear Skies legislation aims to reduce pollutants from coal-fired electric generating units, impacting coal production and distribution. Senator Inhofe introduced S. 131 in the 109th Congress, which would place caps on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury by electric utilities through a tradeable allowance program. The proposed caps would be implemented in two phases: 2010 (2008 for NOx) and 2018. The EPA's proposed regulatory initiatives, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the Mercury Rule, raise similar issues for coal interests as the Clear Skies legislation. An analysis of Clear Skies projected a decline in coal generation's share of the energy mix by 2020, with natural gas combined cycle expected to benefit from this decline. The enactment of Clear Skies legislation would heavily depend on future natural gas prices and utility decisions for compliance strategies. EPA projected a significant increase in the installation of emissions control units like flue-gas desulfurization units (FGD) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to achieve required reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions. This would lead to a rise in FGD-equipped coal-fired capacity from one-third to two-thirds by 2020. The Clear Skies legislation could impact emissions control, particularly FGD units, reducing the market advantage of high-sulfur coal. EPA analysis shows benefits for the Interior Basin. S. 131 would weaken the proposed phase 1 Hg cap, potentially affecting coal production and Hg control levels. The future of Clear Skies legislation is uncertain due to controversies surrounding \"co-benefits\" levels and the availability of emerging Hg control technology like activated carbon injection (ACI). Key issues for coal and Clear Skies include the potential impact of natural gas on coal market share, market shifts between western and eastern suppliers, and the uncertain effects of Hg controls exceeding \"co-benefit\" levels. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee discussed these issues in March 2005. The future of Clear Skies legislation is uncertain due to controversies surrounding emissions control technologies and funding issues. The Clean Coal Technology program, initiated in 1984, faced challenges with limited commercial prospects and reduced funding. President Bush revived the program as the Clean Coal Power Initiative, focusing on advanced coal combustion technology for emissions reduction. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is a $2 billion government-industry program focusing on reducing pollutants from coal plants. It targets SO2, mercury, CO2, and nitrogen oxide emissions. There are 10 active CCPI projects, with a focus on multi-pollutant control systems and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technologies. Funding is allocated for both long-term clean coal technology and pilot/demonstration projects. IGCC technology involves coal gasification to produce electricity. Two small-scale IGCC commercial plants are currently operating in Florida and Indiana. The gasification process involves coal, water, and oxygen to produce synthetic gas, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. Sulfur and carbon dioxide are also produced and removed. One challenge facing IGCC is the reliability of the gasification process. FutureGen is a $1 billion industry/government partnership aimed at building a coal-fired gasification and hydrogen production plant to test emissions-free and carbon sequestration technologies. The goal is to permanently sequester CO2 in a geologic formation, providing electricity and hydrogen while sequestering 1 million metric tons of CO2. The FutureGen project aims to provide 275 MW of electricity and hydrogen while sequestering 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. The project has a total cost estimate of $950 million, with funding from DOE, the private sector, and the international community. Funding for the project began in FY2004 and is projected to increase to $50 million in the near-term. The DOE projects a rapid rise in funding requests for clean coal R&D programs, reaching $100 million in FY2008. Additional funding of $228 million is needed between FY2009-FY2013, with $120 million from the DOE Sequestration program. The Bush Administration has attempted to shift funds from the original CCT program to FutureGen, but Congress has blocked this effort. The Clean Coal Power Initiative, a $2 billion 10-year effort, has received nearly $400 million in funding since FY2002, with a $50 million request for FY2006. The DOE's Office of Fossil Energy is increasing funding for Coal R&D programs, with a focus on gasification research. The proposed budget for FY2006 includes a 5.9% increase to $218 million for coal programs, while other fossil energy programs face cuts. The Administration and Congress are showing more commitment to IGCC efforts for commercializing technology, with a significant increase in funding for carbon sequestration. The FY2006 Administration request for Carbon Sequestration R&D is $67.2 million, a $21.8 million increase from FY2005. FutureGen receives $18 million in the FY2006 request. The funding for Fossil Energy R&D in FY2006 is focused on clean coal technology, potentially neglecting other fossil technologies like natural gas or petroleum. The CCPI may require higher investments for long-term success in developing affordable coal technology with reduced emissions. Insufficient funding could lead to industry abandoning gasification projects despite heavy investment in clean coal strategies. Even with heavy investment in clean coal/gasification strategies, natural gas-fired generation may retain its economic advantage over the long-term due to moderate natural gas prices and more efficient gas units. Technology obstacles with IGCC may not be resolved, hindering larger-scale commercial production. Despite this, investing in coal-gasification projects for closer-term commercialization aligns with EIA's forecast of 16 commercial IGCC plants online between 2011-2025. The House-passed version of the FY2006 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill supports funding for CCPI and FutureGen. The House-approved FY2006 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill supports funding for CCPI and FutureGen. Energy legislation in the 108th Congress was blocked by a Senate filibuster, with provisions for coal technology programs. The 109th Congress approved an omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) with provisions for coal projects, including loan guarantees for IGCC technology and Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuels. The bill also allocated funds for pollution control projects and specified that federal loans or guarantees could cover up to 30% of project costs. Between fiscal years 2006 and 2012, $500 million in funding is allocated for pollution control projects, while $1.5 billion is authorized for cogeneration and gasification projects. The Senate's energy legislation authorizes $200 million annually for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) from 2006 to 2014. Funding and support for research and development of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology have bipartisan backing, with the Natural Resources Defense Council advocating for stricter standards despite supporting IGCC for its emissions reduction potential. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were a catalyst for major reductions in SO2 emissions, according to Resources for the Future Senior Fellow Dallas Burtraw. American Electric Power (AEP) argues that without subsidies, large-scale IGCC development will not happen, and the DOE is studying federal incentives to move IGCC forward. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on energy policy in February 2005, but the House's omnibus energy legislation schedule has slowed due to concerns over spending. The House's omnibus energy legislation schedule has slowed due to concerns over spending. On February 10, 2005, the House Science Committee reported H.R. 610, legislation including less controversial R&D provisions. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established reclamation standards for coal mining operations and the Abandoned Mine Land program to promote reclamation of abandoned sites. Fees on coal production finance reclamation efforts, with funds distributed to states annually. The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) funds are distributed annually to states with approved reclamation programs. Collections have totaled $7.1 billion since the program's inception, with appropriations totaling $5.5 billion. The unappropriated balance in the fund was nearly $1.7 billion by the end of FY2004. Approximately $1.1 billion of this sum is credited to state share accounts, with Wyoming alone holding nearly $430 million. Western states have been contributing more due to coal production shifting westward. Authorization for AML fees collection was extended to June 2005 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2005. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend the authorization for fee collections and address concerns about the mechanics of the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program. The Administration proposed refunding unobligated state balances over a 10-year period, but this was not adopted in the FY2005 AML appropriation. A bill advancing changes to the AML program was introduced in 2005. The Administration's FY2006 budget request includes seeking additional funds to begin returning unobligated balances. H.R. 2721 was introduced in 2005 to amend the AML program. The bill aimed to redirect funds to states with sites needing cleanup by returning unappropriated balances to states that had completed reclamation of Priority 1 sites. Another bill, H.R. 1600, introduced in the 109th Congress, proposed extending the program through FY2020, reducing fees per ton of coal production, and ensuring that 50% of annual contributions are returned to states even after cleanup of priority abandoned mine sites. Both H.R. 2721 and H.R. 1600 aim to redirect funds from the AML program to states with sites needing cleanup. They propose returning unappropriated balances to states that completed reclamation of Priority 1 sites and ending allocations to the Rural Abandoned Mine Land Program."
