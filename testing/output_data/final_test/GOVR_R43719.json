    "content": "The First Amendment limits the government's power to restrict speech. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that limits on campaign contributions and expenditures implicate rights of political expression under the First Amendment. Candidates need sufficient wealth to effectively disseminate their message to the electorate. The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo ruled that limits on campaign contributions and expenditures implicate rights of political expression under the First Amendment. The Court concluded that contributions and expenditures facilitate an interchange of ideas and cannot be regulated as mere conduct unrelated to communication. Different degrees of First Amendment protection were afforded to contributions and expenditures, with contribution limits subject to more lenient review. The Supreme Court has upheld limits on contributions to protect elections from corruption, while invalidating limits on independent expenditures. Recent case law states that only quid pro quo corruption justifies limits on contributions and expenditures. Quid pro quo corruption involves an exchange of money for an official act. The report discusses current Supreme Court and other case law evaluating the constitutionality of limits on contributions and expenditures in various contexts, including base limits, aggregate limits, limits on candidates, minors, and super PACs. It also examines a recent case upholding a ban on the personal solicitation of contributions by judicial candidates. The report discusses expenditure limits, including limits on expenditures by candidates, political parties, and corporations and labor unions. The Supreme Court has found limits on expenditures to be unconstitutional but generally upholds reasonable limits on donor contributions to candidates, known as \"base limits.\" Aggregate limits restrict total contributions to all candidates, parties, and political committees. Buckley v. Valeo upheld FECA limits on individual contributions, recognizing the First Amendment implications of both contribution and expenditure limits. The Court distinguished between expenditure limits and contribution limits under the First Amendment. Contribution limits were found to have little direct restraint on speech, allowing for symbolic expression of support. Reasonable contribution limits still permit political expression and association, making them permissible as long as they serve a sufficiently important interest. In Buckley, the Court found that contribution limits are necessary to prevent corruption or its appearance in politics. The limits are considered a key tool in combating improper influence on candidates by contributors. The Court concluded that the reality and appearance of corruption due to large campaign contributions justify limitations on First Amendment rights. The Court also emphasized the importance of closely drawn limits, ensuring they are not too low to hinder candidates from effectively communicating their message. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of contribution limits in cases like Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, stating that limits must be closely drawn to a significant interest and not necessarily fine-tuned. The Court has invalidated certain contribution limits if they prevent candidates from effectively advocating for their campaigns. In Randall v. Sorell, the Supreme Court invalidated Vermont's $400 contribution limit to state candidates per two-year election cycle, citing First Amendment violations. The Court found the limits were too low, not adjusted for inflation, and hindered candidates from running competitive campaigns. The Supreme Court has ruled that aggregate limits on contributions are unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as they restrict how much money a donor can contribute to candidates, parties, and political committees. In McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, the Court invalidated Section 307(b) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. In McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court invalidated Section 307(b) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which imposed biennial limits on aggregate contributions. These limits were adjusted for inflation each election cycle, with base limits on contributions remaining in effect. The Court ruled that these limits were unconstitutional under the First Amendment as they restricted donors' contributions to candidates, parties, and political committees. The Supreme Court invalidated aggregate contribution limits in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, finding a substantial mismatch between the government's objective and means to achieve it. The Court emphasized the prevention of quid pro quo corruption as the sole legitimate reason for restricting campaign financing. The Supreme Court emphasized preventing quid pro quo corruption as the only valid reason for restricting campaign financing. Spending large sums on elections without controlling officeholders' duties does not constitute corruption. The Court rejected campaign finance regulations for other objectives like leveling the playing field or equalizing candidates' financial resources. The Supreme Court's emphasis on preventing quid pro quo corruption as the sole valid reason for restricting campaign financing may impact future rulings on contribution limits. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court upheld a $25,000 federal aggregate contribution limit as a \"quite modest restraint\" to prevent evasion of base limits. The McCutcheon case distinguished Buckley, stating that it did not control due to different statutory regimes and legal backgrounds. Since Buckley v. Valeo, statutory and regulatory safeguards have been enacted to prevent circumvention of base contribution limits. The ruling in McCutcheon emphasized that aggregate contribution limits restrict how many candidates and committees an individual can support, prohibiting further contributions once the limits are triggered. Congress could enact additional safeguards to prevent circumvention, such as targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and committees or enhanced restrictions on earmarking. The Supreme Court ruled that a ban on further contributions to other candidates, once base limits are reached, violates free speech and association rights. In Davis v. Federal Election Commission, the Court found that staggered increases in contribution limits for self-financed candidates are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court invalidated the \"Millionaire's Amendment\" provision of BCRA, which increased contribution limits for opponents of candidates who spent over $350,000 of personal funds. This ruling was made in Davis v. Federal Election Commission, where staggered increases in contribution limits for self-financed candidates were deemed unconstitutional. The Supreme Court invalidated the \"Millionaire's Amendment\" provision of BCRA, which increased contribution limits for opponents of candidates who spent over $350,000 of personal funds. The Court noted that limits on individual contributions are constitutional, but limits on a candidate's expenditure of personal funds are not justified and actually lessen reliance on outside contributions. The Supreme Court invalidated the \"Millionaire's Amendment\" provision of BCRA, stating that it imposed an unprecedented penalty on candidates who exercise their First Amendment right to use personal funds. The Court found that it created a fundraising advantage for opponents and forced candidates to choose between free political expression and discriminatory contribution limits. The Court suggested that increasing contribution limits for all candidates would have been constitutionally acceptable. The Supreme Court invalidated the \"Millionaire's Amendment\" provision of BCRA, stating that it imposed an unprecedented penalty on candidates who use personal funds. The Court found it created a fundraising advantage for opponents and forced candidates to choose between free political expression and discriminatory contribution limits. The Court emphasized that preventing corruption or its appearance are the only legitimate compelling governmental interests justifying restrictions on campaign financing. Candidates have different strengths like personal wealth, fundraising ability, celebrity status, or a well-known family name, and attempting to level electoral opportunities involves deciding which candidate strengths should impact an election. The Supreme Court invalidated a provision of BCRA that imposed penalties on candidates using personal funds, stating it created unfair advantages. They emphasized that preventing corruption is the only legitimate reason for campaign finance restrictions. The Court also ruled that prohibiting contributions by minors violates the First Amendment, as it does not serve a significant interest and lacks evidence of evasion through conduit donations. The Court found little evidence to support evasion of contribution limits and suggested deterrents like prohibiting contributions in another's name. It noted tailored state approaches, such as counting minor contributions towards a parent's total limit. The Court declined to decide on alternative measures' validity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that limits on contributions to groups making independent expenditures are unconstitutional. This decision was based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which stated that independent expenditures do not lead to corruption. The Court in SpeechNow.org concluded that contributions to groups making independent expenditures do not pose a corruption risk and cannot be constitutionally limited. The Court in SpeechNow.org concluded that contribution limits to groups making independent expenditures are unconstitutional. Super PACs, also known as Independent Expenditure-only Committees, can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and political committees. The FEC has issued advisory opinions providing guidance on the establishment and administration of super PACs. The FEC determined that federal candidates, officeholders, and party officials are subject to fundraising restrictions when soliciting for super PACs. The Supreme Court upheld a ban on judges and judicial candidates personally soliciting campaign contributions, ruling it does not violate the First Amendment. This case specifically addresses regulation of judicial candidates, not candidates in the political arena. In Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that state judicial candidates' speech must have the highest level of First Amendment protection. The regulation was found to protect judicial integrity and maintain public confidence in an impartial judiciary. This decision contrasts with the Court's previous ruling in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, where a state's restriction on judicial candidates announcing their views was struck down. The Court recognized the risks to impartiality posed by electing judges but suggested concerns about judicial integrity should focus on the selection process. In Williams-Yulee, Chief Justice Roberts clarified that concerns about judicial impartiality could be addressed through strict regulation of judicial candidates, contrasting with the Court's previous campaign finance rulings. In Williams-Yulee, the Court distinguished between judges and politicians, stating that judicial candidates must be independent of supporters' preferences to maintain public confidence in the judiciary. This ruling is likely to uphold regulations on contribution solicitations in judicial elections. The Supreme Court has ruled that expenditure limits on candidate spending are unconstitutional as they impose significant restrictions on First Amendment rights. This decision contrasts with contribution limits and may impact the constitutionality of campaign finance regulations in political elections. The Court found that expenditure limits on candidate spending are not justified by an overriding governmental interest, as they do not directly benefit a candidate's campaign fund and do not pose a risk of corruption. The Court also rejected the government's interests in equalizing resources among candidates and reducing campaign costs. Additionally, the Court struck down a law limiting expenditures from personal funds, stating that self-financing reduces dependence on outside contributions and lessens the risk of corruption. In Randall v. Sorrell, the Court also deemed unconstitutional a Vermont statute imposing expenditure limits on state office candidates. In Randall v. Sorrell, the Court found that expenditure limits on state office candidates violated First Amendment free speech guarantees. Justice Breyer, delivering the opinion, stated that there was no significant basis to distinguish the expenditure limits in this case from those struck down in Buckley. The Court rejected the argument that expenditure limits served the governmental interest of reducing time spent raising money, emphasizing the importance of free speech protection. According to Justice Breyer's opinion, the Court must strike down Vermont's expenditure limits due to the precedent set by Buckley, which recognized the link between expenditure limits and reduced fundraising time but still struck them down. The Supreme Court has ruled that limits on independent expenditures by political parties are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. In Colorado I, the Court held that independent expenditures do not raise heightened governmental interests in regulation because they are separate from a candidate's viewpoint and cannot be limited under the First Amendment. In contrast, in Colorado II, the Court ruled that coordinated party expenditures may be constitutionally limited to minimize circumvention of contribution limits. The Court emphasized the absence of coordination between the candidate and the source of the expenditure in independent expenditures. The Supreme Court has ruled that limits on corporate and potentially labor union independent expenditures are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. This decision allows corporations to engage in independent electoral speech through political action committees (PACs) without restrictions. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court invalidated prohibitions on corporate general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Independent expenditures advocate for a candidate without coordination, while electioneering communications refer to a candidate within specific timeframes. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court invalidated prohibitions on corporate general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. The definition of electioneering communication was narrowed in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL II) to include only express advocacy or the \"functional equivalent\" of express advocacy. Despite this limitation, the Court in Citizens United found the prohibitions to be a violation of the First Amendment. The Court invalidated prohibitions on corporate general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications in Citizens United. The statute prohibiting corporate expenditures contained an exception allowing corporations to establish a PAC, but the Court rejected the argument that this mitigated the ban on corporate speech. The Court emphasized the onerous reporting requirements associated with PAC administration. The Court in Citizens United invalidated prohibitions on corporate general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. It emphasized that even if a PAC could allow a corporation to speak, the option to form one does not solve the First Amendment issues with the law. The Court stated that administrative requirements could hinder a corporation from timely communication of its views in a campaign. It determined that the law restricting free speech must undergo strict scrutiny analysis, requiring the government to show a compelling interest tailored narrowly. The Court referenced Buckley v. Valeo, where it distinguished between large campaign contributions and independent expenditures, noting that limits on the latter do not serve the governmental interest in preventing corruption. The Court in Citizens United overturned restrictions on corporate independent expenditures, citing conflicting precedent from previous cases like First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce. Bellotti had upheld corporate political speech rights, while Austin allowed restrictions to prevent corporate influence in elections. Citizens United emphasized the unconstitutionality of banning corporate independent expenditures in support of candidates to uphold free speech principles. The Court in Austin upheld a state law prohibiting corporate independent expenditures that supported or opposed candidates for state office, citing the \"antidistortion interest\" as a compelling reason to restrict political speech based on corporate identity. The Court rejected the antidistortion rationale from Austin and stated that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not cause corruption. The Court found that restrictions on speech based on corporate identity interfere with the First Amendment's protection of the marketplace of ideas. It emphasized that all speakers, including individuals and the media, are financed with funds from the economic marketplace. The Supreme Court in Citizens United overturned its previous ruling, stating that restrictions on corporate political speech violate the First Amendment. The Court emphasized that all speakers, including corporations and the media, are funded by the economic marketplace. The Supreme Court in Citizens United overturned its previous ruling, stating that restrictions on corporate political speech violate the First Amendment. The Court clarified that its decision applies to state and local laws as well. In American Tradition Partnership v. Bullock, the Court rejected arguments from Montana trying to distinguish their law from the federal law invalidated by Citizens United. The Court reiterated that political speech by corporations is protected under the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has historically upheld limits on contributions but invalidated limits on expenditures in campaign finance jurisprudence. Recent rulings now require only quid pro quo corruption or its appearance to justify limits on both contributions and expenditures. The Court found that spending large sums of money without controlling how an officeholder acts does not lead to corruption. Government interests in reducing influence over elected officials have been rejected. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned limits on aggregate contributions, impacting the constitutionality of contribution limits in future rulings."
