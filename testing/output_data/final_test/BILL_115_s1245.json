    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Advancing Career Pathways Innovation Act\" and includes definitions. The Act defines terms such as \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", \"business or industry partner\", and \"career pathway\". The Act defines terms such as \"eligible agency\" as a local educational agency, consortium of local educational agencies, or a school funded by the Bureau of Indian Education. It also defines terms like \"Indian\", \"institution of higher education\", \"Native Hawaiian\", and \"registered apprenticeship program\". The term \"registered apprenticeship program\" refers to a program registered under the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937. The term \"school partnership\" involves an eligible agency and one or more business or industry partners, and may also include other partners like community-based organizations or institutions of higher education. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. Other entities that may be considered appropriate include State or local boards defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The Career Pathways Innovation Grant Program is established. The Secretary will establish a career pathways innovation grant program to address specialized skill needs of business and industry through school partnerships. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for career pathways programs at the secondary school level or career exploration at the elementary school level, with a grant duration of 3 years and potential renewal for an additional 2-year period. The eligible agency can receive a grant under this program for a period of time based on progress. The agency must submit an application with a partnership agreement outlining duties and resources provided by each partner. The eligible agency must submit a partnership agreement detailing resources from each partner for the school partnership. The agency must also describe how they will ensure the quality of the career pathways program, including industry-certified credentials, under the grant. The Secretary will award grants based on these criteria. In awarding grants under this section, the Secretary ensures that a minimum of 15% of grant funds go to rural eligible agencies and 5% to agencies serving Indian or Native Hawaiian children. Priority is given to agencies with school partnerships including higher education institutions offering postsecondary credits. The eligible agency receiving grant funds must use them to build or expand a career pathways program that supports career pathways at the secondary school level or career exploration at the elementary school level. This program can include partnerships with higher education institutions offering postsecondary credits or registered apprenticeship programs. An eligible agency receiving grant funds may use the funds to hire a career pathways partnership coordinator, purchase equipment, recruit teachers, provide externship opportunities, and support transportation related to the career pathways program. The eligible agency receiving grant funds must provide matching funds for activities, including support from business or industry partners, to implement career pathway programs that offer industry-certified credentials and coursework for postsecondary credit at no cost to secondary school students. The eligible agency must provide matching funds for career pathway programs supported by business partners. If a partner withdraws, the agency must notify the Secretary and find a replacement. Interim reports on grant progress are due within 18 months. Each eligible agency receiving a grant must submit a final report on fund usage and outcomes within 90 days of the grant period ending. The Secretary will provide an annual report to Congress summarizing the outcomes of grant funds. SEC. 4. CAREER PATHWAYS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

Designated personnel are assigned for rural and Native-serving applications.
