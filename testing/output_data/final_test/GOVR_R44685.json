The report provides tenure data for Senate committee staff from 2006 to 2016, capturing staff pay dates and consecutive time spent in specific positions. However, it does not provide an aggregate measure of individual congressional career length and lacks demographic information about staff. There is variation in job duties and titles across committees and offices. The Appendix lists job titles in congressional offices and provides tenure data for selected positions in Senate committees. The data assumes staff with the same title perform similar tasks, but differences in duties may affect interpretation. The tenure data do not include information on education, age, pay, or other factors influencing staff retention. Tables in this section offer detailed tenure data and visualizations for each position. The data tables provide detailed tenure information for staff positions in Senate committees since 2006. They include job titles, average and median years of service, and trends in staff tenure over the years. The average tenure represents how long staff members stay in a position on average. The average tenure in a job position can be influenced by outliers, such as individuals who stay for many years or only briefly. The median, another measure of central tendency, represents the middle value. Generalizations about staff tenure are limited due to the availability of reliable data and unique circumstances.
