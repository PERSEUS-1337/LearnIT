    "content": "The federal government generally supports the open publication of unclassified, federally funded research results to drive innovation, job creation, technology development, and the advance of science. Federal grants and contracts urge the publication of research results, with classification only necessary in cases of security concerns. This policy, established in National Security Decision Directive 189, states that fundamental research results should be widely available, with classification used only when necessary. Advances in technology in biological sciences raise questions about the use of classification. The federal government faces challenges balancing funding scientific discovery with limiting security concerns, as seen in recent events regarding influenza research. Researchers sought to publish successful attempts to increase transmissibility of H5N1 influenza, prompting government restrictions and recommendations for modified publication. The federal government recommended publishing modified versions of controversial research manuscripts on H5N1 influenza, sparking debate among stakeholders. Some argue against broad dissemination due to the risk of introducing a highly contagious virus, while others believe the public health benefits outweigh security concerns. The case study highlights tensions among stakeholders and deficiencies in federal decision-making processes related to dual-use life science research. The controversy also raises questions about the publication of scientific research with security implications. The implications of publishing controversial research on H5N1 influenza involve multiple policy issues such as federal support, homeland security, and research information flow. The complexity of these issues may lead to conflicts between security, science, health, export, and international policies. The controversy surrounding the decision to publish these experiments has exposed flaws in balancing public benefits and security trade-offs, prompting potential restrictions by Congress on research results with similar risks. The report discusses the controversy surrounding funding and publishing research on H5N1 influenza transmissibility, highlighting potential benefits and harms. It outlines the presence of H5N1 influenza in nature, the transmissibility experiments, and options to improve research handling to minimize security concerns. Influenza is a virus that circulates through human and animal populations, with changing strains that vary in contagiousness and severity. Scientists use abbreviations like H1N1 to refer to different strains. The H5N1 influenza virus, known as avian flu, caused a human pandemic in 2007. The H5N1 influenza virus, also known as avian or bird flu, began infecting people in China in 1997. It has spread internationally, causing 615 human cases and 364 deaths as of February 2013. While highly contagious among birds, it does not pass easily between people, with most human infections resulting from close contact with infected poultry. Future versions of the virus could potentially be more contagious among humans, leading to a possible human pandemic with serious disruptions in services and social. Federal investments in influenza pandemic preparedness activities focus on researching various influenza strains, particularly H5N1. Scientists aim to understand how specific changes in these strains lead to new viral properties, impacting the likelihood of increased human-to-human transmission. This knowledge is crucial for public health policy decisions regarding countermeasure development efforts. The NIAID funded researchers to study genetic changes in H5N1 strains for increased human transmissibility. Dr. Kawaoka and Dr. Fouchier led groups that identified specific genetic changes allowing air transmission between ferrets. Dr. Kawaoka's group created a transmissible H5N1 virus using molecular techniques. Dr. Fouchier's group genetically modified the H5N1 virus to make it transmissible between ferrets in separate cages. They found that current vaccines and antiviral medications are effective against this new hybrid strain. The virus was less transmissible and caused a less severe disease than the naturally occurring H5N1 virus. The H5N1 virus, genetically modified to be transmissible between ferrets, was found to be less severe than seasonal influenza. Dr. Kawaoka submitted his research to the UK journal Nature, while Dr. Fouchier submitted his to the US journal Science. The Department of Health and Human Services labeled the research as \"dual-use\" due to its potential to both help and harm society. Research on the H5N1 influenza virus, labeled as \"dual-use,\" poses a biologic threat to public health and national security. Policymakers must balance the potential benefits of this research with the increased risk of an influenza pandemic occurring through accidental or deliberate release of a modified virus. Disagreement among experts lies in the relative probabilities of these events, with no universally accepted method to determine these probabilities precisely. The H5N1 influenza research results provided new scientific information on genes involved in transmitting the disease between mammals. Future experiments may further scientific understanding and lead to new approaches for treating and preventing the disease. Some H5N1 viruses were found to be transmitted through the air between ferrets, and genetic changes identified by researchers have been seen in naturally occurring H5N1 viruses. Some experts suggest that monitoring five specific genetic changes in naturally occurring H5N1 viruses could provide early warning of a potential pandemic. However, Dr. Kawaoka proposes scanning for traits that these genetic changes confer, rather than focusing solely on the changes themselves. This approach may help identify strains with pandemic potential without relying on a predetermined list of genetic changes. Enhancements to current surveillance efforts may be necessary for this type of monitoring. Some experts warn that enhanced surveillance is needed for monitoring potential pandemic threats from H5N1 influenza research. Concerns include accidental or deliberate release of the virus and the potential for a human pandemic if a modified virus escapes from laboratories. The 1918 influenza pandemic is cited as a cautionary example of the dangers posed by research that increases contagiousness or disease severity. Some experts warn of the need for enhanced surveillance in monitoring potential pandemic threats from H5N1 influenza research. Concerns include accidental or deliberate virus release and the risk of a human pandemic if a modified virus escapes from labs. The 1918 influenza pandemic serves as a cautionary example of the dangers posed by research that increases contagiousness or disease severity. Researchers argue that the potential harm from a pandemic outweighs any benefits from the research, while others believe the work can be safely conducted with appropriate precautions. Accidental releases have occurred even in laboratories licensed to work with dangerous pathogens, and there is concern that published research could provide adversaries with a roadmap to create a bioweapon. In scientific publication, experiments can be replicated for verification, but there are risks of misuse by individuals lacking skills. Assessing risks of publishing dual-use research results is challenging. In the case of H5N1 influenza manuscripts, modifying the virus would require additional technical knowledge. The potential effects of a highly transmissible modified virus causing a pandemic are concerning. Adversaries could exploit research results for malicious purposes. Various stakeholders debated the merits of publishing modified H5N1 influenza research results due to concerns about potential misuse. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity and the World Health Organization issued recommendations, while Science and Nature magazines agreed to consider stakeholder input before publication. International influenza scientists also agreed to temporarily suspend certain research to allow policymakers time to address ethical, scientific, and security issues. The NSABB, a federal scientific board, recommended suspending certain influenza research to allow policymakers to address ethical, scientific, and security issues. They also provided guidance on dual-use research and biosecurity issues. The NSABB recommended suspending certain influenza research due to ethical, scientific, and security concerns. They identified \"dual-use research of concern\" and provided guidance on how to evaluate and reduce potential harm. However, when H5N1 influenza research manuscripts were close to publication, there was no comprehensive oversight system in place. The NSABB reviewed the manuscripts in October 2011 and recommended against full publication due to the potential for harm outweighing the benefits. The NSABB recommended redacting certain portions of influenza research manuscripts before publication, emphasizing the importance of public health findings while excluding details that could enable replication of experiments. They also advised adding explanations of research goals and safety measures, and suggested the U.S. government develop a mechanism for providing select access to redacted information. The NSABB recommended redacting certain portions of influenza research manuscripts to protect public health findings while excluding details that could enable replication of experiments. They advised the U.S. Government to develop a secure mechanism for sharing sensitive scientific information to support public health, safety, and security efforts. The NSABB reversed its earlier position and recommended the full publication of both the Kawaoka and Fouchier manuscripts after reviewing additional information. They concluded that the data would not immediately threaten public health or national security and could benefit public health efforts. The NSABB reversed its earlier position and recommended full publication of the Kawaoka and Fouchier manuscripts, stating that the data could benefit public health and surveillance efforts. Factors considered included pandemic preparedness, influenza research, and international relations. One member disagreed with the decision and criticized the review process, prompting a response from the NIH. The WHO is the primary forum for coordinating global influenza pandemic preparedness efforts. The WHO convened a group of experts to discuss publishing H5N1 influenza manuscripts, recommending publication without redaction but with a focused communications plan. Complications arose in creating a mechanism for providing restricted information due to international agreements and national legislation. The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework is an international agreement linking access to influenza virus samples with sharing research benefits. Donor countries may see restrictions on research results as against the PIP Framework, affecting their willingness to share virus strains. HHS oversees the NSABB and adopted its recommendations, which evolved over time. HHS responded to proposed publication of H5N1 influenza research results by domestic and foreign publishers, but has no authority over publisher activities. The HHS endorsed NSABB recommendations for H5N1 influenza research and stated plans for secure information access and oversight policy development. They responded to the scientific community's temporary moratorium on research, ensuring U.S. government compliance. The HHS endorsed NSABB recommendations for H5N1 influenza research and stated plans for secure information access and oversight policy development. U.S. government agencies conducting or funding such research would abide by the moratorium. Following a WHO meeting in February 2012, HHS continued to support NSABB recommendations but considered new information. NIH requested authors to revise manuscripts based on additional information from the meeting. When NSABB recommended publishing the manuscripts, HHS concurred that the information should be fully communicated to the journals. The HHS, NIH, and White House OSTP released a new policy on dual-use life sciences research to enhance oversight of federally funded research. The Federal policy aims to preserve the benefits of life sciences research while minimizing misuse for harm. HHS also developed a policy framework for funding decisions on research proposals creating H5N1 influenza virus strains that may be airborne. Since 2003, journal editors have voluntarily adopted the responsibility of weighing the dual-use implications of research proposals creating H5N1 influenza virus strains that may be airborne transmissible between mammals. Both Nature and Science journals delayed publication of submitted manuscripts while discussion occurred, and both published the manuscripts after the NSABB changed its recommendation. The recommendations of government bodies were not binding on the journal publishers. During a previous dual-use research publication controversy, the voluntary nature of publisher review and their ability to ignore non-binding government recommendations raised questions about the efficacy of the process. Nature editors emphasized their independence in deciding to publish based on internal considerations, commissioning a risk assessment that supported full publication. They also stated they would not redact key details or limit access in the future. The competitive nature of scientific publishing may allow foreign journals to legally acquire and publish restricted research material. The effectiveness of publisher-based policies in restricting contentious research dissemination is uncertain, especially with the increasing online dissemination of scientific information. The scientific community is divided on whether to publish controversial research, such as the H5N1 influenza manuscripts. Many influenza researchers agreed to a voluntary moratorium on modified H5N1 influenza transmission research, similar to the 1970s genetic engineering moratorium. The Asilomar conference in 1975 established a consensus statement on recombinant DNA research, addressing public concerns. The consensus statement and moratorium eased public concerns and set a framework for research rules. The National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee used this as a basis for oversight. However, stakeholders have not agreed on controls for H5N1 influenza research, despite government policy. This case study highlights tensions among stakeholders and the impact of federal actions. The controversy over publishing these manuscripts reveals flaws in decision-making processes for dual-use life science research. Congressional policymakers may encounter challenges when considering research with security risks. The federal government faces challenges in overseeing and funding life science research with potential security risks. Oversight is conducted through standard procedures and protocols, but not all research activities are systematically reviewed for dual-use ramifications. Federal agencies do not review all research-related activities, such as publication, for potential security risks. The federal government has challenges in overseeing and funding life science research with potential security risks. A new policy was issued to establish regular review of research funded or conducted by the United States Government for its potential dual-use nature. The federal government issued a new policy to oversee research involving high-consequence pathogens and toxins that could be dual-use research of concern (DURC). This policy aims to mitigate risks and inform the development of updated oversight policies to balance the benefits of life sciences research with minimizing the risk of misuse. Dual-use research of concern is defined as experiments that could be misapplied to pose significant threats to public health, safety, agriculture, environment, or national security. The new policy requires federal departments and agencies to review sponsored life science research projects for dual-use research concerns. They must assess risks and benefits, report results to the President's Homeland Security office, and develop risk mitigation plans in collaboration with researchers. The agency must develop a risk mitigation plan for sponsored research projects. This plan should be incorporated into the grant, contract, or work agreement with the researcher. Examples of risk mitigation procedures include modifying research design, conducting progress reviews, and determining publication methods. If mitigation efforts are insufficient, the agency may request redaction of publications, classify the research, or terminate funding. The NIH conducted a review of 381 extramural and 404 intramural projects using pathogens or toxins covered by a new policy, identifying 10 extramural projects as dual-use research of concern. Risk mitigation steps were determined for each project, with a focus on projects involving influenza virus, anthrax, plague, and botulism pathogens. The new policy aims to address deficiencies highlighted by recent controversies by implementing reviews of proposed and funded research to mitigate potential harmful effects. The White House proposed a policy for oversight of life sciences dual-use research of concern, which includes risk mitigation steps like prepublication review and limiting research results distribution. However, compliance with export control regulations may complicate implementation. NIH has conducted reviews, but guidance for grantees is still in development, posing challenges for proper implementation of risk mitigation steps. The federal government generally supports open publication of unclassified, federally funded research results, with restrictions only in rare cases. The new dual-use research of concern policy may create exceptions to this policy, potentially restricting dissemination of research findings. The Department of Commerce regulates the export of dual-use technologies and research results through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Noncompliance can lead to fines and imprisonment. \"Fundamental research\" is exempt from export controls if it is published and shared broadly within the scientific community. Research funded with prepublication review for national security reasons is not considered \"fundamental research\" and may be subject to export regulation. Deemed exports involve transferring information to foreign nationals within the US, requiring export licenses. Conducting research without prepublication review provisions qualifies as \"fundamental research\" exempt from export controls. The NSABB recommended controlled access to sensitive scientific information to address security challenges posed by H5N1 influenza manuscripts. A mechanism for selectively sharing sensitive scientific information is needed to manage risks of dual-use research. The U.S. Government is urged to develop a practical and secure solution expeditiously. The Board urges the U.S. Government to develop a secure mechanism for sharing sensitive scientific information to support public health and security efforts. The Department of Health and Human Services initially endorsed this approach but later deemed it infeasible for the H5N1 influenza manuscripts. Challenges include formalizing criteria for identifying restricted information, establishing infrastructure for storage, controlling access, and limiting secondary dissemination. Experts have questioned the effectiveness of controlling the exchange of restricted scientific information across international borders. Scientists and professionals often share preliminary information through seminars and conferences, making it challenging for the government to restrict its spread later on. Publishers may lack the infrastructure or willingness to limit the distribution of scientific research data. The editors of Science support an international system for accessing restricted information, as limiting distribution could hinder pandemic preparedness. Challenges include harmonizing export regulations and determining scientific credentials, which may be overcome with federal investment. The federal government maintains information with access restrictions and oversees a credentialing system for researchers who wish physical access to certain pathogens known as select agents. While these systems do not currently limit access to dual-use research results, they may serve as a potential model for developing necessary systems. It remains unclear if policymakers would consider increasing the federal role in this manner an appropriate response. The OSTP policy on dual-use life sciences research emphasizes identifying the dual-use nature of research programs at the beginning. The OSTP policy requires funding agencies to review research portfolios for potential dual-use research of concern, posing challenges in completeness, identification, risk assessment, and mitigation. While the policy may identify some dual-use research, it may not catch all instances, as unexpected results can arise. Periodic review of ongoing projects may help uncover unforeseen dual-use research but presents its own challenges. The effort to review existing and future research activities funded by federal agencies may require clear guidance and oversight. Program managers reviewing research projects could spend most of their time identifying activities that are not dual-use research of concern, potentially affecting the accuracy of their reviews. Some experts argue that the dual-use implications of research activities vary depending on the analyst's perspective, with questions raised about the risks versus benefits of federal biodefense research activities. The NIH faces challenges in developing policy for H5N1 influenza research due to varying expertise among officials and scientists, leading to inconsistent risk and benefit assessments. Stakeholder consensus on policy details has not been achieved, and broadening the approach may be even more difficult. However, the NIH process could serve as a template for future policy development in other life-science areas. The new dual-use research policy is limited to government-sponsored life science research using specific organisms and toxins for defined experiments. It may not cover all research with national security concerns, as it does not include all potentially threatening organisms or toxins. Future efforts may involve developing similar policies in other research fields or funding agencies. Research on pathogens with harmful effects or decreased response to countermeasures may not be identified by the new dual-use research policy. Emerging technologies could also pose challenges by enabling malicious use of pathogens and toxins. The OSTP has proposed additional policies for oversight of dual-use research of concern, including the \"United States Government Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern.\" This policy would establish review and oversight requirements for federally funded life sciences research, with the potential for future expansion to cover more pathogens or experiments. The proposed DURC framework grants research institutions discretion to consider other types of life sciences research. This policy applies only to federal-government-sponsored research, not covering research not funded by the government. Broadening the scope of OSTP policies may address potential shortcomings but increase administrative burden. Broadening the scope of oversight to include non-government-sponsored research may increase administrative burden and raise enforcement issues. Congressional policymakers have options to either maintain the current policy framework or increase oversight activities to address scientific and security concerns. The NSABB, voluntary advisory processes with publishers, and the new government-wide dual-use research of concern policy are being implemented by federal agencies. Congress has the option to wait for agencies to complete implementation or increase oversight activities through requests for information or legislation to address policy gaps. Congressional policymakers may direct funding agencies to identify and address dual-use research concerns before funding. A formalized framework is needed to assess such research, potentially utilizing measures from the NSABB and dual-use research policy. This policy currently affects a small portion of federally funded research, and assessing all research activities may require significant investment. The assessment of all federally funded research activities may require significant investment by executive branch agencies. Prepublication review for research or new funding opportunities could help identify and mitigate dual-use concerns. Some universities are hesitant towards restricted research funding. Some universities have policies against accepting federal funding that requires prepublication review, leading to a decrease in eligible scientists and potentially lower quality research. It is challenging to predict if research will yield sensitive results, as seen in unexpected outcomes like the mousepox experiments. Congressional policymakers may consider overseeing the recipients of research funding for review. Federal agencies may require contract and grant recipients to identify dual-use ramifications in their research activities. Congressional policymakers could mandate prepublication review of dual-use research results and limit distribution, potentially by credentialing scientists for access. The NSABB recommended developing mechanisms to control distribution of sensitive information. Access to sensitive scientific information could be restricted to scientists with appropriate credentials or need-to-know access, controlled by the federal government or publishers through secure websites. Opponents raise concerns about logistical difficulties in determining access eligibility, implementing dual-use labels, and ensuring transparency in the process. Some scientists or universities may choose not to participate if the process is perceived as arbitrary. Some members of the scientific community have concerns about federally based prepublication review of research, as it may not cover all basic and applied research. There are differing opinions on whether restricting access to data would be practical or effective, with some supporting the idea while others believe it would be impractical. Some members of the scientific community support developing a system for federal prepublication review to determine security risks in research. Congressional policymakers may consider expanding the federal government's role in overseeing dual-use biological research, suggesting that such research be limited to select researchers at specific facilities. Some scientists argue that licensing researchers, facilities, or experiments could hinder scientific productivity, while others support federal oversight of dual-use biological research. The registration of life scientists for licensed research shows willingness to comply, but concerns remain about limiting research diversity and international agreements in influenza research. An alternative approach to addressing concerns raised by specific research might be to mandate increased biosafety for activities like H5N1 influenza transmissibility research, as seen in Canada's upgrade from BSL 3 to BSL 4. Some experts suggest conducting such research only under the highest level of biosafety containment to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate releases. Current U.S. requirements for H5N1 influenza research mandate BSL 3 level facilities, with fewer BSL 4 labs available. Increasing biosafety levels could limit research locations and access, reducing risks but potentially hindering scientific progress due to logistical and cost constraints. Congressional policymakers may need to balance potential outcomes and likelihood of events when considering biosafety measures in BSL 4 laboratories. Dual-use issues present challenges due to their multi-disciplinary nature, involving security, scientific, health, export, and international policy considerations. Analysis based on one set of policy priorities may have unforeseen consequences. When analyzing a topic, policy priorities must consider potential trade-offs between security, public health, and scientific advancement. Policymakers should establish regulatory frameworks that maximize benefits from dual-use research while minimizing risks."
