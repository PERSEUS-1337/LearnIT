    "content": "The Act titled \"Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act of 2001\" is established for the purpose of ensuring motor vehicle owners have the right to repair their vehicles. The Congress finds that timely, reliable, and affordable diagnosis, service, and repair of motor vehicles are crucial for consumer safety. Consumers should have the option to choose among competing repair facilities. Increased competition among repair facilities will benefit vehicle owners. The use of computers in vehicle systems is increasing, making proper diagnosis and repair essential for safety and operation. Access codes can hinder owners from timely vehicle diagnosis and repair. Aftermarket parts supply benefits US consumers and economy. Vehicle owners should have the right to all necessary information for repairs. The Congress has granted the Federal Trade Commission authority to enforce rules promoting competition and protecting consumers. Vehicle owners should have the right to access all information needed for diagnosis, service, and repair of their vehicles, choose between original and aftermarket parts, and make necessary repairs to maintain their vehicles in good condition. Restrictions on vehicle repair information limit consumer choice and competition. The purposes of this Act are to ensure vehicle owners have access to all necessary information for diagnosis, service, and repair, promote safety by disclosing information timely and affordably, and encourage competition in vehicle repair. SEC. 3. MANUFACTURER DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. Manufacturers of motor vehicles in the US must provide necessary information for diagnosing, servicing, or repairing vehicles to owners, repair facilities, and the Federal Trade Commission. This includes integrating replacement equipment and other information for vehicle maintenance. The Federal Trade Commission cannot compel manufacturers to disclose trade secrets publicly. The Trade Commission cannot force manufacturers to publicly disclose information that would reveal trade secrets, but can request it for evaluation. Manufacturers must provide information to dealers and repair facilities. SEC. 4 states that failure to provide required information by a manufacturer is considered an unfair or deceptive act in commerce. Violating rules under section 6(a) is also deemed a violation of unfair or deceptive practices. SEC. 5 discusses the private right of action. SEC. 5 allows vehicle owners or repair facilities to sue for violations of the Act and recover litigation costs. The action can be filed in a U.S. district court without restrictions on the amount in dispute or parties' citizenship. SEC. 6 pertains to rulemaking. SEC. 6 of the Act requires the Federal Trade Commission to establish rules within 180 days for manufacturers to provide required information in a uniform manner. These rules apply to vehicles made after 1994 and cannot interfere with the EPA's authority over emissions control systems. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as \"commerce,\" \"manufacturer,\" \"motor vehicle,\" \"motor vehicle equipment,\" \"vehicle owner,\" \"repair facility,\" \"replacement equipment,\" and \"model year.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the regulations outlined in the Act. The term \"model year\" is defined in section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code."
