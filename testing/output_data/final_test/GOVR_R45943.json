    "content": "Agriculture-based renewable energy includes biofuels like corn-based ethanol and soy-based biodiesel, wind turbines on farmland, anaerobic digesters converting animal waste into power, and biomass for industrial heat. U.S. policymakers have supported biofuels since the late 1970s through incentives, regulations, and programs, with ethanol and biodiesel receiving significant federal support. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 and subsequent legislation provided exemptions and incentives for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 directed cooperation between USDA and DOE for research on biofuels. The 2002 and 2008 farm bills authorized and expanded programs promoting renewable energy, particularly those utilizing biomass feedstock. The 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018) continues federal support for renewable energy programs utilizing biomass feedstock through FY2023. Motivations include energy security, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing domestic demand for U.S.-produced farm products. Congress has enacted temporary tax incentives for biofuels, such as tax credits for biodiesel and second-generation biofuel. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the tax incentive for biodiesel and renewable diesel through the end of 2017. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates renewable fuel usage and tax incentives for ethanol and biofuels have historically reduced federal tax revenue. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit expired in 2011 after costing $46.9 billion from FY1980 to FY2013. Excise tax incentives for biodiesel producers have reduced federal revenue by $17.3 billion between FY2008 and FY2018. The 2018 farm bill continues congressional support for renewable energy from agriculturally sourced materials. The report focuses on policies supporting agriculture-based renewable energy in the bill. It describes USDA bioenergy policies, defines bioenergy provisions in the bill, and presents budget data in an appendix. The 2018 farm bill supports renewable energy from agriculturally sourced materials. Federal biofuels policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard, have origins outside of farm bills. These policies play a key role in energy, tax, and environmental policy. The VEETC tax credit for biofuels expired in 2011 along with the ethanol import tariff. Other tax credits were available for biodiesel and small ethanol producers. The 2002 farm bill was the first to include an energy title, providing incentives for research and development of second-generation biofuels. Federal and state programs support renewable energy sources, including biofuels, to expand distribution and use. The 2002 farm bill included an energy title (Title IX) that authorized grants, loans, and loan guarantees to promote research on agriculture-based renewable energy and encourage the adoption of renewable energy systems. Interest in renewable energy grew rapidly due to increases in petroleum prices and biofuels production, with U.S. ethanol production expanding from 2 billion to over 6.5 billion gallons between 2002 and 2007. Corn use for ethanol also increased from 11% to 23% of the U.S. corn crop during this period. The expansion of U.S. corn ethanol production raised concerns about higher prices for grains and oilseeds, leading to increased livestock feed costs, food prices, and lower agricultural exports. Environmental worries included water impacts and the use of nontraditional lands for corn production. In response, policymakers aimed to shift focus to non-corn starch feedstock, especially cellulosic-based feedstock, through the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill, following the enactment of the EISA, aimed to increase the use of advanced biofuels from non-corn starch feedstock. The bill included provisions to expand the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to reach 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2022. However, meeting these goals has been challenging, with funding for energy programs expiring in 2012. The 2014 farm bill extended renewable energy provisions and provided new mandatory funding. The 2014 farm bill made changes to energy programs, including the Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) and repealing certain programs and studies. The 2018 farm bill extends most 2014 farm bill energy programs through FY2023 with new mandatory funding. The 2018 farm bill extends energy programs from the 2014 farm bill through FY2023 with new mandatory funding. It establishes the Carbon Utilization and Biogas Education Program and repeals the Repowering Assistance Program and Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative. The 2018 farm bill provides less mandatory funding for energy programs compared to the 2014 farm bill, but has increased discretionary authorization. The 2018 farm bill authorizes both mandatory and discretionary funding for energy programs. Mandatory funding is provided through the borrowing authority of USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, while discretionary funding is determined annually through the appropriations process. The 2002 farm bill also included provisions for discretionary appropriations. The 2002 farm bill provided mandatory funding of $801 million and discretionary authorizations of $294 million for farm bill energy programs. The Bioenergy Program received 75% of the mandatory appropriations, while the Renewable Energy Systems program received 15%. Discretionary authorizations went to Biomass Research and Development. The 2008 farm bill authorized over $1.0 billion in mandatory funding and nearly $1.5 billion in discretionary appropriations. The 2008 farm bill authorized over $1.0 billion in mandatory funding and nearly $1.5 billion in discretionary appropriations to Title IX energy programs for FY2008-FY2012. Mandatory funding included allocations for the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, and Rural Energy for America Program. Discretionary funding included allocations for the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, and REAP, but actual appropriations were below authorized levels. The bioenergy provisions in Title IX of the 2008 farm bill, except for the Feedstock Flexibility Program for Bioenergy Producers, expired in 2012 due to lack of mandatory funding. The 112th Congress passed continuing resolutions for FY2013 appropriations. The Rural Energy for America Program was the only bioenergy program that received funding. The Rural Energy for America Program was the sole Title IX bioenergy program that received discretionary funds in FY2013. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized $694 million in new mandatory funding for renewable energy programs. Congress lowered the mandatory funding for four programs under the 2014 farm bill through annual appropriations bills. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes energy title programs with $375 million in new mandatory funding and $1.7 billion in authorized appropriations. It reduces the number of energy programs receiving mandatory funding compared to previous farm bills. The 2018 farm bill has reduced the number of energy programs receiving mandatory funding, while maintaining similar levels of discretionary programs and funding as the 2014 farm bill. Some programs previously receiving mandatory funding now only qualify for discretionary funding. The bill includes a distinct energy title (Title IX) continuing bioenergy programs from previous farm bills. The 2018 farm bill made three substantive modifications to bioenergy-related definitions, expanding the term \"biobased product\" to include renewable chemicals, defining \"biorefinery\" as a facility converting renewable biomass into biofuels, and clarifying \"renewable energy.\" The Biobased Markets Program, administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, was established under the 2002 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill made modifications to include renewable chemicals and expand federal support for renewable energy systems and ancillary infrastructure. The Biobased Markets Program, originally established under the 2002 farm bill, promotes biobased products through mandatory purchasing requirements for federal agencies and a voluntary labeling initiative. Products meeting biobased content criteria can display the USDA Certified Biobased Product label. Federal agencies and their contractors are required to purchase biobased products from 109 categories, including cleaners and carpets. The 2018 Farm Bill extended the Biobased Markets Program through FY2023, adding new implementation requirements such as updating eligibility criteria for renewable chemicals to qualify for a \"USDA Certified Biobased Product\" label. It also mandates the development of NAICS codes for renewable chemical and biobased product manufacturers, along with establishing a national registry. The 2018 Farm Bill extended the Biobased Markets Program through FY2023, adding new implementation requirements such as updating eligibility criteria for renewable chemicals to qualify for a \"USDA Certified Biobased Product\" label. It also mandates the development of NAICS codes for renewable chemical and biobased product manufacturers, and establishes a national registry of testing centers for biobased products. USDA is required to establish an expedited approval process for products eligible for the procurement program and to receive a biobased product label. Funding includes mandatory CCC funding of $3 million for each of FY2019-FY2023 for testing and labeling, with discretionary funding authorized but not yet appropriated. Administered by Rural Business and Cooperative Service, USDA in consultation with DOE. The Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP) assists in developing new technologies for biofuels, renewable chemicals, and biobased products. Grants and loan guarantees are available for demonstration-scale biorefineries. Grants cover up to 30% of project costs, while loan guarantees are limited to $250 million or 80% of project cost. Mandatory funds are used for loan guarantees, and discretionary appropriations fund grants. The 2008 farm bill allowed USDA to implement the loan guarantee portion of the Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP). Rural Development oversees the program, with project lenders submitting applications. The 2018 farm bill extended the program through FY2023, expanding eligible technologies to include advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals, and biobased products. Funding includes $50 million for FY2019 and $25 million for FY2020. The Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) received mandatory CCC funding of $50 million for FY2019 and $25 million for FY2020 for loan guarantees. Discretionary funding of $75 million was authorized for FY2019-FY2023, but no funds were appropriated. RAP aimed to encourage biorefineries to use renewable biomass instead of fossil fuels. The program was repealed in the 2018 farm bill. Administered by Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA. The Bioenergy Program, originally created in 1999, provided incentive payments to biofuels producers based on production increases. The 2008 farm bill established a new Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels to support production of advanced biofuels derived from renewable biomass. Payments are based on actual production and incremental increases, with a goal of long-term production growth. The 2018 Farm Bill extended the Bioenergy Program through FY2023, with funding of $7 million in mandatory CCC funding and $20 million in discretionary funding for each fiscal year. The program limits payments for advanced biofuel from a single commodity to one-third of total funding. Administered by NIFA and OEPNU, the program supports biofuels producers with refining capacity over 150 million gallons per year. The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, administered by USDA, awards grants to nonprofit organizations to educate vehicle fleets and the public about biodiesel fuel benefits. Established in 2002 and extended by subsequent farm bills, the program received discretionary funding of $2 million for FY2019-FY2023 under the 2018 farm bill. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) is administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, Rural Development, USDA. It provides financial assistance for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency projects through grants, guaranteed loans, and combined grants and loans. Funding of $2 million is authorized for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023, but no discretionary funding has been provided yet. Eligible entities include rural small businesses and agricultural producers.

Grants are available for energy audits, renewable energy development assistance, and renewable energy systems feasibility studies. The government's contribution is limited to 75% of project costs for RES systems and EEI funding, and 25% for grants. The 2018 Farm Bill extends the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) through FY2023, with amendments to financial assistance for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems. It includes limitations for loan guarantees and funding of $50 million for each fiscal year. The program covers various renewable energy sources like geothermal, solar, wind, and hydropower, aiming to reduce energy use by installing or upgrading equipment. The Rural Energy Savings Program provides loans for energy-efficiency measures to qualified consumers, with mandatory funding of $50 million annually until FY2023. Administered by the Rural Utilities Service, USDA, the program offers loans to eligible entities with no interest for implementing cost-effective energy-saving measures. Eligible entities include public power districts and utility districts. The 2018 Farm Bill extends the Rural Energy Savings Program through FY2023, allowing loans for energy-efficiency measures to qualified consumers. Changes include expanding the definition of energy-efficiency measures to include renewable energy systems, excluding program debt from borrower eligibility calculations, and streamlining accounting requirements for borrowers. Loans from eligible entities to qualified consumers may bear interest not exceeding 5% and must be used for specific purposes. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) program, administered by NIFA, USDA, and DOE, aims to promote commercial production of biofuels, biobased energy innovations, and development of biobased products. The program has no mandatory funding but allows for discretionary funding of $75 million annually from FY2019-FY2023, with $10 million allocated for FY2019. The program requires loans to qualified consumers for specific purposes, with interest not exceeding 5%. An annual report is published detailing program applications, loans made, and recipients. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) program provides funding for research, development, and demonstration of technologies related to biobased feedstocks, products, and processes, including cellulosic ethanol. Eligible entities include institutions of higher learning, national laboratories, federal or state research agencies, private-sector entities, and nonprofit organizations. The program coordinates biomass research and development activities between USDA and DOE through the Biomass Research and Development Board and Technical Advisory Committee. The 2008 farm bill moved BRDI to Title IX and expanded the technical advisory committee. The 2018 farm bill extended the Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) program through FY2023. Changes include an expanded definition of biobased products to include carbon dioxide and increased cost-share requirements for projects. Applicants must propose projects in feedstock development, biofuels and biobased products development, and biofuels development analysis, with a minimum of 15% funding allocated to each area. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) program was extended through FY2023 with changes including expanded objectives to develop high-value biobased products that sequester or utilize carbon dioxide. The initiative's technical advisory committee now includes expertise in carbon capture, utilization, and storage. Funding of $20 million is authorized for each FY2019-FY2023, but no discretionary funding has been allocated yet. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA. The Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative aimed to assist rural communities in reducing conventional energy use and increasing renewable energy sources. Grants were to be provided for assessing energy use, developing renewable energy systems, and not exceeding 50% of total costs. However, no funding was appropriated, and the program expired after FY2013. The 2018 Farm Bill repealed this initiative, which was administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), USDA. The USDA's sugar-for-ethanol program aims to use surplus sugar for ethanol production, with federal subsidies provided through purchases of surplus sugar for resale to ethanol producers. The program is implemented to avoid sugar forfeitures by allowing domestic sugar processors to borrow from the CCC and repay the loan or forfeit the collateral. The CCC operates the sugar program to prevent costs to the federal government. The CCC operates the sugar program to avoid forfeitures by using the Feedstock Flexibility Program (FFP) to purchase sugar and sell it to bioenergy producers. The FFP was activated in 2013 when sugar prices were below federal support levels, using $148 million of CCC funds to prevent forfeitures. The 2018 Farm Bill extended the FFP through FY2023 with no changes to program implementation. The 2018 farm bill extends funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) through FY2023. Administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), BCAP provides financial assistance to establish biomass feedstocks for processing plants. Assistance includes establishment and annual payments for perennial crops, and matching payments up to $20 per ton for two years. Financial assistance is provided through the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) for the establishment and transportation of eligible biomass material to qualified biomass conversion facilities. Producers can receive payments for producing biomass crops on designated contract acres. Eligible land includes agricultural and nonindustrial private forestland, excluding federal or state-owned land. Lands enrolled in conservation programs like CRP or ACEP become eligible after their contract expires. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides financial assistance for establishing and transporting biomass material to conversion facilities. Eligible material owners can receive matching payments for delivering harvested material, including invasive and noxious species. The 2014 farm bill expanded enrolled land eligibility to include expiring CRP or ACEP easement contracts and residue from crops receiving Title I payments. Establishment payments are limited to certain materials. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides financial assistance for establishing and transporting biomass material to conversion facilities. One-time establishment payments are limited to 50% of the cost, not exceeding $500 per acre ($750 for socially disadvantaged farmers). CHST matching payments are capped at $20 per dry ton for a two-year period. The 2018 farm bill extends the program through FY2023 and includes algae as eligible material. No mandatory funding is provided, but discretionary funding of $25 million is authorized. The Forest Biomass for Energy program, authorized by the 2008 farm bill, provides discretionary funding of $25 million for FY2019-FY2023. Administered by the Forest Service, USDA, the program encourages the use of forest biomass for energy through research and development. Eligible entities include federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes, universities, and private entities. Priority is given to projects using low-value forest biomass for energy production, integrating bioenergy into manufacturing, developing transportation fuels, and improving tree growth for renewable energy. Regulations for the program were never announced. The Forest Biomass for Energy program, authorized by the 2008 farm bill, provided matching grants to state and local governments for community wood energy systems. The program aimed to reduce carbon intensity, conserve energy, reduce costs, and increase awareness of energy consumption. The 2014 Farm Bill repealed this program and introduced grants for Biomass Consumer Cooperatives. The 2018 Farm Bill extends the program for biomass consumer cooperatives through FY2023, now called the Community Wood Energy and Wood Innovation Program. It provides financial assistance for community wood energy systems and innovative wood product facilities. The 2018 Farm Bill extends the Community Wood Energy and Wood Innovation Program, providing financial assistance for community wood energy systems and innovative wood product facilities.
