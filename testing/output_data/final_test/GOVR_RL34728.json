    "content": "Individuals with physical disabilities, intellectual or developmental disabilities, or mental illnesses may struggle to find suitable housing with supportive services in their community. Accessibility issues, discrimination, zoning laws, affordability, and lower employment rates contribute to the challenges they face. Persons with disabilities face challenges in finding suitable housing due to insufficient income, limited state funding for supportive services, and inadequate job training. This can lead to living in restricted settings like nursing homes or group homes instead of independently. The need for appropriate housing gained national recognition after the 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. where institutionalization of individuals with disabilities was questioned. The Supreme Court ruled in Olmstead that states must provide community-based treatment for persons with mental disabilities. President Bush's \"New Freedom Initiative\" aimed to ensure full participation of persons with disabilities in society. Implementing the Olmstead decision was part of this initiative to benefit all people with disabilities. However, achieving this goal may be challenging for many states and communities. The federal government provides funds for subsidized rental housing for persons with disabilities through HUD programs like Section 811 Supportive Housing. Other HUD programs, such as Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly and Public Housing, also fund housing units for persons with disabilities. Federal funds from programs like the Community Development Block Grant, HOME Investment Partnerships, and Low Income Housing Tax Credit are used to develop housing for persons with disabilities. The report discusses funding for the Section 811 program, mixed financing arrangements, worst case housing needs, and homelessness among persons with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act ensures accessible rental housing for persons with disabilities, defining \"handicap\" as a limitation in major life activities due to physical or mental impairment. Amendments in 1988 expanded protections against discrimination based on handicap. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities and imposes duties on housing providers to make housing accessible. It became unlawful for multifamily housing developers to design and construct housing that is not accessible to persons with disabilities after the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make accommodations for persons with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility in units and the ability for tenants to make reasonable modifications. This is to ensure full enjoyment of the premises and prevent discrimination. Under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), landlords must provide reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities to ensure equal enjoyment of their dwelling. This includes allowing modifications such as widening doorways, installing ramps, or grab bars. HUD and DOJ offer guidance on what constitutes a reasonable modification, emphasizing the need for a direct link between the tenant's disability and the requested change. Landlords are not obligated to pay for modifications for tenants with disabilities under the Fair Housing Act. They may require tenants to restore the unit to its original state when moving out and can request funds be deposited into an escrow account for this purpose. Some states offer funding through Medicaid waiver programs or grant/loan programs for home modifications. States may set up grant or loan programs using federal funds like the HOME Investment Partnerships block grant and Community Development Block Grant to assist with home modifications for tenants with disabilities. Landlords may be required to make \"reasonable accommodations\" to ensure tenants with disabilities can use and enjoy their dwelling, which may involve altering rules or practices. A tenant with a disability can request accommodations that may involve costs for the housing provider, as long as it is reasonable and does not create an undue burden. Examples include changing rental payment methods for tenants with mental illnesses and allowing assistance animals in pet-restricted buildings. HUD housing programs like Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities and Public Housing provide designated units for persons with disabilities. The Section 811 program, along with Public Housing and Section 8 programs, provide housing options for persons with disabilities. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as someone 18 years or older but younger than 62, including families of persons with disabilities. There are differences in the definitions among the programs, with Section 811 serving as the baseline for comparison. The Section 811 program serves individuals with disabilities, including those with developmental disabilities and chronic mental illness. The program defines a person with disabilities as someone 18 years or older but younger than 62, with long-term impairments that hinder independent living and could benefit from better housing conditions. The Section 811 program serves individuals with disabilities, including those with developmental disabilities and chronic mental illness. A person with a chronic mental illness that limits independent living and could improve with suitable housing meets the Section 811 definition of disability. Persons with HIV, alcoholism, or drug addiction may also be considered disabled if they meet the criteria. However, individuals solely diagnosed with HIV, alcoholism, or drug addiction without meeting the qualifying criteria will not be eligible for occupancy in a Section 811 project. A person with a severe, chronic disability must have a physical or mental impairment that starts before age 22, continues indefinitely, and causes significant limitations in at least three major life activities. These activities include self-care, language, learning, mobility, self-direction, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Developmental disabilities also require individually planned care for a lifetime. The definition of disability in the Section 811 program differs from other housing assistance programs like Section 8 and Public Housing. The Section 8/Public Housing program and Section 202 loan program have different definitions of disabilities. While Section 811 includes physical, mental, and developmental impairments, it also considers those disabled under Title II of the Social Security Act. The Social Security definition of disability involves the inability to work due to a lasting impairment. The Social Security Act defines disability as the inability to work due to a lasting impairment, including being age 55 or older, blind, and unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. The Section 8/Public Housing program includes those with AIDS but not solely HIV positive individuals, and excludes those based solely on drug or alcohol dependence. The Section 202 loan program defines \"handicapped person or individual\" for facilities developed with its loans. The Section 202 loan program defines eligibility for housing for persons with disabilities, including those living with HIV/AIDS. Housing options depend on the nature of the disability, such as physical disabilities, developmental disabilities, or chronic mental illnesses. Individuals with alcoholism or drug addiction as their sole impairment are ineligible. The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, administered by HUD, funds permanent supportive housing for very low-income persons with disabilities. It provides capital grants and project rental assistance to nonprofit housing developers for construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of buildings for housing. Nonprofit developers do not need to repay the grants as long as the housing remains available and affordable for at least 40 years to very low-income persons with disabilities. The Section 811 program, also known as \"mainstream vouchers,\" provides rental assistance for eligible tenants in the private market. Funding for new vouchers ceased in FY2006, with existing vouchers absorbed by the Section 8 tenant-based voucher account in FY2012. The program now focuses on rental assistance, subsidizing units developed with capital funding from sources other than Section 811. Created in 1990, the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program evolved from the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, established in 1959, initially catered to individuals with physical disabilities but later expanded to include those with developmental disabilities and chronic mental illnesses. Congress eventually created the Section 811 program to separate housing for elderly residents from those with disabilities. Units for persons with disabilities under the Section 202 program continue to be financed and governed by its rules. The Section 202 program, established in 1959, initially focused on housing for individuals aged 62 or older. Five years later, the Housing Act of 1964 expanded the program to include non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals with physical impairments that hinder independent living. Mental, intellectual, or developmental disabilities were not initially included in the definition. The program was renamed \"Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped,\" but did not mandate a specific number of units for disabled individuals. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 expanded the Section 202 program to include individuals with developmental disabilities, removing the word \"physical\" from the definition of handicap. However, very few non-elderly handicapped tenants participated in the program, with less than 1% of tenants falling into this category by 1977. The majority of Section 202 projects were not designed to serve the handicapped population. In 1978, Congress addressed confusion regarding eligibility of chronically mentally ill individuals for Section 202 housing, directing HUD to develop criteria. HUD then collaborated with the Department of Health and Human Services to understand the housing needs of the mentally ill. By FY1982, the Section 202 program funded housing for chronically mentally ill individuals for the first time, supporting group homes and independent living facilities. In 1978, the Housing and Community Development Amendments (P.L. 95-557) allocated funds for group homes and independent living facilities for non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals under the Section 202 program. This new requirement aimed to address the special needs of individuals with disabilities that were not previously met in Section 202 projects. Prior to this, only a small number of accessible units in larger Section 202 developments were designated for persons with disabilities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 led to the creation of a set-aside within the Section 202 program to address the additional cost of making units accessible for persons with disabilities. Non-profit sponsors were encouraged to develop innovative housing solutions, such as group homes and independent living complexes integrated into the community. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 further increased the number of developments specifically for households with disabilities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-242) amended the Section 202 program to require a 15% set-aside for persons with disabilities, increasing from the previous $50 million requirement. Congress later mandated a 25% set-aside for housing for persons with disabilities in appropriations acts from FY1988 to FY1991. Additional changes included rental subsidies for Section 202 units. P.L. 100-242 amended the Section 202 program to require a 15% set-aside for persons with disabilities, increasing from the previous $50 million requirement. It specified that rental assistance for persons with disabilities should be provided through a separate subsidy program based on the total actual and necessary reasonable costs of developing and operating the project. The FY1989 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 100-404) provided separate rental assistance funds for housing for persons with disabilities, distinct from those for elderly residents. This led to the creation of the Section 811 program, permanently separating housing for persons with disabilities from the Section 202 program in the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625). This change also altered the way in which units were subsidized. The enactment of P.L. 101-625 changed the financing of housing units for the elderly under the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. It introduced capital grants for financing instead of loans, with a requirement for units to remain affordable for 40 years. A new rental assistance program called PRAC was established, along with updated development cost limitations considering special design features for persons with disabilities. The Section 811 program was created as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to address the housing needs of nonelderly persons with disabilities. It aimed to provide specialized housing with supportive services and separate the programs for elderly and disabled individuals to better meet their unique needs. This separate program would also ensure a bureaucracy knowledgeable about the special needs of tenants with disabilities. The Section 811 program, established under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, aimed to address housing needs for nonelderly persons with disabilities. It emphasized changing terminology to \"persons with disabilities\" and promoting community integration. The program expanded housing options beyond group homes to include scattered units in multifamily developments, condos, and cooperative housing. Funding included $271 million for capital grants and $246 million for project rental assistance in FY1992. In FY1992, Congress funded the Section 811 program with $103 million for capital grants and $100 million for project rental assistance. The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act in 2010 made changes to the program, focusing on financing and community integration. The Act reauthorized the program from FY2011 to FY2015 at $300 million per year. P.L. 111-374 expanded the use of Section 811 rental assistance to include multifamily housing units funded by sources like LIHTCs and HOME funds. This funding is known as the \"Project Rental Assistance Demonstration.\" The legislation also limited the number of units occupied by persons with disabilities to 25% in buildings developed with Section 811 funds, encouraging developers to seek additional funding sources for the remaining 75% of units. This limitation does not apply to group homes or independent living. The Melville Act made changes to Section 811 funding, allowing for delegation to state or local housing finance agencies for projects combining capital grants with other funding sources. This shift may lead to a move away from developments solely for persons with disabilities towards integrated units in larger developments. The rationale behind these changes is that Section 811 funding can be more efficiently utilized if not solely used for capital costs. HUD distributes Section 811 capital grants to nonprofit housing sponsors for building or rehabilitating housing for persons with disabilities. Funds are allocated to multifamily hubs based on the number of eligible individuals, and grants are awarded through a competitive process. Grantees do not need to repay the capital grants as long as the property is used for its intended purpose. The Section 811 program provides capital grants to nonprofit housing sponsors to build or rehabilitate housing for very low-income tenants with disabilities. Grantees do not need to repay the grants as long as the property remains affordable for at least 40 years. Rental assistance from HUD covers the difference between rent and operating costs, and supportive services must be provided to residents. Approximately 27,000 units receive rental assistance, with a total of $149 million awarded to 92 projects in 34 states in recent years. The Section 811 program provides capital grants to nonprofit housing sponsors to build or rehabilitate housing for very low-income tenants with disabilities. The physical design of Section 811 housing may take on several forms, including multifamily rental housing and group homes with specific occupancy limits set by HUD regulations and policies. The Section 811 program provides capital grants to nonprofit housing sponsors to build or rehabilitate housing for very low-income tenants with disabilities. Group homes have occupancy limits of no more than six individuals with disabilities, with specific requirements for bedrooms and bathrooms. Independent living facilities have individual units with a maximum occupancy of 24 persons with disabilities, with restrictions on the number of residents if the site already contains housing for persons with disabilities. Independent living facilities under the Section 811 program have individual units with a maximum occupancy of 24 persons with disabilities. Condominium units are similar to independent living facilities, with separate bedrooms, baths, and kitchens for each resident. The maximum number of units for both types of housing follows the same rules, but condominium units do not allow a unit to be used by a staff person. Project sponsors may choose to serve residents with physical disability, developmental disability, or chronic mental illness, or a combination. They can further restrict residency with HUD approval. For example, a group house for individuals with developmental disabilities could specifically serve persons with autism. However, they cannot deny occupancy to a qualified applicant within the broader disability category, even if they have a different specific disability. Applicants for Section 811 funds must justify restricting residency by disability categories and show why integrated settings are not feasible. Nonprofit organizations awarded grants for Section 811 housing enter PRAC contracts with HUD for rental assistance. PRAC contracts last three years and are renewable annually. Rental assistance covers the gap between tenant rent and operating costs. Residents must be \"very low income\" and pay 30% of their income. Housing developed through Section 811 capital grants must be supportive housing, with owners providing supportive services to help residents live independently. This model assists various populations, including elderly residents, families with young children transitioning to work, formerly homeless individuals, and those living with HIV/AIDS. Services are tailored to individual resident needs. The Section 811 statute requires property owners to ensure availability of supportive services tailored to individual resident needs, including health and mental health services. Owners can provide services directly or coordinate with outside agencies. Services may include assistance with daily living, counseling for mental health and addiction issues, case management, and employment assistance. Organizations applying for Section 811 grants must submit a certified supportive services plan. The Section 811 program requires property owners to provide supportive services tailored to individual resident needs, including health and mental health services. The supportive services plans must detail service needs, list community providers, show provider experience, involve state and local agencies, and commit to providing services for residents. Project sponsors must ensure services are available but cannot mandate resident acceptance. Rental assistance funds can now be used for multifamily housing units under P.L. 111-374. Rental assistance funds can now be used to support multifamily housing units developed with various funding sources. The Section 811 program, known as the Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program, requires that no more than 25% of units in a development receive rental assistance. Recipients must operate the rent-assisted units as supportive housing for persons with disabilities for at least 30 years. The PRA program, funded in two rounds, allocated $98 million for 3,530 housing units in 2013 and $150 million for 4,584 units in 2015. Rental assistance contracts are for 20 years, with funding provided for the first five years. Eligible applicants are state agencies administering Low Income Housing Tax Credits or HOME Investment Partnership program, excluding nonprofit organizations. Grantees must administer rental assistance funds to extremely low-income, non-elderly persons with disabilities. Units developed with Section 811 capital grants are available to low-income residents. Applicants must establish partnerships with state health and human services agencies and Medicaid agencies to deliver services. Only one application per state is allowed for each agency. The Section 8 rental assistance program allows individuals and families to find rental housing on the private market through vouchers. Tenants pay a portion of their income towards rent, while HUD pays the rest to landlords who accept the vouchers. This program is the primary way HUD provides tenant-based rental assistance. The Section 8 program provides rental assistance to tenants with vouchers, who pay 30-40% of their income towards rent. HUD covers the rest, with vouchers now funded through Section 8 due to a change in law. This collaboration includes using Section 8 vouchers with the Medicaid-funded \"Money Follows the Person\" program to assist disabled individuals transitioning from institutions. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 incorporated tenant-based rental assistance into the Section 811 program, allowing vouchers for eligible households. Mainstream vouchers, funded through the Section 811 account initially, were later absorbed into the Section 8 account. Congress first allocated funding for Section 811 mainstream vouchers in FY1997. HUD could use up to 25% of the Section 811 program funds for five-year vouchers. Initially, only public housing authorities could administer the vouchers, but private nonprofit organizations became eligible in FY1999. Congress stopped funding new vouchers in FY2006. Voucher administrators applied through an annual NOFA process, scored based on factors like the number of disabled individuals in poverty and agreements for supportive services. Since 2005, HUD required voucher administrators to assist disabled individuals with Section 811 vouchers in obtaining supportive services and providing technical assistance to landlords for accommodations. In 2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers shifted to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. New Section 811 assistance is now funded through the Section 8 account, with appropriations to convert existing vouchers. Funding for renewing Section 811 vouchers has been provided through the Section 8 account since FY2012. Since 2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers has been shifted to the Section 8 account, with all funding for renewing vouchers provided through this account. HUD reported a total of 13,905 vouchers originally funded through Section 811. Additionally, Section 8 vouchers have been set aside for families with disabled members, in response to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Beginning in FY1997, Congress appropriated funds for Section 8 vouchers to assist tenants with disabilities affected by policy changes allowing elderly preference in buildings. PHAs must help tenants find supportive services and assist landlords with reasonable accommodations. Congress appropriated funds for designated housing vouchers for residents with disabilities from FY1997 through FY2002, and again in FY2008 and FY2009. Approximately 54,000 vouchers are available. An issue arises when vouchers are given up by current holders, as it is unclear if they should go to another person with a disability or to all eligible families. Section 811 vouchers were specified to remain available to disabled families for five years, but it was unclear who could use the voucher if the original family left the program. In FY1997 through FY2002, Congress funded housing vouchers for residents with disabilities. Approximately 54,000 vouchers were available, with uncertainty on who could use them if the original family left the program. Advocates raised concerns about non-disabled households receiving the vouchers. Congress later required Section 811 vouchers to be available to disabled families upon turnover, and HUD began tracking disability status for these families in 2004. Unlike Section 811 mainstream vouchers, Section 8 designated housing vouchers for disabled persons remained available to other disabled households. HUD defined the term \"to the extent practicable\" to mean that before a voucher can be provided to a non-disabled household, every eligible non-elderly disabled family on a PHA's waiting list must have received a voucher. The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act changed the law in 2011 so that vouchers initially funded through the Section 811 account and Section 8 tenant-based account will be treated the same. The Money Follows the Person (MFP) Rebalancing Demonstration allows states to use Medicaid funds to help elderly people and persons with disabilities transition from institutional settings to home- and community-based care. Nearly all states participate in MFP, with persons with disabilities being the majority of beneficiaries. Since 2008, most MFP participants are persons with disabilities, including non-elderly individuals with physical, developmental, or mental health conditions. MFP funds can be used for services after transitioning from institutional care, with supplemental services like housing modifications, security deposits, and transitional planning activities. Some states also use MFP funds as a bridge subsidy for rent. Despite the availability of supplemental services for housing, one of the difficulties with transition programs like MFP is finding permanent housing for individuals leaving institutions. Affordable, accessible housing is a key determinant of successful transition programs, with challenges including an insufficient supply of affordable accessible housing and rental vouchers. HUD encouraged PHAs to collaborate with state Medicaid offices to provide housing options for individuals in MFP. FY2009 Section 8 vouchers were allocated for non-elderly individuals with disabilities transitioning from institutions to the community. Approximately 1,000 vouchers were made available, with an additional 4,300 distributed to PHAs for disabled individuals. HUD awarded vouchers to eligible housing authorities in 15 states in 2011. According to a 2012 report, housing vouchers, along with other options, may have increased the rate of transition for persons with physical disabilities to the community. HUD funds housing for persons with disabilities through various programs, including Section 811 and Section 202. Property owners participating in Section 8 and PHAs can designate buildings for special populations like elderly and disabled individuals. Public Housing program offers housing for low-income families, including elderly and disabled individuals. Tenants pay 30% of their income as rent. The program began in 1937 and expanded to include units for elderly and disabled individuals in 1956. HUD defines \"elderly family\" to include individuals with disabilities since 1961. Since 1961, the Public Housing program has included individuals with disabilities. Controversy arises in developments where elderly and disabled residents live together. The number of disabled residents in elderly public housing increased in the 1980s and 1990s due to mental health care availability and the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act. The 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act added individuals with disabilities, including those with alcohol and drug addictions, to the protected class in housing. This led to an increase in younger residents with mental illnesses and addictions in Public Housing, causing tension with elderly residents. In response, Congress allowed Public Housing Authorities to designate buildings for elderly only, disabled only, or mixed populations in 1992. The Public Housing Opportunity Extension Act of 1996 streamlined the process for designating public housing projects for elderly residents or residents with disabilities. PHAs must submit a plan to HUD for approval, and if approved, non-eligible residents cannot be evicted. HUD provides data on PHAs with approved designated housing plans for persons with disabilities or elderly residents. The Section 8 program provided rental assistance for new and rehabilitated housing for low-income families, including elderly residents and tenants with disabilities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 allowed owners to establish a preference for elderly families in mixed population properties, but residents with disabilities could not be completely excluded. Owners choosing to prioritize elderly residents still had to reserve units for households with disabilities. Beginning in the 1980s, the federal government took a less direct role in affordable housing development, leading to an increase in production and rehabilitation at the state and local level. This shift was partly due to the enactment of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). Owners of housing units are required to set aside a certain percentage for households with disabilities, prioritizing elderly residents but also accommodating near elderly families with disabilities if necessary. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the HOME Investment Partnerships program have led to an increase in affordable housing production. States and localities can allocate funds from these programs for affordable housing for persons with disabilities. The LIHTC, established in 1986, provides tax credits for affordable rental housing development. The IRS allocates tax credits to states based on population, which are then awarded to developers by state housing finance agencies for affordable rental housing development. Developers must ensure a percentage of units are affordable to households with low incomes, and projects must remain affordable for at least 15 years. Projects must remain affordable for at least 15 years, with incentives for 30 years. Rent for rent-restricted units must not exceed 30% of imputed income limitation based on area median incomes. States prioritize LIHTC projects serving lowest income tenants for longest time in their Qualified Allocation Plans. States must consider tenant populations with special needs in setting housing priorities. The HOME program is a block grant distributed to states and local jurisdictions for developing affordable rental housing and housing for homeowners. States can prioritize housing units for special needs populations in various ways during the competition for tax credits. The HOME program provides funds for affordable rental housing and housing for homeowners based on factors like population, poverty levels, housing conditions, and age of housing. Funds can be used for construction, rehabilitation, rental assistance, and homeowner assistance for low-income households. States and localities have discretion in choosing populations to serve and develop a distribution plan through HUD's Consolidated Plan process. The HOME program provides funds for affordable rental housing and housing for homeowners based on factors like population, poverty levels, and housing conditions. States and localities submit a single Consolidated Plan to HUD, which includes an assessment of community needs and a proposal to address those needs using federal funds and community resources. The plan must also contain a housing needs assessment, including the need for housing for persons with disabilities. States and communities must adopt a citizen participation plan and consult with citizens and organizations that provide services to persons with disabilities. The HOME program allows recipient jurisdictions to prioritize housing for persons with disabilities in their Consolidated Plans. Recipients of HOME funds can establish preferences for tenants with special needs, including disabilities, and target rental assistance to individuals with specific disabilities. Communities can develop various types of housing with HOME funds, such as multifamily rental housing, single family homes, transitional housing, single room occupancy projects, and group homes, which may be well suited for tenants with disabilities. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program was enacted in 1974 as part of the Housing Act. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, established in 1974, aims to develop urban communities by funding housing, community, and economic development activities for low- and moderate-income households. 70% of funds go to entitlement communities, while 30% goes to states for small, non-entitlement communities. Allocation is based on factors like population, poverty, and housing conditions. The program must consider the needs of persons with disabilities in its planning. HUD issued guidance to assist CDBG recipients in identifying and meeting the needs of persons with disabilities during the development of consolidated plans. CDBG funds can be used to rehabilitate housing and make it accessible for persons with disabilities, as well as to make public facilities accessible. Funds can also be used for public services like employment counseling to promote economic opportunities for persons with disabilities. The funding structure of the Section 811 program changed in FY2011 due to the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010. Changes included renewing Section 811 vouchers through the Section 8 account and providing funding for Section 811 rental assistance separately from capital grants. In FY2012, Congress provided no new funding for Section 811 capital grants, focusing instead on renewing existing rental assistance contracts and implementing the Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program. This program assists in funding affordable housing for persons with disabilities through various sources like Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the HOME program. Multiple funding streams may be necessary to support the design, construction, and operating costs of such projects. Affordable housing developers use various funding sources, including federal funds, mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits, and local housing trust funds, to develop housing for low-income and special needs populations. Section 811 developers often need multiple funding sources. In 2000, Congress changed the definition of \"private nonprofit organization\" to facilitate the interaction of Section 811 funds and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The value of LIHTCs for Section 811 developers is determined based on the qualified basis, which includes construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation costs. Federal grants received by the developer reduce the qualified basis and the value of tax credits. The Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 allowed for-profit limited partnerships with a nonprofit organization as the general partner to be eligible Section 811 owners, enabling nonprofits to loan Section 811 capital grants to the partnership. The change in the law allows for-profit limited partnerships to own Section 811 housing developments, impacting the value of LIHTCs. Mixed financing arrangements are complex and not yet common, requiring expertise in housing finance. Developers generally avoid federal grant financing in LIHTC projects. The treatment of Section 811 PRAC in tax credit transactions is unclear, as it has not been exempted from the rule that federal grants do not count towards the qualified basis. Despite exemptions for various programs, Section 811 PRAC has not been excluded from the rule that federal grants do not count towards the qualified basis for LIHTC projects. The IRS has not issued a ruling to include Section 811 assistance in calculating qualified basis. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 removed limitations on developing mixed finance projects using federal grants like Section 811 with LIHTC. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) changed LIHTC law by removing the restriction on federal subsidies for developers, making financing projects with LIHTC more lucrative. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) removed the restriction on federal subsidies for developers in the LIHTC statute, allowing all federally subsidized new construction to be eligible for 9% tax credits. These credits are competitive, making it challenging for Section 811 developers to obtain them. HUD reports show that persons with disabilities have a need for affordable housing, with worst case housing needs defined as very low-income renter households that do not receive rental assistance and either pay more than half their income toward rent or live in severely inadequate housing. HUD found in its recent report that 18.50 million renter households were very low income, with 7.72 million facing worst case housing needs. Disability status was determined through questions about functional limitations and ability to perform daily activities, revealing that 2.8 million very low-income rental households had a non-elderly member with a disability. In 2013, 39% of very low-income renter households with a nonelderly person with a disability (about 1.09 million) had worst-case housing needs. Homelessness in the United States grew in the 1970s and 1980s due to various factors like the demolition of skid rows and decreased availability of affordable housing. In the early 2000s, attention shifted to individuals experiencing \"chronic homelessness.\" President Bush announced an initiative to end chronic homelessness within 10 years, targeting individuals with disabilities who have been homeless for long periods. HUD defined chronic homelessness as living in unsuitable places or shelters continuously for 12 months or experiencing four episodes of homelessness totaling 12 months in the past three years. In 2015, HUD estimated that 15% of the homeless population were chronically homeless individuals, with mental health and substance abuse issues prevalent. \"Housing first\" strategies prioritize finding permanent housing for homeless individuals before addressing their health issues. HUD provides funds through Homeless Assistance Grants for supportive housing construction. HUD provides funds for the construction or rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals, leading to a 30% decrease in the number of chronically homeless individuals between 2007 and 2015."
