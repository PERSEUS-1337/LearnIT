    "content": "The Davis-Bacon Act, enacted in 1931, requires federal construction contracts to specify minimum wage rates for laborers. The act was cosponsored by Representative Robert Bacon and Senator James Davis, and has been amended over the years to include fringe benefits. Efforts to repeal the act have been consistently rejected by Congress. The Davis-Bacon Act mandates minimum wage rates for laborers on federal construction projects based on prevailing rates in the project's locality. The prevailing rate serves as a minimum floor, not necessarily the rate needed to recruit and retain workers. The Department of Labor determines wage rates through general area or specific project determinations, sometimes using direct surveys. The Davis-Bacon Act mandates minimum wage rates for laborers on federal construction projects based on prevailing rates in the project's locality. The Department of Labor collects data from contractors, trade unions, and other parties to determine prevailing wages for different classes of laborers and mechanics. DOL evaluates workers by craft, not recognizing unskilled or semi-skilled \"helpers\" for wage rate purposes. This may discourage employers from hiring helpers on Davis-Bacon projects and instead opt for more skilled craftspeople. DOL does recognize apprentices and encourages their employment on such projects. The Davis-Bacon Act mandates minimum wage rates for laborers on federal construction projects based on prevailing rates in the project's locality. It recognizes apprentices and encourages their employment on such projects. The related Copeland Act requires weekly reporting of wages paid, with an affirmation from employers. Davis-Bacon applies to federal construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings and public works exceeding $2,000. Some states have enacted similar \"little Davis-Bacon\" acts, but they differ from the federal law. In the 1920s, federal construction contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder without considering fair wages for workers. This led to itinerant contractors underbidding local firms by employing workers from low-wage areas, resulting in sub-standard wages and inferior quality work. The Davis-Bacon Act was created to ensure fair wages for workers on federal construction projects, protecting local contractors and workers from being undercut by outside low-wage crews. It aimed to maintain quality construction and economic benefits for local communities. The Davis-Bacon Act, enacted in 1931 as an emergency measure, aimed to secure fair wages for workers on federal construction projects. President Hoover strengthened administration through Executive Order No. 5778 in 1932, leading to subsequent reforms by Congress. The Copeland Act in 1934 prevented improper deductions, and in 1935, Congress made significant changes to the statute, including lowering the coverage threshold for contracts. The Davis-Bacon Act, enacted in 1931, aimed to secure fair wages for workers on federal construction projects. Congress made changes to the statute in 1935, including lowering the coverage threshold for contracts. By the 1950s, Congress began adding Davis-Bacon provisions to various program statutes with federal funding. Extensions of coverage sparked uneasiness with the act, leading to fixed arguments for and against it. The Davis-Bacon Act, enacted in 1931, aimed to secure fair wages for workers on federal construction projects. Current policy debate focuses on whether to strengthen, diminish, or repeal the statute. Critics argue it is inflationary, difficult to administer, and hampers competition, while defenders believe it ensures fair wages and labor-management relations. The debate is more philosophical than partisan. Critics of the Davis-Bacon Act argue that it hinders efficient manpower utilization and limits the use of less skilled and cheaper workers. They suggest that without these restrictions, contractors could restructure tasks to increase efficiency and create more job opportunities for low-skilled workers. Additionally, critics point out that the Act was implemented before federal minimum wage standards were in place. Critics argue that the Davis-Bacon Act, implemented before federal minimum wage standards, is no longer necessary with the Fair Labor Standards Act in place. They suggest that paying local market wages instead of locally determined prevailing wages could reduce labor costs for federal construction. Supporters of Davis-Bacon claim it prevents unfair competition and stabilizes the local construction industry. Supporters of the Davis-Bacon Act argue that it ensures higher quality work in the local construction industry by requiring employers to pay at least the locally prevailing wage. This leads to hiring more competent workers, better workmanship, and timely completion of public construction projects, ultimately saving taxpayer money. Additionally, the act prevents contractors from using low-wage workers and encourages training for employees. The Davis-Bacon Act ensures higher quality work in the construction industry by requiring employers to pay locally prevailing wages, leading to competent workers, better workmanship, and timely project completion. Eliminating apprenticeship programs in construction could disadvantage younger workers creating careers in the building trades. Repealing or modifying Davis-Bacon may not result in significant cost savings. The impact of repealing or modifying the Davis-Bacon Act on cost savings and quality of work in the construction industry is uncertain due to the extensive and diverse literature surrounding the act. Independent scholars find it challenging to assess the act's administration and its overall impact due to the vast number of projects, agencies, contractors, and labor circumstances involved. The challenges of accessing documentation and comparing data in the construction industry, involving contractors and labor markets, pose significant obstacles for analysts. The challenges of accessing documentation and comparing data in the construction industry, involving contractors and labor markets, pose significant obstacles for analysts. Payroll records, labor-management relationships, skilled workers, supervision, internal agency memoranda, and other factors all pertain to actual projects. Questions arise about the impact of the Davis-Bacon requirement on contractor selection, contract management, wages, and workforce utilization. Despite oversight and extensive study, gaps in knowledge persist due to political and policy considerations. During each Congress, measures have been introduced to strengthen, diminish, or repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, with contentious issues and threats to enactment. Legislative action has been taken on Davis-Bacon related issues during the 110th Congress, impacting funding authorization for the Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund. The Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund (CWA/SRF) has faced contention in Congress, particularly regarding the Davis-Bacon Act. In the 110th Congress, the House passed the CWA/SRF bill with Davis-Bacon considerations, but it has not been acted upon in the Senate. Representative James Oberstar introduced H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, which included Davis-Bacon language. The Davis-Bacon issue resurfaced in Congress as Representative Richard Baker pushed to remove the language, but the amendment was rejected. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure faced controversy over Davis-Bacon but ultimately approved the bill with a vote of 55 yeas to 13 nays. H.R. 720 includes provisions related to Davis-Bacon, ensuring fair wages for laborers and mechanics on treatment construction projects. Section 602(b)(17) adds Davis-Bacon requirements for construction projects using state revolving loan funds or funds from the Act. This applies to projects with any financial assistance from the state revolving fund, regardless of the source or type of assistance. The report emphasized the importance of applying the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement to construction projects funded by the Clean Water State Revolving Funds, citing the need to attract experienced and productive workers. The Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirement is supported for construction projects funded by the Clean Water State Revolving Funds, as it leads to projects being completed ahead of schedule and reducing overall costs. However, Representative John Mica opposes the provision, stating that it increases the cost of public construction and disproportionately affects small, rural, and disadvantaged communities. Few small and minority-owned firms struggle to afford the higher wages mandated by the Davis-Bacon Act, leading to them being rarely awarded contracts under this regulation. Representative Pete Sessions criticized the application of Davis-Bacon regulations to non-Federal funds, arguing that it benefits big labor bosses at the expense of others. Representative Pete Sessions objected to the Depression Era wage subsidy law, stating it hinders local budgets from funding essential projects. He urged opposition to the rule, citing support for fiscal responsibility, small businesses, States' rights, and the environment. In response, Representative Kathy Castor defended the legislation, emphasizing its importance in authorizing a key aspect of the Clean Water Act. Representative Kathy Castor defended the Davis-Bacon provisions in H.R. 720, highlighting their role in ensuring fair wages for workers on federally funded construction projects. She argued that these provisions attract skilled workers, increase productivity, and ultimately reduce overall costs. Castor emphasized that Davis-Bacon protects communities by basing wage determinations on local workforce costs, leading to projects being completed under budget and on time. Members took strong positions for or against the statute during floor consideration of the bill. During the discussion on the Clean Water Act, Representatives Baker and Steve King proposed an amendment to stop the expansion of the Davis-Bacon provisions. They argued that compliance with Davis-Bacon rules would be difficult for rural and lower-income communities. Chairman James Oberstar countered, stating that Davis-Bacon ensures prevailing local wages, not union wages. The debate shifted from the Clean Water Act to focus on the Davis-Bacon Act, with concerns raised about the impact on wages for workers on building projects. Despite opposition, the Davis-Bacon provisions were included in the House-passed version of the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. The bill H.R. 720 was adopted and sent to the Senate. Another bill, H.R. 6, was introduced by Representative Nick Rahall and eventually became P.L. 110-140 after being passed by both the House and Senate. Initially focused on technical aspects of oil and gas leases, the bill expanded to include various energy-related considerations. The bill H.R. 6, which started as a technical bill on oil and gas leases, now includes energy-related considerations and provisions under the Davis-Bacon Act for workers in energy facilities construction. Representative McKeon opposed the bill, citing concerns about bureaucratic mandates and the expansion of Davis-Bacon wage requirements. The bill H.R. 6 includes multiple instances of Davis-Bacon wage mandates, which can increase project costs by up to 15%. This bill was approved by a vote of 235 ayes and 181 nays, moving back to the Senate for further consideration. Senator McKeon raised concerns about the bill's impact on job training and administrative burdens for private companies. The Senate faced uncertainty over the fate of the House-passed energy bill, with Senator McConnell noting the difference between passing a bill and making laws. A cloture vote failed, leading to a plan for bipartisan collaboration between the House and Senate to amend the bill before sending it to the president for signature. Concerns were raised in the Senate about expanding Davis-Bacon requirements for energy-related construction projects. The Senate passed the energy bill on December 13, 2007, and the House approved it on December 18, 2007. Davis-Bacon was not a major issue in the final judgment on the bill, but it plays a role in ensuring workers in federal construction receive fair wages. The bill includes provisions related to energy and advanced technology vehicles manufacturing. The Energy bill passed by the Senate and House includes provisions for an \"Advanced Vehicles Manufacturing Facility\" with up to $25 billion in loans for eligible individuals and entities. Applicants must assure fair wages for laborers and mechanics on construction projects financed by the loan. This requirement is consistent with other energy-related programs. The Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 (H.R. 2419) passed by the House includes loan guarantees for biorefineries and biofuel production facilities. The bill also introduced a Davis-Bacon provision for construction projects. The Senate approved a much expanded farm bill without Davis-Bacon, leading to a conference request for resolution. The bill requires fair wages for laborers and mechanics on construction projects financed by loans or loan guarantees. The House-passed Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 includes a provision for fair wages on construction projects financed by loans or loan guarantees. Despite attempts to remove the prevailing wage provision, it was sustained in a recorded vote. The Rules Committee expedited the farm bill for consideration, with the Davis-Bacon Act remaining a point of contention during debate. Representative Bob Goodlatte criticized the closed process of the bill, noting the lack of opportunity to address labor provisions. The House-passed Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 includes a provision for fair wages on construction projects financed by loans or loan guarantees. Despite attempts to remove the prevailing wage provision, it was sustained in a recorded vote. Representative Bob Goodlatte criticized the closed process of the bill, noting the lack of opportunity to address labor provisions. Various representatives expressed concerns about the inclusion of Davis-Bacon provisions in the farm bill legislation, arguing that it would drive up costs and hinder alternative energy production. The debate on the merits of Davis-Bacon prevailing wages continued among speakers. The House passed H.Res. 574 with a vote of yeas 222 to nays 202, moving on to H.R. 2419. Representative Joe Baca highlighted the preservation of the Davis-Bacon provision in the farm bill, ensuring fair wages for rural workers. Steve King of Iowa emphasized the presence of the Davis-Bacon wage scale in the bill, predicting continued success in renewable fuels production in his district. Last year, over a billion dollars of private capital was invested without the Davis-Bacon wage scale, using merit shop wages instead. Representative Jack Kingston criticized the inclusion of the Davis-Bacon provision in the bill, calling it a \"special-interest payoff to the unions\" and warning against increasing energy production costs during a fuel crisis. Despite objections, H.R. 2419 was approved with the Davis-Bacon provision still intact. H.R. 2419 was approved with a vote of 231 ayes to 191 noes in the House. The bill was then received in the Senate and placed on the Legislative Calendar. Senator Tom Harkin proposed an amendment to substitute a new bill, leading to the introduction of numerous amendments. Senator Harry Reid's attempt to limit the number of amendments sparked opposition, including from Senator Judd Gregg. Senator Wayne Allard raised concerns about the prevailing wage issue during the debate on the farm bill. Senator Harry Reid's motion for cloture on November 16 was rejected with 55 yeas and 42 nays, falling short of the required two-thirds majority. Labor questions, particularly immigration labor issues, were highlighted as crucial in farm policy discussions. On December 7, a second cloture motion failed with 53 yeas to 42 nays. A third cloture motion passed on December 13 with 78 yeas to 12 nays. The farm bill was adopted on December 14 with 79 yeas to 14 nays, but without a Davis-Bacon provision. A conference was authorized, and Senate conferees were appointed. Congress and the White House clashed over the bill, with lawmakers seeking to sell their reauthorization legislation to a president pushing for deeper cuts in agricultural supports. Sugar companies aimed to include trade with Mexico in the bill to maintain U.S. sugar prices. The proposal to include trade with Mexico in the farm bill aimed to maintain U.S. sugar prices but would restore some trade barriers eliminated by NAFTA. Negotiations for a new version of the bill continued, focusing on higher taxes to fund agricultural subsidies. The House voted to oppose higher taxes for new farm bill spending, leading to the appointment of official conferees for further negotiations. Negotiations for the farm bill continued with intense political bargaining. The House and Senate approved the conference report, but the President vetoed the bill on May 21, 2008, citing lack of program reform and fiscal discipline. The House voted to override the veto. The House and Senate voted to override the President's veto of the farm bill, but a mistake by a House clerk led to a missing title in the bill. Senators will address the issue after the Memorial Day recess to ensure the complete version is sent to the President. House leaders decided to pass a duplicate version of the 15-title farm bill (H.R. 2419) to avoid constitutional questions. A new bill (H.R. 6124) identical to H.R. 2419 was introduced and quickly adopted in the House. The replacement bill was then sent to the Senate and approved. However, there is uncertainty about the bill's fate due to a possible veto by the President. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the American government underwent restructuring, leading to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). H.R. 2638 of the 110th Congress proposed funding and adjustments for the agency. A House-passed bill included a Davis-Bacon provision, but Senate consideration was overtaken by a consolidated appropriations bill (H.R. 2764: P.L. 110-161). Legislation was passed without reference to Davis-Bacon. During House consideration of H.R. 2638, an amendment was proposed to strike the Davis-Bacon section from the bill. H.R. 2638 included a provision stating that funds in the Act cannot be used for projects not complying with the Davis-Bacon Act, which could disadvantage communities affected by disasters. Mr. Rogers expressed concerns about the potential impact on small, emerging, and minority businesses. Representative David Price argued against the provision in H.R. 2638 that requires compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act for projects using federal funds, stating that it unfairly restricts smaller businesses from competing effectively. He emphasized the importance of prevailing wage protection for all jobs, not just those under certain grant programs. Price criticized Homeland Security for narrowly applying the act and urged his colleagues to support striking this restriction. The Rogers amendment, which aimed to remove the Davis-Bacon provision from H.R. 2638, was defeated in a House vote. The bill was then passed by the House and sent to the Senate for consideration. The Senate passed their version of the bill unanimously and appointed conferees for further discussion. The bill, H.R. 2764, was signed into law on December 26, 2007, as P.L. 110-161, without including the Davis-Bacon language. On January 17, 2008, Representative Kathy Castor introduced a resolution for the consideration of bill H.R. 3524, the HOPE VI Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2007, which included a Davis-Bacon provision. The bill aims to improve public housing projects and create safe, affordable communities. Representative Pete Sessions expressed opposition to the bill in its current form. Representative Pete Sessions opposed the bill for mandating compliance with green building rating systems, creating burdens for contractors. He suggested a market-based approach instead of a one-size-fits-all standard. The House passed the resolution and moved on to the Hope VI Reauthorization Act, where Representative Steve King proposed an amendment regarding wages. Representative Steve King proposed an amendment to the Davis-Bacon Act, aiming to remove the requirements for a Davis-Bacon wage scale and prevent act funds from being allocated to it. King argued that labor should be valued by the marketplace, not the government intervening in contractual relationships. Representative Steve King proposed an amendment to the Davis-Bacon Act, arguing against government intervention in contractual relationships and the use of taxpayer funds for a prevailing wage scale. He claimed that the current statute is ineffective and costly, potentially adding $26 million to taxpayers' burden. King's remarks sparked a debate with Representative David Scott, who emphasized that the wage scale in question is prevailing, not union-based. Scott argued against Representative King's proposed amendment to the Davis-Bacon Act, stating that it would negatively impact the living wages of workers on HOPE VI projects during a recession. He emphasized that the prevailing wage scale, not a union wage, helps attract skilled workers efficiently. Representative George Miller supported Scott's stance, clarifying that the issue is about prevailing wages, not union wages. Representative Miller criticized the King amendment, stating it would worsen poverty in poor neighborhoods and lead to higher costs in the long run. He called the amendment outrageous and urged the House to defeat it. Representative King defended his proposal, highlighting his track record of meeting payroll and providing benefits to employees. The King amendment, which aimed to improve wages and working conditions for employees, was defeated in Congress with 136 ayes and 268 nays. The House then passed the bill (271 ayes to 130 nays) and sent it to the Senate. The Hope VI reauthorization was received in the Senate on January 22, 2008, and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Additionally, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate (H.R. 1328 and S. 1200) to address improvements in Indian health care and facilities, including Davis-Bacon coverage for construction funded with federal funds. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 (H.R. 1328) was introduced in the House by Frank Pallone on March 6, 2007. The bill, funded with federal funds, aimed to improve health care facilities and infrastructure for Indian communities. It underwent hearings and was ordered to be reported in early April 2007. Labor standards under Section 303(b) were included in the bill for construction and renovation projects. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 aimed to improve health care facilities for Indian communities. Construction and renovation projects funded with federal funds must comply with the Davis-Bacon Act, ensuring prevailing wage rates. However, when Indian tribes use their own employees for construction, Davis-Bacon rates do not apply. The intention is to maintain the current law and policy regarding the Davis-Bacon Act. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 included a Davis-Bacon provision, with Senator Byron Dorgan introducing a companion bill. Dorgan aimed to seek approval for the legislation quickly, noting that similar bills had been considered for eight years. The bill was referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs, where Dorgan was chair. The Dorgan bill reaffirms the Davis-Bacon Act with modifications for construction or renovation projects by Indian Tribes or Tribal Organizations. It allows for exceptions under certain conditions and updates the citation to 40 U.S.C. 276a-5. The Dorgan bill updates the Davis-Bacon Act for construction projects by Indian Tribes or Tribal Organizations, allowing exceptions and transferring jurisdiction over wage rates. The Dorgan bill updates the Davis-Bacon Act for construction projects by Indian Tribes or Tribal Organizations, allowing exceptions and transferring jurisdiction over wage rates. The Office of Management and Budget criticized the expansion of Davis-Bacon, suggesting a veto if included in the final bill. Senator Kennedy discussed modifications to the bill with Senators Murkowski and Dorgan on February 14, 2006. The managers' amendment to the bill maintains current law regarding prevailing wage rates for Indian health facilities construction. It does not change existing statutes or policies. The managers' amendment to the bill maintains prevailing wage provisions for Indian health facilities construction, with Senator Murkowski expressing that no changes were made to current law. The Indian health care bill was approved by the Senate on February 26, 2008, with the Davis-Bacon provision intact. Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Mr. Miller, emphasized the need to improve the physical state of America's schools to provide a world-class education. He proposed investing in school construction projects to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Ranking Republican, Howard McKeon, disagreed on funding sources, citing concerns about costly mandates threatening state and local autonomy in education. Mr. McKeon raised concerns about the Davis-Bacon Act driving up costs of federal projects, citing a letter from business and construction groups outlining flaws in the wage mandates. Representative Boustany urged the Committee to focus on the Act's shortcomings, suggesting a 20 to 25 percent increase in total costs due to inflated wages. Representative Boustany criticized the Davis-Bacon wage surveys, stating they inflate wages by 22 percent and need improvements. He argued that taxpayers are overcharged or construction employees are underpaid. Representative Steven King supported this view, calling Davis-Bacon anti-competitive and a federal intrusion in state affairs. He highlighted that the mandate applies to any bill receiving federal funds for construction or renovation. Jim Waters of Bowling Green, Kentucky, from the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, criticized Kentucky's prevailing wage law as a well-intentioned policy gone awry. He argued that the law prevents the state government from getting the best value for public project spending, increasing infrastructure costs by 10 to 15 percent. Waters questioned how contractors could build quality structures without being coerced by forced wage policies. Several open shop contractors and business representatives requested that Davis-Bacon not be applied to school construction until further review. Representative Ben Chandler introduced H.R. 3021, the 21st Century High-Performing Public School Facilities Act, which highlighted the urgent need for extensive repairs and modernization of public school buildings. The bill emphasized the importance of updating school facilities to improve academic achievement. The Committee conducted a mark-up of H.R. 3021 on April 30, 2008, emphasizing the importance of updating school facilities to improve academic achievement. The legislation will cover construction, modernization, repair, and renovation projects under Davis-Bacon requirements to control costs, ensure quality work, and improve safety. Prevailing wages lead to higher productivity, safety, and building quality, offsetting the cost of higher wages. The report highlighted that Davis-Bacon requirements help save federal, State, and local revenue by ensuring higher productivity, safety, and building quality. Studies show that repealing prevailing wage laws results in lower incomes and loss of economic activity. Critics of Davis-Bacon were concerned about its inclusion in the bill for a federal school construction program. The Davis-Bacon requirement in H.R. 3021 is criticized for not reflecting market wages, favoring union workers, and causing staggering cost impacts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates over $10.5 billion in savings if the Act is repealed. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) also finds Davis-Bacon difficult to administer, leading to unnecessary costs and inflated prices. They suggest a new wage-rate calculation system under the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Davis-Bacon wage determinations significantly exceed market wages, causing concerns for construction workers and taxpayers. A study cited by Representative McKeon suggests that imposing Davis-Bacon would increase school construction costs in 38 states. Despite minority opposition, an amendment to exempt new school construction from Davis-Bacon coverage was rejected in Committee. H.R. 3021 was reported by the Committee on May 8, 2008, and approved on June 3, 2008. On June 4, 2008, H.R. 3021 was debated and passed by a vote of 250 yeas to 164 nays. Representative McKeon highlighted issues with the Davis-Bacon Act, stating prevailing wage calculations are flawed. Representative McCarthy argued for prevailing wages in the community. The bill was received in the Senate on June 6, 2008, facing strong opposition. On June 6, 2008, H.R. 3021 was received in the Senate, strongly opposed by the White House. H.R. 3074, related to transportation and housing appropriations, was added to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. Representative Steve King proposed an amendment to H.R. 3074 regarding the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative King proposed an amendment to H.R. 3074 that would remove the requirements for the Davis-Bacon Act within the appropriations of the bill. He shared his firsthand experience with Davis-Bacon, highlighting the additional costs it incurs on projects. King emphasized his support for a free market economy and the ability for labor to negotiate the value of their work. Representative King proposed removing Davis-Bacon Act requirements in H.R. 3074, citing additional costs and advocating for labor's ability to negotiate freely. Representative Olver defended the act, noting its long-standing history and importance in the transportation construction industry. Without Davis-Bacon, the transportation construction industry may suffer from low-bid firms undercutting local wages. Davis-Bacon promotes higher quality workmanship, essential for building highways and transit systems. Representative King argued for removing Davis-Bacon requirements, emphasizing the ability of labor to negotiate freely. He highlighted the quality of work done by merit shop employees. Mr. King expressed frustration with the Davis-Bacon wage scale, stating it hinders project management and employee incentives. He emphasized the benefits of merit shop construction but his proposal to remove Davis-Bacon requirements was rejected. The debate then shifted to other matters, leading to H.R. 3074 being added to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. In early August 2007, the House discussed H.R. 3161, focusing on renewable energy and the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Jack Kingston proposed an amendment to prevent funds from being used for salaries or expenses related to renewable energy systems construction. He highlighted the need for alternative energy options amidst rising gas prices and oil imports. Representative DeLauro opposed an amendment in the Ag bill that required prevailing wages for building ethanol plants, driving up costs. Representative Scott defended the Davis-Bacon provision as essential for fair wages and wage stabilization since 1931. Representative Scott defended the Davis-Bacon Act as crucial for preventing underbidding on government contracts and ensuring fair wages. He argued against abridging the Act, stating it was necessary to prevent fly-by-night operations and uphold American values. Representative King of Iowa argued against imposing Davis-Bacon wage scales, highlighting the success of renewable energy investments in his district. Representative Farr defended the Act, emphasizing its role in preventing underbidding on government contracts and ensuring fair wages. Critics of Davis-Bacon argue that the law increases energy costs and cuts wages. Representative Farr opposes an amendment to lower wages, calling it a mean and wrong approach. Ms. DeLauro urges colleagues to reject the amendment to protect American workers' prevailing wage. The Kingston amendment, aimed at addressing the issue of \"helpers\" in the Davis-Bacon Act, was defeated in a roll-call vote. The Act does not mention \"helpers\" or specify skill groups, leaving it to the Secretary of Labor to determine labor classes. This issue is likely to continue being debated in Congress. Under Davis-Bacon, the minimum wage rate is determined for each worker category before project bids. The inclusion of a helper category could potentially increase construction labor costs and undermine the act's purpose by allowing contractors to hire low-skilled, low-wage helpers. This could lead to a decrease in wages and impact apprenticeship programs. Despite debates, helpers have been used in Davis-Bacon construction where common. During the late 1970s, the Carter Administration opened the issue of Davis-Bacon implementation. Industry pushed for closer adherence to area practices in worker classifications, especially 'helper' classifications. President Reagan's Administration redefined the concept of helpers in May 1982, expanding their use, leading to litigation and objections from building trades unions. In the late 1970s, the Carter Administration addressed Davis-Bacon implementation, with industry advocating for changes in worker classifications, particularly 'helper' classifications. President Reagan's Administration redefined helpers in May 1982, sparking litigation and objections from building trades unions. Litigation continued as the Department of Labor redrafted helper regulations to address court objections. In 1989, the courts approved the regulations, but Congress refused to fund their implementation. By the mid-1990s, the agency was free to act, but the Clinton Administration declined to enforce the regulations. In 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors sued the DOL to enforce the regulations, prompting the Assistant Secretary of Labor to deem them \"non-administratable.\" In August 1996, the Department of Labor announced a review of the suspended helper regulation due to new information. The regulation remained in abeyance as DOL reassessed the data. In December 1996, DOL stated that the helper regulation would remain suspended for the immediate future. In July 1997, a court ruled in favor of DOL's indefinite suspension of the regulation. In April 1999, DOL proposed a new rule reverting to the pre-Carter Administration status quo regarding the use of helpers. In the late 1990s, there were discussions about creating a special category of workers called 'helpers' for Davis-Bacon purposes. Legislation was introduced but no action was taken. A hearing was conducted on the impact of helper rules for job opportunities, but no further action was taken. During the late 1990s, discussions were held about creating a new category of workers called 'helpers' for Davis-Bacon purposes. Legislation was introduced, but no action was taken. Representative Anne Northup raised the helper issue during appropriations consideration, leading to language being added to deny funding for the proposed rule. However, this provision was later dropped as the legislation progressed. The Department of Labor issued a new final regulation on helpers in November 2000, set to take effect 60 days after publication. The Department of Labor issued a new final regulation on helpers in November 2000, to be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. The regulation outlined conditions for helpers to be recognized as a distinct classification, separate from other workers on the wage determination. Representative Marsha Blackburn raised the helper issue again in the 108th Congress, along with Representatives Norwood and King. The Helpers Job Opportunity Act was reintroduced by Representative Blackburn in the 109th Congress, but the bill did not progress. The final regulation on helpers from the Clinton Administration is in effect, and the Bush Administration has not revisited the issue. The Department of Labor may still reevaluate the helper question. The Department of Labor may reevaluate the helper question and issue a new rule, or Congress could address the issue through legislation. It is possible that the matter has already been resolved."
