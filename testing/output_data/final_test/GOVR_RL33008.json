    "content": "In a 1972 decision, Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled that federal and state capital punishment laws allowing wide discretion in the application of the death penalty were unconstitutional. The majority found them to be cruel and unusual punishment, citing their inherent arbitrariness, especially in cases involving racial minorities and the poor. The Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia in 1972 led to the commutation of death sentences for inmates on death row. States then revised their legislation to address the Court's concerns about arbitrary decisions in capital punishment cases. In 1976, the Supreme Court reviewed post-Furman capital punishment statutes in five states, upholding guided discretion in three cases but ruling mandatory death sentences unconstitutional in others. The Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia in 1972 led to the commutation of death sentences for inmates on death row. States revised their legislation to address concerns about arbitrary decisions in capital punishment cases. In five cases reviewed in 1976, the Court upheld guided discretion but ruled mandatory death sentences unconstitutional. The sentencing authority must have limited and directed discretion to avoid arbitrariness in imposing capital punishment. Aggravating factors must be clear and restricting to justify the death penalty. States using aggravating circumstances must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe penalty. The Supreme Court emphasized that aggravating factors must be clear and specific to justify the death penalty, ensuring that not every murder falls under such circumstances. The test for constitutionality is whether the statutory language provides guidance to the sentencing authority. The Supreme Court has defined vague terms to guide the sentencer in considering mitigating factors in capital cases. In Lockett v. Ohio, states were required to consider all possible mitigating factors, not just a specific list. In Smith v. Texas, the Court overturned a death sentence because jurors were not allowed to consider important evidence, such as the defendant's age, troubled home life, and low IQ. In 1982, the Supreme Court considered the execution of a juvenile offender in Eddings v. Oklahoma. The Court vacated the juvenile's death sentence, emphasizing that the offender's age must be a relevant factor in sentencing. Justice Powell highlighted that youth is more than just a chronological fact. In 1988, the Supreme Court vacated the death sentence of a 15-year-old defendant in Thompson v. Oklahoma, ruling that executing a minor would be cruel and unusual punishment. Justices emphasized that youth is a time of susceptibility to influence and psychological damage, and minors are generally less mature than adults. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled in Stanford v. Kentucky and Wilkins v. Missouri that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit the death penalty for crimes committed at age 16 or 17. The decision did not use the three-part analysis to determine if sentencing a juvenile to death constituted cruel and unusual punishment. In Stanford v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court considered evolving standards of decency in society to determine the constitutionality of applying the death penalty to juvenile offenders. The Court rejected the argument that the punishment is disproportionate to the severity of the crime and does not contribute to deterrence. The Court in Stanford v. Kentucky determined that the death penalty for juveniles aged 16 or 17 does not violate the Eighth Amendment. It considered contemporary standards of decency and found no national consensus on the issue. The Court rejected bringing personal judgment into the decision-making process. In 1997, Christopher Simmons was sentenced to death for a crime committed at age 17. His appeal was denied as there was no national consensus against executing juveniles aged 16 or 17. Executing juveniles was not considered \"cruel and unusual\" punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Atkins v. Virginia in 2002 established a national consensus against the execution of the mentally retarded. This decision led to a potential shift in the Court's view towards the execution of juvenile offenders. Christopher Simmons filed a writ of habeas corpus in 2003, arguing that a national consensus opposing the execution of 16 and 17-year-old offenders had developed. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the Roper v. Simmons case to decide if executing juvenile offenders under 18 violates the Eighth Amendment. The Missouri Supreme Court believed such executions are prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, contradicting a previous ruling in Stanford v. Kentucky. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 opinion written by Justice Kennedy, affirmed the Missouri Supreme Court's decision that the juvenile death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment. The Court reconsidered the permissibility of executing juvenile offenders under 18 in Roper v. Simmons, noting that many states had rejected the death penalty for juveniles or set the minimum age at 18. The Court considered changes in the law and the limited use of the death penalty for juveniles in states where it was still available. They found that society views juveniles as less culpable than adults due to their lack of maturity, susceptibility to negative influences, and less well-formed character. The Supreme Court eliminated the death penalty for juvenile offenders due to their lack of maturity, susceptibility to negative influences, and the transitory nature of their personality traits. The Court also noted that the death penalty for juveniles was disproportionate punishment and that the United States was the only country to sanction it. The Supreme Court looked to international opinion against the juvenile death penalty. In 1986, the Court ruled it unlawful to execute the mentally insane but did not provide guidelines for determining insanity, leading to issues in protecting the mentally ill from the death penalty. The Supreme Court's decision in Penry allowed the execution of mentally retarded individuals for capital offenses, stating that the Eighth Amendment prohibits practices that offend evolving societal standards. At the time of the decision in 1989, only Georgia had banned such executions, while Maryland had legislation pending. In 2002, the Supreme Court overturned Penry's decision in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that executing mentally retarded defendants violated the Eighth Amendment. The Court emphasized the importance of considering the defendant's mental state as mitigating evidence during sentencing. The Supreme Court in Atkins v. Virginia found that executing mentally retarded defendants violated the Eighth Amendment due to evolving standards of decency and their mental impairments affecting their ability to defend themselves at trial. The Court's majority in Atkins v. Virginia concluded that mentally retarded defendants face a special risk of wrongful execution, especially when their retardation is seen to increase the risk of \"future dangerousness\". They suggested that the determination of mental retardation should be left to the States, while the minority disagreed with considering sources other than state legislatures in this matter. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a separate dissent criticizing the Court's reliance on foreign laws, professional opinions, and opinion polls in reaching their decision. Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized the Court's reliance on foreign laws, professional opinions, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion on the constitutionality of capital punishment. Justice Scalia supported this view, questioning the use of opinion polls and religious organizations in determining a national consensus. The Court's majority in Atkins v. Virginia focused on the special risk faced by mentally retarded defendants in wrongful execution. The Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of imposing capital punishment for rape in Rudolph v. Alabama. Justices Goldberg, Douglas, and Brennan dissented, questioning the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. They noted a global trend against death penalty for rape, emphasizing evolving standards of decency and the effectiveness of less severe penalties. In 1977, the Supreme Court ruled in Coker v. Georgia that imposing the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman is unconstitutional as it is considered cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The decision was based on the proportionality test and objective evidence reflecting public sentiment. The Supreme Court found that death as a penalty for rape of an adult woman is unacceptable, noting that most states do not authorize it. Despite some states reinstating the death penalty for certain crimes after Furman, legislative responses showed a rejection of capital punishment for rape. The Court considered public sentiment and legislative actions in reaching its decision. The Supreme Court analyzed the acceptability of the death penalty for rape under the Eighth Amendment, concluding that it is disproportionate punishment compared to murder. Despite aggravating circumstances, the Court maintained that the death sentence for rape violates the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty for rape is disproportionate punishment and violates the Eighth Amendment. In the case of Enmund v. Florida, it was decided that mere involvement in a crime that resulted in murder does not warrant the death penalty unless the individual killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill. This principle was reaffirmed in Tison v. Arizona, where two brothers were sentenced to death for a quadruple homicide. In Tison v. Arizona, two brothers were sentenced to death for a quadruple homicide their father committed after they helped him escape from prison. The Court found their involvement in the prison break and supply of weapons showed they were ready to kill if necessary, leading to a highly culpable mental state justifying the death penalty. The Enmund culpability requirement in felony cases, combined with reckless indifference to human life, was satisfied in Bradshaw v. Stumpf. The issue was whether the death penalty could be imposed when the prosecution argued that each of two accomplices personally killed the victim with a single shot. Stumpf pled guilty and was sentenced to death, but the Sixth Circuit later reversed his conviction due to inconsistent theories and lack of knowledge in his guilty plea. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on the issue of vacating a guilty plea when evidence presented in another trial contradicts the defendant's guilt. Stumpf, who initially admitted to wounding a husband but denied shooting his wife, was found guilty and sentenced to death. During the penalty phase, he argued that a co-defendant was the shooter, supported by another co-defendant's testimony. The U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case to the Sixth Circuit to consider the effect of prosecutor's inconsistent theories on death sentences. Stumpf was found informed of the intent element of the aggravated murder charge, and prosecutorial inconsistencies did not void his guilty plea. The right to effective assistance of counsel was defined by the Supreme Court in 1970, with further clarification in the case of Strickland v. Washington. The U.S. Supreme Court established a test for ineffective assistance of counsel in criminal trials and capital sentencing proceedings in the case of Strickland v. Washington. In Burger v. Kemp, the Court ruled that a defense counsel's decision not to present mitigating evidence was supported by \"reasonable professional judgment.\" In Darden v. Wainwright, the Court found no merit in the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase because the petitioner failed to satisfy the first part of the Strickland test. The U.S. Supreme Court established a test for ineffective assistance of counsel in criminal trials and capital sentencing proceedings in Strickland v. Washington. In Lockhart v. Fretwell, the Court refined the Strickland test to require a different trial result to be probable due to attorney performance, and the trial result that occurred was fundamentally unfair or unreliable. In 1999, the Court granted certiorari in Williams v. Taylor on the standard to be applied by federal courts in granting a habeas petition following the passage of the AEDPA, and on the Fourth Circuit's application of the Strickland standard in a capital case. The U.S. Supreme Court applied the Strickland standard in a capital case, finding that the Virginia Supreme Court's rejection of Williams' ineffective assistance claim was contrary to established doctrine. The Court emphasized the need to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome due to counsel's errors, reaffirming the two-pronged Strickland test. Williams relied on counsel's deficient performance and the erroneous view that a mere difference in outcome is not enough to prove ineffective assistance. The defendant must demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient and prejudiced the defense to prove ineffective assistance. An exception exists when counsel's assistance is denied entirely or during a critical stage, where the effect is presumed. Only in exceptional circumstances will the defendant be relieved of showing counsel's inadequate performance undermined the verdict's reliability. The Court has held that conflicts of interest must be analyzed for prejudice under the Strickland test, not presumed for automatic reversal. In Florida v. Nixon, the Court ruled that counsel's concession of guilt without the defendant's consent does not automatically constitute ineffective assistance under the Cronic test, but must be evaluated under the Strickland test. The Court recognized that under the Strickland test, decisions on \"basic trial rights\" must be made by the defendant with the attorney's consultation and consent. This includes the authority to determine whether to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify, or appeal. While counsel must consult on important decisions and defense strategy, they do not need consent for every tactical decision. In capital cases, the gravity of the potential sentence is acknowledged. The Court recognized that in capital cases, attorneys face challenges in developing trial strategies due to the gravity of potential sentences. Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty when evidence is overwhelming, making avoiding execution the best possible outcome. Counsel must strive to avoid presenting inconsistent strategies in the guilt and sentencing phases. In capital cases, attorneys must consider strategies for both the guilt and penalty phases. Counsel's strategic choice is not impeded by the defendant's lack of response to the strategy presented. The recent Supreme Court decision in Rompilla v. Beard emphasized the importance of investigating defendants' records for mitigating evidence to avoid ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In Wiggins v. Smith, the Court ruled that attorneys in capital cases must diligently investigate their clients' backgrounds for mitigating evidence. The decision emphasized that defense counsel must thoroughly explore all avenues of defense and cannot excuse inadequate performance by claiming it was a tactical decision. In 1972, the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia due to its discriminatory impact on racial minorities and the poor. New capital punishment laws were upheld in 1976 to prevent arbitrariness. Challenges to the death penalty's application to racial minorities continued, with cases like McClesky v. Kemp and Batson v. Kentucky addressing issues of discrimination in sentencing and jury selection. The Supreme Court enforced the Batson rule to prevent racial discrimination in jury selection, with a case involving Thomas Miller-El in 2003. The Court criticized the Fifth Circuit's handling of the case, remanding it for further consideration. The Supreme Court overturned Miller-El's death conviction in 2005 due to racial bias in jury selection, citing the Batson rule. The Court found that prosecutors had intentionally excluded African Americans from his capital jury. Justice Souter criticized the tactics used by Dallas County prosecutors to exclude African-Americans from the jury in Miller-El's case. They shuffled the jury pool to avoid having too many African-Americans and used different questioning techniques for White and Black potential jurors. In the Johnson case, Justice Stevens ruled that the California Supreme Court made it too difficult for defendants to prove bias in jury selection. Johnson, an African-American accused of murdering a White child, had African-American jurors struck by the prosecutor. The prosecutor in Johnson's case used peremptory challenges to strike African-Americans from the jury, resulting in an all-White jury. Johnson's conviction was initially set aside due to Batson claims, but later reinstated by the California Supreme Court. Justice Stevens emphasized the need for easier testing of Batson claims to eradicate discrimination in jury selection. The Supreme Court has addressed cases involving juror bias in capital cases and the defendant's right to a fair trial. Cases have focused on juror bias in capital cases and the defendant's right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. In Witherspoon v. Illinois, the Court held that a death sentence cannot be imposed if jurors were excluded for opposing the death penalty. However, jurors can still make impartial judgments. States can exclude jurors whose views on the death penalty would affect their decision on guilt. In Witherspoon v. Illinois, the Court ruled that jurors can be excluded if their views on the death penalty would impact their decision on guilt. The Court emphasized the importance of selecting jurors who can impartially apply the law and find the facts, viewing the inquiry into juror bias as a routine part of jury selection. The Court emphasized the importance of selecting jurors who can impartially apply the law and find the facts, with trial judges responsible for determining bias and removing jurors who cannot faithfully apply the law. Jurors who may have doubts about the death penalty but can still determine guilt may be excluded, while those who can determine guilt but not impose the death penalty may also be excluded from the jury. The Supreme Court has ruled that juries must be informed about alternatives to the death penalty, such as the possibility of parole under a lifetime sentence. Prosecutors and trial judges are prohibited from misleading or unfairly influencing juries in capital cases. The Supreme Court bars prosecutors and trial judges from unfairly influencing juries in capital cases, as seen in Dawson v. Delaware where evidence of association with the Aryan Brotherhood led to a death sentence being vacated. The Court emphasizes the need for a context-sensitive balancing test to determine the relevance of evidence presented during the punishment phase. It initially viewed victim impact statements as unconstitutional but later clarified that they are only problematic if unduly prejudicial. The Supreme Court has ruled that impact evidence must not unfairly influence juries in capital cases, as demonstrated in cases where shackling or prejudicial evidence led to death sentences being overturned. Defendants have a constitutional right to a fair jury trial, as highlighted in challenges to death penalty statutes. The Supreme Court ruled that Arizona's sentencing scheme for capital cases did not violate the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. However, in non-death penalty cases, the Court held that any fact leading to an increased sentence must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to comply with the Sixth Amendment. In Ring v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for a judge to find additional facts that would increase a defendant's sentence without a jury determination. The writ of habeas corpus is a procedure for federal courts to inquire into illegal detention and potentially order the release of the petitioner. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) signed by President Clinton made significant changes to federal habeas corpus practice for state prisoners and in capital cases. It ensures that government accountability to the judiciary is upheld for a person's imprisonment, with the individual entitled to immediate release if it does not conform to the law. The AEDPA of 1996 amended federal habeas corpus procedures, creating new rules for capital cases against States. It includes tighter filing deadlines, limits on successive petitions, and specific standards for capital cases. The AEDPA's general habeas provisions apply to both capital and noncapital cases. In Bell v. Thompson, a three-judge panel erred by withdrawing its decision in a habeas case months after its original ruling was considered final. Initially denying Thompson's claim, the panel later reconsidered due to evidence of his schizophrenia at the time of the offense. The Sixth Circuit corrected its earlier decision in Thompson's case, remanding it to the district court due to failures by trial counsel in investigating social history and presenting mitigating evidence. The State of Tennessee challenged the Sixth Circuit's authority to withdraw its decision, leading to a Supreme Court divided ruling (5-4) on the matter. The Supreme Court, in a divided ruling (5-4), upheld Thompson's death sentence but criticized the Sixth Circuit for remanding the case for an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing. Justice Kennedy stated that the scheduling of Thompson's execution was reasonable and the Sixth Circuit's actions were an abuse of discretion. The Court emphasized the State's interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state. The Supreme Court addressed the rule of retroactivity in a capital sentencing context in Beard v. Banks and Mills v. Maryland. The Court held invalid a capital sentencing scheme that required juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously. The Court determined that the Mills rule does not apply retroactively based on existing precedent and the judgment of a reasonable jurist. The Supreme Court in Beard v. Banks addressed retroactivity in capital sentencing, concluding that the Mills decision did not apply retroactively. The Court noted that reasonable jurists could differ on the prior cases' results and provided guidance on the Teague exceptions, particularly the exception for primary conduct beyond criminal law-making authority. The Court has referred to Gideon v. Wainwright in discussing procedural rights that may not qualify as \"watershed\" for Teague purposes. New Supreme Court decisions can lead to lower courts ruling erroneously until the new decision is announced. Retroactively, new Supreme Court decisions generally apply to defendants currently on trial or on direct appeal. Defendants may benefit from new Court rules in limited situations, such as decisions interpreting criminal statutes. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Medellin v. Dretke to determine the effect of a ruling by the International Court of Justice. The Court dismissed the writ of certiorari due to President Bush's intervention, noting the case's significance for U.S. foreign relations and the ongoing Supreme Court debate. The Supreme Court dismissed the writ of certiorari in Medellin v. Dretke due to President Bush's intervention, highlighting the case's importance for U.S. foreign relations and the ongoing Supreme Court debate on international law's impact on decisions."
