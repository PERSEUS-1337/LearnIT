The Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Investment Act of 2007 acknowledges the importance of nurse-managed health clinics (NMHCs) in providing primary care based on the nursing model. There are over 200 NMHCs in the US, recording over 2,000,000 client encounters annually. NMHCs serve as safety-net providers, offering care regardless of a patient's ability to pay. NMHCs serve uninsured individuals, Medicaid recipients, and other vulnerable populations. A study found that 45% of their payor mix is uninsured and 37% are Medicaid recipients. They provide a full range of health care services to underserved communities, helping to reduce health disparities. Nurse-managed clinics play a crucial role in providing healthcare to underserved communities, but lack of funding has led to closures. The goal of the Act is to secure stable funding for these clinics to ensure continued access to care. The Act aims to provide stable funding for nurse-managed health clinics to expand primary care services in underserved communities and reduce health disparities among vulnerable populations. SEC. 399JJ of the Public Health Service Act amends Title III to establish grants for nurse-managed health clinics. The section defines comprehensive primary health care services as including adult, family, and pediatric health care provided by various qualified professionals. Services may include preventive health, prenatal care, cancer screening, well-child services, immunizations, and lead level screenings. The curr_chunk describes a range of health services offered in comprehensive primary care clinics, including screenings for lead levels, communicable diseases, cholesterol, eye and ear health, emergency services, laboratory and radiologic services, care navigation, pharmaceutical services, and family planning. Additionally, it includes health promotion and disease prevention services encompassing educational and assessment services for physical and mental well-being. The curr_chunk provides physical and mental assessment services for patients to improve health through disease prevention and symptom reduction. It defines terms like medically underserved populations, nurse-managed health clinics, and vulnerable populations. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for receiving grants for nurse-managed health clinics serving medically underserved populations. It outlines the requirements for entities to apply for grants to provide comprehensive primary care services. The nurse-managed health clinic must provide comprehensive primary care services during the grant period and establish a community advisory committee within 90 days. The Secretary can waive the requirement to provide all services for up to 2 years if there is good cause. The funds awarded under the grant must be used as specified. Funds awarded under a grant for nurse-managed health clinics can be used for primary care services, additional health services, clinic program management, personnel salaries, training, acquiring buildings and equipment, and paying off loans. The grant amount is determined based on the clinic's financial need. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to nurse-managed health clinics to help them meet requirements, including fiscal and program management support, training, and information provision. The Secretary will provide technical assistance and information to nurse-managed health clinics. The evaluation of funded clinics will track performance and service quality. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for 2009-2012."
