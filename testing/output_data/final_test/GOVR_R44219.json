    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was last reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, but programs continue to receive annual appropriations. The House passed the Student Success Act (H.R. 5) and the Senate passed the Every Child Achieves Act of 2015 (ECAA; S. 1177) for comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA. The Senate passed S. 1177 on July 16, 2015, which would add an Equity Grant formula to distribute Title I-A funds to SEAs and LEAs. H.R. 5 would introduce a \"state option\" for fund distribution and modify weighted child counts under Title I-A formulas. This report discusses proposed changes to Title I-A formulas by S. 1177. Title I-A of the ESEA authorizes aid to LEAs for the education of disadvantaged children, providing supplementary educational services to low-achieving students from low-income families. S. 1177 and H.R. 5 propose changes to the current formulas for distributing funds, including the addition of an Equity Grant formula. The largest program under the ESEA, Title I-A was funded at $14.4 billion for FY2015, with funds allocated to LEAs through four different formulas. Under Title I-A of the ESEA, funds are allocated to LEAs through four different formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). In FY2015, 45% of funds were allocated through Basic Grants, 9% through Concentration Grants, and 23% through each of Targeted Grants and EFIG. The four-formula strategy has evolved over time, with the addition of the Concentration Grant formula in the 1970s to focus funding on LEAs with high numbers of low-income children. During ESEA reauthorization in the early 1990s, attempts were made to replace existing funding formulas with new ones to better target Title I-A funds. The House and Senate proposed different formulas (Targeted Grants and EFIG) to increase funding per formula child in LEAs with higher percentages of such children. However, a compromise was not reached, resulting in funds being allocated through four formulas under current law. Each formula calculates a maximum grant by multiplying a \"formula child count\" with an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures for K-12 education. Under Title I-A formulas, grants are calculated by multiplying factors like formula child count and expenditure factor. Maximum grants are adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs need a minimum number of formula children or rate to qualify for grants. Some LEAs qualify for grants under multiple formulas. Funds are initially calculated at the LEA level for Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Targeted Grants. State grants are adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. EFIG grants are calculated at the state level and then suballocated to LEAs within the state. The Title I-A formulas allocate funds to LEAs within states using different formulas. Basic Grants, the original formula, receives the largest proportion of funds but has been declining since FY2001. Grants are based on two factors: each LEA's relative share and national comparison. Title I-A grants are based on two formula factors: each LEA's relative share of a formula child count multiplied by an expenditure factor. The population used includes children in poor families, institutions for neglected or delinquent children, foster homes, and families receiving TANF payments above the poverty level. In FY2015, children in poor families accounted for 97% of the total formula child count. To receive funding under Basic Grants, an LEA must have at least 10 formula children, with these children making up more than 2% of the children ages 5-17 in the LEA. The state expenditure factor is determined using the state average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education, subject to a minimum of 80% and a maximum of 120% of the national APPE. The state's Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) is adjusted to 80% or 120% of the national APPE. After adjustments, a state's APPE is multiplied by 0.40. Each LEA is guaranteed a minimum grant based on their poverty rate, ranging from 85% to 95% of the previous year's grant. The state's Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) is adjusted to 80% or 120% of the national APPE and multiplied by 0.40. Each LEA is guaranteed a minimum grant based on their poverty rate, ranging from 85% to 95% of the previous year's grant. To benefit from hold harmless provisions, an LEA must meet Basic Grants eligibility requirements. State grants are calculated based on total Basic Grant appropriations, with a minimum state grant and initial LEA grant determined by the number of formula children in the state. If appropriations are insufficient, a ratable reduction may occur. Initial grants are calculated based on total Basic Grant appropriations, with reductions applied if appropriations are insufficient. Puerto Rico is treated like a state under the Basic Grant formula, with grants reserved for schools operated or supported by the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas. Further adjustments to LEA grants are made by SEAs as calculated by ED. Adjustments by SEAs of LEA Grants as Calculated by ED for ESEA Title I-A programs include reservations for school improvement grants, state administration, and academic achievement awards. The Basic Grant Allocation Formula involves providing funds to schools that reduce achievement gaps or exceed progress standards, allocating grants to charter schools or for LEA boundary changes, and allowing states to use alternative methods for reallocating grants among small LEAs. The formula includes calculating preliminary grants based on population and expenditure factors, with adjustments made in subsequent calculations. The Basic Grant Allocation Formula involves calculating preliminary grants based on population and expenditure factors. In Step 2, grant amounts are adjusted for insufficient appropriations, using either the preliminary grant amount or the LEA's hold harmless level. In Step 3, the grant amount is further adjusted through state minimum grant provisions and factors to raise affected LEAs to their hold harmless level. The state minimum grant adjustment is applied to increase grants in the smallest states and decrease grants in all other states. The LEA hold harmless adjustment ensures that no LEA receives less than its hold harmless amount if appropriations are sufficient. Only Steps 1 through 3 are calculated by ED in the grant allocation process. The final grant amount is calculated in Step 4 by adjusting the preliminary grant amount with various factors. The Concentration Grant formula includes adjustments for state administration, achievement awards, and other possible adjustments. Key factors include Population factor, Expenditure factor, LEA minimum level, Appropriation, State minimum adjustment, LEA hold harmless adjustment, school improvement grants reservation, and other adjustments by the SEA. The Concentration Grant formula, different from Basic Grants, has a higher LEA eligibility threshold and specific provisions. It has been part of Title I-A since 1970, with the current version from 1988. Only a small portion of Title I-A appropriations (9% in FY2015) is allocated through this formula. The formula factors include Population Factor and Expenditure Factor, with adjustments for LEA minimum, state minimum, and available appropriations. The Concentration Grant formula has a higher LEA eligibility threshold compared to Basic Grants. It includes Population Factor, Expenditure Factor, LEA minimum grant, and state minimum grant provisions. LEAs meeting eligibility requirements for a Concentration Grant will continue to receive funding based on hold harmless provisions for four additional years if they fail to meet requirements in subsequent years. The state minimum for Concentration Grants is a modified version of the Basic Grant minimum. The state minimum for Concentration Grants is a modified version of the Basic Grant minimum, with specific criteria for funding allocation. The Concentration Grant Allocation Formula is similar to Basic Grants, with the exception that in states where formula children are less than 0.25% of the national total, grants can be allocated to all LEAs with a higher child count rate than the state average. The Concentration Grant Allocation Formula allows for grants to be allocated to all LEAs in the state with a formula child count or rate higher than the state average. Targeted Grants, authorized in 1994 but funded in FY2002, make up a significant portion of Title I-A grants, with an allocation formula based on population factors and minimum grant levels. Targeted Grants, a significant portion of Title I-A grants, have an allocation formula based on population factors and minimum grant levels. The formula assigns weights to children based on each LEA's formula child rate and number, resulting in higher grants for LEAs with higher formula child rates. There is a higher eligibility threshold for Targeted Grants compared to Basic Grants. The Targeted Grants allocation formula for Title I-A grants is based on population factors and minimum grant levels. Children are assigned weights based on each LEA's formula child rate and number, resulting in higher grants for LEAs with higher formula child rates. The Targeted Grants allocation formula for Title I-A grants is based on population factors and minimum grant levels. Formula child counts determine grants, with higher rates resulting in higher grants. About 88% of LEAs use percentage-based weighting over numbers-based weighting for grants under the Targeted Grant formula. Formula children in LEAs with high rates have a weight of up to four, while those with high numbers have a weight of up to three. The Targeted Grants allocation formula for Title I-A grants is based on population factors and minimum grant levels. Formula child counts determine grants, with higher rates resulting in higher grants. There are five ranges associated with each of the number and percentage weighting scales demarcated in current law, based on the distribution of Title I-A formula children among LEAs. The weights are applied in a stepwise manner, with each quintile including roughly 20% of all children. The Targeted Grants allocation formula for Title I-A grants is based on population factors and minimum grant levels. Formula child counts determine grants, with higher rates resulting in higher grants. There are five ranges associated with each of the number and percentage weighting scales demarcated in current law, based on the distribution of Title I-A formula children among LEAs. The weights are applied in a stepwise manner, with each quintile including roughly 20% of all children. In calculating the weighted child count, the numbers scale and percentage scale are used to determine the allocation for an LEA based on the formula child rate and total school-age population. The Targeted Grants allocation formula for Title I-A grants is based on population factors and minimum grant levels. Formula child counts determine grants, with higher rates resulting in higher grants. An LEA must have at least 10 formula children and a formula child rate of 5% or more to receive funding. The weighted formula child counts from Steps 1 and 2 are combined to calculate the population factor for the LEA. State Grant allocation is determined by the lesser of 0.35% of total state grants or the average of 0.35% of total state grants and 150% of the national average grant per formula child, multiplied by the number of formula children in the state. Initial LEA Grant is similar to Basic Grants but with weighted formula child counts. Ratable Reduction and further adjustments by SEAs of LEA Grants follow the same principles as Basic Grants. Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and the Bureau of Indian Education are also subject to the same rules, with additional provisions for Puerto Rico. Targeted Grant Allocation Formula is the same as Basic Grants. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants, authorized in 1994 but funded in FY2002, allocates grants based on weighted child counts at the state level. EFIG grants constitute a significant portion (23% in FY2015) of total Title I-A grants, differentiating it from other allocation formulas. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants allocates grants based on weighted child counts at the state level, with LEAs competing for funding within their state. Grants are determined based on how an LEA's formula child count compares to others in the state. Intra-state allocation is based on state equity factors, with slightly narrower constraints on the expenditure factor compared to other Title I-A formulas. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants applies floor and ceiling constraints to the expenditure factor, resulting in higher factors for lower-spending states and lower factors for higher-spending states. It includes unique factors like an effort factor based on APPE and an equity factor based on variations in APPE among LEAs within a state. State grants are calculated based on child count, expenditure factor, effort factor, and equity factor, adjusted by a state minimum. LEAs receive funding based on a weighted formula child count. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants includes unique factors like an effort factor based on APPE and an equity factor based on variations in APPE among LEAs within a state. Each LEA's share of the state's total grant is based on a weighted formula child count, adjusted by an LEA hold harmless provision.Weights are applied to the formula child counts before they are used in the formula, with different weights depending on the state's equity factor. The weights in the EFIG formula for Title I-A grants vary based on the state's equity factor, with higher equity factors leading to higher weights for formula children. States with equity factors below 0.10 have the same weights as Targeted Grants, while states with equity factors between 0.10 and 0.20 have weights 50% higher, and states with equity factors of 0.20 or above have weights twice as high. The state expenditure factor is determined using the state APPE for public K-12 education, with a minimum of 85%. The APPE in the EFIG formula is subject to a minimum of 85% and a maximum of 115% of the national APPE. If a state's APPE is below 85% of the national APPE, it is raised to 85%, and if it is above 115%, it is reduced to 115%. The state's APPE is then multiplied by 0.40. The effort factor in the formula is a ratio of the three-year average APPE for public K-12 education to the three-year average state personal income per capita, divided by the national APPE to national PCI ratio. The Equity Factor in the EFIG formula is determined by the coefficient of variation (CV) measuring the disparity in Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) among Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in a state. The CV is a decimal proportion of the state APPE, with an additional weight applied to estimated counts of formula children. The resulting multiplier is limited by narrow bounds of 0.95 and 1.05, ensuring a restricted impact on state grants. The Equity Factor in the EFIG formula is determined by the coefficient of variation (CV) measuring the disparity in Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) among Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in a state. Grants are maximized for states with higher expenditures per formula child. The equity factors range from 0.0 to 0.25, with most states falling in the 0.10 - 0.20 range. A multiplier is calculated by subtracting the equity factor from 1.30, resulting in higher grants for states with lower expenditure disparities among LEAs. The Equity Factor in the EFIG formula is determined by the coefficient of variation (CV) measuring the disparity in Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) among Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in a state. States with greater expenditure disparities among LEAs have higher CV and equity factor, resulting in lower grants under the EFIG formula. Hold harmless provisions are not considered in the initial calculation of state total grants, potentially leading to insufficient funds to fully pay hold harmless amounts to all LEAs. Minimum State Grant calculations include children in LEAs ineligible for EFIG grants. The EFIG formula calculates initial state grants based on the number of formula children, state expenditure, effort, and equity factors. Minimum state grants include children in LEAs ineligible for EFIG grants. Further adjustments by SEAs and Education Finance Incentive Grant Allocation Formula are also considered. The EFIG formula calculates initial state grants based on various factors including population, expenditure, effort, and equity. The grants are then adjusted through the state minimum grant provision. LEA EFIG allocations are calculated based on weighted population factors. Step 1 Summarized Text Chunk:\nIn Step 1, the weighted population factor for each eligible LEA is divided by the total weighted population factor for all eligible LEAs in the state. If this amount is greater than the LEA's hold harmless amount, it is used. If it is less than the LEA's hold harmless level and sufficient funds are available, the hold harmless amount is used. Step 2: Preliminary LEA Grant 2 = Preliminary LEA Grant 1 * L_HH_ADJ or L_HH, whichever is greater In Step 2, the amount for each LEA is adjusted to account for the aggregate costs of raising LEAs in the state to their hold harmless levels. If an LEA's new grant amount is less than the LEA's hold harmless level and sufficient funds are available, the latter amount is used.\n\nStep 4 Output:\nIn Step 1, the weighted population factor for each LEA is divided by the total for all LEAs. If greater than the hold harmless amount, it is used. If less and funds are available, hold harmless is used. In Step 2, grants are adjusted to raise LEAs to hold harmless levels. If new grant amount is less and funds are available, hold harmless is used. In the grant allocation process, only Stage 1 and Steps 1 and 2 in Stage 2 are calculated by ED. The final LEA grant is calculated in Step 3 by adjusting the preliminary LEA grant with various factors. Adjustments are made for school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, and other possible adjustments. The formula includes factors such as population factor, expenditure factor, effort factor, equity factor, and appropriation. State minimum adjustment is also considered in the calculation. Under S. 1177, Title I-A funds would be allocated to LEAs via states using five formulas, including adjustments for school improvement, state administration reservations, achievement awards, and other possible adjustments. The formula considers factors such as population, expenditure, effort, equity, and appropriation, as well as the State minimum adjustment. Under S. 1177, up to $17 billion would be allocated through existing formulas, with any excess funds distributed using a new Equity Grant formula. The bill would also change how schools are ranked for Title I-A grants, requiring elementary and middle schools with over 75% low-income students to be served first. Under S. 1177, LEAs must prioritize serving schools with high percentages of low-income students. The Equity Grant formula would be similar to EFIG but with some key differences. The Equity Grant formula, similar to EFIG, determines LEA grant amounts based on formula child counts within each state. State Equity Grants are affected by the formula child count relative to other states, while LEA grants are based on how an LEA's child count compares to others in the state. Unlike other grant formulas, Equity Grants are allocated at the state level, with each state's share determined by a formula child count and expenditure factor. The Equity Grant formula determines LEA grant amounts based on formula child counts within each state, with weights applied based on the state's equity factor range. The children counted for calculating Equity Grants are the same as for Basic Grants, and the formula child weights are applied based on the state's equity factor range. The Equity Grant formula calculates LEA grant amounts based on formula child counts within each state, with weights applied based on quintiles. The Equity Grant quintiles are based on the distribution of formula children in FY2015, and LEAs must have a formula child rate at or above 20% to benefit from weights in the 4th and 5th quintiles on the numbers weighting scale. The Equity Grant formula calculates LEA grant amounts based on formula child counts within each state, with weights applied based on quintiles. For LEAs with a formula child rate below 20%, only weights in the first three quintiles on the numbers scale are used. This provision would have a limited impact on grant amounts, affecting only 0.23% of LEAs in FY2015. The eligibility threshold for Title I-A grants is the same as Targeted Grants. The expenditure factor is determined by multiplying the national APPE by 0.40. State APPE does not affect the grant determination. The initial grant for each state is calculated based on formula child counts, the national expenditure factor, and state equity factor. Puerto Rico's grant would be capped at a certain percentage amount. Puerto Rico's Equity Grant would be capped at a certain percentage amount based on its FY2015 funding relative to other states. The grant would increase with overall funding increases but remain the same percentage share. If funding decreases, Puerto Rico's grant would also decrease. The treatment of Outlying Areas and the Bureau of Indian Education would be similar to Basic grants. The treatment of Outlying Areas and the Bureau of Indian Education would be similar to Basic Grants. State Equity Grant Allocations are calculated based on a formula involving population factor, expenditure factor, effort factor, and equity factor. The final state grant is determined by dividing the preliminary state grant by the total preliminary grants for all eligible states, then adjusting for the state minimum grant provision. The grant adjustment would be upward in the smallest states and downward in all other states to pay for applying the minimum. Calculation of LEA Equity Grant Allocations involves dividing the weighted population factor for each LEA by the total for all LEAs in the state, adjusting for hold harmless levels. Adjustments are made to raise LEAs to their hold harmless levels. The grant adjustment process involves bringing LEAs up to their hold harmless levels by reducing grant amounts for other LEAs in the state. Only Stage 1 and Steps 1 and 2 in Stage 2 are calculated by ED. The final LEA grant is determined by multiplying the preliminary grant by various adjustment factors. LEA grants are adjusted by states for school improvement and state administration reservations, as well as other possible adjustments. Factors such as population, expenditure, equity, and appropriation are taken into account. The final grant amount is determined by multiplying the preliminary grant by various adjustment factors. The report examines estimated state level grants under S. 1177 at two appropriations levels: $17.5 billion and $20 billion. These levels were chosen as hypothetical examples above the $17 billion trigger for the Equity Grant formula. The methodology and estimated grants at various levels are discussed, including FY2015 Title I-A grant amounts under current law. The estimated FY2015 Title I-A grant amounts under current law were calculated by ED and all other estimated grant amounts were calculated by CRS using the most current data available. CRS used the FY2015 Title I-A grants amounts calculated by ED as the prior-year grant amounts for calculating the FY2016 Title I-A grant amounts. Additionally, it was assumed funding would remain at FY2015 levels for Basic Grants and Concentration Grants, with any increases in appropriations split evenly between Targeted Grants and EFIG. Before grants are made to states, $4 million is set aside from the Basic Grant appropriation for the U.S. Census Bureau to produce the SAIPE dataset. Table 4 provides estimated FY2016 Title I-A grants under S. 1177 assuming appropriations are increased above the $17 billion threshold required to fund the Equity Grant formula. 1% of any appropriations increase would be used for Outlying Areas and BIE grants, with the remaining 99% for grants to states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. These estimates are for comparison purposes only and do not predict specific grant amounts for LEAs or states. Grants are estimated based on appropriations levels of $17.5 billion and $20 billion, with comparisons to FY2016 grants under current law. Nine states and the District of Columbia are projected to receive minimum grants under various programs. Targeted Grants, EFIG, and Equity Grants have different minimum grant calculations. The addition of a fifth formula in S. 1177 results in a redistribution of appropriations, affecting states differently. States like Alaska, Delaware, DC, and Wyoming would see a decrease in estimated grant amounts under the Targeted Grant provisions, while states like New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont would see an increase under the EFIG and Equity Grant provisions. Overall, 20 states and the District of Columbia would see changes in their estimated grant amounts under S. 1177, with some states losing funds ranging from $1,000 to $12.6 million, while others would see an increase in their grant amounts ranging from less than $1,000 to $5.9 million. No state would lose more than 0.9% of their Title I-A funding, and no state would have their grant increase by more than 0.7%. The District of Columbia and states would see changes in their grant amounts under S. 1177, with losses ranging from $3,000 in Wyoming to $75.7 million in New York. Two states would see no change, while the rest would see an increase in grants, ranging from less than $1,000 to $35.2 million. Congress may consider differences in the Equity Grant formula and the complexity of moving from four to five formulas for Title I-A grants. Moving from four formulas to five for Title I-A grant determinations under S. 1177 would complicate the process and potentially shift funding allocations. The Equity Grant formula may have minimal impact unless appropriations exceed $17 billion. The current formulas consider state education spending, while the Equity Grant formula includes factors based on state APPE and effort relative to personal income. The Equity Grant formula in S. 1177 does not consider differences in education spending among states, unlike the current formulas which include a factor reflecting state education spending. Arguments for a state-specific expenditure factor include recognizing varying spending levels, incentivizing increased spending, rewarding high-spending states, and adjusting for regional cost of living differences. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of using poverty data alone without considering regional cost of living differences. It highlights concerns about the expenditure factor not accounting for education costs, differences among LEAs within states, and providing little incentive for increased spending. The curr_chunk discusses how an increase in spending may not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in a state's expenditure factor due to certain limitations. It also mentions that Title I-A funding may not see a significant increase compared to state and local spending. Additionally, it points out that the expenditure factor may not accurately adjust for poverty data and regional cost of living differences. The current discussion highlights concerns about the complexity of using multiple allocation formulas for Title I-A grant amounts, questioning the necessity and transparency of having five formulas instead of consolidating them into one. This could further complicate the grant allocation process. The rationale for using multiple formulas to allocate shares of funds for a program is to provide varying shares to different types of LEAs or states based on distinct allocation patterns. This approach tempers the influence of any one formula and decreases the overall impact of Title I-A grant amounts under S. 1177. The Equity Grant formula, if implemented, would limit its impact on total Title I-A grant amounts by only allocating funds in excess of $17 billion. Title I-A appropriations have seen steady increases post-NCLB reauthorization in 2002, with recent years showing relatively constant funding levels below the threshold needed for the Equity Grant formula. If funding trends continue, the Equity Grant formula may not be funded in the near future. The Equity Grant formula may not be funded soon, but if appropriations increase as they did from FY2001 to FY2005, it could be implemented in the next few years under H.R. 5. This bill would slightly alter the quintiles used to determine weighted child counts under Targeted Grants and EFIG starting in FY2022. If the changes result in decreased funds for any LEA, the current quintiles would still be used. H.R. 5 proposes changes to the quintiles used for weighted child counts under Title I-A grants, while also introducing a new state option for fund distribution. The state option would not alter grant calculation formulas but would allow states to change how funds are allocated within the state. The changes to the quintiles are detailed in the bill, with any potential decrease in funds still using the current quintiles. Under H.R. 5, changes to the quintiles for weighted child counts in Title I-A grants are proposed. The ceilings and floors for the quintiles would be adjusted, with a slight increase in numbers and percentages. These adjustments would have a limited impact due to their small scale. The current quintile ranges were based on 2001 data and would need updating to reflect the distribution of formula children in FY2015 if reauthorization legislation follows the NCLB model. The changes proposed by H.R. 5 to quintiles for Title I-A grants would take effect in FY2022 if no harm is done to LEAs. From FY2016 to FY2021, no changes would occur. The new quintiles would only be used if no LEAs lose funds compared to the prior year. Formula changes may shift funds among states and LEAs, but typically no LEAs lose funds if there is a sufficient increase in appropriations. The proposed changes to quintiles for Title I-A grants in H.R. 5 may not go into effect in FY2022 or subsequent years if harm is done to some LEAs. The impact of these changes on Title I-A grants is expected to be minimal, as appropriations for Title I-A have been relatively constant in recent years."
