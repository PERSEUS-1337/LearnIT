    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stanislaus River Native Anadromous Fish Improvement Act\" and includes a pilot program to protect anadromous fish in the Stanislaus River. The Act establishes a pilot program to remove non-native predator fish from the Stanislaus River in consultation with various agencies. The program aims to scientifically quantify the impact of removing these predator fishes on the abundance of juvenile anadromous fish in the river. The pilot program aims to evaluate the number of juvenile anadromous fish migrating past the rotary screw trap at Caswell using effective predator collection techniques. Necessary permits must be obtained within 6 months of the Act's enactment, and the program should start on the first business day of the following year after obtaining all required permits. The pilot program will be implemented for five consecutive calendar years and managed jointly by the Commissioner and the districts. The parties will collaborate on changes in structure, management, personnel, techniques, data collection, and conduct of the program. The program may be conducted by district personnel, private contractors, Bureau of Reclamation personnel, or a combination. The districts can choose to conduct the program using their own personnel or private contractors. The Commissioner may assign a Bureau of Reclamation employee to oversee field activities to ensure compliance. The districts must notify the Commissioner of their election by October 15 for the following calendar year. The districts are responsible for covering 100% of the costs for this participation. The districts are responsible for 100% of the cost of the pilot program. The Commissioner provides an estimate of the following year's costs by December 1. Failure to pay by December 31 will delay program activities. The districts must make full payment before conducting any part of the pilot program. The Commissioner will provide an expense report by September 1 each year, and any overpayment will be credited to the districts for the following year. The Commissioner will deduct expenses from the districts' payment for work done by the Bureau of Reclamation. Monthly data will be posted on the website, and a report will be published by June 30 the following year. Recommendations for further action will be included. The Secretary of the Interior or Commerce must issue permits within 180 days of application for a pilot program. Any unapproved application after 180 days is deemed approved. Permits will be in the name of the Bureau of Reclamation and districts, with the authority to administer delegated to districts. The pilot program allows districts to delegate permit authority to private contractors. The program must comply with the Endangered Species Act and is exempt from NEPA requirements for seven years. SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS. Any restriction under California law on the catch of non-native species preying on anadromous fish in the Stanislaus River is void and preempted. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Anadromous fish in the Stanislaus River are native salmon stocks that reproduce after maturing in San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean. This definition excludes American shad, sockeye salmon, and striped bass. The term \"Commissioner\" refers to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, while \"districts\" pertain to the Oakdale Irrigation District and the South San Joaquin Irrigation District. The \"pilot program\" denotes the pilot non-native predator removal program established under section 2(b). The Act and its authorities will expire 7 years after the pilot program implementation begins."
