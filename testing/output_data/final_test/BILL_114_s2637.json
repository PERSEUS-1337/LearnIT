    "content": "The purpose of this section is to provide clarity on the objective. The purpose of this Act is to clarify the treatment of authentic Alaska Native articles of handicraft under international conventions related to the protection of migratory birds. The Union Concerning the Conservation of Migratory Birds and Their Environment was signed at Moscow on November 19, 1976 (TIAS 9073) (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.). SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION FOR ALASKA NATIVE ARTICLES WITH MIGRATORY BIRD PARTS. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to clarify definitions for Authentic Alaska Native Articles of Handicraft, including the definition of Alaska Native and Authentic Alaska Native Article of Handicraft. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to define Authentic Alaska Native Articles of Handicraft as items made of natural materials by Alaska Natives using traditional methods without mass copying devices. The term 'Authentic Alaska Native article of handicraft' includes weaving, carving, stitching, sewing, lacing, beading, drawing, or painting that meets specific criteria. It also encompasses items like clothing that combine these techniques. The term 'Indian tribe' is defined as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Authentic Alaska Native article of handicraft can contain nonedible migratory bird parts without restriction under the Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to allow Alaska Native handicrafts containing migratory bird parts taken in a wasteful manner."
