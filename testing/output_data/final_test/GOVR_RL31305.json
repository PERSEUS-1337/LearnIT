    "content": "The House and Senate approved a conference agreement on the FY2003 defense authorization bill (H.R. 4546) in November, which was signed into law by the President in December. The defense appropriations bill (H.R. 5010) was also approved earlier, providing $355.1 billion for programs, $11.7 billion below the Administration's request. It did not include a requested $10 billion contingency fund for counter-terrorism operations in FY2003. The House and Senate approved a conference agreement on H.R. 4546 in November, which was signed into law by the President in December. The bill provided funds for the war on terrorism and the Cost of War Against Terrorism Authorization Act (COWATAA). The FY2003 Defense Appropriations Bill, H.R. 5010, was approved by the House and Senate in October after conferees reached a compromise. The President signed the bill into law on October 23. The congressional budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 353, and the Senate's version, S.Con.Res. 100, recommended funding levels for defense in FY2003 close to the Administration's request. The House approved a measure deeming the budget resolution passed for guiding later funding legislation. In response to the terrorist attacks, a request for $27.1 billion in supplemental FY2002 appropriations was submitted, with $14 billion for defense programs. The House approved a bill providing $28.8 billion for these activities. The House approved a bill, H.R. 4775, providing $28.8 billion for defense in FY2003. The Senate approved a version with $31.4 billion, and a compromise bill was agreed upon with $28.9 billion, including $14.5 billion for defense. The President signed the bill on August 2 (P.L. 107-206), with $13.983 billion available for defense after rescissions. The Administration proposed $396.8 billion for the national defense budget function in its FY2003 budget request to Congress. $3.4 billion was for full accrual accounting of civilian personnel retirement benefits, which was not approved, making the final request $393.4 billion. Of this amount, $366.7 billion was for programs covered by the defense appropriations bill. In FY2003, Congress was hesitant to make significant changes to the Administration's defense budget increase request due to the global war on terrorism. There were disagreements between defense and budget committees on how to handle a $10 billion contingency fund for terrorism and full accrual accounting of civilian retirement benefits. Congressional defense committees wanted more control over allocating funds for national defense. The House Budget Committee set aside $10 billion for war costs in a reserve fund, while also allocating funds for civilian accrual accounting. The Senate Budget Committee rejected the shift to full accrual accounting. The House approved a budget resolution recommending $393.8 billion for national defense in FY2003, with $10 billion reserved for the global war on terrorism. An additional $3.4 billion was available for defense in the reserve fund. The Senate Budget Committee version of the resolution, S.Con.Res. 100, recommended $393.4 billion for national defense in FY2003 and rejected full accrual accounting for civilian employees. The committee also proposed lower defense spending levels after FY2004 and set aside funds in a reserve for future use in defense or deficit reduction. Congressional budget resolution recommendations for national defense funding are not binding on appropriations committees. The House-passed budget resolution provided $759 billion in total discretionary funding to the appropriations committee, while the Senate version provided $768 billion. The $9 billion for full civilian accrual accounting caused a deadlock in marking up appropriations bills. The House and Senate faced a deadlock over $9 billion in discretionary funding. The House approved a rule for the FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill, including a provision on the $10 billion contingency for war costs. There was ongoing discussion on how to treat this funding, with appropriators wanting more flexibility. However, the House leadership did not agree to amend the \"deeming\" language, causing objections from some conservatives. The House leadership did not agree on the treatment of the $10 billion contingency fund for war costs. The House Armed Services Committee approved the fund in a separate bill, using part of it to finance programs. The conference agreement on the defense authorization bill approved the $10 billion as an unallocated contingency fund for the war against terrorism, but it was not appropriated by the appropriations committees. Funding for counter-terrorism activities may be addressed next year. The House version of the defense appropriations bill, H.R. 5010, provided $354.7 billion for defense activities, $12.1 billion below the requested amount. $10 billion was allocated for counter-terrorism activities. The Senate version provided $355.4 billion, $11.4 billion below the request. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill allocated $255.1 billion. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill provides $255.1 billion, $11.6 billion below the request. There was considerable debate in Congress about priorities within the budget and specific programs, with the most contentious issue being concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits. The House authorization bill included a provision for partial concurrent receipt, while the Senate bill included immediate, full concurrent receipt. The conference agreement provides a benefit payment only to military retirees with a combat-related disability. The House Armed Services Committee disagreed with the Office of the Secretary of Defense's decision to terminate the Army Crusader program, including full funding for it in the defense authorization bill. However, Congress later agreed to terminate the program but allocated funds for a new artillery system. The Senate debated missile defense funding, reducing requested R&D funds by over $800 million. The Senate debated missile defense funding, reducing R&D funds by over $800 million. The Administration requested $19.4 billion in the FY2003 defense budget for the global campaign against terrorism, with $10 billion as an unallocated reserve for future use. The FY2003 defense budget requested $10 billion as an unallocated reserve for future military operations, with $9.4 billion allocated for specified activities. An additional $700 million was requested for programs in the Nuclear Posture Review, to be appropriated to the Defense Emergency Response Fund for flexibility in fund usage. The counter-terrorism funds requested for FY2003 aimed to continue activities funded in previous years through emergency supplemental appropriations. The Administration requested $27.1 billion in FY2002 supplemental appropriations for responding to the terrorist attacks, with $14.0 billion allocated for defense. The House and Senate approved a bill providing $28.8 billion in supplemental appropriations, including $14.5 billion for defense. $5.1 billion was contingent emergency funding, but the White House does not intend to designate it as an emergency, with $983 million for defense. Congress did not provide the $10 billion requested as an unallocated contingency fund for specific counter-terrorism programs in the DERF. Instead, funding was allocated to regular operating and acquisition accounts in authorization and appropriations bills, with reductions in funding for combat air patrols and other programs. The House Armed Services Committee considered allocating $3.6 billion of the requested amount in a separate bill. The House Armed Services Committee initially allocated $3.6 billion for specific programs in H.R. 4547, which was later reduced to $3.1 billion. Most of this funding was for counter-terrorism projects requested by the Administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized the full $10 billion for the war on terrorism in its version of the bill. The Administration submitted a formal budget amendment revising its request for $10 billion for various DOD appropriations accounts. The revised request would authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer the funds 15 days after notifying Congress. The allocation includes up to $2.55 billion for military personnel accounts, up to $5.57 billion for operation and maintenance accounts, up to $1.88 billion for procurement or research development. The House Armed Services Committee reported a revised version of H.R. 4547, allocating $3.1 billion to specific programs and $6.9 billion in broad categories. The bill was passed on July 24, authorizing $392.8 billion for national defense. Congress did not approve using the contingency fund for an increase in defense programs, instead providing $10 billion as an unallocated reserve for war costs. The House Armed Services Committee authorized $392.8 billion for national defense in H.R. 4547. Congress allocated $10 billion as an unallocated reserve for war costs, with the disposition of funds for counter-terrorism dependent on appropriations bills. The Administration requested pay raises and benefits for military personnel, including a 4.1% pay raise and selective pay increases. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved the Administration's proposed pay and benefits increases, providing a 4.1% pay raise and other targeted pay increases. Significant personnel-related issues emerged, including concurrent receipt of retirement and disability benefits, House cuts in funding for health benefits accrual, and an increase in authorized active duty military end-strength. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved a 4.1% pay raise and other targeted pay increases. Veterans organizations advocate for full retirement pensions and VA disability benefits without offset. Last year, Congress approved partial concurrent receipt, but it was not funded by the Administration. This year, concurrent receipt remains a critical issue in the House. The House-passed authorization bill approved phased-in concurrent receipt for military retirees with a disability of 60% or greater, costing an estimated $516 million in FY2003 and $17 billion over ten years. This measure would require an increase in contributions to the military retirement fund to cover the increased benefits for current military personnel. The House measure proposes accrual payments from the general Treasury for military retirees, with an estimated cost of $1.1 billion in FY2003, $8.8 billion over five years, and $22.6 billion over ten years. The Senate also included a phased-in measure for concurrent receipt of disability and retired pay, with an amendment approved for immediate full concurrent receipt regardless of disability level. The Senate-passed measure does not shield the Defense Department from accrual costs. The Senate version of concurrent receipt would cost $4.3 billion in FY2003, $25.8 billion over the next five years, and $61.0 billion over the next ten years. The Defense Department would need to provide $1.1 billion in FY2003, $2.5 billion over the next five years, and $6.4 billion over the next ten years to cover accrual payments for military personnel. The Administration opposed permitting concurrent receipt. The White House and Defense Department threatened to veto the defense authorization bill over the issue of concurrent receipt. A compromise was reached during the 107th Congress's lame duck session, providing a new benefit for retirees with disabilities caused by combat injuries. Payments will be made to retirees with disabilities of 10% or greater from a Purple Heart injury or 60% or more from combat-related activities. The amount will be equal to VA disability benefits, with an estimated 30,000 retirees qualifying for the new benefit. The Defense Department will administer the payments. The Defense Department will administer combat-related disability benefits for retirees with disabilities of 10% or greater from a Purple Heart injury or 60% or more from combat-related activities. An estimated 30,000 retirees may qualify for the new benefit, with costs to be covered by the Defense Department through annual appropriations or supplemental funding requests. The Defense Department estimated a $8.1 billion payment for retiree health care benefits in FY2003, with potential cost reductions expected. The House Armed Services Committee reduced military personnel funding by $810 million, leading to concerns about a possible shortfall in accounts. The House Appropriations Committee also reduced funding for health benefits. The House Appropriations Committee reduced funding for health benefits accrual by $405 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee reduced accrual contributions by $372.6 million. The Administration opposed the House authorization measure, and the conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill also reduces funding for health benefits accrual by $405 million. The House Armed Services Committee approved an increase of 12,552 in active duty end-strength. The House Armed Services Committee approved an increase of 12,552 in active duty end-strength, with the military services seeking additional personnel. Secretary Rumsfeld has resisted increases, citing long-term costs and advocating for reducing demands on the force. The cost of the end-strength increase would exceed $1 billion annually once fully phased in. The Senate approved an increase in active duty end-strength by 12,000, with Senator Cleland proposing a total increase of 40,000 service members over five years. The Defense Department opposed any increase, while the House Appropriations Committee argued that requirements are uncertain for FY2003. The committee report did not approve an increase in end-strength for FY2003. The conference agreement allows for a potential increase of up to 3% above the authorized level, with the military service secretaries having the authority to increase by up to 2%. The agreement establishes a floor on end-strength and repeals a measure for flexibility in increasing end-strength. The Army's modernization plan includes upgrading existing weapons with new capabilities, developing new brigade combat teams, and creating the future \"objective force.\" Controversial elements include the Comanche helicopter and Crusader artillery system. The interim force features the new \"Stryker\" light armored vehicle, supported by Congress despite some debate. The Army's modernization plan includes upgrading existing weapons and developing new brigade combat teams for the future \"objective force.\" Congress generally supports the plan, including the interim force with the new \"Stryker\" vehicle. The key element is the \"Future Combat System,\" which integrates new armored systems and improved communication capabilities. Congressional debates have focused on the characteristics of the armored vehicle and funding for the Crusader artillery system. The fate of the Crusader artillery system in the defense budget was a contentious issue, with plans to cancel the $11 billion program due to concerns about deployability and the need for alternatives. The fate of the Crusader artillery system in the defense budget was contentious as Secretary Rumsfeld intended to terminate the project, despite considerable support in Congress. The House Armed Services Committee provided full funding for Crusader R&D, with language prohibiting a funding cut until a formal analysis of alternatives was completed. The White House threatened a veto if any bill limited its ability to cancel the program, and the Senate Armed Services Committee deferred action pending a hearing on the Crusader. The Services Committee deferred action on the Crusader bill, with potential funding reduction. DOD requested Congress to allocate Crusader funding to other Army R&D programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved an amendment to fence Crusader funding for 30 days and require a study of alternatives. The Secretary of Defense could request to reprogram the money into other Army indirect fire weapons development. Senator Warner's amendment allowed the Secretary of Defense to allocate funds to other programs without seeking congressional permission. The Warner amendment, approved unanimously, led to the approval of the Levin amendment by a vote of 96 to 3. The House Appropriations Committee agreed to terminate the Crusader program and fund alternatives proposed by the Administration. They also allocated $173 million for developing a platform and new munitions, with a requirement for a system to be delivered by 2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $173 million for a non-line of sight cannon to be deployed by 2008, as directed by the conference agreement on H.R. 4775 for supplemental appropriations. Congressional defense committees approved reprogramming funds from the Crusader to the Army's Future Combat System development program, including $173 million for the cannon. The House and Senate defense committees took different actions on Army helicopter programs. The House added funds for additional UH-60 Blackhawk utility helicopters and simulators, while the Senate added funds for aircraft allowing the Army to allocate the funds. Funding for the CH-47 cargo helicopter was more contentious, with the House adding funds for crashworthy seats and the Senate having a different amount allocated. The Senate authorization initially had $4 million for crashworthy seats, which was reduced to $1 million in floor action. The House appropriations bill added $45 million for seat modifications to increase production rates and upgrade all CH-47s to the \"F\" version. The appropriations conference agreement allocated an additional $39.1 million to support increased production rates and ensure all upgraded aircraft requirements are met by 2016. Additionally, funds were provided for 6 TH-67 training helicopters. The Comanche helicopter program was also addressed. The Comanche helicopter program faced criticism for cost increases, restructuring of development plans, and delays in procurement. The House Armed Services Committee proposed a cap of $6 billion on engineering and manufacturing development costs for the Comanche, below the Army's projections. The House bill also required annual reviews by the Defense Department's Inspector General, with support for the program in jeopardy according to the House Appropriations Committee. The House Appropriations Committee warned of potential support cuts for the Comanche program due to delays and cost overruns. The Defense Department also scrutinized the program, leading to a decision to reduce planned procurement by half. The conference report on the authorization bill removed the House cap on EMD costs and Inspector General review requirements, but now mandates quarterly reports to Congress on the program's status. Additionally, there were differences in funding for other Army programs, with the termination of the Wide Area Munitions program and an additional $60 million allocated for the Bradley fighting vehicle. The House and Senate bills differed in funding allocations for various military programs. The House added money for Bradley fighting vehicle upgrades and tank recovery vehicles for the National Guard, while the Senate made cuts to certain missile programs. The House also allocated funds for up-armored HMMWVs and SINGCARS radios, but the Senate cut funding for the latter. The defense appropriations conference report made changes to various military programs, including terminating the Wide Area Munitions program, adding funds for Bradley upgrades, and shifting Patriot PAC-3 procurement from the Army to the Missile Defense Agency. The Army plans to equip six brigades with Stryker vehicles. The Defense Department is considering reducing the number of Interim Combat Brigades from six to three, as part of the FY2004-FY2009 defense plan. Congress has not debated this proposal yet, but $59.5 million has been added for Stryker brigade deployment. The FY2003 budget request for Navy shipbuilding fell short of the needed pace to sustain a fleet of 300 ships. Congressional action included funding for an additional DD-51 destroyer and a tentative settlement for Virginia-class submarine acquisition. The House authorization added $810 million for various shipbuilding programs, including Virginia class submarine advance procurement, cruiser conversion advance procurement, and nuclear submarine refueling overhaul. Funds were also added to accelerate procurement of the next aircraft carrier, CVN(X). The Navy's plan to procure the carrier had slipped by one year, with additional funding requested in FY2007 and FY2008. The Senate Armed Services Committee added $690 million for Navy shipbuilding. The Senate Armed Services Committee added significant funds for Navy shipbuilding, including $690 million transferred from missile defense R&D. This included $415 million for Virginia-class attack submarines, $200 million for refueling an SSN-688 Los Angeles-class attack submarine, $150 million for LPD-17 amphibious ships, and $125 million for DDG-51 destroyers. They also provided $229 million to accelerate CVN(X) procurement. In contrast, the House Appropriations Committee allocated $250 million for the CVN-77 carrier's advanced radar and electronic systems. The Navy is upgrading ships with advanced radar and electronic systems as a transition to the CVN(X). The Senate Appropriations Committee added funds for shipbuilding, addressing cost overruns on various ships while criticizing the Navy's overuse of advance procurement. They reduced funding for advance procurement for certain programs. The committee added $306 million for work transfer on LPD-17s and DDG-51s, $229 million for CVN(X) procurement acceleration, $200 million for SSN-688 refueling overhaul, $90 million for advanced electronics on CVN-77, $160 million to restore CVN(X) procurement schedule, $530.9 million for prior year cost growth, $243 million for LHD-8, and $165 million for an additional SSN-688 refueling overhaul. The Senate bill includes $165 million for an additional SSN-688 refueling overhaul. The Navy planned to accelerate development of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) under the DDX program. Congress was informally asked for additional funds to study alternatives for the LCS program. The Senate report allocated $4 million for the program, which had not undergone the usual acquisition review process. The defense authorization conference report provides $4 million for a new program, requiring a review of program requirements and alternatives. Funding for major aircraft programs in the FY2003 Administration request includes Marine Corps V-22, Air Force F-22, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Navy F/A-18E/F, and C-17. The Navy is considering reducing future F-35 procurement, but congressional support remains strong. Both House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved funding for major aircraft programs, including F-22, F-35, V-22, and C-17. Additional funds were added for trainer aircraft, Navy helicopters, F/A-18E/F fighters, and EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft upgrades. House Appropriations Committee added funding for F-22 R&D, while Senate Appropriations Committee added funds for 4 additional F/A-18E/F fighters. The Senate Appropriations Committee added funds for additional F/A-18E/F fighters and fully funded procurement of C-17 aircraft. The appropriations conference report included $120 million for 2 additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Air Force's funding approach for C-17 procurement raised concerns about fiscal discipline. The House Armed Services Committee approved the C-17 procurement profile but warned against the funding approach used by the Air Force. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the Air Force's approach and required full funding for C-17 aircraft procurement in FY2004. This funding approach deviates from the longstanding DOD policy of full funding for end-items requested in any given year. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the Air Force's incremental funding approach for C-17 procurement and added $585.9 million for full funding of 15 aircraft. The appropriations conference agreement mandates full funding for the C-17, adding $585.9 million for FY2003 and instructing the Air Force to request full funding in the future. Last year, the defense appropriations bill allowed the Air Force to negotiate with Boeing to lease tanker aircraft for a ten-year period. Boeing has offered to lease 100 767 aircraft as tankers, with concerns raised by Senator McCain and others about the potential long-term costs compared to regular procurement. The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have projected higher costs for leasing. Mitch Daniels, the Director of OMB, criticized the plan to lease tankers, suggesting it would be cheaper to buy new tankers or re-engine older aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved an amendment by Senator McCain requiring Congress to authorize funds for any tanker lease agreement. The Air Force is close to reaching an agreement with Boeing on tanker leases, with $3 million allocated in the appropriations conference agreement. Payment for tanker leases may be made one year in advance, allowing funds for aircraft procurement. Senator McCain criticized the leasing provisions in the conference report, leading to a revised provision that requires specific authorization and appropriation for tanker leases. The Secretary of Defense is expected to seek congressional approval for a new tanker lease. Funding details for major aircraft programs are outlined in Table 8. The Administration requested $7.8 billion for missile defense programs in FY2003, including funding for various defense systems such as mid-course defenses, Navy Theater Wide program, THAAD system, Patriot PAC-3, boost phase defense systems, and space-based sensors. The Administration requested $7.8 billion for missile defense programs in FY2003, including funding for various defense systems such as mid-course defenses, Navy Theater Wide program, THAAD system, Patriot PAC-3, boost phase defense systems, and space-based sensors. Additionally, there were debates in Congress about the National Missile Defense program and space-based systems like the SBL. The House Armed Services Committee generally supported the Administration's request but reduced funding for the ABL by $77.5 million. The House Armed Services Committee disputed the need for a second test aircraft in the defense appropriations bill. They redistributed savings to other missile defense programs and refused to fund Patriot PAC-3 or MEADS development in the Army budget. Representative Spratt's amendment to reduce funding for SBL and space-based interceptor development was defeated, but an alternative by Representative Hunter to add funds for PAC-3 and Arrow was approved. The Missile Defense Agency's funding for PAC-3 and Arrow was to be financed without specifying the source of funds. Representative Spratt's amendment to prohibit nuclear interceptor missiles was rejected. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced missile defense funding by $814.3 million, mainly in systems engineering and support activities, prompting some Republicans to vote against reporting the bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced ABL and SBIRS-High funding by $135 million and $100 million respectively, and approved provisions for stricter oversight of missile defense programs. Secretary Rumsfeld opposed the funding cuts and acquisition procedure changes in a letter to Senator Levin. Secretary Rumsfeld opposed the Senate's provisions on acquisition procedures, stating they would hinder program management. He threatened a veto if the final bill includes cuts to missile defense funding or changes to program management. The Senate approved an amendment to restore some missile defense funding, allowing the President to allocate funds to either missile defense or counter-terrorism, with priority given to counter-terrorism. The Senate approved an amendment to prohibit nuclear armed interceptors for missile defense. The House Appropriations Committee made changes in missile defense funding, denying funding for Navy sea-based terminal defense and the Russian-American Observation Satellite Program (RAMOS) due to lack of response from the Russian government. The House and Senate committees made changes to missile defense funding, cutting funding for sea-based and space-based boost phase defenses. The House approved a shift in funding from the space-based kinetic interceptor program to the Airborne Laser program. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided additional funding for missile defense and counter-terrorism programs. The appropriations conference report reduced funding for missile defense by $43 million but added $45 million for Patriot PAC-3 procurement and $70 million for the U.S.-Israeli Arrow program. It also included provisions for revised management of missile defense programs, requiring annual reports to Congress on performance goals and funding profiles for each system. The agreement requires the Defense Department's Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) to provide a one-time review of cost, schedule, and performance criteria to Congress. It also mandates a life-cycle cost estimate for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program and allows for 85% of the authorized funds to be obligated. Additionally, the director of the Missile Defense Agency must report to Congress on each flight test of the Ground-Based Mid-Course National Missile Defense System. The authorization conference report prohibits the use of FY2003 funds for developing a nuclear-armed interceptor for missile defense. The Warner/Levin amendment provides up to $814.3 million for missile defense and counter-terrorism programs. In January, the Administration completed a Nuclear Posture Review and submitted a classified report to Congress. The classified Nuclear Posture Review report was leaked, sparking public debate on nuclear weapons use against non-nuclear states. Administration plans included reducing offensive nuclear warheads and developing new weapons for specific missions. A treaty with Russia was announced to reduce strategic offensive force levels. In Congress, a proposal to limit strategic nuclear force levels to 1,700 warheads was rejected. The House approved a Tauscher amendment for a report on options for 1,700 to 2,200 warheads. Representative Spratt's amendment for one-year advance notification of nuclear testing decision was rejected. The Rules Committee blocked a floor vote on the amendment. An amendment by Representative Markey to prohibit a nuclear earth penetrator weapon was also rejected. The Senate Armed Services Committee eliminated $15.5 million for a \"Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator\" warhead and requires a detailed report. The Senate approved an amendment to prohibit nuclear armed interceptors for missile defense. The Senate bill includes provisions for requesting funds before developing new nuclear weapons, with specific authorization required for any new program. Funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator warhead are provided but cannot be used until Congress receives a required report. The Department of Energy must request funds for new nuclear weapons development, and a report on options for resuming nuclear testing is required. The Defense Department is concerned about the impact of environmental regulations on training and has proposed legislation to exempt DOD training activities from several environmental statutes. The House-passed version of the authorization bill includes provisions exempting DOD from the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Wilderness Act for military training exercises. DOD may use its own plan to protect endangered species instead of designating installations as critical habitats. The House bill exempts DOD from certain environmental statutes for military training exercises, allowing them to conduct activities that may unintentionally harm migratory birds. It also permits DOD to have emergency access to the Utah Test and Training Range. The House bill exempts DOD from environmental restrictions for military training in the Utah Test and Training Range, including designated wilderness areas. The House Armed Services Committee did not address other environmental measures proposed by DOD. The House Armed Services Committee did not address environmental measures proposed by DOD. In the Senate bill, $20 million is authorized for the Secretary of Defense to acquire lands for buffer zones and natural habitat areas for endangered species near military installations. The authorization conference report includes revisions to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, temporarily exempting military training activities. The report does not include changes to the Endangered Species Act but maintains provisions for the Utah Test and Training Range. Current law limits the number of U.S. military personnel in Colombia to 400, excluding those serving diplomatic functions or on emergency missions. The House authorization bill proposed raising the cap to 500 personnel in Colombia. The authorization conference report establishes a cap of 500 U.S. military personnel in Colombia, with the Secretary of Defense able to waive the cap for national security reasons. Last year, Congress approved a measure for military base closures in 2005. Representative Taylor's amendment to repeal last year's base closure provisions was defeated in the House Armed Services Committee markup. Abortions are available in the United States. Abortions are often not available to U.S. military personnel deployed abroad. Congress debated allowing abortions at overseas military hospitals, with the House rejecting the proposal and the Senate approving an amendment to remove the prohibition on privately funded abortions at these facilities. The House FY2003 appropriations bill includes a provision prohibiting the transfer of funds to other agencies without approval. The House FY2003 appropriations bill includes a provision, 8122, that prohibits the transfer of funds to other agencies without approval. This would prevent the transfer of defense funds to the Department of Homeland Security without appropriations committee approval. H.Con.Res. 253 and S.Con.Res. 100 are concurrent resolutions establishing the congressional budget for fiscal years 2003 and beyond. The House FY2003 appropriations bill, H.R. 4546, authorized appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2003. The bill was marked up by the House Armed Services Committee and approved with amendments. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent after striking all after the enacting clause and substituting the language of S. 2514. The conference report was filed and agreed to in both the House and Senate in November. H.R. 4547 (Stump) authorized appropriations for the war against terrorism, approved by the House (413-3) on July 24, 2002. S. 2514 (Levin) authorized appropriations for military activities for fiscal year 2003, marked up by the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 9, 2002. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported on May 9, 2002, with the report filed on May 15, 2002. The Senate approved the appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, as amended on June 27, 2002. The House and Senate approved the appropriations bill on June 27, 2002, and August 1, 2002, respectively. The conference report was agreed upon in the House on October 10, 2002, and in the Senate on October 16, 2002, before being signed into law on October 23, 2002. The Senate approved appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, on June 27, 2002. The House and Senate both approved the bill on different dates before it was signed into law on October 23, 2002. In 2002, S. 2709 (Feinstein) was marked up and ordered to be reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee for military construction, family housing, and base realignment and closure for the Department of Defense. It was later approved by the House and Senate, leading to the enactment of P.L. 107-206, H.R. 4775, making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002. S. 2551 (Byrd) was a bill for supplemental appropriations in response to terrorist attacks, marked up by the Senate Appropriations Committee in May 2002 and signed into law in August 2002. The bill received approval from both the House and Senate, with a conference report agreed upon in July 2002. The summarized text chunk includes various CRS reports on defense, military medical care services, military pay and benefits, military retirement, and environmental programs for FY2003. The summarized text chunk includes CRS reports on military retirement, missile defense, Navy ship procurement, aircraft carrier programs, future surface combatant programs, peacekeeping, recruiting and retention in the military, and tactical aircraft modernization. Congress funds national defense programs through annual appropriations measures, with the defense appropriations bill being the largest. The national defense authorization bill authorizes programs funded in these appropriations measures, addressing defense programs in detail. Congressional debate on major defense policy and funding issues typically occurs during action on the authorization bill. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense, including personnel pay, weapons procurement, and research. It also provides funding for other agencies like the CIA and intelligence community. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense, including personnel pay, weapons procurement, and research, as well as other agencies like the CIA and intelligence community. Additionally, other appropriations bills provide funds for national defense activities of DOD and other agencies, including military construction, atomic energy defense activities, civil defense activities, national security-related activities, and transportation funding. The Administration proposed a significant increase in the national defense budget for FY2003, totaling $396.8 billion, the largest increase since the early Reagan Administration. This includes supplemental funding for counter-terrorism in FY2001 and FY2002, making it the largest increase in defense spending since the Vietnam War. The Administration projects continued growth in defense spending through FY2007. The Administration's plan includes a large increase in defense spending, but concerns remain among defense advocates in Congress. Some Members are unhappy with the proposed budget allocation of $10 billion for the global counter-terrorism campaign, preferring to use it for major weapons programs like shipbuilding. The Defense Budget from FY2000-FY2007 shows Administration projections in current and constant FY2003 dollars. The data reflects changes in accounting for retirement benefits, including accrual accounting for health care benefits for military retirees and civilian retirement benefits. OMB has adjusted figures for consistency. The FY2003 defense budget includes changes in accounting for military and civilian retirement benefits, with a shift to accrual accounting. OMB figures do not show the allocation of $9.8 billion for defense in the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental appropriations act. In the FY2003 and FY2004 defense budgets, significant adjustments in accrual accounting impact budget totals. This includes accrual accounting for over-65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel and civilian personnel retirement pension and health benefits. The Administration has proposed funding all civilian retirement benefits on an accrual basis, resulting in a $3.4 billion increase in the Department of Defense budget for FY2003. OMB has adjusted figures for FY2001 and FY2002 to align with the new treatment, including $3.0 billion in FY2001 and $3.2 billion in FY2002 for increased civilian retirement accrual. Additionally, starting in FY2004, the Administration is proposing accrual accounting for under-65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel. The Administration is proposing accrual accounting for under-65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel starting in FY2004. DOD would pay into a fund for future benefits and receive reimbursement for costs of retiree health care. The cost of changes in accrual accounting is reflected in budget projections from FY2004 onwards. The Defense Department's increased costs include accounting changes, inflation, pay raises, changes in weapons cost estimates, and costs of the global counter-terrorism campaign. DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim stated that these \"must pay\" bills leave less than $10 billion for new initiatives. Key cost breakdowns include $6.7 billion for inflation, $2.7 billion for pay raises, $8.1 billion for health care benefits for retired uniformed personnel, $3.3 billion for retirement account accrual payments for civilian DOD personnel, $7.4 billion for revised weapons cost estimates, and $19.4 billion for realistic costing and operating costs.

The total new costs amount to $47.5 billion, offset by $9.3 billion in savings from procurement programs, resulting in a net increase of almost $50 billion in the defense budget. The FY2003 budget for counter-terrorism costs increased by $16 billion, not $19 billion as in FY2002. Additionally, $3.2 billion was allocated for civilian accrual accounting in FY2002, making the added cost in FY2003 only $0.2 billion. A significant portion of the $9.4 billion for war-related funding will go towards procurement of items like UAVs and intelligence infrastructure. Overall, new initiatives in FY2003 compared to FY2002 amount to $20-25 billion, a substantial increase. The FY2003 defense budget increase is significant, with a large portion going towards military personnel and operation and maintenance. The budget comparison shows a focus on these areas rather than procurement or research and development. The FY2003 defense budget increase includes significant funding for military personnel accounts, with rapid growth due to pay and benefits increases approved by Congress in the FY2001 defense authorization act. Key provisions of this act included a 3.7% pay raise, pay table reform for mid-career personnel, increased housing benefits, Tricare for Life for over-65 military retirees, and a requirement for future military pay raises. The FY2003 defense budget increase includes significant funding for military personnel accounts, with rapid growth due to pay and benefits increases approved by Congress in the FY2001 defense authorization act. The bill also included a 3.7% pay raise, pay table reform for mid-career personnel, increased housing benefits, Tricare for Life for over-65 military retirees, and a requirement for future military pay raises to be equal to the \"employment cost index\" plus 0.5%. Increased pay and benefits have improved military recruitment and retention, but have also driven up personnel costs dramatically. Total military personnel funding is projected to grow to $117 billion by FY2007. Personnel costs are projected to increase from $48,000 to over $65,000 per active duty troop in FY2003 prices after adjusting for inflation. This growth is similar to the upward trend in operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts. Total O&M funding per active duty troop in constant, inflation-adjusted prices shows a very consistent pattern over the years. The consistent pattern of growth in defense spending above inflation is projected to continue, with personnel and O&M costs taking up a significant portion of the increases. National defense funding is expected to increase by $166 billion from FY2000 to FY2007, with a large portion allocated to personnel and O&M, and the rest for procurement and R&D. The OMB figures show $3.0 billion in FY2000 and $3.2 billion in FY2001 for civilian retirement benefits, with full accrual accounting proposed to begin in FY2003. The debate in Congress revolves around whether the allocated funds for procurement in FY2003 and FY2007 are sufficient to reverse the \"procurement holiday\" in defense budgets following the Cold War. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry highlighted the decline in new weapons purchases in the 1990s, attributing it to reduced threats, recent weapon acquisitions, and the retirement of older equipment. Perry emphasized the need to end the procurement holiday soon. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry warned about the need to end the procurement holiday to avoid a future \"bow wave\" of costs. The goal of $60 billion per year for procurement was reached in FY2001, but now the debate has shifted to how much more than $60 billion is needed for modernization. Studies have focused on the amount needed to sustain a steady state procurement rate for major weapons. The cost estimates for modernizing strategic nuclear weapons vary, with projections ranging from $80 billion to $160 billion annually. Concerns have been raised by members of congressional defense committees about the adequacy of the Administration's budget plan for procurement. Adjusting for inflation, the projected $99 billion for procurement in FY2007 falls short of steady-state procurement requirements. Defense committees are concerned about the Administration's budget plan for weapons procurement, particularly the shipbuilding budget. The plan only calls for five new ships in FY2003, which falls short of the needed rate to maintain a fleet of 300 ships. There are also concerns about underfunding for helicopters, munitions, and other programs. Reports indicate discussions within the DOD about how to handle a significant \"bow wave\" of procurement costs in FY2007 and beyond. The Defense Department is facing a significant \"bow wave\" of procurement costs in FY2007 and beyond, with plans to cut back on F-35 fighter procurement. The Navy is proposing to cut back on F-35 fighter procurement, and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is considering terminating weapons programs to prioritize funds for transformational weapons. President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld have endorsed defense transformation, but there is pressure to clarify the administration's definition. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz outlined transformation goals in the Quadrennial Defense Review, requesting about $21 billion for FY2003. Goals include defending the U.S. homeland, denying enemy sanctuary, projecting forces in distant theaters, conducting operations in space and information warfare, and leveraging information technology for joint forces. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz outlined transformation goals in the Quadrennial Defense Review, requesting about $21 billion for FY2003. A total of $136 billion is planned over the next 5 years for these goals. Congressional actions on defense authorization and appropriations are detailed in tables provided. The Defense and Military Construction Appropriations budget authority in millions of dollars was outlined in the Summary tables of appropriations conference reports in Congressional Record on October 10, 2002, pages 7807 and 7816."
