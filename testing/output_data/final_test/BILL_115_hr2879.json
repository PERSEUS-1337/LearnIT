SEC. 3. EXTENDING AVIATION DEVELOPMENT STREAMLINING. Section 47171 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include general aviation airport construction or improvement projects in the expedited environmental review process requirements. Section 47175 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to redefine and rearrange certain paragraphs related to general aviation airport construction or improvement projects. The amendment redefines and rearranges paragraphs related to general aviation airport construction or improvement projects, including runway construction, land acquisition, taxiways, safety areas, aprons, and navigational aids. It also includes other airport development projects designated by the Secretary to facilitate aviation capacity building at general aviation airports. Establishment of a public-private partnership program at general aviation airports. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a program for improving facilities at general aviation and privately owned airports without scheduled air service. Operators or sponsors seeking to participate must submit an application with required information. The program established by the Secretary of Transportation aims to improve facilities at general aviation and privately owned airports without scheduled air service. The application must include an assessment of airport needs, ability to attract private investments, and support from the airport community. Limitations include selecting only 4 airports per state per fiscal year and a maximum funding of $500,000 per airport annually. The Secretary gives priority to airports where the operator or community will contribute to the project cost, employ best business practices, or establish a public-private partnership. Assistance must be used promptly and can include various types of support. The Secretary may use funds to assist in marketing airports to private entities, fund studies on attracting private investment, and participate in partnerships or investments. The Secretary can also enter agreements with airports and entities for providing assistance. Authorized $5,000,000 annually from Airport and Airway Trust Fund for 2018-2022 for this section. Amounts to remain available until expended. Section 9502(d)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the FLIGHT Act of 2017 for expenditure authority from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The Secretary of Transportation will designate disaster relief airports based on specific criteria, including being categorized as a regional reliever airport, proximity to medical facilities, and location in disaster-prone regions. The Secretary of Transportation will designate disaster relief airports based on specific criteria, including having a paved runway of at least 3,400 feet, aircraft maintenance facilities, and adequate taxiway and ramp space for loading supplies. If a state has fewer than 3 qualifying airports, the Secretary may designate up to 3 general aviation airports as disaster relief airports in consultation with state aviation officials. The region is considered prone to natural disasters if there is a high probability of earthquakes or if the President has declared more than 5 major disasters in the area. The term 'natural disaster' includes various events like hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and wildfires. Disaster relief airports must be operated and maintained for disaster relief purposes. If a runway is unusable due to maintenance or necessary repairs, it does not violate operational requirements. A disaster relief airport must comply with operational requirements even if it is under maintenance or in need of repairs. It must also develop an emergency natural disaster management plan and may face a civil penalty for violations. Consideration for project grants is given based on the airport's role in disaster relief. The airport's role in disaster relief is a key factor in determining grant eligibility. This section applies regardless of other laws or agreements. SEC. 6. AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO DISASTER RELIEF. This section focuses on disaster relief airports. Section 47102(3) of title 49, United States Code is amended to include planning, acquiring, and constructing facilities at disaster relief airports for disaster preparedness and infrastructure improvements. The Secretary determines aprons and terminal buildings to facilitate disaster response at the airport. SEC. 7. Covered aircraft construction included in aeronautical activity definition for airport improvement grants. The construction of recreational aircraft at general aviation airports for exclusive recreational use is considered an aeronautical activity for airport compliance and eligibility for federal financial assistance."
