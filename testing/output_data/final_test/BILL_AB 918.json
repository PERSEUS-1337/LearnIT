    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the risks of behavioral restraint and seclusion, as highlighted by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. While California tracks and reports on the use of these methods in state developmental centers, data on their use in other facilities serving individuals with developmental disabilities is not publicly available. The Legislature aims to reduce the use of restraint in care facilities by ensuring consistent data collection and public access to this data. A new section is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code defining physical and chemical restraint. This is to ensure quality services for individuals with developmental disabilities and decrease the use of restraint. The definitions of \"long-term health care facility,\" \"acute psychiatric hospital,\" and \"regional center vendor\" are provided in the Welfare and Institutions Code to ensure quality services for individuals with developmental disabilities. The department is required to report data on the use of physical and chemical restraint by regional center vendors, long-term health care facilities, and acute psychiatric hospitals serving individuals with developmental disabilities. Quarterly data on incidents of physical and chemical restraint must be published on the department's website. The new section 4659.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines terms related to restraint, including physical restraint, chemical restraint, and seclusion. It also specifies that long-term health care facilities must report incidents of chemical restraint to regional centers. (5) \"Acute psychiatric hospital\" is a facility approved by a regional center vendor, as defined in the Health and Safety Code.\n(6) \"Regional center vendor\" is an agency or individual approved by a regional center to provide services. All regional center vendors providing residential or supported living services, long-term health care facilities, and acute psychiatric hospitals must report any death or serious injury related to the use of seclusion, physical restraint, or chemical restraint to the designated agency by the next business day. The report should include the person's encrypted identifier, facility name, address, and contact number."
