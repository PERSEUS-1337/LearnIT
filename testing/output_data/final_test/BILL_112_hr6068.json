    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Fairness Act of 2012\" and includes a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program. The \"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Fairness Act of 2012\" amends Section 1240Q of the Food Security Act of 1985 to define terms like Chesapeake Bay State, Chesapeake Bay watershed, owner, and technical service provider. The term 'technical service provider' refers to a third-party provider eligible for approval under section 1242(e). Amendments include inserting 'and owners' after 'producers' in various subsections, adding 'and nonindustrial private forest lands' in subsection (b), and specifying exceptions in subsection (c). Subsection (d)(1) is modified by striking certain language and inserting new text. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to Chesapeake Bay States to develop water quality goals for nitrogen reduction. Subsections (e) through (h) are redesignated as subsections (f) through (i). The Secretary may enter into agreements with Chesapeake Bay States to provide financial and technical assistance for reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment from agricultural or nonindustrial private forest land in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to improve water quality. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to agricultural producers and owners in the Chesapeake Bay watershed through a technical service provider, agricultural or silvicultural producer association, or a State or unit of local government to promote water quality goals. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to agricultural producers and owners in the Chesapeake Bay watershed through various entities such as a State or unit of local government, Indian tribe, farmer cooperative, institution of higher education, or an organization with a history of working with producers on agricultural land. This assistance aims to address local conservation priorities related to agricultural production, wildlife habitat development, and nonindustrial private forest land management, as well as critical watershed-scale issues. Technical assistance may be provided to agricultural producers and owners in the Chesapeake Bay watershed for conservation services aimed at reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment losses from agricultural and nonindustrial private forest land. This includes education on activities to reduce such losses and conservation planning. The text chunk discusses conservation planning, implementation, and maintenance to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment losses from agricultural and nonindustrial private forest land in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It includes identifying best management practices, outreach and education to producers and owners, and adoption of tools and technology for achieving compliance with water quality laws. The text chunk discusses funding amendments for conservation planning in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, allocating $50,000,000 annually from 2013 to 2018."
