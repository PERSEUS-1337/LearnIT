The \"Secure and Verifiable Electronic Voting Act of 2004\" mandates voter-verified paper records for manual audits, ensuring accuracy and integrity in voting. The voting system must preserve a voter-verified paper record for manual audits and provide the voter with an opportunity to correct any errors before the record is finalized. This paper record will be the official record used for any recount in elections using the system. The voting system must have a voter-verified paper record that cannot be produced on thermal paper. The system should not contain undisclosed software and must disclose its source code for inspection. Additionally, no voting system should have any wireless communication device. The electronic voting system must be certified by accredited laboratories and provide voter verification of results for individuals with disabilities. The electronic voting system must meet disability access and voter-verification standards outlined in the paragraph, with the option for assistance for individuals with disabilities.

The Secure and Verifiable Electronic Voting Act of 2004 provides funding to states for voter-verification and audit capacity requirements. The Election Assistance Commission will pay each state to assist with implementation, with limitations on the amount based on the cost of adding a printer to voting systems.

Additionally, the authorization of appropriations is extended. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to change deadlines for payments related to election administration and voting machine replacement to November 2004, with an aggregate amount of $650,000,000 for fiscal years 2003 through 2005.

The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to require states to implement a paper ballot voting system for the November 2004 general elections, with the Commission reimbursing any costs incurred by the State or jurisdiction. SEC. 5 amends the Help America Vote Act to require federal certification of technological security for voter registration lists. SEC. 6 introduces a requirement for mandatory recounts. SEC. 6 introduces a requirement for mandatory recounts of voter-verified records for Federal, State, and local elections in 0.5 percent of jurisdictions in each State. The Election Assistance Commission will conduct these recounts immediately following each general election and publish the results.

The voting system manufacturer must document the chain of custody for software handling, ensure software is not transferred over the Internet, provide codes to the Commission, and maintain internal security procedures. The voting system manufacturer must meet internal security procedures required by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The amendment applies to voting systems used after the November 2004 general election. SEC. 8 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to repeal the exemption of the Election Assistance Commission from certain government contracting requirements. The amendment will apply to contracts entered into by the Commission after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 9 states that the amendments made by this Act will take effect as if included in the original enactment of the Help America Vote Act of 2002."
