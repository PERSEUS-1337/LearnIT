    "content": "The Act titled \"Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing Act of 2009\" establishes rules on transparency of ticket marketing, distribution, and pricing by primary ticket sellers. The Federal Trade Commission must create rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment regarding the sale, distribution, and pricing of tickets. These rules include requirements for primary ticket sellers to disclose the total number of tickets available for sale at least 7 days before the sale date and to make public the total number and distribution method of tickets not available to the general public. The Act requires primary ticket sellers to disclose distribution methods, sale dates, ticket prices, ancillary charges, and refund policies to the general public. SEC. 3. RULES FOR SECONDARY TICKET SELLERS. The Federal Trade Commission must establish rules within 180 days of this Act for secondary ticket sellers, including requirements for clear statements and refund procedures if tickets do not match the description. The Act imposes restrictions on secondary ticket sellers, including a 48-hour prohibition on purchasing tickets after they are first available for primary sale. Sellers must disclose ticket details such as distribution method, face value, and seat location when offering tickets for resale. The Act requires secondary ticket sellers to provide details such as seat location, purchase date, and a unique identifier for the ticket. Online resale marketplaces must display a notice for secondary ticket sales and users must confirm reading it before proceeding with a transaction. The Act prohibits ticket resale at a higher price than face value by employees of venues, ticket sellers, artists, or online marketplaces. It also mandates online resale marketplaces to disclose if the seller is associated with the event. SEC. 4. REGISTRATION OF SECONDARY TICKET SELLERS AND ONLINE RESALE MARKETPLACES. Beginning on the date of final regulations, secondary ticket sellers and online resale marketplaces must register with the Federal Trade Commission by providing contact information such as a street address, telephone number, and email address. Secondary ticket sellers and online resale marketplaces must register with the Federal Trade Commission and provide accurate information annually. The FTC assigns a unique number to each registered seller or marketplace. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. The Federal Trade Commission and State Attorneys General have the authority to enforce violations of rules and practices that are deemed unfair or deceptive. State Attorneys General can take action if the residents of their state are affected by such violations. The State, as parens patriae, may bring a civil action on behalf of residents to enjoin, enforce compliance, obtain damages, penalties, and other relief for violations of rules. Notice must be served to the Commission at least 60 days prior to initiating the civil action. The State can bring a civil action on behalf of residents to enforce compliance for violations of rules. The Commission must be notified at least 60 days before initiating the action. The Commission can intervene in the civil action, be heard on all matters, remove the action to the appropriate court, and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general of a State can still exercise their authority. The attorney general of a State can conduct investigations, administer oaths, compel witnesses, and produce evidence. They can proceed in State or Federal court for violations of civil or criminal statutes. Venue for civil actions is where the defendant is found, resides, or does business, or as per section 1391 of title 28, United States. Proper venue for civil actions can be determined under section 1391 of title 28, United States Code. Process serving can be done without territorial limits, and individuals involved in alleged violations can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. The FTC can take preemptive action when a civil or administrative action is initiated for rule violations, preventing states from filing similar actions during the proceedings. The Commission can initiate civil actions against defendants for rule violations. States can recover costs and attorney fees if they prevail in such actions. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"ancillary charges\" (additional fees not included in ticket price), \"base price\" (ticket price excluding ancillary charges), \"box office\" (physical ticket sale location), \"bundled series tickets\" (ticket packages for multiple events), and \"distribution method\" (how tickets are sold). The term \"face value\" refers to the total price of a ticket, including base price and any additional charges. \"Primary sale\" means the initial sale of a ticket to the general public by a primary ticket seller. The term \"primary ticket seller\" includes venue owners, event managers, or ticketing service providers who engage in the primary sale of tickets. The term \"secondary ticket seller\" refers to a person who resells tickets for an event at a premium above face value, excluding individuals who resell fewer than 25 tickets. An individual reselling fewer than 25 tickets during any 1-year period is excluded from being classified as a secondary ticket seller. SEC. 7. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not override state or local laws on ticket resale and pricing, unless they conflict with this Act or provide less consumer protection."
