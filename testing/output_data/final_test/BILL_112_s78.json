    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Pregnant Women and Children From Perchlorate Act of 2011\" aims to address the findings and purposes outlined in the legislation. Congress finds that perchlorate, a chemical used in rocket propellant and other applications, is increasingly contaminating soil and water. Perchlorate has been detected at nearly 400 sites in the US, with levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts per billion. The EPA does not centrally track perchlorate detections or status. Perchlorate contamination is widespread in the US, with detections in 35 States and the District of Columbia. It has contaminated 153 public water systems in 26 States. Data likely underestimate total exposure, with California alone affected by 273 drinking water sources and 86 systems. Perchlorate has also been detected by FDA scientists in the US. Perchlorate has been found in the US food supply, including lettuce, milk, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and spinach, as well as in human breast milk. It can harm human health, especially in pregnant women and children, by interfering with iodide uptake by the thyroid gland, affecting hormone production crucial for health and development. Thyroid function is essential for regulating metabolism in adults and ensuring proper mental and physical development in children. Impairment of thyroid function in expectant mothers or infants can lead to delayed development and decreased learning capability. In October 2006, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that low levels of perchlorate exposure in women with low iodine levels can lead to significant changes in thyroid hormones. About 36 percent of women in the US have iodine levels similar to those in the study. The Environmental Protection Agency has not set a health advisory for perchlorate in drinking water. The Act criticizes the EPA's Drinking Water Equivalent Level of 24.5 parts per billion for perchlorate, citing concerns about exposure routes, impact on vulnerable populations, and reliance on outdated studies. The Act aims to establish a health advisory and national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate, ensuring protection for pregnant women, infants, and children. The Act aims to establish a health advisory and national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate, fully protecting pregnant women, infants, and children by considering body weight, exposure patterns, and all routes of exposure. The Act establishes a national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate. Section 1412(b)(12) of the Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a health advisory for perchlorate that is fully protective of vulnerable populations within 90 days of enactment. The Administrator must propose and finalize a national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate within specific timeframes to ensure protection of vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, infants, and children. The Administrator must propose and finalize a national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate with a maximum contaminant level goal that is as protective of vulnerable persons as feasible."
