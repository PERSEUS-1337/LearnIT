The Clean Renewable Energy Bond and Qualified Project definitions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are amended to adjust the requirements for net proceeds and qualified projects. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to adjust requirements for net proceeds and qualified projects, including determining incremental hydropower production based on Federal Energy Regulatory Commission standards for qualified borrowers. Non-hydropower production facilities do not need to be licensed by the Federal Energy Regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must license facilities that meet licensing requirements. Clean renewable energy bond proceeds can reimburse qualified borrowers for expenses incurred after the enactment of this section. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the tax code related to clean renewable energy bonds. Amendments include changes in use treatment, maximum term adjustments, repeal of limitations on bond amounts, and special rules on expenditures. Amendments to the tax code related to clean renewable energy bonds include adjustments to net proceeds percentages, time periods, and special rules on arbitrage.

The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the tax code related to clean renewable energy bonds, including the definition of \"net proceeds\" and the repeal of the ratable principal amortization requirement. It also introduces a new definition for \"public power entity\" as a State utility with a service obligation under the Federal Power Act. The curr_chunk introduces limitations on the amount in reserve or replacement funds for clean renewable energy bonds and special rules allowing separation of ownership and entitlement to the credit. The credit under this section is allowed to the person holding the instrument evidencing the entitlement, not the bond holder. The credit from holding a qualified energy tax credit bond is treated as a payment of estimated tax. Unused credits can be carried back or forward if they exceed the limitation. The credit from holding a qualified energy tax credit bond can be applied if the sum exceeds the limitation, with rules similar to section 39. Section 54 of the Code is amended for termination and clerical redesignations, effective for obligations issued after the enactment date."
