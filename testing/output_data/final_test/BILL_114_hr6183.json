    "content": "The \"Border Tax Equity Act of 2016\" is the short title of this Act. Congress finds that the United States relies on direct taxes while many countries use value-added taxes (VAT) in addition to direct taxes. VAT averages 15% worldwide and 21% in the EU. Direct taxes like corporate income taxes rebated upon export are seen as subsidies under WTO rules, while indirect taxes like sales taxes and VAT rebates are not considered subsidies. At present, there are no WTO rules on subsidies for trade in services. Some countries impose taxes on imported services and exempt or refund taxes on exported services, disadvantaging US service providers. This disparate treatment of border taxes harms US agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers by acting as export subsidies for foreign exporters and subjecting US exporters to double taxation. In the United States, exported products or services may face a border tax in the importing country, which includes indirect taxes. European Union governments paid VAT rebates of $91.9 billion on goods exported to the US in 2015, while collecting $28.7 billion in VAT-equivalent taxes on imported goods. For services, they paid $47.6 billion in VAT-equivalent taxes on services exported to the US and collected $36.3 billion in VAT-equivalent taxes on services. The United States businesses have complained about border tax inequity for over 45 years, with an estimated $36.3 billion in VAT-equivalent taxes on services imported from the US. Congress has recognized the prejudicial effect of disparate treatment of border taxes on goods and has sought a negotiated solution since 1968. Congress has declared a trade negotiating objective to revise WTO rules on border adjustments for internal taxes to address the disadvantage of countries relying on direct taxes over indirect taxes for revenue. Congress emphasizes the need to address and resolve the issue of border taxes during WTO negotiations to rectify the disadvantage faced by countries relying on direct taxes for revenue. Failure to revise rules on border taxes could hinder balanced trade relations with major trading partners. Effective action through legislation is necessary to address the massive distortions to trade that United States agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers face due to border taxes. SEC. 3. REPORTS ON RESULTS OF WTO NEGOTIATIONS TO REVISE WTO RULES REGARDING BORDER TAXES AND FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS. The United States Trade Representative must submit a report to Congress within 60 days after WTO negotiations, certifying if U.S. trade objectives on border tax treatment have been met. This includes revising WTO rules on border tax treatment for trade in goods. The WTO rules on border tax treatment for trade in goods and services aim to address the disadvantage faced by countries relying on direct taxes rather than indirect taxes. This includes adjustments at the border to redress the imbalance in trade. The United States aims to revise WTO rules on trade in services to prevent disparate treatment of border tax adjustments based on the nature of taxes. The US Trade Representative must report on free trade agreements related to border taxes within a year of this Act's enactment. The US Trade Representative must report to Congress on whether covered countries in trade agreements are addressing border tax treatment issues, specifically related to the revision of laws on border adjustments for internal taxes. The US Trade Representative must report to Congress on the revision of laws in covered countries regarding trade in services to address disparities in border tax treatment. The term \"covered country\" refers to a country that primarily relies on indirect taxes adjusted at the border instead of direct taxes that are not adjusted at the border. SEC. 4. Tax on imports from foreign countries with an indirect tax system. Subchapter E - Tax on Imports From Foreign Countries With An Indirect Tax System. Imposition of tax. Imposition of tax on imports from foreign countries with an indirect tax system, where the tax amount is based on the difference between rebated indirect taxes and those imposed at the US border. The tax is paid by the importer at the time of entry. The tax on imports is imposed at the time of entry and applies from a specified period until US trade negotiating objectives are met. It is collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and deposited into a special account for payments to qualified US exporters. The term 'importer' is defined for imports of goods. The term 'time of entry' is defined for imports of goods and services, specifying the required documentation and regulations for each. Foreign countries that use an indirect tax system can provide rebates on taxes paid for goods or services exported from their country. Value-added taxes (VAT) are a type of indirect general consumption tax levied on the value added to goods and services at different stages of production and supply chain. The curr_chunk discusses the regulations that the Secretary may prescribe for the goods and services tax (GST). It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of subchapters for subtitle D of chapter 36 of the tax code. SEC. 314. Payments to U.S. exporters to counteract discriminatory border taxes from importing countries. SEC. 314. Payments to U.S. exporters to counteract discriminatory border taxes from importing countries. Upon exportation of goods or services from the United States to a foreign country with indirect taxes on imports, the Secretary of the Treasury can pay the exporter an amount equal to the foreign country's taxes minus any U.S. taxes paid on the goods or services. The exporter must identify the foreign country's imposed indirect taxes in the request for payment. The exporter must identify and provide proof of payment for indirect taxes imposed by the importing foreign country within a reasonable period. Payments will be made from a special account authorized under the Internal Revenue Code. The requirement applies from a specified date until all trade negotiating objectives regarding border tax treatment are met. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury can prescribe rules and regulations to implement this section, which defines indirect tax systems and value-added taxes. The curr_chunk discusses an indirect tax imposed by the exporting country on the value added to goods and services in that country at various production stages, also known as a goods and services tax (GST). The curr_chunk specifies that if the United States Trade Representative does not certify to Congress by a certain date that trade negotiating objectives regarding border tax treatment have been met through WTO negotiations, then specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code and the Tariff Act will take effect 90 and 120 days after that date, respectively."
