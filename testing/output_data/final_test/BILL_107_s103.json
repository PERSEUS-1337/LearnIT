Congress finds that many students lack sufficient academic preparation in secondary school, leading to limited employment opportunities, high college dropout rates, and the need for remediation in college. There is a consensus on the importance of raising academic standards and modeling them after advanced placement programs, which are endorsed by education leaders and almost half of all states. The advanced placement program offers college-level courses in many secondary schools, with over 1,000,000 students participating. Test scores are accepted for college credit at numerous institutions worldwide. 24 states are funding programs to increase participation in advanced placement, including teacher professional development, required courses in some states, fee payment for tests, and public school mandates in others. The advanced placement program in secondary schools has over 1,000,000 students participating, with test scores accepted for college credit. 24 states are funding programs to increase participation, including teacher development and public school mandates. Some states require universities to grant academic credit for AP test scores of 3 or better, showing success in raising standards and increasing enrollment and achievement. The purpose is to encourage more students to take AP exams to demonstrate their achievements. The purpose of encouraging more students to take AP exams is to demonstrate their achievements, build on the benefits of advanced placement programs, support state and local efforts to raise academic standards, and increase the availability of schools offering AP programs. The aim is to increase access and diversity in advanced placement programs, particularly for low-income and disadvantaged students, as well as juniors at schools without AP courses. The goal is to increase access to advanced placement programs for juniors and seniors, aiming to have 25 percent of secondary school students participate. Additionally, the plan is to boost the number of students receiving advanced placement test scores that earn college credit and to increase the participation of low-income individuals by helping with test fees. The Secretary prioritizes funding for activities under section 10995F, distributing remaining funds with 70% for section 10995D and 30% for section 10995E. This includes grants for the Advanced Placement Program to increase student participation and access to college credit opportunities. The Secretary awards grants to eligible entities for authorized activities for a 3-year period, with annual payments. Eligible entities include State and local educational agencies. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. Priority in awarding grants under this section is given to eligible entities demonstrating a need for advanced placement programs, involvement of business and community organizations, availability of matching funds, focus on English, mathematics, and science programs, and targeting local educational agencies. An eligible entity may use grant funds to expand access for low-income individuals to advanced placement incentive programs, including teacher training, pre-advanced placement course development, curriculum coordination, development, and supplies. The eligible entity can use grant funds for curriculum development, books, supplies, and activities related to expanding access to advanced placement programs for low-income individuals. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary, and data on student participation in advanced placement courses and tests must be reported annually. The Secretary compiles and reports annually to Congress on information received from eligible entities regarding student participation in advanced placement courses and tests, including scores, and demographic data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, sex, English proficiency, and socioeconomic status. \"SEC. 10995E.

Grant funds can be used for curriculum, teacher training, and course materials, with agencies able to contract with organizations for course provision and support services. The Secretary awards grants to State educational agencies to reimburse low-income individuals for advanced placement test fees if they are enrolled in an AP class and plan to take the test. The grant amount is based on the number of eligible children in the State compared to other States. State educational agencies must disseminate information about advanced placement test fee payments to eligible individuals through teachers and counselors. To apply for a grant, the agency must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how they will use the funds to pay for test fees for low-income individuals. The State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary detailing how grant funds will be used to pay for advanced placement test fees for low-income individuals.
