    "content": "The Flexibility Incentive Grant Pilot Program is introduced in Section 1. The Flexibility Incentive Grant Pilot Program, established under Chapter 53 of title 49, provides incentives for States to generate new revenue for public transportation projects and allows flexibility in the use of existing transportation funds. States can apply for grants for fiscal years 2008-2011 by August 1 of the preceding year. An application for a grant under the Flexibility Incentive Grant Pilot Program must include the amount spent on public transportation projects by the State and counties in the previous two fiscal years. The Secretary will determine if there was an increase in spending by each State by September 1 of calendar years 2008 through 2011. The State and counties' expenditures on public transportation projects from the second fiscal year preceding September 1 to the first fiscal year preceding September 1, the amount of increase, and the percentage increase over the State's second preceding fiscal year. Grants for increased public transportation funding will be provided to States with a 10 percent or more increase in expenditures for public transportation projects. The grant amount for public transportation projects is determined by the increase in expenditures from the second preceding fiscal year to the first preceding fiscal year, excluding federal sources. States with a 10 percent or more increase in expenditures are eligible for the grant. For fiscal years 2008 through 2011, the Secretary will grant $50,000,000 to large states with a 1 percent or more increase in expenditures for public transportation projects and services compared to the preceding fiscal year, as long as the state's total expenditures were over $1,000,000,000 in the preceding year. For fiscal years 2008 through 2011, the Secretary will grant $10,000,000 to each State that established a new dedicated source of revenue for public transportation projects, resulting in a 10 percent increase in State funds available for such projects. The Secretary will grant $10,000,000 to each State that established a dedicated source of revenue for public transportation projects within 2 years. This may include State motor fuels tax, sales tax, interest on existing highway funds, motor vehicle excise tax, tolls, loans from highway funds, and other revenue sources determined by the Secretary. In the preceding fiscal year, the State amended laws to allow funds restricted for highways to be used for public transportation projects. States eligible for multiple grants must receive the grant for the highest amount they qualify for. States can use the grants for projects eligible under title 23 or chapter 53. Grant requirements apply unless stated otherwise. The Federal share of the cost of projects funded under this section is 100 percent. $250,000,000 is authorized for appropriations for fiscal years 2008 through 2011. Program evaluation is required within 5 years of the enactment date. The Secretary must conduct a study to evaluate the pilot program authorized by this section within 5 years of enactment. A report on the study results must be submitted to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \"5341. Flexibility incentive grant pilot program\""
