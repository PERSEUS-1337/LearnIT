    "content": "The \"Regulatory Improvement Act of 2000\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress acknowledges the importance of effective regulatory programs in protecting the environment, worker safety, and public health, despite the significant costs they impose. Improving the use of scientific and economic analysis by Federal agencies in developing regulations can enhance protections while minimizing costs. Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are valuable tools for informing regulatory decisions, but should not replace good judgment and values. Evaluation of costs and benefits should consider all relevant information in comparable terms. Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment should be transparent with analytical assumptions and uncertainties explained. The public has a right to know about regulation costs, risks addressed, and quality of analysis. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs should oversee regulatory activities for consistency. The Federal Government should improve cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment tools through research. The Federal Government aims to enhance cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment tools through research, as outlined in the regulatory impact analysis amendment to Chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code. The definitions under section 551 apply to this subchapter, including terms like 'benefit' and 'cost' referring to favorable and adverse effects, 'cost-benefit analysis' as comparing costs and benefits, and 'Director' as the head of the Office of Management and Budget. The term 'major rule' refers to a rule that may have a significant economic impact, adversely affect various aspects like the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, environment, public health, safety, or governments, and can be designated as such by the Director. The term 'quantified' means measured and expressed in. The term 'quantified' means measured and expressed in numerical terms. Regulatory impact analysis includes cost-benefit analyses of alternative rules complying with the statute, including those requiring no government action, voluntary programs, flexibility for small entities, and market-based mechanisms. The term 'risk assessment' refers to the systematic process of organizing hazard and exposure information to estimate potential risks, especially related to health, safety, or environmental concerns. The risk assessment process involves estimating harm to a population or resource, analyzing uncertainties, and identifying hazards and populations affected by the rule. It also assesses the relationship between exposure and harm addressed by the rule. The risk assessment process includes estimating harm, analyzing uncertainties, identifying hazards, and assessing exposure to determine the likelihood of harm. Substitution risk refers to potential harm to health, safety, or the environment. The regulatory impact analysis involves assessing the risk of harm to health, safety, or the environment resulting from the implementation of a rule. Agencies must prepare an initial analysis for major rules and include a summary in the notice of proposed rulemaking. When a final major rule is published or the comment period ends, the agency must prepare a final regulatory impact analysis addressing changes to the proposed rule, cost-benefit analysis, and significant comments received. The agency must consider significant comments received on the proposed rule and the initial regulatory impact analysis. SEC. 4. RISK BASED PRIORITIES STUDY. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will conduct a study with an accredited scientific institution to compare risks to human health, safety, and the environment, develop methodologies for comparative risk analysis, and make recommendations for setting priorities in risk reduction. The Director will conduct a study to compare risks to human health, safety, and the environment, with public participation. Results will inform agency budget and strategic plans within 4 years of enactment. The President must submit a report to Congress every 5 years recommending legislative changes to reduce risks to human health, safety, or the environment more effectively. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. This section introduces new subchapters for regulatory flexibility analysis and regulatory impact analysis in the United States Code. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will take effect 180 days after enactment, except for agency rules with a notice of proposed rule making published 60 days before enactment."
