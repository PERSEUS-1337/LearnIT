    "content": "The Act titled \"Platte River Recovery Implementation Program and Pathfinder Modification Authorization Act of 2006\" defines the purposes and implementation of the program, cost-sharing contributions, authority to modify the program, and authorization of appropriations. It also includes the authorization of the Pathfinder Modification Project and its authorized uses. The Act aims to authorize the continuation of the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program for endangered species without creating Federal water rights. It also includes the modification of the Pathfinder Dam and Reservoir. The Agreement refers to the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program Cooperative Agreement between the Governors of the States and the Secretary. The First Increment is the initial 13 years of the Program. The Governance Committee is composed of members from the States, Federal Government, environmental interests, and water users. Interest in land or water includes various arrangements necessary for implementing the Program. The Program includes various projects and activities such as planning, construction, habitat restoration, research, and program administration. The Secretary is responsible for determining necessary activities to carry out the Program. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation. The term \"States\" includes Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Governance Committee, may participate in the Program, carry out projects during the First Increment, enter agreements with entities, acquire interests in land without eminent domain, transfer acquired interests, and accept or provide grants. Cost-sharing contributions are also addressed. The States must contribute at least 50% of the total funds for the Program, with $30,000,000 in non-Federal funds required initially. Contributions can also be made in the form of water or land. In-kind contributions may be accepted by the Secretary or States for the Program. The Governance Committee approves contributions of goods or services as outlined in Attachment 1 of the Agreement. The Program can be modified or amended before completion of the First Increment if the Secretary and the States determine it aligns with the Program's purposes. No action under this title shall affect the acreage limitation provisions of reclamation laws, including not impacting district obligations to repay construction costs or reinstating acreage limitations once payments are complete. It also cannot increase construction repayment obligations, extending the period of acreage limitations. The text states that the provisions of the title do not create or grant Federal water rights. SEC. 106 authorizes $157,140,000 for projects, with adjustments for inflation. Any unspent funds will carry over for future use. SEC. 107 terminates the Secretary's authority for the First Increment by September 30, 2020. The Secretary of the Interior may modify the Pathfinder Dam and Reservoir in Wyoming without federal appropriations. The project is described in the Final Settlement Stipulation in Nebraska v. Wyoming. Authorized uses of the Pathfinder Reservoir are outlined. Authorized uses of the approximately 54,000 acre-feet capacity of Pathfinder Reservoir, which will be recaptured by the Project, include municipal, environmental, and other purposes as outlined in the Final Settlement Stipulation in Nebraska v. Wyoming."
