The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is amended to allow non-U.S. citizens to purchase voting interests in an air carrier under certain conditions set by the Secretary of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is amended to allow non-U.S. citizens to purchase voting interests in an air carrier under certain conditions set by the Secretary of Transportation. The conditions include that the majority of the air carrier's voting interests must be owned or controlled by U.S. citizens, and the purchase must be in the public interest. Factors considered for the public interest finding include the financial condition of the air carrier, the impact on employees, and competition in the industry. The Secretary of Transportation considers various factors when evaluating a non-U.S. citizen's purchase of an air carrier, including the impact on competition, foreign ownership laws, government subsidies, and ownership percentages. After evaluating a non-U.S. citizen's purchase of an air carrier, the United States or its possessions would have control over the carrier. The foreign country's aviation market access for U.S. citizens post-purchase must be equivalent. Interested parties must submit an application to the Secretary with required information for approval within 90 days. When an application meeting the requirements is submitted to the Secretary, they will approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove it. The President has the authority to review and either approve, disapprove, or impose conditions on the application based on national defense considerations. The Secretary's actions on purchase applications are subject to approval, conditions, or disapproval by the President within 30 days. Disapproved actions are null and void, while actions not disapproved within the time limit take effect as the Secretary's decision. The Secretary's actions on purchase applications are subject to approval, conditions, or disapproval by the President within 30 days. Disapproved actions are null and void, while actions not disapproved within the time limit take effect as the Secretary's decision. The Secretary, not the President, shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 1006 of this Act. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is amended to include a new section, Sec. 420, which addresses the reduction of U.S. citizenship voting interest ownership requirement. This section outlines the general rule, factors to consider for public interest finding, and the application process."
