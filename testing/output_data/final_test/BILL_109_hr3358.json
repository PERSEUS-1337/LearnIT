The Algiers Accords established the US-Iran Claims Tribunal but prevented the hostages from suing Iran. Despite this, the hostages filed a lawsuit in 2000. The District Court entered a default judgment against Iran in a class action lawsuit. The Department of State tried to vacate the decision, but Congress amended the law to allow the case to proceed, quashing the State Department's motion. Congress amended the law to allow a class action lawsuit against Iran to proceed, despite the State Department's attempt to vacate the default judgment. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit questioned the voluntary nature of agreements reached under the Algiers Accords, noting they were made \"at the point of a gun\". The Department of Justice affirmed to the Court that both Congress and the President have the authority to abrogate international obligations of the United States. STATEMENTS OF POLICY: The US seeks justice for victims of terrorism and holds terrorists accountable. US law supersedes agreements with Iran related to American hostages held from 1979 to 1981. Justice is sought for former American hostages in Iran. The Algiers Accords provisions barring US citizens from prosecuting claims in US courts are abrogated. A common fund is to be established for former American hostages in Iran and their survivors. A common fund is established to pay claims to American hostages in Iran and their families, funded by the liquidation of blocked assets related to Iran. A common fund is established to pay claims to American hostages in Iran and their families, funded by the liquidation of blocked assets related to Iran.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System determines the payment period for American hostages in Iran and their families."
