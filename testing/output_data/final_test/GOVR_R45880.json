    "content": "Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA, P.L. 95-604) to address environmental and public health concerns related to uranium mill tailing sites. Title I authorized federal financing for remediation of inactive sites, while Title II required commercial operators to fund decommissioning and stabilization activities for active sites. The federal government is responsible for managing Title I and Title II uranium mill sites after decommissioning. The Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management oversees 31 Title I sites and six Title II sites, conducting monitoring programs to prevent material release. Commercial operators still own 23 Title II sites under NRC regulation. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) requires site operators to operate under NRC or DOE licenses. Once decommissioning is complete, the license is transferred to DOE for federal management. UMTRCA does not regulate uranium mining or waste disposal, focusing on uranium milling to produce yellowcake uranium. Uranium milling operations involve physical and chemical processes to concentrate mineralized uranium ore into yellowcake uranium. Tailings, the waste material produced, are disposed of in settling ponds after the milling process. Yellowcake uranium is further converted and enriched for civilian nuclear power production. The milling process produces sand-like tailings material, with a large quantity relative to uranium concentrate. NRC estimates 2.4 pounds of yellowcake uranium oxide from 2,000 pounds of ore. Concerns about public health and the environment stem from historical operations and tailings disposal. EPA identifies health risks from uranium mill tailings, including lung cancer from radon gas diffusion, inhalation of radon gas, exposure to gamma radiation, and erosion of radioactive materials into the environment. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission funded uranium mining in the 1950s and 1960s for nuclear weapons and naval reactors. Wind and water erosion can release radioactive and other constituents from uranium tailings into surface and groundwater, posing long-term hazards. From 1947 to 1971, annual domestic uranium concentrate production in the United States ranged from 20 to 35 million pounds. The 1970s saw growth in the U.S. nuclear power industry, with 59 reactors connected to the grid. However, domestic uranium production decreased by 92% from 1978 to 1993. By 2000, only a few uranium mills and ISR facilities produced 4 million pounds of uranium concentrate, falling short of the anticipated growth in the industry. The civilian nuclear power industry in the U.S. did not grow as expected in 1978, leading to a decrease in domestic uranium production. The number of operational uranium mills was lower than anticipated, posing technical and regulatory challenges. Awareness of challenges in decommissioning and managing uranium mill tailings has increased since 1978. As of 2018, there was one uranium mill and six ISR facilities in operation. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 includes three titles, authorizing remediation efforts. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA; P.L. 95-604) includes three titles: Title I authorized remediation of uranium mill tailings inactive before 1978, Title II regulated commercial uranium mills after 1978, and Title III directed NRC to consult with New Mexico for mill tailings sites. DOE completed decommissioning for all Title I sites by 1998, except for Moab, UT. Title I does not cover sites operating after 1978, addressed under Title II. Title III provisions have been resolved to address environmental and health risks from residual radioactive material. Uranium mill sites operated from the mid-1940s to the 1970s to support federal nuclear programs. After contracts ended in the early 1970s, some mills closed without proper environmental remediation. Before 1978, federal agencies lacked authority to regulate mill tailings, leading to inadequate management. The Joint Position found that uranium mill tailings were used as construction material in civilian building projects, leading to environmental and public health risks. Congress appropriated funds for remedial action in contaminated sites near Grand Junction, CO in 1972. The 1972 Atomic Energy Commission Appropriation Authorization provided financial assistance to Colorado for remedial action on uranium mill tailings used in construction in Grand Junction. This legislation served as a template for the UMTRCA program, defining key terms and federal agencies involved in implementing it. The UMTRCA program, established in 1971, focused on remediation of off-site properties contaminated with residual radioactive materials from uranium mill tailings. Vicinity properties were either sites where tailings were used in construction or adjacent sites contaminated by wind dispersion. By 1999, DOE had remediated 5,300 vicinity properties, but its authority expired in 1998. Residual radioactive material is defined as radioactive waste in tailings from ore processing. The UMTRCA program focused on remediating off-site properties contaminated with residual radioactive materials from uranium mill tailings. Residual radioactive material, defined as radioactive waste in tailings from ore processing, was permanently isolated in engineered repositories to prevent environmental contamination. The repository is designed to stabilize residual radioactive material for 200 to 1,000 years at a disposal site, either at the original processing site or an alternative location. The distinction between a processing site and disposal site affects federal management obligations under UMTRCA, with DOE required to consult with EPA on site priorities but not bound by EPA's evaluations. DOE can proceed with remedial actions on lower priority sites as per UMTRCA. Site designations are not subject to judicial review. Section 102 lists 22 processing sites under Title I. DOE can enter into cooperative agreements with states for remedial actions at uranium mill tailing sites. Cooperative agreements require NRC concurrence and site owner liability release. Access for inspection and enforcement is authorized for DOE, NRC, and EPA at any site. UMTRCA authorizes DOE, NRC, and EPA access to sites for inspection and enforcement through cooperative agreements. It allows for agreements between DOE and Indian tribes for processing sites on Indian lands. In cases where remediation near streams is technically infeasible, agencies can determine alternative disposal sites to protect human health and the environment. Section 104 of UMTRCA allows the state, in cooperation with DOE, to purchase rights and transport tailings materials to an alternative disposal site. DOE constructed separate repositories for inactive uranium mill tailings, returning management of the original processing site to the state. The state has four options to manage the site and must provide documentation of remedial actions to future purchasers. DOE manages Title I disposal sites under a general NRC license and is authorized to obtain surface and subsurface mineral rights. Under UMTRCA, DOE is authorized to obtain surface and subsurface mineral rights for disposal sites to prevent disruption of stabilized tailings. BLM can sell or lease federal lands within disposal site boundaries, ensuring that stabilized radioactive materials are not disturbed by mineral development activities. Any disturbance requires the private operator to perform site remediation at no cost to the government. Section 106 of UMTRCA allows for the purchase of land for a consolidated disposal site, with restrictions on using certain types of lands. Congress recognized the need for cleanup responsibility among the federal government, states, and private operators, with the federal government proposed as the primary funder for cleanup programs. In drafting UMTRCA, Congress decided that the federal government should be responsible for most of the remedial action costs at Title I sites, with states sharing a portion of the costs. Section 107 establishes financial responsibilities, with the federal government covering 90% of remediation costs and states committing the remaining 10%. Processing sites on Indian lands are fully funded by the federal government under cooperative agreements. EPA is authorized by Congress to oversee these remedial actions. EPA was authorized by Congress to set health and environmental standards for uranium mill tailing sites under UMTRCA. DOE was directed to perform remedial actions according to these standards. Groundwater contamination issues persist at several sites, leading to the enactment of UMTRA in 1988 to address these concerns. UMTRA, enacted in 1988, extended DOE's authority for groundwater remediation at Title I sites. Title II of UMTRCA authorized regulation of commercial uranium mills, including land transfer to the federal government and financial arrangements with licensees. Section 201 amended the AEA to include mill tailings as byproduct material. UMTRCA Section 202 allows the federal government to retain byproduct material from uranium or thorium extraction for long-term management. States can choose to retain sites under long-term management, but none have done so. Any license producing byproduct material must meet NRC decommissioning standards, with the land transferred to federal management once decommissioning requirements are met. Unlike Title I sites, UMTRCA does not authorize DOE to perform remedial actions at Title II sites. Title I sites, UMTRCA does not authorize DOE to perform remedial actions at Title II sites under long-term federal management. Section 202 authorizes DOE, as the custodial agency, to \"carry out maintenance, monitoring, and emergency measures, but shall take no other action pursuant to such license, rule or order, with respect to such property and materials unless expressly authorized by Congress after the date of the enactment of this Act.\" NRC may exempt the requirement for long-term federal management prior to the termination of the license if long-term federal management is found \"not necessary or desirable to protect the public health, safety, or welfare or to minimize or eliminate danger to life or property.\" The process to transfer a Title II site from an NRC license to long-term federal management is described in regulation and guidance. For Title II sites transferring federal public lands to long-term federal management under DOE, \"DOE must apply to BLM for permanent. When transferring Title II sites to long-term federal management under DOE, DOE must apply to BLM for permanent withdrawal of federal land and minerals. The transfer is subject to NEPA review, involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, state, and local governments. DOE maintains regulatory jurisdiction over disposal sites, with recent interest in alternative land uses. A \"partial-jurisdiction\" regulatory structure has been proposed, with DOE regulating the repository and BLM leasing surface and subsurface rights for alternative uses. Section 205 of UMTRCA amended Section 84 of the AEA authorizing NRC as the principle federal regulator of Title II sites through issuance and enforcement of source and byproduct material licenses. NRC is directed to manage byproduct materials to protect public health and the environment from associated hazards. NRC can consider costs and other factors in establishing license conditions. NRC and agreement states ensure licensees comply with EPA standards. Section 206 of UMTRCA amended Section 275 of the AEA authorizing EPA to set regulations. EPA was authorized by UMTRCA to set generally applicable environmental and health standards, consistent with RCRA standards. These standards are not site-specific to allow flexibility in addressing surface and groundwater issues at various sites. EPA periodically revises these standards, with the final rule for Title II uranium mill tailings sites published in 1983. NRC determines compliance with decommissioning standards before transferring sites to federal management. Regulatory authority may be delegated to an agency by the NRC. The NRC may delegate regulatory authority to an agreement state for issuing and enforcing byproduct material licenses in compliance with NRC requirements. NRC retains oversight authority over agreement states, ensuring federal regulatory compliance. Four UMTRCA Title II sites are listed on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, authorizing remediation actions. Congress authorized DOE to implement remedial action programs under Title I and designated DOE as the federal agency responsible for long-term management of UMTRCA sites. DOE-LM, established in 2003, manages environmental contamination at UMTRCA sites associated with WWII and the Cold War. They oversee 19 Title I disposal sites, 12 Title I processing sites, and six Title II disposal sites. An additional 17 Title II disposal sites will be under their custody in the next decade. UMTRCA sites are in 12 states. NRC can make agreements with states to regulate uranium milling operations. The NRC oversees agreement state programs for radioactive material licenses, ensuring compliance with federal regulations. Congress intended decommissioning requirements to minimize long-term maintenance. NRC can enter financial arrangements with uranium mill licensees. The NRC oversees agreement state programs for radioactive material licenses, ensuring compliance with federal regulations. Congress intended decommissioning requirements to minimize long-term maintenance. NRC can enter financial arrangements with uranium mill licensees for short- and long-term bonding, surety, or other financial arrangements to cover decommissioning costs and long-term maintenance. Public health concerns focused on preventing exposure to radiological emissions and risks associated with radioactive tailings material. The UMTRCA addressed the dispersion of contaminants in groundwater at sites. DOE's surface remedial authority expired in 1998 for Title I sites, but they still manage groundwater remediation. The Moab processing site in Utah is the only Title I site not under federal management. Before UMTRCA, federal agencies had little authority over tailings regulation. Title I required engineered disposal sites to stabilize inactive uranium mill tailings piles. Agencies established engineered disposal sites to stabilize inactive uranium mill tailings for long-term management. DOE spent $2 billion on surface cleanup activities by 1994 and continues with groundwater remediation and monitoring at Title I sites. Private licensees decommission Title II sites, transferring them to DOE-LM for federal management. Six Title II sites have been transferred so far, with ongoing decommissioning for the rest. Groundwater, stabilization, and erosion issues persist at Title I sites. DOE-LM may face similar challenges at Title II disposal sites as seen at Title I sites, with issues like groundwater contamination, stabilization, and erosion management. Natural factors like wind erosion, rainfall, and droughts can deteriorate site integrity, leading to contaminant release. Vegetation helps stabilize tailings and reduce erosion, but annual monitoring and maintenance costs fluctuate due to climatic events. Uranium mill operations have caused groundwater contamination from various sources, necessitating ongoing remediation efforts. Groundwater contamination at UMTRCA sites has led to off-site migration of contaminants. DOE has used active and passive groundwater remediation methods, including pump-and-treat and natural flushing. Institutional controls are often applied in conjunction with remediation efforts. Institutional controls, such as alternative water sources, site restrictions, and monitoring programs, are implemented at UMTRCA sites to minimize risks from groundwater contamination. For example, at the Riverton, WY site, restrictions were put in place to limit residents' groundwater use. DOE administers long-term surveillance plans with detailed groundwater monitoring requirements as part of NRC general license obligations. Groundwater monitoring requirements at UMTRCA sites vary based on site classification. Title I sites allow DOE to perform groundwater remediation indefinitely, while Title II sites under long-term federal management only permit maintenance, monitoring, and emergency measures. Funding for Title II sites is contingent on congressional appropriations to prevent additional costly remedial actions. The Moab site, originally a Title II site under UMTRCA, was designated as a Title I site in 2000 by Congress. This transfer of ownership to DOE and federal government responsibility for decommissioning costs was enacted through the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act. Uranium mill tailings at the Moab site are situated on the north bank of the Colorado River, with DOE-EM overseeing remediation efforts. DOE-EM constructed a railway to transport uranium mill tailings from the Moab site on the north bank of the Colorado River to Crescent Junction, about 30 miles away. By December 2018, 59% of the 16 million tons of tailings had been transported, with a projected completion date of 2034. Costs incurred by DOE totaled $527 million by FY2018, with estimated total costs ranging from $1.186 billion to $1.197 billion. Funding for the project is allocated annually in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Site remediation costs and time frames have exceeded initial expectations due to evolving complexities and risks. The GAO reported in 1995 that DOE's surface remediation costs were $2.3 billion, exceeding 1982 estimates by $621 million. Long-term federal costs for managing disposal sites and groundwater contamination remain uncertain. Six Title II sites have been transferred to DOE-LM as of FY2019, with remaining licensees decommissioning and transferring their sites. UMTRCA directs agencies to apply decommissioning requirements stringently to minimize long-term monitoring and maintenance. DOE-LM manages Title II sites after transfer from NRC or state. DOE-LM manages Title II sites after transfer from NRC or state, with disagreements on decommissioning adequacy, long-term monitoring, and funding. Issues include proposed legislation, site-specific decommissioning, and financial assurance. Contaminated material is still being discovered and excavated at properties around Grand Junction, CO, where uranium mill tailings were used in construction. The Cheney disposal cell, located 15 miles southeast of Grand Junction, CO, was constructed by DOE in 1990 to accept residual radioactive material from the Grand Junction processing site and nearby properties contaminated by uranium tailings. DOE's authority to accept byproduct material at the Cheney disposal cell is set to expire by the end of FY2023 or when the cell reaches capacity. Legislation is needed to reauthorize DOE to operate the disposal cell beyond FY2023. The DOE plans to dispose of residual radioactive material from processing sites and byproduct material from vicinity sites in the Cheney disposal cell through FY2031. Legislation authorizes reimbursements to Title II licensees for remedial costs proportional to the quantity of byproduct material produced under federal contracts, funded by the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorizes reimbursements to Title II licensees for decommissioning federal uranium enrichment facilities. The 106th Congress recognized challenges in decommissioning, with $355 million reimbursed to 13 licensees from FY1994 to FY2018. DOE aims to avoid accumulating balances and liabilities by timely reimbursing approved claim balances. The DOE reimbursed $26 million to 13 licensees for approved but unpaid claims as of FY2018. The estimated remaining program liability was $99 million for eligible sites. Various issues have delayed the transfer of Title II sites to federal management. NRC regulates uranium mills and tailings for Title II sites to ensure thorough decommissioning. The transfer of remaining sites to DOE-LM is pending NRC's approval of completed decommissioning requirements. The NRC estimates specific dates for some Title II sites, while others are listed as \"to be determined.\" DOE-LM would be responsible for long-term federal management of Title II sites after completion of decommissioning and site transfer. Differences between DOE-LM and NRC exist regarding decommissioning adequacy, long-term monitoring requirements, and funding for maintenance costs. NRC is authorized to collect financial arrangements for decommissioning costs if licensees are unable to fulfill their obligations. UMTRCA does not authorize federal funding for decommissioning Title II sites. Licensees may lack financial resources to meet NRC's requirements, posing health and environmental risks from unreclaimed sites. DOE-LM manages Title II sites post-decommissioning, with differences in decommissioning adequacy and funding. NRC can collect financial arrangements if licensees fail to fulfill obligations. UMTRCA authorized federal funding for long-term monitoring and maintenance costs at Title I sites, while Title II sites require licensees to cover costs through a one-time surveillance charge. DOE-LM has different remediation authorities for Title I and Title II sites under long-term federal management. Title I sites allow for indefinite groundwater remediation, recognizing ongoing challenges post-decommissioning, while Title II sites do not fall under DOE-LM's remedial authority. DOE-LM is authorized to perform monitoring, maintenance, and emergency measures at Title II sites under long-term federal management. Funding for Title I sites is provided through DOE annual appropriations, while DOE-EM administers remediation at the Moab site in Utah with funding from the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The DOE-LM oversees over 100 sites contaminated by radiological, chemical, and hazardous wastes. Annual expenditures vary depending on factors like groundwater remediation and disposal site maintenance. Funding for DOE-LM is presented as a single line-item in annual budget requests and appropriations bills. Total expenditures at different disposal sites range from $110,000 to $13.96 million per year. Funding for long-term federal management costs by site or for the site inventory as a whole is not specified in annual budget justifications or appropriations bills. The DOE-LM oversees 100+ contaminated sites from nuclear weapons production. Congress allocated $159 million for DOE-LM in 2019. NRC collects a one-time LTSC fee from licensees for long-term federal management costs. The one-time LTSC fee collected by NRC from licensees is deposited into the U.S. Treasury's General Fund. The fee was justified in 1980 based on an assumption of $2,500 per year for long-term monitoring costs at UMTRCA Title II sites. Licensees are required to pay a minimum one-time LTSC fee of $250,000, adjusted for inflation. NRC has not revised this fee since 1985, but allows for increases if necessary. UMTRCA does not authorize additional fees once the license is transferred to DOE-LM. The adequacy of the LTSC to cover DOE's long-term maintenance and monitoring costs has been a concern. In 2014, the DOE Office of Inspector General found that DOE-LM had spent $4.25 million at six Title II sites, while LTSC fees only amounted to $0.148 million. If LTSC fees are insufficient, DOE-LM would need to use annual appropriations for long-term management responsibilities. The IG report highlights concerns about the adequacy of LTSC fees to cover DOE's long-term maintenance costs for UMTRCA sites. Limited information is available on DOE-LM's monitoring and maintenance costs at these sites. Congress may need to address issues related to decommissioning and funding for completion at certain sites once transferred to DOE-LM. The adequacy of funding for decommissioning at certain sites and long-term surveillance charges for future management needs is a concern highlighted in the IG report. Congress may need to address issues related to funding for completion at sites transferred to DOE-LM."
