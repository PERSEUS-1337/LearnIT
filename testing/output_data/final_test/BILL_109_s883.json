    "content": "The Act titled \"Climate Change Technology Deployment in Developing Countries Act of 2005\" is adding a new section to the Global Environmental Protection Assistance Act of 1989, focusing on technology deployment in developing countries. The Act \"Climate Change Technology Deployment in Developing Countries Act of 2005\" defines key terms like carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas, and greenhouse gas intensity. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity. The Department of State is the lead agency for integrating the goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity in developing countries into US foreign policy. The Secretary of State must submit reports on the top 25 energy-using developing countries, detailing their energy usage and greenhouse gas intensity. The Secretary of State must submit reports on the top 25 energy-using developing countries, detailing their energy usage and greenhouse gas intensity. The reports should include information on progress, potential projects, and obstacles to reducing greenhouse gas intensity. The initial report will be used to establish baselines for developing countries. The Secretary of State will track developing countries' progress in reducing greenhouse gas intensity using annual reports. Assistance will be provided for projects to reduce greenhouse gas intensity through bilateral agreements. The Secretary of State aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, increase private investment in related projects, and expedite technology deployment. Focus will be on promoting rule of law, property rights, and economic freedom, as well as increasing capacity and infrastructure. Priority will be given to projects in developing countries. The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, will conduct an inventory of greenhouse gas reducing technologies for developing countries. A report will be submitted to Congress within 180 days, including results and obstacles to technology deployment. Trade-related barriers to exporting these technologies will also be addressed. The United States Trade Representative must identify and negotiate the removal of trade-related barriers to exporting greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies from the US within 180 days of enactment. An interagency working group is established to promote the export of greenhouse gas intensity reducing technologies from the US, identify priority countries for exporting these technologies, address barriers to adoption, and learn from past energy technology export efforts. The group is led by the Secretary of State. The interagency working group, led by the Secretary of State, includes the Administrator of USAID, the US Trade Representative, a designee of the Secretary of Energy, and a designee of the Secretary of Commerce. They conduct performance reviews of actions taken to promote the export of greenhouse gas reducing technologies from the US and submit reports annually. The interagency working group, led by the Secretary of State, conducts performance reviews and submits reports annually on promoting the export of greenhouse gas reducing technologies from the US. They also submit a report to Congress describing the results of the performance reviews and evaluating progress in promoting the export of these technologies, along with any recommendations for increasing exports. SEC. 736 outlines the Technology Strategic Plan and Demonstration Projects. The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, will develop a technology strategic plan and carry out demonstration projects to reduce greenhouse gas intensity in developing countries. Demonstration projects will be conducted in at least 10 eligible countries determined by the Secretaries and the Administrator. Eligibility is based on a country's commitment to just and democratic governance. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of promoting just and democratic governance, including political pluralism, human rights, and combating corruption. It also highlights the need for economic freedom through policies that encourage global trade, private sector growth, and sustainable resource management. The curr_chunk focuses on selecting eligible countries for funding based on criteria like meeting eligibility standards, reducing greenhouse gas intensity, and promoting economic growth. It also mentions types of projects that may be included, such as coal gasification and liquefaction. The curr_chunk outlines eligible projects for funding, including coal gasification, liquefaction, carbon sequestration, cogeneration, renewables, and lower emission transportation. The Secretary of State, in coordination with other agencies, will implement fellowship and exchange programs for officials from developing countries to learn about reducing greenhouse gas intensity. Appropriations are authorized for this program, effective October 1, 2005, and it will terminate on December 31, 2010."
