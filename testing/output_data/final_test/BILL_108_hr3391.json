The Act, titled the \"Provo River Project Transfer Act,\" defines key terms such as Agreement, Association, District, and Pleasant Grove Property. The United States acquired a 3.79-acre parcel of land for the Provo River Project, Deer Creek Division in Pleasant Grove, Utah. The \"Pleasant Grove Property\" includes an office building and shop complex. The \"Provo Reservoir Canal\" refers to the canal and associated facilities from the Murdock Diversion Dam to the Provo Reservoir Canal Siphon and Penstock. The Salt Lake Aqueduct, part of the Provo River Project, extends from Deer Creek Dam to Terminal Reservoirs in Salt Lake City. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and the State refers to Utah. SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF LAND AND FACILITIES. The Secretary shall convey the Provo Reservoir Canal to the Association, subject to conditions outlined in the Agreement, including future arrangements for operation and ownership. Additionally, the Secretary will convey Pleasant Grove property according to the Agreement's terms. The Secretary will convey the Pleasant Grove Property to the Association and the Salt Lake Aqueduct to the District, including granting permanent easements to certain lands. The United States will convey easements for the use, operation, maintenance, repair, and improvement of the Salt Lake Aqueduct by the District on non-Federal land authorized under Public Law 107-329. The boundaries of the easements will be determined by the Secretary in consultation with the District and the Secretary of Agriculture, with a limitation on activities that could interfere with the aqueduct. The Secretary will transfer administrative jurisdiction over the land to the Secretary of Agriculture upon conveyance of the easement. The land will be administered as an administrative site by the Secretary of Agriculture. Easements will be administered in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. In exchange for the conveyance of the easement, the Association will pay the Secretary an amount equal to the remaining debt obligation of the United States for the Provo Reservoir Canal and past revenues from the canal. The Provo Reservoir Canal conveyance would prevent funds from being deposited in the reclamation fund established under the Act of June 17, 1902. The Association may deduct sums for reimbursement in determining net present values. The District must pay the Secretary for the remaining debt obligation and revenues from the Salt Lake Aqueduct. The Salt Lake Aqueduct conveyance would have provided funds to the United States, which would be deposited in the reclamation fund as per the terms of the Act of June 17, 1902. In determining net present values, the District can deduct sums for reimbursement. The Association and District must pay the Secretary for administrative costs and compliance with environmental laws. Before conveying land and facilities, the Secretary must comply with Federal cultural resource laws, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act. This Act does not alter any obligations under these laws. SEC. 4. EXISTING CONTRACTS. The Deer Creek Division Construction Contract and Provo River Project contracts will continue to be operated and maintained by the Association as per existing agreements. Any written contracts related to the Provo River Project or Jordan Aqueduct System are confirmed. The Provo River Project and Jordan Aqueduct System contracts are valid and enforceable by the United States. Entities with existing capacity rights can use them to transport Central Utah Project water with authorization from the Central Utah Water Conservancy District. The Central Utah Water Conservancy District authorizes the use of water facilities for transporting Central Utah Project water, with modifications to the 1936 Repayment Contract for the Deer Creek Division of the Provo River Project. This should not impair existing environmental commitments or require additional water releases. The Central Utah Water Conservancy District authorizes modifications to the 1936 Repayment Contract for the Deer Creek Division of the Provo River Project, including partial prepayment, annual repayment adjustment, and transfer of facilities. Additionally, the 1938 Repayment Contract for the Aqueduct Division will be modified or terminated to reflect complete payout and transfer of all facilities. This Act does not affect existing contracts allowing water conveyance through the Provo Reservoir Canal. SEC. 5. EFFECT OF CONVEYANCE.\n\nUpon conveyance of land or facility under section 3, it will no longer be part of a Federal reclamation project. The Association and District will not receive future reclamation benefits, except for nonreclamation benefits. The United States will not be liable for damages, except for negligence before conveyance.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORT. SEC. 6. REPORT.\n\nIf a conveyance required under section 3 is not completed within 18 months, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing the conveyance status, obstacles, and anticipated completion date."
