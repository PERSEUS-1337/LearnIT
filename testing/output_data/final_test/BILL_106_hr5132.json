    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C Health Care Act\" establishes a comprehensive hepatitis C health care testing and treatment program for veterans. The \"Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C Health Care Act\" mandates Hepatitis C testing for veterans, with priority given to those who served during the Vietnam era and those with risk factors for the virus. The \"Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C Health Care Act\" mandates testing for Hepatitis C in veterans with risk factors or those who request it. If a veteran tests positive, the Secretary must provide treatment without regard to service connection or priority group. Additionally, the Secretary must offer a liver biopsy and genotype test upon request before treatment. The Secretary must ensure each Department medical center has specialists for Hepatitis C testing and treatment coordination. Increased training options for healthcare personnel are provided to improve treatment for veterans with Hepatitis C. The table of sections in the chapter is amended to include a new item after section 1720E. SEC. 3. Funding for Hepatitis C programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Beginning in fiscal year 2001, funds for Hepatitis C detection and treatment by the Department of Veterans Affairs will be allocated through the \"Medical Care\" account's \"Specific Purpose\" subaccount. The allocation of funds to Veterans Integrated Service Networks will be based on Hepatitis C incidence rates among veterans in each network. These funds cannot be used for any other purpose. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a standardized policy for Hepatitis C within the VA health care system, including testing, treatment, education, and notification. Veterans who have not been tested will be notified annually. Additionally, there will be the creation of Hepatitis C Centers of Excellence. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish Hepatitis C Centers of Excellence at VA medical centers in regions with high Hepatitis C case rates in fiscal year 1999. Funding for these centers will be provided separately from existing Hepatitis C allocations."
