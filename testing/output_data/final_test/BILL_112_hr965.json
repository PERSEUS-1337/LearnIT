The Congress finds that antibiotic resistance is a growing menace to public health, with treatments for common infections becoming limited and expensive. This resistance may impair the ability of the United States to respond to terrorist attacks involving bacteria. The Congress recognizes the threat of antibiotic resistance to public health and the ability of the United States to respond to bacterial terrorist attacks. Steps have been taken to curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine, but agriculture remains unaddressed. The National Academy of Sciences reported in March 2003 on the decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine. In 2010, the FDA found that 80% of antibacterial drugs in the US were used on food animals, not for human health. Efforts are needed to reduce inappropriate overuse in animals and agriculture. Large-scale surveys by the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in 1999, 2001, and 2006 found that a high percentage of livestock farms administer antimicrobials for health or growth promotion, many of which are similar to drugs used in human medicine. These drugs are used to treat serious diseases in humans such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, and skin infections. The nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural animals contributes to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people. A report by experts recommended that antimicrobial agents should no longer be used in agriculture. The United States Geological Survey found antibiotics in 48% of streams tested, with many downstream from agricultural operations. A study linked antibiotic use in animals to resistant strains of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli. The use of antibiotics in animals has been linked to increased resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter infections, leading to more severe illnesses and deaths. A study in 2010 showed that low-dosage antibiotics can cause genetic mutations, raising concerns about their use in agriculture for growth promotion. Consumer Reports found high levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in poultry products in 2003. The FDA's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System finds antibiotic-resistant bacteria in retail meat products. The USDA linked antimicrobial drug use in animals to MRSA infections in humans. Calls for a ban on nontherapeutic use of medically important antibiotics in animals have been made. The National Academy of Sciences highlighted the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 1998. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cost the United States $4-5 billion annually. In 2009, healthcare costs for these infections were estimated at $16.6-26 billion. Over 300 organizations support legislation to phase out nontherapeutic antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2010, the Danish ban on non-therapeutic antibiotic use in food animal production led to a significant decrease in antimicrobial resistance in various bacterial species. Overseas restrictions on antimicrobial drugs in livestock production could impact U.S. export markets for livestock and poultry. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act mandates drug safety approval and places the responsibility on manufacturers to prove safety. The Food and Drug Administration has modified the antibiotic approval process to consider resistant bacteria as a safety concern. Existing approvals for antibiotics used in animal production for nontherapeutic purposes have not been reviewed. Certain non-routine antibiotic uses in animal agriculture are legitimate for disease prevention. Federal agencies lack critical data on antibiotic use in animals. The FDA has updated antibiotic approval process to address resistant bacteria. Approvals for nontherapeutic antibiotic use in animal production have not been reviewed. Certain antibiotic uses for disease prevention in animal agriculture are legitimate. Federal agencies lack crucial data on antibiotic use in animals and recommend developing a plan to collect this data. The Act aims to preserve the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics by reviewing the safety of certain antibiotics used in food-producing animals. It also focuses on proving the safety of critical antimicrobial animal drugs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a critical antimicrobial animal drug as a drug intended for use in food-producing animals composed of specific types of antibiotics or their derivatives used in humans. Nontherapeutic use refers to using the drug as a feed or water additive for animals. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a critical antimicrobial animal drug as a drug intended for use in food-producing animals composed of specific types of antibiotics or their derivatives used in humans. Nontherapeutic use refers to using the drug as a feed or water additive for animals for growth promotion, feed efficiency, weight gain, routine disease prevention, or other routine purposes. Amendments to the Act require applicants to demonstrate the reasonable effectiveness of critical antimicrobial animal drugs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines critical antimicrobial animal drugs for food-producing animals. Nontherapeutic use involves using the drug for growth promotion, feed efficiency, and routine disease prevention. Amendments require demonstrating drug effectiveness. Amendments also address phased elimination of nontherapeutic drug use in animals important for human health. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines critical antimicrobial animal drugs for food-producing animals. Nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals of a critical antimicrobial animal drug or one of the same chemical class must have approval or exemption under specific sections. The approval for nontherapeutic use will be withdrawn after 2 years unless certain conditions are met. The Secretary can make a final determination that there is no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance due to nontherapeutic drug use before a specified date. The Secretary may grant exemptions for critical antimicrobial animal drugs, leading to the rescinding of approvals for nontherapeutic drug use in food-producing animals within 2 years. Applications for critical antimicrobial animal drugs must be submitted to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary may rescind approvals for nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals within 2 years of application submission, unless a final determination of no harm to human health is made before the rescind date. The Secretary may rescind approvals for nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals within 2 years if there is a risk of harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance. Committee hearings will be held to discuss the implementation of rescinding approvals for nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals within 2 years if there is a risk of harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance. The House and Senate committees will hold hearings on the implementation of section 512(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The rulemaking authority of the House and Senate will be exercised, with recognition of their constitutional right to change rules related to the procedure. The House and Senate committees will hold hearings on the implementation of section 512(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with the rulemaking authority being exercised in the same manner as any other rule of the House or Senate."
