    "content": "H.R. 4007, passed by the House, incorporates existing statutory authority with some amendments. It creates a new title, Title XXI, for Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, without a statutory termination date. Appropriations are authorized for three years. H.R. 4007, passed by the House, authorizes appropriations for three years and adds responsibilities to the Secretary of Homeland Security, including outreach to chemical facilities, assistance to small facilities, and reporting on program performance. It also modifies the Secretary's discretion in various areas, maintaining criteria for risk-based performance standards but limiting discretion in accepting alternative security programs and personnel surety. H.R. 4007, passed by the House, authorizes appropriations for three years and adds responsibilities to the Secretary of Homeland Security. It modifies the Secretary's discretion in various areas, including personnel surety, and expands the Secretary's authority to high-risk facilities. Some experts argue that modifying the Secretary's discretion may impact regulatory efficiency, while others believe further modifications are needed to align with congressional intent. H.R. 4007, passed by the House, contains amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, creating a new title called Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. Section 2101 establishes a Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program. The House passed H.R. 4007, which includes amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, creating the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program. This program establishes risk-based performance standards to protect chemical facilities from terrorism and security risks. Chemical facilities of interest and covered chemical facilities must submit security assessments and implement security plans. The Secretary will issue regulations for high-risk chemical facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement site security plans. This will expand the current requirements to more facilities than under the existing CFATS regulation. Approximately 36,000 facilities possess a chemical of interest above a screening threshold quantity, with DHS regulating around 4,000 as high risk. The new title requires facilities to submit vulnerability assessments and site security plans. Facilities can use layered security measures in their plans to address security vulnerabilities. Approval and disapproval of site security plans are outlined in the new title, with the Secretary reviewing and approving each plan. The new title allows the Secretary to approve alternative security programs that meet risk-based performance standards for chemical facilities. This provision also permits facilities to use an alternative security program approved by the Secretary to satisfy the site security plan requirement. The new title allows the Secretary to approve alternative security programs for chemical facilities to meet site security planning requirements. It also requires the Secretary to use risk assessment policies when approving site security plans, without requiring resubmission for facilities approved before the new title enactment. Additionally, DHS can consult with GAO on third-party accreditation program applicability. Subsection 2101(d) addresses compliance with provisions on audits and inspections. The new title allows the Secretary to approve alternative security programs for chemical facilities and use risk assessment policies for site security planning. It also allows the use of non-DHS and nongovernmental inspectors for audits and inspections, with prescribed standards for training and retraining. Stakeholders have expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest and disclosure of facility business. Some stakeholders raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and disclosure of facility business information. There were also discussions about the use of third-party inspectors by DHS and the need for establishing qualifications and standards for them. The authorization for DHS to set standards for non-DHS inspectors in Subsection 2101(d) could address these concerns. Subsection 2101(d) addresses noncompliance by a covered chemical facility, requiring written notification of deficiencies, consultation, and an order to comply by a specified date. If noncompliance persists, the Secretary can order the facility to cease operation. Written notification must occur within 14 days of noncompliance, consultation is with the Secretary or designee, and a cease operation order can only be issued if noncompliance continues after the specified date. The existing statute requires written notification and identification of an opportunity for consultation in case of noncompliance by a covered chemical facility. It does not limit the Secretary's ability to issue a cease operation order if noncompliance persists. A new provision addresses personnel surety, establishing a program for vetting individuals and providing redress for inaccuracies in submitted information. Covered facilities can use federal screening programs to meet personnel surety requirements. The proposed legislation aims to enhance personnel surety at covered chemical facilities by requiring vetting under the DHS program or identification as a security risk. It also mandates the development of a common credential and annual progress reports. The use of federal screening programs for personnel surety has been a contentious issue. The DHS requires credentials vetted against the terrorist screening database and verified regularly. They do not accept other personnel surety programs. The fourth provision prohibits the Secretary from requiring facility information unless vetted under the DHS program or identified as a security risk. Facilities must submit information on personnel with access to regulated areas. The fifth provision would require the Secretary to share necessary information with the owner or operator of a covered chemical facility to comply with Section 2101, raising questions about information protection and sharing protocols. The Secretary is required to share information with owners or operators of chemical facilities. Subsection 2101(e) outlines the Secretary's responsibilities, including identifying chemical facilities of interest, conducting risk assessments, and adjusting facility tiering. These provisions are not found in existing statutory authority. The Secretary is mandated to identify chemical facilities of interest and develop a risk assessment approach incorporating threat, vulnerability, and consequence elements. Records must be maintained for facilities no longer subject to regulatory requirements due to a change in risk tier. The new title would define terms related to chemical facilities, exempting certain facilities from regulation. A \"covered chemical facility\" is defined as a facility meeting security risk criteria, excluding specific types of facilities. A \"chemical facility of interest\" holds certain chemicals above a specified quantity determined by the Secretary. The new title defines terms related to chemical facilities, exempting certain facilities from regulation. Facilities exempt from the definition of \"covered chemical facility\" may still have to meet requirements for \"chemical facilities of interest.\" Section 2102 addresses protection and sharing of information. The new title includes provisions to protect and share information related to chemical facilities. Subsection 2102 establishes guidelines for information disclosure, sharing with state and local officials, and enforcement proceedings. These provisions are similar to existing statutory authority under MTSA and form the basis for DHS's designation of Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information (CVI). Subsection 2102(d) of the new title limits the applicability of information sharing under this section, rather than the entire title. It requires the Secretary to provide necessary information to first responders at chemical facilities for incident response. This information must be shared with fusion centers through the Homeland Security Information Network. Section 2103 of the new title includes provisions on civil penalties, with a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day of violation. Subsection 2103(b) denies the right of action to enforce provisions against owners or operators, except the Secretary. Section 2104 requires the Secretary to publish whistleblower protections for individuals providing information about covered chemical facilities. Section 2105 of the new title addresses the relationship of the new title to other laws, affirming that it does not supersede federal laws regulating chemical substances. It also allows states to establish more stringent requirements for chemical facilities unless there is an actual conflict. The new title, Section 2105(c), requires coordination with TSA to eliminate duplicate rail security measures and clarifies TSA regulations prevail in case of conflict. It exempts certain rail facilities from submitting Top-Screen information, creating a statutory exemption from CFATS regulation. Section 2106 of the new title introduces reporting requirements not present in current statutory authority. It mandates the Secretary to submit a report to Congress within 18 months, certifying progress in identifying chemical facilities, outlining steps taken, metrics used, and a risk assessment approach. The Secretary has developed a risk assessment approach and tiering methodology as directed by Section 2101 of the new title. The Comptroller General will submit reports to Congress every six months assessing the act's implementation. Section 2107 authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to implement the new title. Section 2107 of the new title authorizes the Secretary to promulgate or amend CFATS regulations to carry out the requirements, defining \"CFATS regulations\" as guidance or regulations under existing authority. The Secretary must rely solely on the new title for identifying chemicals of interest and providing guidance to small covered chemical facilities for enhancing their security. The new title defines a small covered chemical facility as one with fewer than 350 employees, not a branch or subsidiary. The Secretary must report to Congress on best practices for small chemical facilities and coordinate outreach efforts with relevant entities. The new title authorizes appropriations for FY2015 through FY2017 at $81 million per year, with a request for $87.436 million for the Infrastructure Security Compliance Division in FY2015. H.R. 4007 would amend the Homeland Security Act to reflect the new title and require a third-party study on vulnerabilities to terrorism associated with the CFATS program. Section 2(d) of H.R. 4007 requires the Secretary to submit a plan for using metrics to assess CFATS program effectiveness, with benchmarks and information on how DHS plans to use the data. The plan is due 180 days after enactment. Section 3 establishes that the act would take effect 30 days after enactment. Executive branch agencies have raised issues regarding chemical facility security, which H.R. 4007 addresses directly. In the context of H.R. 4007, previous debates on chemical facility security have included discussions on adopting inherently safer technologies to reduce consequences of a terrorist attack. The Obama Administration in 2010 expressed support for using these technologies in high-risk chemical facilities under certain circumstances. The Obama Administration supported using inherently safer technology approaches to enhance security at high-risk chemical facilities, specifically for Tiers 1-4. Regulatory entities should have the authority to require Tiers 1 and 2 facilities to implement these methods if they improve security and are feasible. Tier 3 facilities should also assess inherently safer technology methods in their site security plans. The Obama Administration supports using inherently safer technology to enhance security at high-risk chemical facilities, specifically for Tiers 1-4. Regulatory entities should have the authority to recommend implementing these methods for Tier 3 and Tier 4 facilities, but not require it. Flexibility and staggered implementation are deemed necessary for the new policy. H.R. 4007, passed by the House, maintains existing language prohibiting the Secretary from disapproving site security plans based on specific security measures. The DHS is restricted from mandating consideration or implementation of inherently safer technologies. The Obama Administration seeks an extension of statutory authority until October 4, 2015. The Obama Administration supports extending statutory authority for chemical facility safety until October 4, 2015. A multi-agency working group called for permanent statutory authorization for the CFATS program. H.R. 4007 passed by the House provides a permanent authorization and three-year funding through FY2017. The report calls for congressional action to streamline CFATS enforcement process, allowing DHS to issue immediate orders for penalties or facility closure in cases of noncompliance posing a threat. H.R. 4007 passed by the House retains the current enforcement structure. The Department of Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection Agency have identified a gap in regulating the security of chemicals at water and wastewater treatment facilities in the United States. They are calling for additional authorities to close this gap and secure chemicals of interest at these facilities to protect the communities they serve. The Obama Administration believes that EPA should lead chemical security for water and wastewater systems, with DHS supporting EPA's efforts. A report in May 2014 called for Congress to remove the exemption for these facilities, allowing DHS to regulate security in collaboration with EPA. H.R. 4007, passed by the House, addresses this issue. H.R. 4007, passed by the House, exempts water and wastewater treatment facilities from the covered chemical facility definition. The Committee believes that the current regulatory scheme for drinking water facilities is effective, with approximately 52,000 community water systems and 16,500 wastewater treatment facilities in the U.S. Despite calls to remove these exemptions, the Committee opposes expanding the CFATS mission to cover an additional 70,000 facilities. Expanding the CFATS mission to include an additional 70,000 facilities is deemed misguided. DHS does not have the authority to regulate public water systems and wastewater treatment works as covered chemical facilities."
