The Legislature requires a separation among manufacturing, wholesale, and retail interests in the alcohol industry to prevent dominance and excessive sales through aggressive marketing. The exceptions to tied interests are limited to prevent undermining the general prohibition. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for unique conditions in San Diego County. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Business and Professions Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 462.
