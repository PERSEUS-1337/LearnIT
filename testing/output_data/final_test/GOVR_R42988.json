    "content": "This report presents key immigration trends and issues considered by Congress, such as border security, employment verification, and reforms to legal immigration. It provides time series data and snapshots, with references to more in-depth analyses by the Congressional Research Service. Data mainly come from the Department of Homeland Security. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) details requirements for admission of foreign nationals, grounds for exclusion and removal, document controls, and naturalization eligibility. Congress has amended the INA multiple times since 1952. Legal immigration includes permanent admissions based on employment. The chart book provides historical data on legal immigration, including permanent admissions and temporary admissions. It also covers trends in immigration control, such as inadmissibility determinations and border apprehensions. The final section looks at recent trends in the unauthorized resident alien population and unaccompanied alien children. Immigration to the United States peaked in the early 20th century, with foreign-born residents making up 14.8% of the population in 1910. Immigration declined due to limits imposed by the Immigration Acts in 1921 and 1924, as well as during the Great Depression and World War II. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 remains the governing statute for immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 allowed 2.1 million unauthorized aliens to become Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs). The Refugee Act of 1980 and the Immigration Act of 1990 were significant in shaping legal permanent immigration in the United States. The Refugee Act allowed refugees and asylees to become LPRs, while the Immigration Act set a yearly limit of 675,000 LPRs with exceptions for certain categories like immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and refugees. Immigration levels in the U.S. have risen to early 20th-century levels, with 990,553 aliens becoming LPRs in FY2013. The Immigration Act of 1921 and 1924 imposed numerical limits on LPR admissions to the United States based on nationality quotas. Dominant immigrant-sending countries have varied over time, with trends in the top countries presented in Figure 2. The national origins system set quotas based on foreign-born populations in 1890 and 1920. The Immigration Act of 1921 and 1924 imposed nationality quotas on LPR admissions to the United States based on foreign-born populations in 1890 and 1920. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings, leading to a more diverse immigration pattern over the 20th century. Mexico emerged as a top sending country post-1970, along with other countries like the Dominican Republic, India, and China. The Immigration Act of 1921 and 1924 imposed nationality quotas on LPR admissions to the United States. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings, leading to a more diverse immigration pattern. The total number of foreign-born residents in the United States has increased significantly over the past 50 years, reaching 42 million in 2014. The proportion of foreign-born residents in the US has not been seen since 1910, with a shift in source regions from Europe to Latin America and Asia. Between 2000 and 2014, foreign-born individuals contributed 30% to the total US population increase, with most of the increase in the prime working age population. About one-third of current foreign-born residents arrived in the US since 2000. As of 2013, 32% of foreign-born residents were Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs). The U.S. foreign-born population includes individuals on long-term temporary visas and unauthorized aliens. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets limits and preferences for permanent immigration based on various factors. The largest growth in immigration since 1986 has been in immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and employment-based immigrants. The number of employment-based immigrants increased from 56,617 to 161,110. 87% of these immigrants adjusted from a temporary status. In FY2013, about 991,000 aliens became LPRs, with 65% entering based on family ties. Other categories included employment-based LPRs (16%), diversity immigrants (5%), and refugees/asylees (12%). The pool of potential LPRs each year exceeds the worldwide level set by the INA. Over 1.8 million approved visa petitions pending in FY2015 had been submitted and approved at least 10 years earlier. The approved visa petitions pending at the end of FY2015 had been submitted and approved at least 10 years earlier, representing persons approved for visas not yet available due to numerical limits. The decline in approved pending cases after FY2007 was due to visa priority dates far in the future. Recent FY2015 data show an advancement in the processing queue, with over half of the 4.6 million approved petitions being for brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. At the close of FY2015, approved visa petitions pending included siblings of U.S. citizens, adult children of U.S. citizens, family members of LPRs, and employment preferences. Refugees are individuals fleeing persecution based on various factors. Refugee admissions to the U.S. are determined by the President in consultation with Congress. The President, in consultation with Congress, sets the refugee admissions ceiling annually. The number of refugees admitted fluctuated over the years, with a temporary suspension post-9/11. Foreign nationals in the U.S. can apply for asylum through USCIS or EOIR. Requests for asylum have fluctuated over the years, with a drop since the mid-1990s, an increase in the early 2000s, and a modest rise since 2010. USCIS affirmative requests in FY2014 approached early 2000s levels, while EOIR defensive cases have not reached those levels yet. EOIR defensive cases include unapproved asylum cases referred by USCIS and credible fear claims from expedited removal. Aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. The number of asylum cases approved has remained steady since FY1997, with exceptions in FY2001 and FY2002. USCIS affirmative approvals exceeded 20,000 in those years. The INA allows for the temporary admission of various foreign nationals. For more information, refer to CRS Report R41753, Asylum and \"Credible Fear\" Issues in U.S. Immigration Policy. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows for the temporary admission of nonimmigrants for specific purposes. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, with over 70 specific types currently issued. These visa categories are commonly referred to by letter and numeral, such as B-2 for tourists and H-1B for temporary professional workers. Nonimmigrant visas can be valid for multiple entries and years, and the U.S. Department of State consular officer must ensure the foreign national is entitled to nonimmigrant status. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for temporary admission of nonimmigrants for specific purposes. Nonimmigrant visas must demonstrate they are not coming to reside permanently. Nonimmigrant visa issuances reached 9.9 million in FY2014, influenced by the visa waiver program. The major nonimmigrant category for temporary workers is the H visa. The H visa is the major nonimmigrant category for temporary workers, including H-1 for professional specialty workers and H-1C for nurses. Other temporary worker visas include H-2A for agricultural workers, H-2B for seasonal/intermittent workers, L visas for intracompany transferees, E-1 for treaty traders, E-2 for treaty investors, and J and Q visas for cultural exchange participants with extraordinary abilities. Temporary employment-based visa categories have increased since FY1994, with visas issued to nonimmigrants surpassing 1 million in FY2007 and FY2008. Despite fluctuations, these visas have shown growth each year since FY2010. Religious workers on R visas were the only category that did not exhibit substantial growth. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43735. In addition to consular officers interviewing aliens for visas, DHS Customs and Border Protection inspects foreign nationals entering the US. CBP requires about one-quarter of nonimmigrants to fill out arrival records, known as I-94 admissions. I-94 data shows admissions have increased from FY2003 to FY2013. In FY2013, I-94 admissions increased due to CBP's expanded use of I-94 forms at land ports. Visitors under the VWP constituted 40% of all temporary visitors. Tourists dominated I-94 admissions, with 80% being tourists and 10% business visitors. Other categories included students, exchange visitors, temporary workers, and families. Foreign nationals coming to the US generally need a visa for admission. Foreign nationals coming to the United States must obtain a visa for admission, with the burden of proof on them to establish eligibility. Inadmissibility criteria under INA Section 212(a) include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, and immigration violations. Section 212(a) denials for nonimmigrant visas have increased in the past decade, surpassing immigrant visa denials in FY2013. The leading grounds of inadmissibility for LPRs have shifted from public charge exclusions to prior removals/illegal presence and labor certification. Increased denials based on immigration law violations are also on the rise. The INA requires inspection of all aliens seeking entry, regardless of possessing a visa. All persons must demonstrate eligibility to a CBP inspector for admission. The CBP requires individuals to prove their status as a foreign national with a valid visa or passport, or as a U.S. citizen. Inadmissible aliens can be voluntarily withdrawn or summarily excluded, with immigration judges handling other cases. The number of inadmissible aliens at ports of entry has remained relatively stable over an eleven-year period. Border Patrol apprehensions of foreign nationals at ports of entry have fluctuated in recent years, with Mexican nationals accounting for 28% of inadmissible aliens. Other significant groups include individuals from Canada (14%), the Philippines (11%), and Cuba (9%). Border Patrol staffing has increased since 1986, with Congress passing multiple laws to authorize more personnel and appropriations. Border Patrol staffing has significantly increased over the past decade, with 20,273 agents as of September 30, 2015, up from 2,268 agents in 1980. Annual apprehensions rose between FY1991 and FY2000 but have generally decreased since then, reaching a low of 327,577 in FY2011. Apprehensions data count events, not individuals, with some facing high-consequence enforcement. Border Patrol enforcement actions have increased in recent years, with 86% facing high-consequence enforcement in FY2012. Employers must verify new hires' identity and work eligibility through a paper-based system. Compliance is met if documents appear genuine. Employers must submit two documents for new hires: one for identity (e.g., driver's license) and one for work authorization (e.g., Social Security card). They can participate in E-Verify, an electronic verification program that checks employment authorization. E-Verify evolved from the Basic Pilot program and became available nationwide in December 2004. The number of employers enrolled in E-Verify grew significantly over the years. The number of employers enrolled in E-Verify increased from 5,900 in FY2005 to 617,000 by the end of FY2015, representing roughly 10% of U.S. employers. The number of E-Verify cases submitted by employers also rose from under 1 million in FY2005 to 30.5 million in FY2015. Employers who unlawfully hire unauthorized aliens may face civil and/or criminal penalties from DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In April 2009, ICE issued new guidance on immigration-related worksite enforcement targeting criminal aliens and employers with illegal workplaces. Employers may face civil money penalties, criminal fines, and imprisonment for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens or producing fraudulent immigration documents. In FY2014, 642 employers received civil penalties totaling $16.3 million, a significant increase from previous years. Criminal fines peaked at $36.6 million in FY2010. Criminal fines peaked at $36.6 million in FY2010, declined to lower levels between FY2011-FY2013, and increased to $35.1 million in FY2014. The number of criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations increased between FY2003 and FY2008, with some marked yearly changes. However, between FY2008 and FY2009, the number of individuals arrested on criminal charges plummeted. Since FY2011, there has been a steady decline in the number of arrests. Foreign nationals can be removed from the United States for various reasons outlined in INA Section 237, including inadmissibility grounds and committing certain criminal offenses. The immigration status of aliens can lead to removal if they commit certain criminal offenses, fail to register, are security risks, become a public charge, or vote unlawfully. Immigration judges determine removability, with formal removals increasing while voluntary returns have declined. ICE manages various programs targeting criminal aliens, including the Criminal Alien Program, INA \u00a7 287(g) program, National Fugitive Operations Program, and Priority Enforcement Program. These programs aim to initiate removal proceedings against criminal aliens and fugitives through partnerships with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. The Criminal Alien Program, managed by ICE, works with law enforcement agencies to identify and remove criminal aliens. Congress has prioritized deporting aliens convicted of certain crimes, leading to an increase in removals over the past decade. In FY2013, criminal aliens accounted for 45% of all removals. In FY2013, criminal aliens accounted for 45% of all removals. The unauthorized resident alien population rose from 8.6 million in 2000 to a peak of 12.2 million in 2007, declining since 2010. The unauthorized resident alien population has been relatively stable since 2010, with estimates ranging from 10.9 million to 12.0 million in recent years. Various organizations, including Pew and DHS, have produced consistent estimates using different methodologies. The unauthorized resident alien population in the United States has remained above 10 million for over a decade, despite factors such as increased border security and high unemployment. The most recent report estimated that 42% of unauthorized residents entered from 2000 to 2010. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33874 and CRS Report R41207. The number of unaccompanied children seeking to enter the United States along the U.S.-Mexico border has surged in recent years, with apprehensions peaking at 68,445 in FY2014 before declining. The increase is mainly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Multiple agencies in the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement are involved in addressing this issue. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and Congress share responsibilities for processing, treating, and placing unaccompanied alien children (UAC) at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress is concerned about the implications for border security and U.S. immigration policy. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43599, Unaccompanied Alien Children: An Overview."
