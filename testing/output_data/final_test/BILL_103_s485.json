    "content": "The \"Automobile Damage Consumer Protection Act of 1993\" requires disclosure of motor vehicle damage under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. This includes a damage disclosure statement. The \"Automobile Damage Consumer Protection Act of 1993\" mandates that prior to transferring title of a motor vehicle, the seller must disclose any damage exceeding $1,000 in repair costs incurred during their ownership. This disclosure must be submitted to the state's motor vehicle department. The \"Automobile Damage Consumer Protection Act of 1993\" requires certificates of title issued by a State to include a damage disclosure form on the back, a statement on the front about previous damage exceeding $1,000, a form for disclosing any damage to the vehicle, and a diagram to circle damaged areas. The Secretary will prescribe the form and content of all certificates of title within 180 days of the enactment of the \"Automobile Damage Consumer Protection Act of 1993\". SEC. 702 states that the Secretary must ensure that a damaged motor vehicle is repaired to its predamaged condition if the repair cost exceeds $1,000, and failure to do so does not exempt anyone from disclosing the damage. SEC. 703 requires each State to maintain records of damage disclosure statements for motor vehicles, and SEC. 704 exempts certain vehicles from these requirements. SEC. 704 exempts motor vehicles over 9 years old or with a gross weight over 16,000 pounds from certain regulations. SEC. 705 outlines criminal penalties. SEC. 705 outlines criminal penalties for violations of the title, including Class A misdemeanor for first offenses and Class E felony for repeat offenders. Any violation of the title may result in a civil penalty of up to $2,000 per violation, with a maximum penalty of $100,000 for related violations. The Secretary can assess and collect these penalties through a civil action brought by the Attorney General. Before referral to the Attorney General, penalties can be compromised if the charged person can prove the alleged violation did not occur. The Secretary considers various factors in determining the amount of civil penalty for violations, including the person's culpability, history of offenses, ability to pay, and the impact of the penalty on their business. Other factors such as the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation are also taken into account, along with any other relevant considerations for justice. \"SEC. 707. DEFINITIONS.\" For the purposes of this title, a certificate of title is a document issued by a State showing ownership of a motor vehicle. Cost refers to the expenses of parts, framework, paint, and labor. Damage, as defined for the damage disclosure statement, includes theft, fire, vandalism, collision, weather, submersion in water, or flood. Motor vehicle refers to automobiles or motor trucks, excluding motorcycles or mopeds. The term 'person' in this title includes manufacturers, distributors, dealers, corporations, and individuals."
