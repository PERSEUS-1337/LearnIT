    "content": "Data used in developing sample position expectations were taken from various publicly available sources, including The House Employment Bulletin, The Senate Employment Bulletin, and The House GOP Job and Resume Bank. Ads were collected from different periods ranging from January 2015 to September 2019. Data was collected from various sources including the House GOP Job Bank web page and ads posted between January 2016 and December 2017. Over 1,800 ads were collected, with 880 ads for positions in Member personal offices after removing duplicates and irrelevant ads. Similar position titles were grouped together for analysis. The study analyzed 704 job ads for various positions in congressional staff, categorizing them based on job titles and levels. The ads were coded against different variables to identify suitable candidates in a decentralized recruitment process. Means of identifying appropriate candidates for congressional staff positions include reassigning staff, placing ads in subscription services, word of mouth, and other nonpublic means. The dataset analyzed may not be representative of all job solicitations, and some senior staff positions may not have public-facing recruitment processes. Most position titles were categorized into four primary responsibility areas: Legislative, Policy, and Oversight; Media, Messaging, and Speeches; Constituent Communications, Outreach, and Service; and Office Administration and Support. The dataset analyzed for congressional staff positions includes sample position descriptions based on coded data, detailing primary responsibilities, expected duties, applicant information, and other expectations. Categorizing positions by title assumes similar tasks are carried out in House and Senate offices, despite potential differences in staff resources and office dynamics. Variations in staff resources and duties within House and Senate offices may limit the generalizations about staff roles. Differences in job duties, work schedules, and office emphases can affect how sample position expectations align with operational practices in congressional offices."
