    "content": "The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2008 includes sections on short title, findings, Medicare payment for intravenous immune globulins, coverage and payment of intravenous immune globulin in the home, reports, and offset. Congress finds that IVIG is a crucial therapy for various diseases and conditions, improving quality of life and saving lives. Each brand of IVIG is recognized as a unique biologic by the FDA due to differences in production processes. IVIG therapies are not interchangeable due to different biological products. IVIG manufacturing is complex and requires substantial planning, taking 7 to 12 months from plasma collection to FDA approval. Medicare reimbursement for IVIG changed in 2003. Medicare changed reimbursement methodology for IVIG from average wholesale price to average sales price plus 6 percent, reducing rates for providers. A 2007 report found Medicare reimbursement inadequate, with a significant portion of IVIG sales occurring above payment amounts. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation reported a shift in site of care for Medicare beneficiaries receiving IVIG treatment, leading to a lack of continuity of care and adverse health outcomes. The Office of Inspector General also found that a significant portion of IVIG sales occurred above Medicare payment amounts. The Health and Human Services reported that 61% of physicians sent patients to hospitals for IVIG treatment due to high prices. The Office of Inspector General warned that any improvement in Medicare reimbursement for IVIG could be lost if manufacturers raise prices in the future. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services acknowledged challenges in obtaining IVIG since the payment change to ASP+6. Approximately 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries receive IVIG treatment for primary immunodeficiency disease in various settings, with no other effective treatment available. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established an IVIG home infusion benefit for these individuals, covering only IVIG and excluding other treatments. The Medicare IVIG home infusion benefit covers only the cost of IVIG and excludes coverage for infusion services like nursing and clinical services in the home. This limitation results in home infusion providers generally not accepting new patients with primary immune deficiencies. Access to home infusion of IVIG for patients with primary immune deficiency disease, who have a genetic or intrinsic defect in their human immune system, is limited due to healthcare providers not being able to acquire IVIG at prices at or below the Medicare part B reimbursement level and not being reimbursed for infusion services provided by a nurse. This limitation results in providers generally not accepting new patients with primary immune deficiencies. This access is crucial as it can reduce infections and improve the quality of care and health for these patients. SEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULINS. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2008 amended Section 1842(o) of the Social Security Act to collect data on payment differences for intravenous immune globulin and physician costs. The Federal Government collects pricing data and data from the intravenous immune globulin community on access to services. The Secretary will continue IVIG preadministration-related services payment until adequate payment is determined. The Secretary will provide additional payment to physicians for intravenous immune globulins, instead of the IVIG preadministration-related services payment, for a 2-year period. Amendments are made to Section 1833(t)(14) of the Act regarding hospital outpatient services. The Secretary will collect data on payments for intravenous immune globulin and review costs incurred by hospitals for furnishing the products. The Secretary will collect survey and pricing data, including data from the intravenous immune globulin community, to assess access to IVIG services. Additionally, a special payment rule for IVIG preadministration-related services will continue. The Secretary will assess access to IVIG services by collecting survey and pricing data, including data from the IVIG community. A special payment rule for IVIG preadministration-related services will continue until the Secretary determines adequate payment for IVIG. Additional payment authority will be provided to hospitals furnishing IVIG during a 2-year period after the review is completed. The Secretary will provide additional payment authority for hospitals furnishing intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) as part of a covered OPD service, in place of IVIG preadministration-related services payment, for all IVIG-related items. SEC. 4. COVERAGE AND PAYMENT OF INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULIN IN THE HOME. Amendments are made to the Social Security Act regarding the administration of intravenous immune globulin in the home, including payment provisions. The Secretary will provide separate payment for items and services related to the administration of intravenous immune globulins based on a review of data, including pharmacy overhead, patient service costs, and supply costs. The Secretary will provide separate payment for intravenous immune globulins based on patient service costs, supply costs, and the consumer price index increase. SEC. 5. REPORTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress within 7 months of the Act's enactment, detailing data collection and review results. The report will also address the potential use of additional payments to physicians providing intravenous immune globulins. Additionally, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission is required to submit a report within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must submit a report to Congress analyzing the impact of additional payments to physicians for intravenous immune globulins under Medicare. Additionally, an assessment of implementing a new payment methodology for these globulins under Medicare is required. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must provide recommendations for legislation and administrative action to reduce lag time in data used for determining average sales price under Medicare. This includes analyzing the feasibility of implementing new methodologies. SEC. 6. OFFSET. Amends the Social Security Act to include disposable drug delivery systems for colorectal cancer treatment."
