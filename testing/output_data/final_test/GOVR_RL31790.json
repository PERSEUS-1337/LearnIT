    "content": "The federal tobacco support program utilized price support loans and marketing quotas to guarantee minimum prices for tobacco and limit supply. This system aimed to create a stable market for farmers and manufacturers. The federal tobacco support program, established in the 1930s, aimed to provide economic stability for farmers and manufacturers through price support loans and marketing quotas. However, the program failed to achieve its desired goals as U.S. tobacco prices were higher than global competitors, leading to a loss of export and domestic markets. Additionally, support prices exceeded production costs, resulting in economic profits that inflated marketing quota lease rates and land prices. Marketing quotas became valuable assets for farmland, adding substantial value and rental income for owners. The number of active tobacco producers declined over time, with production becoming concentrated on fewer, larger farms. In 1982, there were 180,000 tobacco farms, but by 2002, the number had decreased to 57,000. Most active tobacco farmers owned marketing quota and rented from absentee owners. Burley producers owned 44% of their quota and leased the remaining 56% at an average cost of $0.33/lb. The leasing and transfer of quota for flue-cured tobacco had been prohibited since 1986. In the mid-1990s, flue-cured producers owned about 33% of their quota and rented the remaining 67% at an average cost of $0.37/lb. The average rental cost of quota in 2003 was $0.63/lb. for flue-cured and $0.57/lb. for burley. The decline in quota levels after 1997 was due to the reversal of rapidly growing export markets for U.S.-manufactured cigarettes, leading to increased consolidation and higher rental fees. After 1997, farmers faced economic pressures to consolidate and rent more quota to maintain revenue. Financial aid sources, including payments from cigarette manufacturers and Congress, helped offset decreases in marketing quotas. Congress also directed the Commodity Credit Corporation to take ownership of 1999 tobacco pledged as price support loan collateral. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) took ownership of 1999 tobacco as price support loan collateral and disposed of it in landfills by December 2003, costing about $625 million. Financial assistance sources helped active tobacco producers pay higher rental rates, offsetting declining marketing quotas and increasing production costs. Farmers struggled to increase demand for tobacco due to federal policies discouraging it. The elimination of quotas through a buyout could reduce production costs for farmers. Advocates proposed issuing marketing licenses to active producers to maintain price benefits. Licenses would only be given to active producers to prevent them from acquiring exchangeable value. The President's Commission on Improving Economic Opportunity in Communities Dependent on Tobacco Production developed a framework for a quota buyout, including licensed future production and continued price support. Legislative proposals offered sizable benefits to active growers, with H.R. 245 and H.R. 986 largely modeled on the Commission's recommendations. The President's Commission on Improving Economic Opportunity in Communities Dependent on Tobacco Production proposed reducing tobacco support program loan rates or eliminating them to increase competitiveness in domestic and export markets. This could lead to a potential 50% increase in U.S. tobacco production. However, there would be significant adjustment costs associated with dropping support prices to free market levels or eliminating the program. The proposal to reduce tobacco support program loan rates or eliminate them could lead to a 50% increase in U.S. tobacco production. This would wipe out the value in quotas, affecting absentee quota owners and farmland values. Compensating quota owners for lost asset values could minimize economic adjustments. The \"free market\" policy approach was appealing to active producers looking to expand their tobacco enterprises and farmers intending to exit from tobacco production. Small to medium-sized operations and inefficient farmers would be most disadvantaged. The \"free market\" option for tobacco production would result in fewer but larger farms, with production moving to locations with suitable soils and climate. Some advocates found the potential increase in production unappealing. S. 1490 proposed eliminating quotas and price support but allocating a national crop acreage base among active producers, with acreage reductions if supplies become excessive. An acreage limitation program, introduced by H.R. 3160, aimed at reducing planting. This bipartisan bill, similar to McConnell's proposal, differed in payment amounts with S. 1490 offering $11 billion and H.R. 3160 offering $15 billion. S. 1490 included community development assistance. The value of tobacco marketing quota depended on various factors, such as program longevity and national marketing size. The average sale price of tobacco marketing quotas in Kentucky was $2.58/lb. in 2001, $2.08/lb. in 2000, and $1.75/lb. in 1999. Buyers were discounting purchase prices in anticipation of future quota reductions. Most buyout bills proposed to pay owners $8/lb., which was higher than the present value of annual rental income. The buyout price for tobacco quotas was $8/lb, higher than market prices. Active producers were offered an additional $4/lb. The estimated buyout and transition payments ranged from $11 to $19 billion. A typical tobacco farmer in North Carolina would receive $298,800 for their quota and transition payments. The President's Commission recommended using federal excise taxes on tobacco products to fund the proposed buyout, estimated at $0.17 per pack for five years. Legislative proposals included assessments on manufacturers and importers of tobacco products. In South Carolina, the average tobacco farmer would cost $438,240 to buy out, while in Kentucky, it would cost $56,400. The report discussed the possibility of a tobacco buyout program funded by federal excise taxes, with manufacturers like Philip Morris willing to contribute. Savings for manufacturers could amount to $270 million if the support price for tobacco was reduced. Overseas operations could also benefit from lower prices on US and foreign leaf. It was estimated that it would take about 14 years for manufacturers to recover the cost of a $15 billion quota buyout program. Morris (12) proposed FDA regulation of tobacco products along with participating in a buyout. Health groups and Philip Morris supported FDA regulation, with doubts about Congress divisions. H.R. 4033 sought $9.6 billion from the U.S. Treasury for a buyout, with lower rates and additional benefits for growers. The bill was included in H.R. 4520, a tax bill. The Jenkins bill, included in H.R. 4520, was part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Senate amended the JOBS Act by attaching the McConnell buyout bill and the DeWine-Kennedy FDA tobacco product regulation authority. Conferees discussed the tax legislation on October 5, 2004, with tobacco quota buyout provisions funded by an assessment on manufacturers and importers of tobacco products. The Chairman's mark of H.R. 4520 did not include FDA regulation of tobacco products. It eliminated tobacco marketing quotas, acreage allotments, and nonrecourse loan price support authority. Current quota owners and active producers would receive payments totaling about $6.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. Total expenditures were capped at $10.140 billion. The Chairman's mark of H.R. 4520 did not include FDA regulation of tobacco products. It eliminated tobacco marketing quotas, acreage allotments, and nonrecourse loan price support authority. Total expenditures were limited to $10.140 billion over a 10-year period from FY2005 through FY2014. Remaining Phase II payments from manufacturers to farmers would terminate. National Quota Levels and Actual Marketings of Flue-Cured and Burley Tobacco from 1990-2004 are shown in Table 1. Comparison of Tobacco Quota Buyout Proposals and Transition Payment Estimates by State are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Based on USDA data, the Tobacco Quota Buyout Law is compared to Peanuts. Various CRS reports and university sites focus on tobacco policy issues. The Economic Research Service also maintains information on tobacco economics. The USDA provides various resources related to tobacco, including the Economic Research Service's Tobacco Briefing Room, National Agricultural Statistics Service data on production, Farm Service Agency's administration of tobacco quota and price support loan programs, and the Foreign Agriculture Service's tracking of tobacco exports and imports."
