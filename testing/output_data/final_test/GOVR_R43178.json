    "content": "The rapid technological advances are reshaping the telecommunications and media markets, leading to calls for a reevaluation of existing laws and regulations. The regulatory debate centers on issues such as applying regulations to traditional providers entering new markets, imposing regulations on new entrants competing with traditional providers, and establishing a regulatory framework for new technologies. The role of the Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory bodies is also under scrutiny. The role of the Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory bodies is being reevaluated as networks transition to Internet Protocol. Policy goals like universal service mandates and localism are being reconsidered as markets transform. Broadband technologies' deployment, adoption, and regulatory treatment are key focus areas in the policy debate, with some policymakers advocating for ensuring access to the Internet for all stakeholders. The policy debate surrounding broadband deployment and access to the Internet includes concerns about the transition of the Universal Service Fund to the Connect America Fund, impact on the media sector, and allocation of radio-frequency spectrum for new wireless technologies and government use. The demand for spectrum is crucial for both public and private sectors, with broadband technology playing a key role in telecommunications services. Broadband infrastructure deployment is seen as a way to boost economic development and create jobs, especially in rural areas where broadband availability is lacking. The National Broadband Plan identified broadband adoption issues, including populations with low incomes, seniors, minorities, and the less-educated. The 113th Congress may address broadband-related issues such as the transition to the Connect America Fund and reauthorization of broadband loan programs. They may also consider revising the regulatory structure and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The 1996 Telecommunications Act and the Communications Act of 1934 may need revision due to changes in telecommunications providers and markets, and the shift to an Internet protocol (IP) based network. Policymakers are considering how a revision could incentivize investment, deployment, and subscribership to broadband infrastructure. Congress may explore options to enhance broadband deployment while minimizing negative effects of government intervention on competition and private sector investment. The debate on telecommunications reform revolves around ensuring unfettered access to the Internet, with a focus on \"net neutrality\" to guarantee equal access and non-discriminatory treatment. Various reports address the roles of the Rural Utilities Service and the Universal Service Fund in promoting broadband access in rural areas. Congressional discussions aim to incentivize investment in broadband infrastructure while minimizing negative impacts on competition and private sector investment. The debate on net neutrality focuses on ensuring equal access to the Internet without discrimination. Policymakers are divided on the need for specific regulations to protect against potential abuses that could threaten net neutrality. Some argue for more regulatory guidelines, while others believe existing laws are sufficient and additional regulations could hinder the Internet's expansion and development. The debate over net neutrality revolves around the need for regulations to prevent discriminatory practices by broadband providers. Some argue that new regulations could hinder Internet expansion, while others believe they are necessary to prevent anti-competitive behaviors. The FCC's Open Internet Order, adopted in December 2010 and implemented in November 2011, has sparked mixed reactions. While some support the action, others believe the FCC has overstepped its authority in regulating the Internet. The issue of Internet regulation and the FCC's authority is currently facing court challenges, adding to the ongoing debate over broadband regulation. The FCC's broadcast media ownership rules aim to promote competition, localism, and diversity of voices. The FCC reviews these rules every four years to determine if they serve the public interest. The FCC proposed rule changes in December 2011, including eliminating the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership rule to enhance diversity. The FCC proposed changes to its ownership rules, including eliminating the Cross-Ownership rule and modifying the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership rule in the top 20 markets. It also suggested adjustments to the Local Television Ownership Rule and sought public input on promoting diversity in media ownership. The FCC sought public comment on how to attribute control of broadcast television stations that enter into sharing arrangements with other stations in their local markets. Currently, the only sharing agreement-related attribution rule for television stations covers local marketing agreements where one station purchases blocks of time from another station and sells advertising for at least 15% of the broadcasting time. The FCC enforces this as a bright-line rule. The FCC enforces a bright-line rule for sharing agreements in broadcast television stations. As long as the agreement does not exceed 15% of the station's programming time and maintains ultimate control over station finances and programming, it will not trigger the attribution rule. These agreements create \"virtual duopolies\" in the industry. The FCC delayed adoption of new broadcast ownership rules to analyze public comments on gender and minority ownership impact. The Minority Media and Telecommunications Council requested a further delay for a study on the proposed rule changes' effects. The National Association of Broadcasters supports the delay, and the FCC agreed. New rules are expected to be adopted in 2013. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has provided federal support to local public television and radio broadcasting entities since 1967. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was created to provide federal grants to local public television and radio broadcasting entities without political interference. CPB receives most of its funding through federal appropriations, with about 15% of public broadcasting funding coming from CPB. President Obama signed a Continuing Resolution in 2013 to maintain CPB's advanced appropriations at $445 million for FY2013. The federal government reduced CPB's budget by 5% to $422.75 million for FY2013 due to sequestration. Congressional policymakers are debating the federal role in funding public broadcasting amidst concerns over the federal debt and the balance of news coverage. Policymakers defend federal funding for public broadcasting, citing its importance in providing news and information to the public, especially for children's education. A report by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting explored alternative funding sources in response to budget cuts. Ending federal funding would have a severe impact on public broadcasting. The report warned that cutting federal funding for public broadcasting would severely harm the service in the US. Emergency communications rely on wireless networks, 9-1-1 calls, and alerts like EAS and WEA. Previous Congresses passed laws to improve emergency communications, and the 113th Congress is expected to continue these efforts. The 113th Congress is continuing legislative initiatives and oversight of programs related to emergency communications. The Spectrum Act of 2012 addressed the needs of first responders and 9-1-1 call centers by establishing a nationwide broadband network and improving 9-1-1 services and technology. The 113th Congress focused on improving emergency communications by passing legislation like the Spectrum Act of 2012, which established a nationwide broadband network and enhanced 9-1-1 services. Subsequent bills like the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 and the NET 9-1-1 Improvement Act of 2008 further supported improvements in 9-1-1 services and the handling of emergency calls. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is being developed to incorporate EAS messages for effective emergency alerts. IPAWS serves as a communications backbone for alerts to designated areas, utilizing various communication channels including broadcast, satellite, cable, radio, and IP-enabled networks. It supports Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) to mobile devices and was developed as part of the Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN) Act. Congress and the FCC aim to increase wireless and wireline broadband capacity to encourage broadband deployment. Both Congress and the FCC have streamlined the process for companies to place wired and wireless broadband equipment on existing poles or structures. Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits discrimination among providers of equivalent services and ensures that state and local governments cannot prevent the provision of wireless services in an area. Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 amended the Communications Act to require state and local governments to grant requests for modifications of existing wireless towers or base stations if the request would not substantially change the physical dimensions. Ambiguities in the terms \"tower\" and \"base station\" may cause difficulty in applying the new provision. The FCC has been working to streamline the process of collocating equipment on existing poles owned by utility companies, as granted by Section 224 of the Communications Act. Ambiguities in the terms \"tower\" and \"base station\" from the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 may lead to difficulties in applying the new provision. The FCC implemented changes to Section 224, allowing ILECs to benefit from pole attachment rights and adjusting rates charged by utilities to telecom carriers. Utility companies challenged the FCC's authority, but the Court of Appeals upheld the interpretation of the statute. The court upheld the FCC's interpretation of Section 224, allowing ILECs to benefit from pole attachment rights and adjusting rates charged by utilities to telecom carriers. The utility companies' petition was denied. The FCC, an independent federal agency, regulates communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. Its mission is to ensure affordable and non-discriminatory communication services for the American people. The court upheld the FCC's interpretation of Section 224, allowing ILECs pole attachment rights and adjusting rates charged by utilities to telecom carriers. The utility companies' petition was denied. The FCC, as an independent federal agency, regulates communication services through various mediums like radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. It is mandated by the Communications Act of 1934 to regulate different sectors of the telecommunications industry. Some policymakers have criticized the FCC's regulatory approach and have proposed procedural and substantive reforms to better align with the current state of the industry. The FCC's budget is funded by regulatory fees collected from license holders and other entities, not through direct appropriation. The agency has the authority to review and adjust these fees annually to reflect changes in its appropriation. The Internet is made up of decentralized networks owned and operated by the private sector. The Internet is comprised of international and decentralized networks owned by private sector entities. The governance of the Internet is managed by ICANN, which uses a multistakeholder model for decision-making. National governments are increasingly recognizing the importance of ICANN's policy decisions, especially in areas like intellectual property, privacy, law enforcement, Internet freedom, and cybersecurity. Some governments advocate for more intergovernmental influence over Internet governance, while others like the US and EU oppose it. The debate arose during the 2012 WCIT where the US and 54 other nations refused to sign a treaty expanding ITR jurisdiction over the Internet. The 112th Congress passed S.Con.Res. 50 to promote a globally free Internet without intergovernmental control. The 113th Congress is debating how the U.S. government should maintain influence over ICANN's Internet governance process and resist increased international governmental control. Concerns include the potential for intergovernmental conferences to increase control over the Internet. For more information, refer to CRS reports R42351 and 97-868. The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 reauthorized provisions in the Copyright Act and Communications Act related to satellite operators retransmitting broadcast television signals. This allows satellite operators to import distant network programming without prior consent from the television station. The reauthorization of provisions in the Copyright Act and Communications Act allows satellite operators to retransmit broadcast television signals without prior consent. Congress will need to decide whether to retain, modify, or eliminate provisions related to retransmission consent, sparking policy debates about copyright licenses. Copyright holders oppose compulsory licenses, preferring negotiated rates, and seek to eliminate compulsory satellite and cable licenses. This could have competitive implications. Online video distributors face a competitive disadvantage as they must negotiate copyright fees directly with copyright holders for broadcast signals, unlike cable and satellite operators who benefit from compulsory licenses. Cable and satellite operators aim to eliminate retransmission consent fees, while online distributors seek parity in negotiations. The proposal to require mandatory arbitration for retransmission consent negotiations at an impasse is opposed by broadcasters. Cable and satellite operators are restricted from retransmitting distant TV stations if local stations provide the same programming, but some counties are assigned to markets where all stations are located across state borders, leading to a debate on how to serve these \"orphan counties.\" This issue is likely to arise during Congress's reauthorization of statutory provisions. The reauthorization of statutory provisions is important for addressing issues such as mandatory arbitration for retransmission consent negotiations and serving \"orphan counties\" with TV stations across state borders. Spectrum capacity is crucial for delivering mobile broadband and supporting industries that rely on fixed wireless broadband for fast and reliable data transmission. The wireless spectrum, managed by the FCC and NTIA, transmits signals for voice, text, and video communications. Spectrum policy involves allocating frequencies, enhancing technology, and increasing capacity. The 113th Congress may address spectrum policy issues to ensure new capacity for wireless broadband. The Spectrum Act in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 aimed to increase spectrum availability for commercial use through auctions and incentives for broadcasters to release airwaves. The Spectrum Act in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 aimed to increase spectrum availability for commercial use through auctions and incentives for broadcasters to release airwaves. It also included provisions for deficit reduction and establishing a planning structure for public safety broadband networks. The Communications Act of 1934 mandated a universal service concept to provide telecommunications services to all Americans, including those in rural areas, at affordable rates. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 codified this commitment, leading to the establishment of a federal Universal Service Fund in 1997 by the FCC. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was created to provide subsidies for voice telecommunications services, broadband access for schools and libraries, and advanced services for rural health care providers. There was a debate on whether broadband should be included in universal service objectives due to gaps in access, especially in rural areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 called for the FCC to develop a national broadband plan to ensure every American has access to broadband capability. The plan, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan, submitted in 2010, emphasized the role of the Universal Service Fund (USF) in achieving this goal. However, the USF was not initially designed to directly support broadband, leading the FCC to adopt an order in 2011 to transform the USF over a multi-year period to support broadband services. The Universal Service Fund (USF) is undergoing a major transition to support broadband services, replacing the High Cost Program with the Connect America Fund (CAF) and modifying other programs. This transformation has sparked debate among policymakers as they aim to modernize the USF. Congress is expected to monitor the impact of these reforms and the FCC's progress in implementing them. The CRS Report R42524, Rural Broadband: The Roles of the Rural Utilities Service and the Universal Service Fund, discusses the impact of the Universal Service Fund's transition to support broadband services."
