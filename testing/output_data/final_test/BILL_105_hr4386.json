    "content": "The text introduces special tax rules for Section 42 housing cooperatives and their shareholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax rules for Section 42 housing cooperatives allow non-patron shareholders to include low-income housing tax credits and deductible interest in their taxable income calculations. The tax rules for Section 42 housing cooperatives allow patron shareholders to deduct amounts paid for real estate taxes on houses or apartment buildings within the cooperative. The tax rules for Section 42 housing cooperatives allow deductions for interest paid on indebtedness related to the acquisition, construction, alteration, rehabilitation, or maintenance of houses or apartment buildings, as well as the land on which they are situated. The term 'section 42 housing cooperative' refers to a corporation with no more than 2 classes of stock, including shares issued to non-resident equity contributors and shares issued to resident equity contributors. A section 42 housing cooperative must meet certain criteria, including that each patron stockholder has the right to occupy a dwelling, no shareholder can receive distributions except on liquidation, 80% of income must come from patron shareholders, and the cooperative must be entitled to claim low-income status. The text chunk discusses the definition of a shareholder's proportionate share in a cooperative housing corporation eligible for low-income housing tax credits under section 42. It explains how the proportionate share is calculated based on the stock owned by a particular shareholder compared to the total outstanding stock of the corporation. The text chunk explains how each dwelling unit in a section 42 housing cooperative is allocated a share of the cooperative's real estate taxes or interest, reflecting the cost attributable to the shareholder's unit. The term 'proportionate share' in a section 42 housing cooperative refers to shares determined based on allocations described in the agreement. A cooperative must elect this application, and once chosen, it can only be revoked with the Secretary's consent. Prior approval of occupancy is required in certain cases, disregarding agreements with the cooperative. In a section 42 housing cooperative, prior approval is needed for occupancy in specific cases, such as when stock is acquired by operation of law or by a non-individual. The original seller must acquire any stock from the cooperative within one year of transferring the apartments or houses. In a section 42 housing cooperative, the original seller must transfer apartments or houses to the cooperative. For mutual housing associations, membership certificates replace stock, and membership certificate-holders replace shareholders. Membership certificates in mutual housing associations replace stock for shareholders. Non-patron shares of stock are treated as depreciable property for tax purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of shares of stock to patron shareholders for depreciation purposes in a trade or business. This is based on the appropriate depreciation method, recovery period, and convention as outlined in section 168. The curr_chunk explains that the deduction for depreciation allowable under section 167(a) to a non-patron or patron shareholder with respect to any stock for any taxable year shall not exceed the adjusted basis of such stock. Any disallowed deduction can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year. The curr_chunk discusses the disallowance of deductions for certain payments to a section 42 housing cooperative, specifically for non-patron or patron stock holders. No deduction is allowed for amounts paid to the cooperative that are chargeable to the cooperative's capital account. The shareholder's adjusted basis in the cooperative stock is increased by disallowance amounts. Upon transfer of patron stock, consideration cannot exceed the shareholder's adjusted equity. This includes consideration paid for the stock and payments for improvements to the shareholder's residence. No gain or loss is recognized on distributions by a section 42 housing cooperative. The section 42 housing cooperative can distribute a dwelling unit to a patron stock holder in exchange for their stock, qualifying for nonrecognition of gain under section 1034(f). Non-patron stock holders are entitled to tax credits available to the cooperative. The tax credit for the section 42 housing cooperative is calculated based on the relative holdings of non-patron stock. Amendments are made to exclude amounts paid by tenants for patron stock. The tax credit for a section 42 housing cooperative is not affected by the cooperative's right of first refusal to acquire stock after the compliance period. The minimum purchase price for the stock of a section 42 housing cooperative is determined based on the present value of remaining depreciation deductions. The discount rate provided in subsection (b)(2)(C)(ii) is applicable at the time of exercising the option or right of first refusal. Section 1381(a) of the Code is amended to include provisions related to these calculations. The Code is amended to include provisions for determining the minimum purchase price for the stock of a section 42 housing cooperative. The Code is amended to include provisions for determining the minimum purchase price for the stock of a section 42 housing cooperative. Special rules for section 42 housing cooperatives and their shareholders will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
