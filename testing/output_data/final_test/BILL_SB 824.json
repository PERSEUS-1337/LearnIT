    "title": "SB 824",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Low Carbon Transit Operations Program is created to provide assistance for transit agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve mobility, with funding continuously appropriated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Funding allocation is based on specific criteria and guidelines. The Low Carbon Transit Operations Program requires recipient transit agencies to spend allocated funds on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and not supplanting other funds. The program funds transit operating or capital assistance that enhances transit services, increases mode share, and supports zero-emission buses. The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board, will develop guidelines for recipient transit agencies to demonstrate how proposed expenditures will benefit disadvantaged communities and meet specific criteria. At least 50% of funds received must be spent on projects benefiting disadvantaged communities as identified by the State Air Resources Board. The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board, will develop guidelines for recipient transit agencies to demonstrate how proposed expenditures will benefit disadvantaged communities and meet specific criteria. Recipient transit agencies must submit a list of proposed expenses and documentation to the Department of Transportation before seeking funds. For capital projects, agencies must specify phases of work and identify funding sources. The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board, will determine the eligibility of proposed expenses for recipient transit agencies to ensure compliance with guidelines. Funding sources for subsequent project phases must be described, and agencies can continue operational assistance if greenhouse gas emissions reductions are demonstrated. The Department of Transportation notifies the Controller of approved expenditures for each transit agency and the available allocation. Transit agencies can retain funding for up to four years if not used in a fiscal year, specifying the intended use for the funds. A recipient transit agency can loan or transfer its funding share to another agency within the same region for eligible expenditures, including operating assistance, following guidelines set by the Department of Transportation. A recipient transit agency can reassign savings or surplus moneys allocated under the program to another eligible expenditure, including operating assistance. The agency can also reassign previously allocated moneys for an expenditure that is no longer a priority. Annual reports must be provided to the Department of Transportation in a specified format. The Department of Transportation and recipient transit agencies must comply with guidelines from the State Air Resources Board to meet requirements for maximizing benefits to disadvantaged communities. Recipient transit agencies must also adhere to legal requirements, including the California Environmental Quality Act and civil rights and environmental justice obligations under state and federal law. The audit of public transportation operator finances will now include verification of money receipt and expenditure from the program. Recipient transit agencies must submit audit copies to the Department of Transportation for review by the Legislature and Controller upon request. Additionally, a new section 75231 is added to the Public Resources Code. Section 75231 of the Public Resources Code allows recipient transit agencies to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Department of Transportation for eligible expenditures under the program. This letter permits agencies to use their own funds for expenses and be reimbursed later if certain conditions are met. The recipient transit agency must ensure that their expenditures are eligible under the program, comply with legal requirements, and have sufficient funds available for reimbursement from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The recipient transit agency and the Department of Transportation will have an agreement for reimbursement from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, with timing and amount dependent on the agreement terms and fund availability. The Department of Transportation may develop guidelines for implementation in consultation with recipient public transit agencies."
