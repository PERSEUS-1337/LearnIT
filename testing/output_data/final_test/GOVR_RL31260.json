    "content": "Digital television (DTV) is a new television service that offers movie theater quality pictures and sound, wider screens, better color rendition, and multiple video programming options. It can be high definition television (HDTV) or standard definition television (SDTV), providing a better picture quality than current television. The transition to digital TV allows broadcasters to offer digitally-based services like pay-per-view, similar to cable and satellite providers. Digital television (DTV) offers high-quality pictures and sound, wider screens, better color rendition, and multiple video programming options. It uses the radiofrequency spectrum efficiently, conserving bandwidth for other wireless applications. To enjoy a \"high definition\" TV experience, digital programming produced with digital equipment must be available and delivered to consumers via digital signals through various means like broadcast, cable, satellite, or DVD. Digital television (DTV) technology requires consumers to have a digital television product capable of receiving and displaying digital programming. Congress and the FCC have been involved in the development of DTV, transitioning from analog to advanced television systems. The FCC initially used the term high definition television (HDTV) but later switched to advanced television (ATV) and then to DTV to accurately describe the new service using digital signal transmission. In 1995, the term DTV (ATV) was adopted to describe the new digital television service accurately. The FCC established a standard for DTV signal transmission based on ATSC recommendations in December 1996. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 limited initial DTV licenses to existing broadcasters, who would retain their analog licenses during the transition. Broadcasters were required to return either their analog or digital channel eventually. In the 104th Congress, a debate occurred regarding FCC auctions for DTV spectrum valued between $11 billion to $70 billion. Despite no legislation, the FCC granted DTV licenses to 1600 TV broadcasters, providing 6 MHZ of spectrum for digital signals. The phased transition allowed consumers time to adapt without immediately needing new equipment. Broadcasters were given 6 MHZ of new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing 6 MHZ for analog transmission to simulcast NTSC and DTV signals. This allowed viewers without DTV sets to continue receiving television programming during the transition. Licensees had to build DTV facilities on a schedule based on market size, with FCC granting extensions for unforeseeable circumstances. The target date for broadcasters to cease analog broadcasting and return licenses was set for 2006. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated that analog television licenses must be returned by 2006 for auction. The FCC could grant extensions in certain conditions, such as if digital converter technology was not widely available or if a significant portion of households did not have digital TV. In the market served by the station, 15% of television households do not have digital TV or subscribe to digital services. The 2006 deadline for the digital transition was extended by the 109th Congress. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 set a hard deadline of February 17, 2009. The FCC continues to monitor the DTV conversion of broadcast stations. Over 1,800 stations received digital television channel assignments post DTV transition. The FCC released the Third Periodic Review of Rules and Policies Affecting the Conversion to Digital Television on December 31, 2007. The FCC adopted procedures and rule changes to ensure broadcasters meet the digital television transition deadline by February 17, 2009. Full-power television stations must file status reports detailing their transition progress. Successful digital television buildout requires compelling programming, signal delivery, and consumer adoption of digital equipment. The widespread adoption of digital television equipment has led to an increase in digital programming, which includes visually appealing content like sports events and movies. Digital programming is delivered through broadcast over the airwaves, satellite television systems, and digital cable services. As of January 10, 2008, 1,626 stations were broadcasting digital signals in 211 markets, representing about 95% of the nation's stations. As of October 10, 2007, the FCC has granted construction permits to 1,706 stations, covering over 99% of U.S. TV households. The cost of transitioning to digital operation for broadcasters is estimated to be $10 to $16 billion. Approximately three-quarters of full-power commercial stations missed the May 1, 2002 conversion deadline, with 843 stations requesting extensions. As of October 10, 2007, the FCC has granted construction permits to 1,706 stations, covering over 99% of U.S. TV households. 772 stations have been granted extensions for DTV facilities, with 602 filing for second extensions. Satellite television is provided to over 22 million American households by companies like Echostar's DISH Network and Hughes' DirecTV. DirecTV requires additional equipment for high-definition programming, such as a larger satellite dish and set-top box. Cable companies initially hesitated to offer digital and high-definition channels, but most now provide them. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association reports that 209 out of 210 local TV markets have cable providers offering high-definition programming, reaching 100 million U.S. households. The market for DTVs has expanded rapidly, with over 100 million U.S. television households having access to HDTV. Prices for DTV monitors and receivers have significantly dropped, with an average retail price of $819 in 2007. The goal is to complete the transition to DTV quickly to reclaim and reallocate NTSC spectrum for other purposes, such as commercial wireless services and public safety services. The FCC has designated some analog TV spectrum for public safety use. Congress and the FCC are addressing the complex policy landscape involving various industries and technologies to facilitate the transition to digital television. The report discusses key issues in the Congressional debate on the digital television transition. Appendix A provides background information on policy issues related to the digital television transition in the 108th Congress, including spectrum reassignment for public safety purposes and legislation such as the HERO Act. The Media Bureau of the FCC proposed a digital transition deadline extension from 2006 to 2009. Cable and satellite providers would only be required to carry a broadcaster's digital signal, with the option to down-convert it to analog for viewers. This would help broadcasters meet the 85% threshold needed to return their analog spectrum to the government for auction. The commercial broadcasting industry strongly opposed this proposal. The commercial broadcasting industry opposes the Media Bureau's proposal to extend the digital transition deadline to 2009. They argue that it would hinder the development of digital television services and remove the incentive for consumers to purchase DTVs. Kenneth Ferree, former head of the Media Bureau, believes that market forces will ensure popular stations are carried by cable and satellite TV providers in both digital and analog form by 2009. Kenneth Ferree suggests that economically disadvantaged households could receive federal subsidies for purchasing converter boxes to ensure they continue to receive television service. Congress held hearings in 2004 on the digital television transition, examining the possibility of consumer subsidies for converter boxes. The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet held a hearing on lessons learned from Berlin's successful digital television transition in 2003. The General Accountability Office identified key elements for success, including consumer education, subsidies for low-income households, and a clear shut-off date for analog TV service. The 9/11 Commission recommended expedited assignment of radio spectrum for public safety. Senator John McCain introduced the SAVE LIVES Act to extend the digital transition deadline to 2008, freeing spectrum for first responders and creating a $1 billion program to assist consumers with analog TVs. The program proposed in S. 2820 aims to assist low-income households in purchasing digital-to-analog converter boxes for analog televisions to continue receiving TV signals. It also requires labeling of analog TVs, recommends a consumer education program on the digital transition, and mandates final decisions on DTV must-carry and public interest obligations by the FCC. Senator Conrad Burns' amendment set a digital transition deadline of December 31, 2007 for spectrum. Senator Conrad Burns set a digital transition deadline of December 31, 2007 for spectrum designated for public safety, with the FCC having the authority to waive the deadline to avoid consumer disruption. Senator McCain later offered a modified version of S. 2820 as an amendment to the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, which was approved by the Senate with modifications by Senator Burns. The final version of the amendment in S. 2845 maintained the digital transition deadline for public safety spectrum. The Senate passed S. 2845 on October 6, 2004, setting a digital transition deadline of December 31, 2007 for public safety spectrum. The legislation does not authorize auctions of commercial spectrum used for analog TV broadcasts. The House-passed version of S. 2845 contained a provision expressing the need for broadcasters to cease analog transmissions by December 31, 2006 to return spectrum for public safety and commercial uses. The conference report version also emphasized the timely return of analog broadcast spectrum by December 31, 2006. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) was signed into law on December 17, 2004. Lawmakers debated the implementation of a \"hard date\" for the DTV transition, considering modifying the digital transition deadline of December 31, 2006, and reclaiming analog spectrum for public safety. Appendix B in this report lists DTV-related legislation in the 109th Congress. Congress and the FCC aimed to complete the digital transition quickly to reclaim analog spectrum for first responders and auction for telecommunications development. Auctioning the spectrum could generate billions in revenue, which could help reduce the federal budget deficit. The debate also focused on addressing over-the-air households. The debate focused on providing financial assistance to over-the-air households for purchasing converter boxes or digital televisions. Questions arose about whether assistance should be exclusive to low-income households or available to all, and if funding should come from auctioning the analog spectrum. The Government Accountability Office conducted a television characteristics survey at the request of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a survey on television characteristics, finding that 19% of households rely on over-the-air TV, 57% on cable, and 19% on satellite TV. Low-income, non-White, and Hispanic households are more likely to use over-the-air TV. GAO estimated a subsidy for over-the-air households could cost $460 million to $2 billion, depending on set-top box costs and recipient limitations. Cable and satellite providers would convert digital signals to analog for consumers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that providing subsidies for converter boxes to cable and satellite TV consumers, as well as over-the-air households, could cost between $1.8 billion to over $10 billion. Each analog television set would require its own converter box to receive a digital signal. The cost estimates do not include the cost of implementing the subsidy. The GAO cost estimates for providing subsidies for converter boxes to TV consumers do not include the cost of implementing the subsidy program. Testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee discussed the challenges of implementing a subsidy for DTV equipment and the need for a hard deadline for the digital transition. The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet discussed the requirement of warning labels on new analog televisions and the conversion of digital signals at cable and satellite providers' head-ends or at the subscriber's home. Another hearing emphasized the importance of educating retailers and consumers about the digital transition, with a focus on setting a transition deadline. Additionally, the House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on DTV legislation to expedite the transition and increase revenues from auctioning spectrum. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the Digital Television Transition Act of 2005, setting a hard deadline of December 31, 2008 for the DTV transition. The legislation aims to raise revenues by auctioning analog spectrum and allocate funds for a digital-to-analog converter box program. CBO estimated $10 billion in net receipts from spectrum auctions. The Digital Television Transition Act of 2005 includes funding for various programs such as digital-to-analog converter boxes and public safety communications grants. The legislation also shifts the DTV transition deadline to December 31, 2008 and allocates auction proceeds to the Treasury for deficit reduction. It does not address issues like multicast must-carry or DTV public interest obligations. The legislation shifts the DTV transition deadline to December 31, 2008, reclaiming analog spectrum and ceasing analog television service. It eliminates the provision allowing broadcasters to keep analog spectrum indefinitely. The FCC is directed to release digital channel assignments by December 31, 2006, conduct auctions for recovered analog spectrum licenses starting January 7, 2008, and issue status reports on coordinating digital allotments with Canada and Mexico. The legislation directs the FCC to conduct auctions for recovered analog spectrum between channels 52 and 69. $990 million from auction proceeds will fund a Digital Television Conversion Fund for a converter box program. U.S. households can request up to two $40 coupons for converter boxes between January 1, 2008, and January 31, 2009. Retailers can participate in the program. The legislation directs the Department of Commerce to establish grant programs for public safety agencies and NYC broadcasters. Funds will be allocated to assist in the acquisition, deployment, and training for interoperable communications systems. Additionally, funds will reimburse NYC broadcasters for temporary DTV broadcast systems and compensate low-power television stations for digital-to-analog conversion. The legislation includes provisions for compensating low-power television stations for digital-to-analog conversion devices. Warning labels on analog TVs will inform consumers about the need for a digital tuner or converter box. Public outreach programs will educate consumers about the analog TV broadcasting deadline and available options. The draft legislation aims to accelerate the deadline for TVs to have built-in digital tuners to March 1, 2007, instead of July 1, 2007. It also prohibits the FCC from changing the schedule for mandatory DTV reception capability. Cable and satellite providers must offer broadcaster signals in digital and analog formats for five years after the transition, with the option to convert digital broadcasts to standard definition. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee discussed the DTV transition, with a focus on setting a \"hard\" deadline for digital conversion. There was disagreement over cable and satellite carriage of multicast broadcast programming. The committee approved the Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005, which set a deadline of April 7, 2009 for digital conversion. The legislation also extended the FCC's auction authority to September 30, 2009. The Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 extends the FCC's auction authority to September 30, 2009, with auctions for recovered analog spectrum starting on January 28, 2008. Proceeds go into a fund, with $5 billion transferred to the Treasury on October 2, 2009. The remaining funds are allocated for various purposes, including assisting consumers with converter boxes, emergency communications, and natural disaster assistance. The legislation for the Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 includes provisions for funding converter boxes for consumers affected by hurricanes and natural disasters. It does not specify details on the converter box subsidy program or cable carriage issues. A separate DTV bill may be introduced in the future to address these matters. The Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 was approved by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Amendments were proposed to reduce funding for converter boxes and change the transition deadline, but were not successful. The Senate passed the bill on November 4, 2005. The budget reconciliation conference report was approved by the House and Senate in December 2005. The House approved the bill again on February 1, 2006, clearing it for the President's signature. The House approved S. 1932, clearing it for the President's signature. On February 8, 2006, the President signed it into law (P.L. 109-171). Title III sets the digital transition deadline for February 17, 2009, allocating $1.5 billion for converter boxes. Full-power TV stations will cease analog broadcasts after the deadline. The FCC will auction analog spectrum between channels 52 and 69 from January 28, 2008, to June 30, 2008, with auction proceeds estimated at $12.5 billion. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund will transfer $7.363 billion to the Treasury, with $990 million allocated to the NTIA for a converter box program. The program will provide up to two $40 coupons per household between January 2008 and March 2009 for the purchase of converter boxes. The total funding may increase with additional support. The program may receive additional funding up to $1.5 billion, including $160 million for administrative costs. Other designated uses of auction proceeds include establishing a grant program for public safety agencies, reimbursing New York City TV broadcasters for temporary DTV broadcast system costs, and compensating low-power TV stations for digital-to-analog conversion devices. The act allocates funds for various purposes including upgrading low-power television stations to digital, implementing a national alert program, enhancing 911 services, supporting essential air services, and assessing additional license fees by the FCC. Additionally, the FCC is instructed to coordinate digital television channel allotments with Canada and Mexico. The Conference Agreement for P.L. 109-171 did not retain certain provisions from the House bill regarding digital-to-analog conversion and consumer outreach programs. Senator Stevens introduced S. 2686, which includes provisions related to the digital television transition. The Senate Commerce Committee completed markup of the communications reform bill, H.R. 5252, with provisions related to the digital television transition. This includes mandates for consumer education, establishment of a DTV Working Group, requirements for television sets to receive digital signals, setting energy standards for converter boxes, and obligations for large cable operators to provide local broadcasters' digital signals. The bill H.R. 5252 mandates large cable operators to provide local broadcasters' digital signals in both digital and analog formats until February 17, 2014. It affirms FCC authority for digital stream requirements for the blind and requires semi-annual reports on international coordination. Spanish-language analog TV stations near the U.S.-Mexican border can continue analog operation until February 17, 2011. The FCC is given statutory authority for the broadcast flag rule with limitations. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 set a deadline for the digital transition to February 17, 2009, and established a converter box coupon program. Congress is focused on ensuring households are prepared for the DTV transition deadline, overseeing federal agencies like the FCC and NTIA, and evaluating the need for additional federal efforts for public education and outreach. The 110th Congress held hearings on the DTV transition, with unresolved issues including digital multicast must-carry and spectrum auctioning. The NTIA proposed a coupon program for digital-to-analog converter boxes. NTIA proposed providing up to two $40 coupons to households with analog televisions relying on over-the-air broadcast signals. Cable or satellite households are not eligible. Applicants must self-certify their use of analog TVs. NTIA sought input on determining eligibility based on economic need and consumer education. $5 million is allocated for education on the digital transition and converter box program. NTIA allocated $5 million for consumer education on the digital transition and converter box program. They emphasized the importance of collaborating with various stakeholders to reach households relying solely on over-the-air television. Representative John Dingell and other Democrats expressed concerns about restricting eligibility for converter box coupons to over-the-air households only. The NTIA released its final rule for the converter box program, allocating $990 million initially with a potential additional $510 million. The program aimed to provide coupons to cable or satellite households with analog TVs, opposed means testing for eligibility, and emphasized performance standards for converter boxes. The letter also highlighted the need for adequate consumer education, especially targeting lower income households and vulnerable groups. The NTIA released a final rule for the converter box program, allocating $990 million initially with a potential additional $510 million if needed. Starting on January 1, 2008, up to two $40 coupons will be available to U.S. households for digital-to-analog converter boxes. Exclusive over-the-air households will be eligible for coupons during a \"Contingent Period\" if additional funding is required. Cable and satellite households with extra over-the-air televisions can get coupons during the initial phase but not during the contingent phase. The final rule for the converter box program outlines procedures for manufacturers and retailers to participate. Manufacturers must submit devices for approval meeting technical specifications. Approved devices can have a smart antenna interface connector and program guide, but not video recording or playback capabilities. Retailers need certification from NTIA to process coupons. Retailers certified by NTIA must have systems for processing coupons electronically, track transactions, train employees, manage inventory, and report suspicious behavior. NTIA contracted IBM for the Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon program, with a total award of $119,968,468. IBM will provide consumer education and coupon services until September 30, 2009. The IBM-led team will provide services in consumer education, coupon distribution, and financial processing for the Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon program. Consumers can apply for up to two converter box coupons through NTIA's website or toll-free number. Coupons will be sent out starting in late February or early March of 2008. Congressional concern is focused on informing the public about the digital transition before the February 17, 2009 deadline. The focus is on informing the public about the digital transition to prevent analog over-the-air households from losing TV service. Surveys show a lack of awareness among viewers, with only a small percentage knowing about the transition. Federal agencies are involved in addressing this issue. The NTIA and the FCC are working on consumer education efforts for the DTV transition, with 61.2% of Americans unaware of it. The NTIA is funded for consumer education, focusing on raising awareness of the coupon program for groups most likely to be affected. They are partnering with private sector stakeholder groups to reach these at-risk constituencies and the general public. NTIA and FCC are collaborating with private sector and government agencies to educate consumers about the DTV transition. Funding requests have been made for consumer education, with efforts focused on reaching vulnerable populations and raising general awareness. The FCC has joined the DTV Transition Coalition to further outreach efforts. The FCC has joined the DTV Transition Coalition and is promoting DTV awareness through consumer publications, web materials, and events. There are discussions on whether the federal government should take a more proactive role in DTV public education. In response to criticisms, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) for a DTV Consumer Education Initiative, seeking public comments on various proposals to raise awareness of the DTV transition. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified before the Senate Special Committee on Aging about difficulties in implementing consumer education programs for the DTV transition. GAO highlighted concerns about the voluntary nature of private sector outreach efforts and the potential for conflicting messages from industry stakeholders. GAO is conducting ongoing assessments of public and private sector DTV consumer education programs and planning consumer surveys leading up to the transition date. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) are running consumer education campaigns for the DTV transition. NAB is preparing PSAs for local broadcasters, while NCTA is running a $200 million advertising campaign on cable channels. The FCC believes PSAs are the most effective way to reach over-the-air television viewers about the digital transition. The FCC is proposing requirements for television broadcast licensees to conduct consumer education efforts on the digital transition, including PSAs. Digital multicasting allows broadcasters to divide their digital spectrum into separate content streams. The FCC affirmed that cable operators are not required to carry more than one digital programming stream from a broadcaster. The issue is whether \"must carry\" requirements should be expanded for cable operators. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 5252 did not address multicast must-carry for cable operators, leading to a debate between commercial broadcasters and cable providers. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin supports requiring multicast must-carry, suggesting a reconsideration of the FCC's 2005 decision. No multicast must-carry legislation has been introduced yet. The FCC's 2005 decision on multicast must-carry was opposed by Commissioners Copps and Adelstein. Chairman Martin withdrew an attempt to require multicast must-carry in 2006 due to lack of votes. Cable providers may need to carry downconverted analog signals post-digital transition for analog TV users. Customers might need converter boxes or cable companies could provide them. Cable providers may seek authority to downconvert digital signals of local broadcast stations to analog format for analog TV users post-digital transition. Congress may mandate which stations receive \"dual carriage\" to cable customers. H.R. 5252 in the 109th Congress required cable operators with capacities over 550 megahertz to offer locally broadcast digital signals in formats viewable on both analog and digital TVs until February 17, 2014. Cable operators with capacities of 550 megahertz or less would have different requirements. Cable operators with capacities over 550 megahertz were required to offer locally broadcast digital signals in formats viewable on both analog and digital TVs until February 17, 2014. Operators with capacities of 550 megahertz or less would only need to offer analog signals through that date, with the option of providing digital signals as well. Cable and satellite providers could offer standard definition digital signals instead of high definition, with the ability to convert signals at various locations. Broadcasters and consumer electronics industry opposed the provision allowing standard definition digital signals, arguing it could discourage consumers from purchasing high definition TVs. The FCC adopted a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2007 to ensure all cable subscribers, including those with analog TV sets, can view must-carry television stations on cable systems after the transition to digital television in 2009. Approximately 50% of cable subscribers are analog, and many digital cable subscribers have TVs that only receive analog service. Cable operators must comply with the statute to ensure all subscribers can access the transition to digital television. The FCC proposed that cable operators must carry all must-carry local broadcast stations in analog format for analog cable subscribers or in digital format for all-digital systems. Cable systems must also carry high definition broadcast signals in HD format. The FCC adopted rules to ensure cable customers can still receive local TV stations after the transition to digital television. Cable operators must comply with a \"viewability requirement\" to ensure all subscribers can access the transition. The FCC's viewability requirement mandates cable operators to carry signals in analog and digital formats or digital-only with set-top boxes for analog TVs. The requirement is in place until February 2012, with small cable companies able to request waivers. Content providers are cautious about providing high-quality digital content until technologies prevent unauthorized copying and Internet transmissions. Technologies like the \"broadcast flag\" and plug technology are being considered for this purpose. The FCC is considering implementing the \"broadcast flag\" and technology to address the \"analog hole\" issue for digital content protection. The \"broadcast flag\" applies to over-the-air content, while the \"analog hole\" issue pertains to all digital content. Consumer electronics devices receiving over-the-air DTV signals would need to incorporate content protection technologies by July 1, 2005. However, a U.S. Circuit Court ruling on May 6, 2005, impacted this requirement. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's broadcast flag rules on May 6, 2005, ruling that the FCC has no authority to regulate consumers' use of televisions and other devices receiving broadcast transmissions. Congressional policymakers are considering introducing legislation mandating a broadcast flag, with draft legislation discussed in the 109th Congress. The FCC's authority to proceed with the broadcast flag rule was discussed in hearings held by the Senate and House Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. H.R. 5252 would give the FCC statutory authority to implement the broadcast flag rule and approve digital output protection technologies. The legislation also ensures that the broadcast flag cannot restrict the distribution of news and public affairs programming. The FCC is considering rules to restrict news and public affairs programming based on \"timeliness,\" with broadcasters making the determination subject to FCC review. Legislation is being discussed to require consumer electronics to prevent unauthorized copying of digital content. Under the \"must carry\" provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, cable TV providers are required to transmit local analog programs to their customers to ensure the economic viability of local broadcast television. Broadcasters are advocating for mandatory carriage of DTV programming by cable operators to reach most Americans who receive TV via cable. Broadcasters argue that cable providers must carry DTV programming for consumers with DTV receivers. Cable companies, led by NCTA, oppose \"must carry\" requirements, citing property rights and infrastructure costs. They argue they should decide their content. Cable operators will carry DTV programming based on consumer demand. Mandating DTV channels would require removing non-broadcast channels. Cable operators investing in upgrades for DTV programming may require different equipment than over-the-air TV. HDTV programming needs more bandwidth than SDTV, leading to debate over mandating DTV broadcast transmissions on cable. FCC initiated a proceeding on this matter in July 1998. The FCC ruled in January 2001 that cable systems are not required to carry both analog and digital signals of local TV stations simultaneously. However, digital-only TV stations have the right to carriage on local cable systems, and TV stations converting to digital operations must also be carried. The FCC examined the must-carry issue through 2004, focusing on digital multicasting. Cable operators may be required to carry additional multicasted channels. An agreement in 2005 between NCTA and APTS required cable companies to provide dual-carriage of public TV stations during the transition and up to four multicasts after. After the transition, cable operators may carry up to four multicasts of public stations. APTS will no longer lobby for government must-carry mandates. The FCC affirmed that cable operators are not required to carry more than one digital programming stream from a broadcaster. Existing analog TVs will need a converter box to receive digital signals, but TVs with built-in digital tuners will not need one. The FCC adopted a phase-in plan in 2002 requiring most new TVs to have digital tuners. In 2002, the FCC mandated that most new television sets include digital tuners by 2007. TVs with screen sizes of 13 inches or more, as well as TV receiving equipment, must have DTV reception capability by specific deadlines. The FCC mandated that all TV devices like VCRs, DVD players, etc., must include DTV tuners by July 1, 2007. Consumer Electronics Association opposed the phase-in plan, calling it a \"TV tax\" on consumers. National Association of Broadcasters supported the mandate to speed up the DTV transition and ensure free over-the-air broadcasting survival. The Consumer Electronics Association initially opposed the digital tuner mandate but later agreed due to an interoperability standard with the cable industry. They petitioned the FCC to adjust the deadline for digital tuners in mid-sized televisions, leading to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in February 2005. The FCC denied the petition to eliminate the deadline for digital tuners in mid-sized televisions, but agreed to move up the deadline to March 1, 2006. They also proposed an earlier deadline for all televisions over 13 inches and considered extending the requirement to smaller sets. Ultimately, the FCC decided that all TVs shipped or imported into the US must have digital tuners by March 1, 2007. The FCC mandated that all TVs over 13 inches must have digital tuners by March 1, 2007. Retailers can still sell analog-only TVs from existing inventory but must label them for requiring a converter box after February 17, 2009. Content providers are cautious about providing high-quality digital content until interoperability standards are in place to prevent unauthorized copying. In 1998, five consumer electronics companies formed DTLA to license DTCP technology for protecting digital content. Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures Entertainment adopted DTCP in 2001 to prevent unauthorized copying and Internet retransmission of media. The DTLA technology protects home recording of broadcast and subscription programming, but does not safeguard over-the-air broadcast content. Major studios are hesitant to sign licensing agreements until broadcast content can be protected. Broadcast networks oppose the 5C standard, fearing it will push high-quality content towards cable and satellite. The five other major studios proposed encrypting digital broadcast content with a \"broadcast flag\" to prevent Internet distribution or retransmission. On June 3, 2002, engineers proposed a \"broadcast flag\" for digital content broadcast over-the-air. The content industry supports the proposal, while the technology industry is divided. Supporters argue the flag is necessary to protect against piracy and ensure high-value programming availability. Opponents, including consumer electronics and high tech companies, fear restrictions on content distribution. The FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on digital broadcast copy protection, soliciting public comment on mandating a copy protection mechanism for digital broadcast television. Concerns were raised about the potential adverse effects on innovation and consumer rights. The FCC adopted a rule allowing broadcasters to insert a \"broadcast flag\" into over-the-air transmissions to protect digital television content. Consumer electronics devices had to incorporate content protection technologies by July 1, 2005. Approval of these technologies was required before manufacturing DTV devices. The FCC established an interim procedure for certifying content protection technology, with a public comment period to determine approval. The FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to establish a permanent approval procedure for content protection technology. On August 4, 2004, the FCC approved thirteen digital output protection technologies. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the FCC's broadcast flag rules on May 6, 2005, stating that the FCC cannot regulate consumers' use of televisions and devices receiving broadcast transmissions. The 109th Congress considered legislation mandating a broadcast flag after the Court's ruling. The 109th Congress considered legislation mandating a broadcast flag, giving the FCC statutory authority to approve digital output protection technologies and recording methods for distance learning activities. The legislation also allowed for the redistribution of digital broadcast content within the home environment, with a provision that a broadcast flag could not restrict the distribution of news and public affairs programming based on \"timeliness.\" Broadcasters would determine if the criteria is met, subject to FCC review under certain conditions. During the 109th Congress, legislation was considered regarding the broadcast flag and digital output protection technologies. Content providers were concerned about the \"analog hole,\" where digital signals could be easily converted into unprotected analog form, allowing for unauthorized copying and Internet transmission. Legislation H.R. 5252 was not enacted. The Analog Content Protection Act, introduced by the House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Courts, would require devices to recognize an analog rights signaling mechanism. The draft legislation was the basis for the Digital Transition Content Security Act of 2005. Interoperability standards between digital televisions and cable systems are necessary for consumers to watch digital programming over their cable systems. Interoperability standards between digital televisions and cable systems are crucial for consumers to watch digital programming over their cable systems. The absence of a national interoperability standard has led to the use of proprietary set-top boxes leased by cable companies. The consumer electronics industry and cable operators are working on determining technical details for DTV devices to achieve nationwide compatibility. Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed the FCC to adopt regulations for the commercial availability of \"navigation devices\" without compromising cable providers' rights. The FCC mandated cable operators to separate security functions from non-security functions in set-top boxes by July 1, 2000. Integrated set-top boxes were allowed until January 1, 2005, with subsequent extensions to July 1, 2007. A voluntary agreement was reached between the Consumer Electronics Association and the National Cable Television Association on interoperability standards. In December 2002, the cable and consumer electronics industries agreed on a standard for digital cable television receivers, filing a Memorandum of Understanding with the FCC. This followed earlier disagreements over technical details and interoperability standards. The cable and consumer electronics industries reached an agreement with the FCC in December 2002, outlining a standard for digital cable television receivers. The FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in January 2003 to seek feedback on the agreement. Despite opposition from various organizations, the FCC adopted the agreement in September 2003, allowing for the manufacture of \"plug and play\" television sets. The new rules allowed for the manufacture of \"plug and play\" television sets that could receive one-way digital signals without a set-top box. Consumers needed a security card from their cable operator to insert into the TV set. Set-top boxes were still required for two-way services like video on demand. The FCC rule mandated CableCARDs for unidirectional digital signal security after July 1, 2007. Cable operators had to provide CableCARDs for \"plug and play\" TVs, and new set-top boxes could no longer be \"integrated.\" The FCC ruled that cable providers must use CableCARDs for unidirectional digital signal security after July 1, 2007. Cable companies requested waivers to extend the deadline by two years, arguing that it would increase costs for consumers and divert resources from developing low-cost digital set-top boxes. Consumer electronics industry opposed the extension, stating that it would hinder progress towards next-generation network security technology. The FCC granted waivers for small cable operators and those pledging an all-digital conversion by February 17, 2009, but large cable operators like Comcast and Time Warner must comply with the July 1, 2007 deadline for CableCARD technology. Negotiations continue between the cable and consumer electronics industry for a standard on bidirectional navigation devices. The FCC released a notice seeking comments on bidirectional navigation device standards for cable television systems and consumer electronics. They are also considering extending the rule to non-cable providers like DBS and IP-based video services. Public television stations were given a deadline of May 1, 2003, to convert to digital broadcasting, with a focus on ensuring converter boxes for over-the-air households. Public broadcasting stations are utilizing digital television to enhance services for local communities. They are using multicast channels for education, workforce development, public affairs, and addressing underserved communities. Some stations are establishing Homeland Security public safety networks through datacasts. As of January 2007, 340 out of 349 public television stations were broadcasting digitally, with varying levels of digital transition progress. Public television stations face challenges in funding the digital transition, with estimates ranging from $400 million to $1.7 billion for complete conversion. Federal programs like the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) provide funding support for this process. The Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) is a grant program that helps public television stations pay for equipment and infrastructure needed for digital conversion. Funding for PTFP has been provided for over 40 years, with a $20 million allocation approved for FY2008. The House and Senate approved funding for the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) in FY2008, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 providing $18.8 million. The Digital Distribution Fund at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) also received funding for digital conversion equipment. The Administration requested $30.6 million for CPB's digital conversion program, with the House approving $29.7 million in new funding. The House and Senate approved funding for digital conversion in FY2008. H.R. 3043 and S. 1710 provided $29.7 million each. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 also allocated $29.7 million. The Public Television Station Digital Transition Grant Program at RUS funded digital broadcasting equipment for rural areas. The Administration did not request funding for RUS digital conversion in FY2008. S. 1859 provided $10 million for public television. The Committee approved a bill providing $10 million for public broadcasting digital conversion in rural areas. Future funding is not anticipated after FY2008. The House Agriculture Appropriations Act included no funding for digital conversion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 provided $5 million for public broadcasting digital conversion in rural areas. The Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 contains a provision for grants to rural public television stations. The Senate farm bill authorizes grants to rural public television stations for digital conversion, allowing satellite TV providers to offer distant network signals in \"white areas\" with inadequate analog signals. Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress aims to enhance digital services in rural areas through grants to noncommercial education TV stations. Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 4501/H.R. 4518/S. 2644) explores creating \"digital white areas\" for satellite dish subscribers to receive distant network digital signals if they can't get local signals. The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA) passed in November 2004 allows satellite companies to offer \"distant digital signals\" under certain conditions. Low Power Television (LPTV) stations were created by the FCC in 1982 to serve rural and urban communities. Low Power Television (LPTV) stations were established by the FCC in 1982 to serve rural and urban communities. Concerns have been raised about many LPTV stations losing their licenses during the transition to digital TV. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 provided some relief by creating a \"class A\" status for qualifying LPTV licensees, offering protection during the transition to DTV. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 created a \"class A\" status for qualifying LPTV licensees to protect them during the transition to digital TV. The act outlines criteria for LPTV stations to be eligible for class A status and interference protection they must provide to other TV stations. The FCC established rules in April 2000 to help LPTV stations continue providing free, over-the-air programming to their communities. Cable providers are required to carry locally-generated programming of full-power TV broadcasters, including some LPTV stations that meet certain criteria. The FCC ruled in April 2000 on criteria for LPTV stations to qualify for class A status and interference protection. A petition argued for \"must-carry\" rights for class A licensees, but the FCC decided against it. In 2003, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was adopted for digital low power television and translator stations. In 2004, rules were established for the digital conversion of LPTV and translator stations without setting a transition deadline. The final transition date will be determined in the FCC's Third DTV periodic review proceeding. The FCC's Third DTV periodic review proceeding will address the cessation of analog operations for full-power stations by February 18, 2009. Low-power stations may continue analog broadcasts after that date, subject to future FCC decisions. Funding of up to $10 million is provided during FY2008-2009 to compensate low-power television stations. The FCC provides funding to compensate low-power television stations for digital-to-analog conversion devices, with a maximum of $1000 per device. An additional $65 million is available to upgrade stations from analog to digital in rural communities. The grant programs are administered by the NTIA, and a specific program was announced on October 29, 2007, to help low-power television stations continue analog broadcasts. The program provides funds for low-power television stations to purchase digital-to-analog conversion devices. Applications are accepted between October 29, 2007, and February 17, 2009. LPTV stations are not subject to the digital conversion deadline and will continue to broadcast analog signals. The NTIA permits manufacturers to include analog signal pass through capability in certified converter boxes, but it is not required. The Community Broadcasters Association has filed a complaint against the FCC regarding the blocking of analog signals by NTIA-certified converter boxes. Fees for Ancillary or Supplemental Services are addressed in the Telecommunications Act. The Telecommunications Act (P.L. 104-104) requires DTV licensees offering supplemental services to pay annual fees to the FCC to recover a portion of the public spectrum resource value. Congress and public interest groups are overseeing the implementation of this law to ensure fairness in compensation for the use of the DTV spectrum. The FCC requires broadcasters to pay 5% of their gross revenues from ancillary uses of DTV spectrum. This includes subscription video, software distribution, data transmissions, teletext, and more. Non-commercial stations are also being considered for revenue-generating services and potential spectrum fees. Some argue that commercial broadcasters should pay higher fees. The FCC ruled that noncommercial stations must use their digital capacity for educational services, but can offer ancillary services on excess channels. Public stations must pay a fee of 5% of revenues from these services. Some argue that commercial broadcasters should pay higher spectrum fees. In March 1997, President Clinton established an Advisory Committee on Public Interest Obligations of DTV Broadcasters to recommend how DTV licensees should compensate the public. The Committee consisted of members from government, broadcasting industry, academia, and consumer interest organizations. Recommendations included voluntary actions like providing five minutes per night of air time for candidate-centered discourse before an election. Some panel members wanted to mandate free air time. The report was referred to the FCC, which opened a Notice of Inquiry proceeding on December 15, 1999, to gather public comments. The FCC opened a Notice of Inquiry in December 1999 to gather public comments on the public interest obligations of TV broadcasters transitioning to DTV. In September 2000, the FCC issued the DTV Public Interest NPRM requiring broadcasters to disclose how they serve the public interest. They also issued the Children's DTV Public Interest NPRM focusing on educational programming for children and limiting advertising. No decisions have been made yet. The FCC issued guidelines on educational programming and commercial limitations for digital television broadcasters in response to the Second Periodic Review. The Order increases required educational programming in proportion to increased free video programming on multicast channels and protects children from excessive commercial messages. The FCC issued guidelines on educational programming and commercial limitations for digital television broadcasters in response to the Second Periodic Review. The Order concludes that commercial limits apply to all digital programming directed at children 12 and under, whether on free or pay multicast channels. Two bills introduced in Congress addressed public interest obligations of DTV broadcasters, but were not enacted. Hearings in the 110th Congress discussed public interest obligations of DTV broadcasters, with a focus on increasing educational and informational programming for children. During a hearing on the communications marketplace, all five FCC Commissioners testified about public interest obligations of broadcasters. Commissioner Michael Copps emphasized the need to determine these obligations in the Digital Age, particularly focusing on community affairs and local programming. He highlighted the ongoing proceedings since 1999 regarding the public interest obligations of DTV broadcasters. Commissioner Michael Copps emphasized the urgency of determining public interest obligations for DTV broadcasters, with a focus on community affairs and local programming. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin expressed reservations about imposing specific requirements on broadcasters, particularly regarding free air time for political candidates during the digital transition. Digital television broadcasters provide free air time to political candidates, but FCC Chairman Martin is hesitant about requiring broadcasters to provide this. Commissioners Copps and Adelstein urge the FCC to move forward on DTV public interest obligations. Chairman Martin believes many rules, such as children's programming, have already been addressed. The remaining issue is whether minimum quantities of certain broadcasting should be required. Opposition from state and local communities has hindered broadcasters' ability to offer DTV services. Opposition from state and local communities has hindered broadcasters' ability to offer DTV services, particularly in building new signal transmission towers. The FCC has considered preempting zoning restrictions to facilitate the construction of DTV broadcasting facilities. Legislation in the 109th Congress, such as H.R. 1646 (Harmon), addresses issues related to digital television. Legislation in the 109th Congress includes bills such as H.R. 2354, H.R. 2359, H.R. 2512, which address various aspects of digital television, including public safety frequencies, digital tuners in television receivers, and public interest requirements for multicast digital television channels. Public Television Digital Educational grants to noncommercial educational television stations. H.R. 3032 (Gene Green) - TV Truth Act of 2005 requires disclosure to consumers about analog televisions no longer receiving broadcast transmissions after the switch to digital. H.R. 4569 (Sensenbrenner) - Digital Transition Content Security Act of 2005 mandates analog conversion devices to preserve digital content security measures. H.R. 5252 (Barton) - Communications Act of 2006 includes provisions for the digital television transition and DTV consumer education. The curr_chunk discusses the Digital Television Consumer Education Act, which mandates DTV consumer education and requires cable operators to provide local broadcasters' digital signals. It also establishes a DTV Transition Federal Advisory Committee. Introduced in May 2006 and passed by the House in June 2006. Reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in September 2006. The curr_chunk discusses various bills related to digital television programming and funding. S. 616 focuses on increasing educational programming for children, S. 1023 establishes a Digital Opportunity Investment Trust fund for educational grants, and S. 1268 designates a digital transition date and funding for emergency services. The curr_chunk discusses bills related to digital television programming and funding. S. 1600 authorizes funds for converter boxes for low-income households, S. 1932 sets a digital transition deadline, and allocates funds for converter box assistance. The Senate and House agreed to the conference report on the Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006, signed into law as P.L. 109-171 on February 8, 2006. The Act includes provisions for the digital television transition, such as DTV consumer education and requirements for cable operators to provide local broadcasters' digital signals. Introduced as S. 2686 by Senator Stevens, the bill was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. See H.R. 5252 for further action. H.R. 608 (Barton) and H.R. 2566 (Engel) are legislation in the 110th Congress related to digital television. H.R. 608 requires the FCC to create a DTV public education program and NTIA to report on the converter box coupon program. It also mandates retailers, cable and satellite operators, and broadcasters to inform the public about the digital transition. H.R. 2566 requires TV retailers to display signs next to analog TV sets advising the need for a set-top box after February 17, 2009. The legislation introduced in the 110th Congress related to digital television requires retailers to inform the public about the digital transition and the need for a set-top box after February 17, 2009. Public Service Announcements are also mandated to educate the public about the transition, and funding is allocated for DTV consumer education. Additionally, a report to Congress is required to describe the measures taken by federal agencies to inform the public about the transition to digital television. H.R. 3862 (Wynn) and S. 2125 (Kohl) were introduced in 2007 to educate older Americans on the digital television transition. They establish a federal task force and require retailers, cable operators, and broadcasters to inform the public about the transition. The FCC is directed to award grants for public education, and progress reports are required to be provided to Congress every 90 days. The DTV transition legislation requires various measures to inform the public about the digital transition, including grants for public education and modifications to the converter box program. The DTV Border Fix Act allows TV stations along the Mexican border to continue analog broadcasts through 2014 with certain conditions. Introduced in 2007, these bills were referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation."
