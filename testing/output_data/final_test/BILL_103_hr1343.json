Individual retirement plan distributions can be used penalty-free for first home purchases or educational expenses. Individual retirement plan distributions can be used penalty-free for first home purchases or educational expenses. A qualified first-time homebuyer distribution refers to a payment or distribution used within 60 days for qualified acquisition costs of a principal residence for a first-time homebuyer or their family members. For first-time homebuyers, qualified acquisition costs include expenses for acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence. The definition of a first-time homebuyer is someone who has no present ownership interest in a property. The term \"principal residence\" refers to a home where an individual has no current ownership interest for at least 3 years before acquiring it, and certain sections of the law did not affect the timing of the acquisition. The term \"principal residence\" has the same meaning as in section 1034, and the \"date of acquisition\" refers to the date when a binding contract is entered into or construction/reconstruction of the residence begins. A special rule applies if there is a delay in acquiring the principal residence. The distribution amount due to a delay in purchasing or constructing a residence can be contributed to an individual retirement plan within 120 days. This contribution is not subject to certain restrictions and does not affect other contributions. Qualified higher education expenses include tuition, fees, and books. The tax code defines education expenses as tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment at an eligible educational institution. The amount of qualified higher education expenses for a taxable year is reduced by any amount excludable from gross income. These amendments apply to distributions received after the enactment of the Act."
