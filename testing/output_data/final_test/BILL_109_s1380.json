    "content": "The \"Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2005\" is also known as the Railway-Road Grade Crossings Act. The \"Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2005,\" also known as the Railway-Road Grade Crossings Act, includes amendments to Section 20134 of title 49, United States Code. These amendments focus on the establishment of a pilot program using automated video image analysis technology to address collisions, injuries, and fatalities at highway-rail grade crossings. The program will target violations by motorists at crossings equipped with automatic warning devices. The Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2005 includes amendments to Section 20134 of title 49, United States Code. A plan to eliminate highway-rail grade crossings in the United States that pose a safety threat must be submitted by the Secretary of Transportation within one year of the enactment of this subsection. The Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2005 requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a plan to eliminate unsafe highway-rail grade crossings. The plan must address crossings with inadequate protective equipment, establish new crossings if needed, and estimate the cost. Priority for closing crossings is given to states with high accident rates, outdated equipment, or heavy rail traffic. The Secretary of Transportation is required to develop a plan to eliminate unsafe highway-rail grade crossings, considering factors like traffic delays, public inconvenience, and local government participation. A guide on crossing consolidation and closure will be updated within a year. Grants are available to improve the safety of railway-highway grade crossings. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a comprehensive review of the safety of all public railway-highway grade crossings in the United States, including security measures, safety conditions, past accidents, possible safety improvements, and relevant factors. The Secretary of Transportation will compile a list of 5,000 railway-highway grade crossings most in need of safety improvements, based on a review. Changes include reducing the number of crossings to 25, adjusting funding distribution to states, and increasing the minimum amount for safety improvements to $15,000. The Secretary of Transportation may award grants to States for safety improvements at railway-highway grade crossings, prioritizing projects in States with the highest number of accidents. The minimum amount for safety improvements has been increased to $15,000. The Secretary of Transportation may award grants to States for safety improvements at railway-highway grade crossings, with a focus on reducing crossings without automated warning systems by 50%. States must submit an application and provide non-Federal contributions for the program. Federal financial assistance requires a $1 for every $9 matching requirement from the State. Funding for railway-road grade crossing safety improvements is set aside from the surface transportation program funds. $178,000,000 is allocated for grants under section 130(j) before making apportionments for a fiscal year. SEC. 3. The Secretary of Transportation will analyze laws to prevent trespassing and vandalism on railroad property and update strategies within a year. Model legislation for penalties on violators of crossing signs will be developed within two years. SEC. 4. Funding for Operation Lifesaver is addressed. SEC. 4. OPERATION LIFESAVER FUNDING. Amends Section 104(d)(1) of title 23, United States Code to allocate funds for a public information and education program to prevent motor vehicle accidents at railway-road crossings. Funding amounts increase annually from $1,250,000 in 2006 to $1,460,000 in 2010. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct annual inspections on 2% of highway-rail grade crossings in the top 10 states with collision rates. Additionally, investigations of fatal accidents will be carried out by the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. The Secretary of Transportation will investigate all fatal accidents in the US during a 1-year period and any fatal railroad accidents after the enactment of this subsection. A report will be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment and annually thereafter. SEC. 6. DEFINITION. The term \"highway\" in this Act and its amendments refers to the definition in section 101 of title 23, United States Code."
