    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in response to vulnerabilities during the financial crisis to strengthen financial stability and protect consumers. Some in Congress argue that the regulations have created a significant burden, especially for small banks, hindering economic growth and reducing consumer access to credit. Critics claim the regulations are \"one-size-fits-all\" and unfairly burden small banks that were not responsible for the crisis. The report discusses the regulatory burden on small banks compared to large banks and analyzes recent regulatory proposals. It does not determine if small banks face too much or too little regulation, as this depends on policymakers' judgment of balancing financial stability, credit availability, and consumer protection. The report evaluates the regulatory burden on small banks compared to large banks, discussing the benefits and costs of financial regulation. Regulatory burden can impact banks, consumers, the government, and the economy. Under the Ability-to-Repay requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act, lenders must verify borrowers' ability to repay mortgages, leading to increased costs for banks in training staff and reviewing applications. These costs may be passed on to consumers through higher rates and fees, potentially resulting in fewer mortgages being originated and impacting the economy through reduced home sales and construction. Regulatory burden on banks has both benefits and costs. Regulatory burden on banks includes operating costs and opportunity costs. Operating costs are expenses incurred to comply with regulations, such as training employees and updating computer programs. Opportunity costs refer to missed business opportunities due to additional regulations, like offering fewer mortgages. A bank may offer fewer mortgages due to new regulations making mortgage lending more expensive, leading to a shift towards more profitable activities. Regulatory burden can impact where certain financial activities are conducted, with nonbank institutions potentially taking on a larger share of small-dollar loans if regulations favor them. The broader societal costs and benefits of regulations should consider how the financial system adapts, beyond the focus on costs borne by banks in this report. The presence of regulatory burden in banks does not necessarily mean a regulation is undesirable or should be repealed. Regulatory burden refers to costs, while unduly burdensome considers the relationship between benefits and costs of a regulation. Just because a regulation incurs costs does not make it unduly burdensome. Policymakers need to consider this distinction when advocating for regulations. The term \"burden\" in regulations does not always mean it is unduly burdensome. Advocates for bank relief argue that regulations are unduly burdensome, while critics believe the benefits justify the burden. Small banks face regulatory burden, and banks are regulated by specific charters. Federal depository institutions, such as banks, are issued specific business charters by regulators to accept deposits. These institutions are classified based on asset size, with small banks typically defined as having $1 billion or less in assets. The Federal Reserve considers community banks to have less than $10 billion in assets. Community banks are often referred to as small banks, typically defined as having $1 billion or less in assets by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has a research definition that includes banks with less than $1 billion in assets that make loans and take deposits, or banks with more than $1 billion in assets meeting specific criteria. Not all small banks are community banks, and not all community banks are small banks. Some large financial institutions own subsidiaries that qualify as small banks, leading to a lack of a widely accepted definition for small and community banks. These terms encompass a diverse group of institutions in size, activities, and charter. Asset size alone does not define a small bank, and looking at the number of employees can provide additional perspective. For example, a bank with $100 million in assets had an average of 25 employees in 2014. The number of employees at banks varies based on their asset size, with small banks having fewer employees than larger ones. Small banks have seen a decline in numbers and share of industry assets over the years, while larger banks have increased their market share. The total number of banks in the US has decreased from 18,083 in 1986 to 6,509 in 2014. The number of banks in the US has decreased significantly over the years, from 18,083 in 1986 to 6,509 in 2014. The number of banks with assets over $10 billion has nearly quadrupled during this time, from 28 in 1984 to 107 in 2014. The number of banks with assets under $100 million has drastically decreased from 14,000 in 1984 to 1,872 in 2014. Larger banks now hold more than 80% of total industry assets, compared to less than 30% in 1984. The decrease in the number of banks from 9,904 in 2000 to 6,509 in 2014 has been mainly due to mergers and failures. Failures played a larger role during the financial crisis and recession but have declined as economic conditions improved. The number of \"New Reporters\" providing information to the FDIC has decreased in recent years, with no newly chartered banks in 2014. Industry consolidation may indicate a burdensome regulatory environment for small banks. Consolidation in the banking industry is driven by various factors, including financial struggles, outperformance, regulatory changes, and economies of scale. The ability to bank across state lines was restricted until 1997, leading to mergers for survival or growth. Economies of scale in banking, such as advancements in information technology, also contribute to consolidation. The banking industry consolidation is influenced by factors like financial struggles, regulatory changes, and economies of scale. The slow growth post-recession and low interest rates may deter new entrants. Banking regulation is extensive, covering all aspects of operations. Banking regulation encompasses rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement, with federal agencies continuously overseeing banks to ensure compliance with a wide range of policy areas. Regulatory oversight extends from a bank's establishment to its closure, with examiners monitoring behavior, imposing reporting requirements, and confirming adherence to rules and standards. Banking regulation involves rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement. Examiners ensure banks meet quantitative targets and interpret regulations. Enforcement includes legal actions like fines for non-compliance. Regulatory burden can arise from staff resources, changes in bank activities, and peer behavior adjustments. Banking regulation is divided into safety and soundness regulation and consumer protection regulation. Safety and soundness regulation ensures banks maintain profitability and avoid failure by monitoring risk profiles and setting metrics for capital and liquidity. Banks are assigned a primary federal regulator to reduce duplication, with jurisdictional overlap due to historical evolution. State banks have a primary federal regulator and are also regulated at the state level, while credit unions are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration. Banks are federally regulated for safety and soundness to safeguard taxpayer funds and mitigate moral hazard. Prudential regulation aims to balance bank stability with the cost and availability of credit. Consumer protection regulations focus on ensuring that institutions comply with consumer protection and fair-lending laws. The Dodd-Frank Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) certain powers over banks for consumer protection. This could lead to higher costs for banks, potentially reducing services or causing activity to move to less regulated parts of the financial system. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has consumer protection powers over banks based on their asset size. For banks with over $10 billion in assets, the CFPB is the primary regulator for consumer protection, while safety and soundness regulation is handled by the prudential regulator. The CFPB can issue rules, conduct examinations, and enforce compliance with fines for larger banks. Smaller banks with $10 billion or less in assets have consumer protection authorities divided between the CFPB and prudential regulators. The CFPB and prudential regulators share consumer protection authorities for smaller banks. The CFPB can issue rules and participate in examinations, while the prudential regulator maintains primary supervisory and enforcement authority. The CFPB may refer enforcement actions against small banks to prudential regulators. Regulation in the financial services industry aims to protect consumers and prevent undue burdens on providers. This includes consumer protection, anti-money laundering, community reinvestment, economic sanctions, and activities-based regulations by agencies like the SEC and Commodity. The regulatory burden in the financial services industry, particularly in banking, is influenced by factors such as bank size and charter. Different bank regulators have varying practices and policies, impacting the regulatory burden. Size is just one factor, with rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement also playing a role in determining the burden on a bank. The regulatory burden in the financial services industry, particularly in banking, is influenced by factors such as bank size and charter. Different bank regulators have varying practices and policies, impacting the regulatory burden. The OCC, FDIC, and Fed often undertake joint rulemaking and participate in the FFIEC to create standardized reporting forms. State regulators can issue regulations for state banks as long as they do not conflict with federal law. State chartered banks have a state and primary federal regulator. Regulation and regulatory burden in the financial industry, especially in banking, are influenced by factors like bank size and charter. Policymakers tailor regulations based on risk profiles to reduce burden, with small banks facing less intense scrutiny if perceived healthier. Different activities attract varying levels of regulatory scrutiny based on risk, complexity, and impact on consumers and the economy. This leads to different compliance costs for banks offering different services and engaging in various activities. Some banks will have higher regulatory compliance costs due to involvement in more activities requiring oversight. Activities like operating in securities or derivatives markets trigger additional regulation. Size and charter are not closely correlated among federal bank regulators. FDIC regulates banks of varying sizes. The FDIC regulates a large number of banks with assets over and under $1 billion. Size is not the only factor in deciding to charter as a bank or credit union. Most credit unions are small, but there are also a few with assets exceeding $1 billion. It is challenging to determine the correlation between size and risk profile due to confidential supervisory ratings. Both small and large banks faced financial distress during and after the financial crisis. Size somewhat influences business model and types of activities. The FDIC regulates banks with assets over and under $1 billion. Size influences business model and activities. Small banks focus more on traditional banking, while large banks engage in a variety of activities. Some banks do not meet the criteria of a \"community bank.\" The comparison of data from bank holding company peer reports shows that large banks are more involved in complex activities than small banks. Size influences how banks are regulated and supervised, with smaller banks facing different regulations compared to larger banks. Some argue against a one-size-fits-all regulatory model for banks. The federal banking regulatory system treats all banks the same regardless of size, which has been criticized by some experts. The primary goal of regulation is to protect taxpayers from bank failures, regardless of the bank's size or activities. Governor Tarullo argues that regulatory reforms post-financial crisis have created different categories of banking organizations based on total assets, with varying regulatory requirements. This approach acknowledges that larger banks pose a risk to the broader financial system, not just the deposit insurance fund. Different sized banks face different regulations to address the varying risks they pose. Governor Tarullo argues that recent regulatory reforms have categorized banks based on size, with smaller banks facing lower levels of risk compared to larger banks. He suggests that specific regulations, such as the Volcker Rule, may be unnecessary for small banks. Overall, Tarullo believes that recent reforms have differentiated between banks based on size and provided exemptions for smaller banks. In rulemaking, small banks may receive special consideration through exemptions or tailoring to reduce regulatory burden. Congress or regulators can require this differentiation in rules issued for small banks. Governor Tarullo suggests recent reforms have categorized banks by size, with smaller banks facing lower risk levels and potentially not needing certain regulations like the Volcker Rule. In rulemaking, small banks may receive special consideration through exemptions or tailoring to reduce regulatory burden. Tailoring is used to ensure requirements still apply to small banks but reduce compliance burden, often based on asset size thresholds. Regulatory details are typically worked out by regulators, with different thresholds at various asset sizes like $1 billion, $10 billion, $50 billion, and $250 billion. Tailoring and exemptions have different strengths and weaknesses in reducing regulatory burden for small banks. In rulemaking, small banks may receive exemptions or tailored regulations to reduce burden. Exemptions and tailoring aim to balance benefits and costs for small banks. Policymakers consider whether to include exemptions, tailoring, or neither in regulations. Examples show how small banks have been exempted from long-standing regulations. The section discusses how small banks are affected by recent regulations and the special consideration they receive in the rulemaking process. Prior to recent financial reforms, small banks received exemptions or special treatment in certain rules, such as the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. This policy allows small bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets to hold more debt for acquisitions. The policy statement, referenced in the \"Collins Amendment\" to the Dodd-Frank Act, sets reserve requirements tailored in favor of small banks. Banks must hold cash reserves against deposits, with percentages graduated based on deposit amounts. Small banks have lower reserve requirements to account for their size. The policy statement in the \"Collins Amendment\" to the Dodd-Frank Act sets reserve requirements tailored for small banks, allowing them to use more deposits for profitable activities. Exemptions from certain regulations, like FDIC and Sarbanes-Oxley Act provisions, are provided for banks with assets below a certain threshold, easing regulatory burden based on institution size. This shows that regulations with exemptions and tailoring based on bank size have long existed. Exemptions and tailoring based on bank size have been increasingly applied in recent rulemakings. It is unclear if these exemptions represent a continuation of past trends or a shift away from a unitary regulatory approach. Evaluating the impact of new rules on small banks is challenging due to the variety of rules and their differing effects. This section focuses on \"major rules\" issued by banking regulators to highlight how they affect small banks. Since 2010, 14 major rules have been issued under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel Accords, with 13 having exemptions or tailored provisions for small banks. Prudential regulators and the CFPB have issued these rules, showing a lack of consistent approach in recent regulations. Recent regulations lack consistency in determining exemptions or tailoring, with varying thresholds based on asset size or number of activities. Major rules primarily target larger banks, such as the Dodd-Frank Act's enhanced prudential regime for banks with assets over $50 billion. Small banks may have some form of tailoring or exemption in these rules. The recent regulations have exemptions or tailoring based on asset size or activities. Rule #4 modified the Volcker Rule to make it easier for banks to hold securities backed by trust preferred securities. Small banks are exempt from six of the eight major rules, with the Volcker Rule tailored for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Small banks are also subject to some provisions of the Basel III Regulatory Capital Rule. The CFPB rules in Table 2 apply to entities involved in specific activities, with exemptions for small banks based on the covered activity. Mortgage servicing rules have exemptions based on the type of servicing performed. The Electronic Fund Transfers rule pertains to remittance transfers and Loan Originator activities. The Ability-To-Repay rule (#10) provides compliance options for small banks based on their asset size and activity performed. Table 2 helps understand which major rules apply to small banks but may not cover recent rulemaking. Other rules from the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel Accords could still burden small banks, not listed in the table. Recent major rules not related to these acts are also not included in the table. The table does not include recent major rules unrelated to the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel Accords, nor rules from the Treasury Department or securities regulators that may affect small banks. It is not an exhaustive list of all financial reform rules and may not accurately reflect the impact on small banks due to varying lengths, burdens, and complexities of the rules. Some requirements may be divided into multiple rules, and multiple regulatory goals may be combined into a single rule. The presence of exemptions or tailoring in a rule does not guarantee optimal structure for achieving regulatory goals while minimizing burden. Exemptions may only apply to a small part of a rule, leading to potential burden trickle-down effects on small banks. Market forces could also cause burden spread, as seen with pricing restrictions on debit card issuers potentially affecting small banks. Certain statutes require regulators to consider the regulatory burden on small banks when writing rules. For example, 12 U.S.C. Section 4802 mandates that each Federal banking agency must consider administrative burdens on depository institutions, including small ones. Similarly, 12 U.S.C. Section 5512(b) requires the CFPB to consider the impact of its rules on banks and credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets, allowing for exemptions based on total assets or transaction volume. Bank regulators are not required to perform a quantitative cost-benefit analysis for rules impacting small entities, including small banks. The Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates an assessment of the rule's impact on small entities if it will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of them. The definition of small entities is not clearly defined in the act. Since 2013, banking agencies and CFPB define a small bank as having assets of $500 million or less for the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), a lower threshold than other regulators. Rules must meet this test, and regulators can waive the requirement under certain circumstances. If a rule has a significant economic impact on small entities, the issuing regulator must describe reasons for the action, the affected small entities, compliance requirements, and alternatives to the rule. The CFPB is required to convene a small business review panel when developing a rule that may impact small entities economically. The panel collects advice on potential cost increases for small entities and alternatives to the rule that minimize these impacts. The CFPB, OMB, and SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy must issue a report of the panel's findings as part of the rulemaking process. Bank regulators are required by SBREFA to develop small entity compliance guides for rules with significant economic impact on small entities. In the past, banking regulators have not consistently fulfilled this requirement. When the OIG report was published, management at the Fed agreed with the recommendations and committed to implementing them. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires federal banking agencies to review outdated regulatory requirements on insured depository institutions every 10 years. The latest review process, initiated in June 2014, focuses on reducing the regulatory burden on community banks. Regulatory burden can also stem from supervision and enforcement actions. Regulators have incorporated differential treatment for small banks into supervision and enforcement processes. Small banks are supervised differently from large banks, with combined supervision for safety and soundness and consumer protection for banks with $10 billion or less in assets. This is seen as less burdensome for small banks, although they are still examined separately by the primary regulator for both aspects. Different subsidiaries of the same institution may be regulated by different regulators, leading to varying levels of regulatory burden. To ensure consistency, banking regulators coordinate through the FFIEC, offering training programs and employing a uniform bank rating system. Efforts are made to promote consistency across regulators and address regulatory burden issues within bank regulators. Regulatory supervision practices vary for banks of different sizes, with concerns that practices intended for large banks could affect smaller banks. Regulators address concerns of supervision practices trickling down to small banks by structuring internal organization with separate responsibilities for different bank sizes. The OCC has specific deputies for Midsize/Community Banking Supervision and Large Bank Supervision, along with separate guidelines in the Comptroller's Handbook. A subcommittee of Fed Board members focuses on reducing regulatory burden on community and regional banks. The subcommittee has initiatives to reduce regulatory burden on community banks. The Fed has separate supervisory frameworks based on bank size. The FDIC has separate offices for complex institutions and community banks. FDIC examiners are initially trained as community bank examiners. On-site examinations are part of the supervisory process. Regulators have visitorial powers including examination and inspection of banks, regulation of activities authorized by federal banking law, and enforcing compliance with laws. Banks are examined at least once every 12 months, but smaller banks with high ratings are examined every 18 months. Larger banks may have full-time on-site examiners for monitoring. Regulatory relief act in 2007 changed examination frequency from 12 to 18 months. Some large banks have full-time on-site examiners for monitoring and receive reports of findings after examinations. Regulators have established processes for banks to appeal examination results, including informal discussions with examiners and a formal appeals process mandated by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. Steps have been taken to reduce the regulatory burden of on-site examinations, such as the Fed's new examination program introduced in January 2014. The new bank examination program, introduced in January 2014, links examination intensity to the risk profile of individual community banks. Governor Tarullo mentioned in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee the shift towards spending less time on low-risk compliance issues at community banks. Additionally, efforts are being made to increase off-site supervisory activities to reduce the burden on community banks. Bank supervision is an ongoing process that includes monitoring data collected from banks, with the primary source being the quarterly Reports of Condition and Income submitted by banks. The FDIC emphasizes the importance of quarterly call reports for bank supervision, as they provide early indications of changes in risk profiles. The call report is structured to reduce burden on small banks, with data items tiered based on size and complexity. Community banks only need to fill out a fraction of the report, tailored to their business model. For example, a $75 million community bank reported data on only 14% of items and 40 pages. Bank regulators have taken steps to reduce the burden of regulatory reporting for small banks. The Fed announced reduced reporting requirements for holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets. Collaboration between the CFPB and prudential bank regulators aims to lessen regulatory burden. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) collaborates with prudential regulators to reduce regulatory burden by accessing reports and records during examinations. Bank regulators may require corrective measures if issues are identified, with informal and formal appeals processes available. During the examination process, bank examiners may request corrective actions to ensure compliance with laws. Regulators can enforce actions like prompt corrective directives or cease and desist orders, imposing penalties. Banks may seek legal expertise to understand enforcement actions, leading to added regulatory burden. Settlements are often reached to avoid legal actions, but terms can set new industry standards. Enforcement actions against other banks may deter certain business functions, even if allowed. Regulators publicly disclose formal enforcement actions on their website to provide transparency. Regulatory burden in the regulatory process is tailored to reduce the burden on small banks. Small banks receive differential treatment in rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement to impose less burden compared to larger banks. This differential treatment suggests there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to bank regulation. Most aspects of small bank regulation aim to impose less burden compared to larger banks, but it is unclear if the current regulatory structure is overly burdensome for small banks. Small banks may face excessive regulation due to multiple rulemakings from recent acts, or because they have less capacity for compliance. While exemptions and tailoring for small banks exist, they may not be efficiently targeted, and small banks could potentially benefit from additional regulatory relief without compromising consumer protection and safety goals. The recent financial crisis has led to a regulatory focus on mitigating systemic risk, which includes risks posed to financial stability by small banks. Governor Tarullo emphasized the role of systemic risk in moving away from a unitary model of bank regulation. This shift aims to balance regulatory relief for small banks while still protecting consumers and promoting financial stability. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to address the systemic risk posed by large banks by imposing heightened regulatory standards on them to prevent them from being \"too big to fail.\" This approach helps prevent moral hazard and levels the playing field in the banking industry. Heightened regulation aims to level the playing field by preventing large banks from having a funding advantage over smaller banks. It also seeks to reduce the likelihood of large banks failing and imposing losses on taxpayers. Critics argue that regulatory capture could worsen the moral hazard problem without effectively reducing risk-taking. The argument that small banks did not cause the financial crisis and should not face new regulations is debated. While small banks may pose less systemic risk, their failure during the crisis depleted the FDIC's insurance fund. The need for regulatory safeguards for small banks is questioned, as pre-crisis regulations may not have been sufficient to protect against risks. The debate continues on whether small banks should have less stringent regulations compared to large banks. The argument for regulating small banks differently from large banks includes potential economies of scale in regulatory compliance costs. Compliance costs, such as software, manpower, and specialized knowledge, may be relatively more costly for small firms as regulatory complexity increases. If regulatory compliance costs are subject to economies of scale, the balance of costs and benefits should be considered. Economies of scale in regulatory compliance costs can impact the balance of costs and benefits for banks of different sizes. Small banks may face costs outweighing benefits, leading to potential exemptions or simplified regulations. Empirical evidence is limited, but a study by the FDIC's inspector general suggests economies of scale in compliance, with smaller banks spending more time on exams. The 2013 CFPB study on compliance costs found some evidence of economies of scale, with larger banks experiencing higher costs. Independent Community Banks Association survey showed mixed evidence, with smaller banks having similar costs regardless of size, but larger banks facing significantly higher costs. The survey focused on small banks with less than $500 million in assets, lacking evidence for call report compliance costs for larger banks. Tailoring regulations for small banks may be necessary if few banks within a class engage in certain activities, due to differences in business models or policy issues primarily affecting large banks. Tarullo highlighted the Volcker Rule as an example of a regulation applying to all banks. Tarullo highlighted the Volcker Rule as a regulation applying to all banks, but argued that small banks were unlikely to pose the problems the rule was intended to address. Exempting nonactive institutions within a class from regulations may have compliance costs for nonparticipants, and lack of critical mass in risk exposure could reduce systemic concerns. Applying exemptions based on lack of critical mass may be best done. Some policymakers advocate tailoring regulations to favor small banks due to perceived unique public benefits, such as increased access to credit and lower prices. Empirical evidence on this is mixed, with small banks making fewer residential mortgages and credit card loans but more small business loans. Market forces should theoretically determine the best credit supply and pricing. In a perfectly competitive market, the lowest price and highest credit supply prevail, favoring small banks that offer broader access to credit without preferential policy. Regulatory burden based on size could distort credit allocation efficiency. However, if markets are not perfectly competitive, incumbents may benefit from barriers to entry, reducing competition. Arguments for small banks highlight their niche roles in rural and underserved areas. Small banks are argued to be better suited for extending credit to rural and underserved areas due to their personalized knowledge of risks and ability to engage in relationship banking. They argue for more flexible rules and exemptions to support this, citing examples of existing regulations that provide additional compliance options for lenders in rural areas. Small banks are also noted for making more agricultural loans compared to large banks, indicating that rigid regulations with standardized criteria may not be suitable for their relationship banking model. Some argue that standardized criteria are not suitable for the relationship banking model of small banks. Targeting rural or underserved communities directly may be more efficient than providing regulatory relief to small banks regardless of their credit provision. Community banks prefer portfolio lending over securitization, with some policymakers favoring the former due to its role in the financial crisis. Evaluating the desirability of reducing regulatory burden on small banks involves subjective value judgments on competing policy goals. Some argue that reducing the burden on small banks could lead to regulatory arbitrage, resulting in disparate treatment for consumers. Quantifying the regulatory burden for banks has been a challenge for researchers, including the FDIC, GAO, and CFPB. The FDIC's \"Community Banking Study\" found that tracking regulatory compliance costs is difficult for institutions. The interview participants mentioned the challenges of tracking regulatory compliance costs within their internal cost structure. GAO reported industry officials' difficulty in predicting the impact of Dodd-Frank Act provisions on community banks and credit unions. Quantifying the regulatory burden on small banks remains a challenge, with CFPB conducting a case study on compliance costs at seven banks. The CFPB conducted a study on compliance costs at seven banks of varying sizes for four regulations, finding that smaller banks spend a higher percentage of their retail operating expenses on compliance compared to larger banks. The report highlights challenges in analyzing regulatory burden, noting that banks do not track their full compliance costs thoroughly. Regulators are not required to provide quantitative estimates for all rules issued, leading to incomplete information on regulatory burden. Banking regulators must \"consider costs\" under 12 U.S.C. \u00a74802 but do not have to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. A study by the CFPB found that smaller banks spend a higher percentage of their retail operating expenses on compliance compared to larger banks. Regulatory costs and benefits were not quantified for major rules under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB quantified costs for two rules and discussed costs and benefits for three rules, but no cost-benefit analysis was found for the other four rules. Small banks' costs and benefits were qualitatively discussed, with no quantitative estimates specifically for them. Regulators use a lower threshold for small entities in their analysis compared to the definition used by FDIC, Fed, or OCC. Regulatory Flexibility Act requires assessment only for rules with significant economic impact on small entities. Table 3 summarizes impact on small entities for 14 major rules under Dodd-Frank. The prudential regulators found that out of the 14 major rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, seven rules had no significant impact on small entities, while one rule had an undetermined impact. The Basel III Regulatory Capital rule was estimated to have a significant impact on 146 banks with less than $500 million in assets, resulting in a capital shortfall, compliance costs, and lost tax benefits. The CFPB could not rule out significant impacts on small entities for the five rules it issued, with uncertainties in the number of affected entities. Thrifts, credit unions, and non-banks with less than $175 million in assets participated in the activity addressed by the rule, but the regulators provided no quantitative estimate of costs or the number of firms covered by exemptions. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires regulators to estimate the hours banks spend complying with information requests, but data on hours spent by small vs. large banks is not distinguished, complicating the estimation of regulatory burden for small banks. This results in regulators estimating only partial, if any, costs. Regulators estimate only partial, if any, costs associated with regulation, especially for new rules. There are no requirements to estimate the overall costs of regulation. Quantitative assessments may help understand the burden, but there are arguments against performing them. Regulatory burden is not fully understood when rules are aggregated. Regulators often struggle to accurately estimate the costs and benefits of new rules, especially for complex regulations. Quantitative assessments could increase resources needed for rulemaking and may not fully capture the broad benefits that accrue to the population. High uncertainty in cost-benefit analyses could potentially be misleading and do more harm than good. Regulators do not regularly report data on the burden stemming from supervision. Bank regulators' inspectors general conducted studies on the regulatory burden to small banks from compliance with supervisory exams. OCC community bank exams typically took 120 days or less, but sometimes took up to a year. FDIC community bank risk-management exams varied in length based on the size of the bank. From 2007 to 2011, bank exams varied in length based on supervisory ratings, with poor-rated banks having shorter exams and good-rated banks having longer exams. The FDIC spent 24 to 57 days on risk management exams, while Fed exams averaged 63 to 79 days. Banks can appeal exam results to the agency Ombudsman, and the frequency of appeals may indicate bank displeasure. The frequency of appeals to the agency Ombudsman by banks regarding exam results is relatively low. Banks formally appealed a small number of OCC, FDIC, and Fed exam results between 2007 and 2011. Disputes are often resolved through the supervisory process before exams are completed. The regulatory burden associated with call reports has increased according to a survey by the Independent Community Bankers of America. The regulatory burden associated with call reports has increased over the last ten years, with a significant increase in hours and costs noted by respondents. Regulators argue that call reports are tailored to reduce burden on small banks, but there is a lack of empirical evidence on the overall regulatory burden posed by bank regulation. The regulatory burden on small banks compared to large banks has been a topic of discussion, with different approaches being considered. Governor Tarullo's view on a shift away from the unitary model may prompt Congress to evaluate the best regulatory model. Various options exist, from treating all banks equally regardless of size to implementing separate regulatory regimes for small and large banks. Without changes, banks will continue to be regulated based on their charter and size. The regulatory burden on small banks compared to large banks has been a topic of discussion. All banks will continue to be assigned a primary regulator by charter and subject to the same regulations, with exemptions or tailoring based on size. New legislation can add size exemptions in existing statutes, allowing for tailored exemptions based on the regulation's purpose. The disadvantage of varying exemption sizes based on issue is a lack of coherence and consistency in regulatory structure, adding complexity. Ad hoc exemption levels may not be optimally set and could be influenced by political dynamics. Maintaining the status quo model makes it challenging to address regulations needing exemptions. Moving to a consistent exemption size for all regulations could provide clarity and discretion for regulators. The advantages and disadvantages of standardized criteria for exemptions in regulations include more consistency and predictability but less flexibility. Policymakers need to consider where to set the exemption level and how frequently it should be applied to reduce the regulatory burden on small banks. Additionally, the possibility of retroactively applying a standard exemption to existing regulations should be considered. The question of whether the exemption should be set high for large, complex banks or low for broader application arises if policymakers move towards a single exemption level. The debate revolves around setting exemption levels in regulations for banks, particularly regional banks. Policymakers are considering whether to have varying exemption levels based on standardized criteria or a unitary model with a consistent exemption size. This decision involves weighing the benefits of regulation against the costs and determining the appropriate level of exemption. One policy option is to replace the current system with charters and regulators based on a size threshold, such as a \"community bank\" charter and a \"large complex organization\" charter. This could lead to a broader reevaluation of the number of charters and regulators, potentially reducing regulatory burden. One potential solution to reduce regulatory burden and complexity is to establish separate charters and regulators based on size thresholds for banks. This could allow for more tailored regulations to fit the business models of large and small banks. However, having two separate regulatory architectures could lead to increased complexity and potential weaknesses in the system. A size-based charter system for banks could lead to regulatory capture issues, where regulators may prioritize the interests of the banks they oversee rather than the public interest. This could result in conflicting regulations and opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, similar to past problems with the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) due to concerns of regulatory capture and insufficient monitoring of riskiness. Problems with the OTS included lack of expertise in regulating large, complex organizations like Washington Mutual and AIG. A size-based charter system could potentially avoid issues like charter shopping and regulatory expertise gaps if applied at the holding company level. Moving to a true unitary approach in banking regulation could reduce the number of charters and regulators, potentially decreasing regulatory burden and complexity. This approach aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and improve the efficiency of financial intermediation and credit allocation. However, it may lead to less targeted regulations for diverse banks. Less targeted regulations could impose regulatory costs on banks not relevant to them. Small banks losing exemptions from regulations could be worse off, but a level playing field might benefit them. Critics claim Dodd-Frank benefits large banks due to regulatory capture, formalizing their too big to fail status. Ending enhanced prudential regulatory regime for large banks could benefit small banks. The impact on small banks depends on how size-based exemptions are reworked. A level playing field approach may be supported regardless of one's stance on bank regulation. This report analyzed the regulatory burden on small versus large banks, finding that small banks have received accommodations in recent major rules. Despite an increase in regulatory burden for small banks since the financial crisis, they have not been disproportionately affected compared to larger banks. Thirteen out of 14 major rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Act include exemptions or cost reductions for small banks. The report distinguishes between regulatory burden and unduly burdensome regulations, highlighting the importance of balancing costs and benefits. It does not assess whether the absolute burden on small banks is excessive, as this depends on policymakers' considerations of financial stability, credit availability, and consumer protection. The recent increase in regulatory burden may impact small banks' competitiveness with non-banks but should not hinder their ability to compete with larger banks. Accurately assessing regulatory burden is crucial for policymakers to make informed decisions. Overestimating or underestimating this burden can have negative consequences such as consolidation in the banking industry, migration of activity to the shadow banking system, and reduced access to credit for rural and underserved areas. Quantifying the magnitude of regulatory burden remains a challenge for researchers as banks do not track their compliance. In discussing unduly burdensome regulation, the focus is often on banks due to the direct cost they bear. Policymakers should consider the potential effects of regulatory relief on consumers, market stability, and the banking system. Regulators have the authority to provide relief to small banks without congressional action, but without it, exemptions and adjustments to rules may continue inconsistently."
