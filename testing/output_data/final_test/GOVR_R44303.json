The reconstruction efforts have been slow, with concerns about winter approaching and little progress made. The earthquake spurred the second Constituent Assembly to reach agreement on a new plan. The second Constituent Assembly in Nepal reached an agreement on a new constitution in 2013, which was voted into effect with 507 out of 601 members in favor. The constitution does not delineate provinces along ethnic lines, leading to protests, especially due to a provision granting full Nepali citizenship only to those with two Nepali parents. This has sparked agitation, particularly in the Terai region. The release of Nepal's new constitution triggered violent protests from disaffected groups in the south, who claim it discriminates against them. The United States has friendly relations with Nepal and aims to help it build a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic society. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. Nepal, the 17th-poorest country in the world, has a great need for economic development and foreign assistance. The United States has provided $1.6 billion in assistance to Nepal since 1951, focusing on fostering a more democratic, prosperous, and resilient country through inclusive governance, sustainable economic growth, and increased human capital. The United States provides assistance to Nepal for economic development, democratic institutions, and poverty alleviation. The FY2016 foreign assistance request for Nepal is $82.4 million. A bipartisan Congressional Nepal Caucus chaired by Representatives Anders Crenshaw and Jared Polis supports U.S. policy objectives towards Nepal. The House Democracy Partnership and Peace Corps have also engaged with Nepal in the past. Between 1962 and 2004, over 4,200 Peace Corps volunteers served in Nepal until the program was suspended due to civil war. It was restarted in 2012, with around 70 volunteers currently working on food security projects. Nepal is a parliamentary democracy with a Prime Minister and cabinet, and a largely ceremonial presidency. The Constituent Assembly has 601 seats, with the Nepali Congress Party and the Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist-Leninist leading the government in coalition. Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML became Prime Minister in October 2015, succeeding Sushil Koirala of the NC. Oli has taken a tougher stance towards India and is perceived as less sympathetic towards the Madhese of the Terai region. Parliament elected Bidhya Devi Bhandari as Nepal's first female President on October 28, 2015. The Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, once the largest party, is now the third-largest in the Constituent Assembly. The Nepali Congress and CPN-UML hold a strong majority with 371 out of 575 seats. Ethnic and regional tensions, particularly between the Madhese of the Terai and the Pahadi people, have led to violent protests over the constitution, resulting in 45 deaths, mostly in the Terai region. The Madhese people in Nepal's Terai region have expressed discontent with the political status quo, leading to political agitation and violence in 2007-2008. This resulted in negotiations with the government to address discrimination against the Madhese. Strikes and police curfews in the Terai have restricted trade with India, causing severe fuel shortages in Nepal. India denies imposing an unofficial blockade to force changes in Nepal's constitution. The Government of Nepal responded to a fuel shortage by seeking to reduce dependence on India and gain access to fuel from China. Nepal signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China to import petroleum products, potentially reducing India's leverage. The Maoists supported redrawing the country's district map based on ethnic identity, which could exacerbate divisions within Nepali society. The main geographic division in Nepal is between the low-lying Terai region and the mountainous areas. Nepal has a diverse population with Hindu and Buddhist majorities. The country transitioned from strict monarchy to constitutional monarchy in 1959. In the 1950s, Nepal began transitioning from strict monarchy to constitutional monarchy. King Mahendra issued a new constitution in 1959 and held the country's first democratic elections. However, in 1960, the king declared the parliamentary system a failure, leading to the suspension of the constitution and the establishment of a party-less system of rule under the monarchy. Despite the ban on political parties, they continued to operate and advocate for a return to constitutional democracy. In 1990, the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy was launched by student groups and major political parties, leading to peaceful demonstrations in urban centers. After a deadly confrontation with police, King Birendra handed power to an interim government, which drafted a new constitution in November 1990. In 1990, Nepal transitioned to a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch. The Communist Party of Nepal Maoist launched a \"People's War\" to replace the monarchy with a communist regime due to government corruption and failure to improve citizens' lives. The Maoists ran a parallel government, redistributed seized property, and waged insurgency through torture and killings. The Nepali Maoists waged insurgency through torture, killings, and bombings targeting authorities. They funded their activities through bank robberies and \"revolutionary tax.\" In June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra killed his parents and other royal family members, leading to King Gyanendra's coronation. Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala stepped down in July 2001 amid unrest. In July 2001, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala resigned due to instability and failure to address the Maoist insurgency. He was replaced by Sher Bahadur Deuba, who faced a constitutional crisis in 2002 when King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and extended emergency rule. This led to a lawsuit filed by 56 former MPs against the Prime Minister. In August 2002, the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit against the Prime Minister regarding the dissolution of parliament during emergency rule. Despite the pledge of no emergency rule during the November 2002 elections, the government considered measures to prevent Maoist disruptions, including imposing a partial state of emergency. Opposition parties argued that emergency rule would hinder free and fair elections and urged dialogue with the Maoists as an alternative. The government initially planned to hold elections in stages over two months starting in mid-November to ensure security. However, due to the risky security situation, the cabinet asked King Gyanendra to postpone the national elections for a year. The king then dismissed the prime minister, disbanded the cabinet, and assumed executive powers. The security situation worsened after the collapse of the cease-fire between the Maoists and the government in August 2003. The Maoists wanted to draft a new constitution abolishing the monarchy, while the king wanted them to disarm. After seizing power in early 2005, King Gyanendra tried to defeat the Maoists without political support, leading to the decline of the monarchy's power in Nepal. He aimed to assert control over democratic forces and use the Royal Nepal Army to defeat the Maoists, but made little progress due to internal disarray and a split in the Maoist leadership. The king failed to reinstate constitutional democracy within 100 days of assuming power, leading to continued restrictions on civil liberties. Despite releasing some political prisoners, many remained under arrest. The U.N. established a human rights monitoring team in Nepal in 2005. The king's actions against the democrats inadvertently strengthened the Maoists' position. The king's actions inadvertently strengthened the Maoists' position by occupying almost half of the RNA with palace security, civil administration, and restrictions on communications and civil rights. The king's legitimacy was weakened due to the circumstances of his rule and poor perceptions of his son, Prince Paras Shah. The Maoists blockaded major highways in response, leading to clashes with the RNA and disrupting trade. In 2004, the Maoists blockaded Kathmandu, causing food prices to double and fuel to be rationed. This tactic increased pressure on the king's government and demonstrated their political power. In April 2006, King Gyanendra handed over power to a Seven Party Alliance after facing popular resistance and protests against direct royal rule in Nepal. The alliance included parties like Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Nepal Sadbhavana Party. In May 2006, six of the seven political parties formed a coalition government to promote a more democratic Nepal in the face of direct rule by the king. In November 2006, the Seven Party Alliance and the Maoists reached a peace agreement, ending a decade-old insurgency that claimed over 13,000 lives. The Maoists agreed to put down their arms and postpone a decision on the future of the monarchy until after the election of a Constituent Assembly. Constituent Assembly elections were delayed but eventually held in April 2008. A second CA was elected in 2013 with increased voter turnout. The Nepali Congress Party and CPN-UML gained power, leading to a new constitution in September 2015. Nepal's economy faces challenges post-2015 earthquake. Nepal's economy is struggling to recover from the 2015 earthquake and political unrest in the Terai region, which has disrupted cross-border trade with India. The GDP growth is expected to slow down to 3.4% in 2015, with the fuel shortage being a major issue. New agreements with China may reduce Nepal's reliance on India for fuel imports. There are concerns that the trade blockade could lead to negative economic growth, something Nepal has not experienced since 1982. Rebuilding infrastructure and housing damaged by the earthquake will be a long-term challenge. The 2015 earthquake in Nepal caused extensive damage, with recovery efforts estimated to take years. The Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of recovery at $7.1 billion, equivalent to one-third of Nepal's GDP. Development partners have pledged $4 billion in grants and loans over five years to support reconstruction. Nepal's economy heavily relies on agriculture, which employs 75% of the workforce. The United States, India, China, and Germany are key trade partners for Nepal. The United States and Nepal have signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to enhance bilateral trade and investment. U.S. exports to Nepal include agricultural products, aircraft parts, optic and medical instruments, and machinery. Nepal has substantial hydropower potential with an estimated 40,000 MW, but has only developed 680 MW so far. The United States is supporting Nepal's hydropower development through a $9.8 million project. China and India are supporting Nepal's hydropower development. China's China International Water and Electric Corporation has an 80% share in the 25 MW Madi Hydro project in Kaski District. They are also investing $1.6 billion in a 750 MW hydropower project in West Seti. Remittances from Nepalis working abroad are crucial to the economy, estimated to be 20-30% of GDP. The value is predicted to increase from $7.1 billion in 2014 to $8.8 billion in 2016, with 3.5 million Nepalese working abroad mainly in unskilled or semi-skilled jobs. Popular destinations include Saudi Arabia, South Korea, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Malaysia, and Oman. Nepal faces human rights concerns including political turmoil delaying the establishment of key commissions, discrimination based on caste and ethnicity, poor prison conditions, and corruption. Restrictions on freedom of assembly and harassment of the media are reported, along with limited freedoms for refugees. Forced and bonded labor, as well as trafficking in persons, are persistent issues in the country. Trafficking in persons is a serious problem in Nepal, with emerging trends including organ trafficking, internal trafficking, fake foreign marriages, and international labor trafficking. Around 20,000 women and young girls are trafficked from Nepal to India annually. The 2015 earthquake may have increased vulnerability to traffickers. USAID and the State Department have recognized Nepal's efforts to combat human trafficking, with the country receiving a \"Tier 2\" ranking in the Trafficking in Persons report. Nepal made progress in preventing human trafficking, leading to 203 convictions in 2014. Discrimination against lower castes, especially Dalits, hindered their access to Hindu temples. Thousands of Lhotshampa refugees from Bhutan were resettled by countries like the United States, Australia, and Canada. The Tibetan population in Nepal, totaling 15,000-20,000 people, consists of refugees who fled from Tibet following the Dalai Lama's escape to India in 1959. Nepal recognized Tibetans as refugees between 1959 and 1989, but after 1989, they were only allowed to transit through Nepal on their way to India due to diplomatic pressure from China. Restrictions on Tibetans' rights in Nepal have increased since 2008, with fewer Tibetans crossing from China into Nepal. The number of Tibetans crossing from China into Nepal has decreased significantly since 2008, from 2,200 per year to 171 in 2013. In 2015, Congress allocated funds to support Tibetan communities in Nepal and India. Nepal's ecological regions include the Terai, hill, and Himalaya regions, with diverse eco-climatalogical conditions due to its altitude gradient and location. Nepal, located at the interface of the Tibetan plateau and the plains of northern India, faces climate change challenges due to its altitudinal gradient and mountainous terrain. The country is heavily reliant on natural resources and agriculture, making it vulnerable to soil loss, glacial lake growth, and flooding. Nepal is ranked as the 13th most vulnerable country to climate change and is a focus country for the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative. Erosion, landslides, and floods are major causes of agricultural decline in Nepal due to deforestation. Between 1990 and 2005, Nepal lost 24.5% of its forest cover. Rising temperatures may increase diseases like malaria. Changes in monsoon rains could impact Nepalese livelihoods. Nepal's poverty hinders its ability to mitigate climate change impacts. Despite global poaching, Nepal has made progress in protecting endangered species. Nepal has successfully protected its endangered species, with no rhino poaching reported in 2013. This contrasts with South Africa, where rhino poaching increased significantly. The key to Nepal's success lies in army patrols and a community-based approach to wildlife protection. The country's integrated approach involves collaboration between park agencies, law enforcement, Interpol, and local communities. tensions along the India-China border have also impacted Nepal due to its geopolitical position. Tensions along the India-China border have led to troop buildups, impacting Nepal due to its geopolitical position. Nepal maintains amicable relations with both nations, with closer ties to India in trade, culture, and defense cooperation. Nepal heavily relies on India for imports, exports, foreign investment, and access to the sea. Some Nepali leaders seek a more independent foreign policy to reduce Indian economic influence. Nepal seeks independence in foreign policy to reduce Indian influence. India and Nepal have strengthened ties with agreements on loans and assistance. India's influence on Nepal's constitution and energy supply remains a point of contention. China's increasing influence in Nepal, particularly in energy and trade, is seen as a challenge to India's dominance in the region. China's economic engagement with South Asian countries is viewed with geopolitical concern by some analysts in New Delhi. China's assistance to Nepal after the earthquake and plans to extend railway lines show its growing presence in the region. Nepal serves as a transit country for Tibetans fleeing Chinese repression, with most moving on to settle in India. The government closely monitors Tibetan refugees, restricting their freedom and access to public services. Nepal is a significant contributor to U.N. peacekeeping missions, with 4,000 troops and 1,000 police deployed in 2015. The U.S. provided $1.8 million in peacekeeping equipment to Nepal that year."
