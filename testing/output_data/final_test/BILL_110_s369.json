    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that since September 11, 2001, the United States has been engaged in a unique war, where terrorists view everyone as the enemy. The tragic deaths at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon represent an escalation of direct terrorist attacks on civilians, including the brave responders who perished on that day. Since September 11, 2001, heroic actions were taken by officers, rescue workers, government employees, and passengers to prevent further casualties and ensure the safety of innocent Americans. In response to the unprecedented attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, it is appropriate to recognize the sacrifice of the victims with a medal. SEC. 3.
