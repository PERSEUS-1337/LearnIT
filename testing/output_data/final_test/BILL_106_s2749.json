Congress finds that the nineteenth-century westward movement over the California National Historic Trail was significant in the development of the western United States and in preventing colonization by Russia and the British Empire. Over 300,000 settlers completed the journey, leaving behind records and stories. Recognition and interpretation of this movement are deemed appropriate due to its national scope and strong interest from the people of the United States. The California Trail, including the Hastings Cutoff and the trail of the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, is recognized for its national, historical, and cultural significance. The purpose is to provide an interpretive facility highlighting the vital role of trails in the West in the development of the United States.

The California Trail Interpretive Center, established by the Secretary of the Interior, aims to showcase the importance of Western trails in US development. The Secretary may establish the \"California Trail Interpretive Center\" near Elko, Nevada to interpret the history of the California Trail. A master plan study will guide the development of the Center, including design details and site description. The California Trail Interpretive Center near Elko, Nevada will include details on site location, acquisition method and cost, construction cost, operation and maintenance cost, and non-Federal entity participation. The Secretary may acquire land for the Center through donation, purchase, or exchange, and involve the Advisory Board for local input.

The \"Education Land Grant Act\" allows the Secretary of Agriculture to convey National Forest System lands to public school districts for educational purposes, as long as certain criteria are met. This includes using the land for elementary or secondary schools, serving the public interest, not conflicting with National Forest System needs, and staying within a reasonable acreage limit.

The conveyance must serve public objectives, the applicant must be capable of implementing the project, the land must be identified for disposal in a land management plan, and public participation must be provided. A conveyance under the Education Land Grant Act cannot exceed 80 acres and must be for a nominal cost without transferring mineral or water rights. The exact acreage and legal description will be determined by a survey paid for by the applicant. The Secretary must review applications within a 14-day period. Before the end of the 14-day period, the Secretary must provide notice of receipt of the application to the applicant. Within 120 days, a final determination must be made on conveying land or reasons for not doing so must be provided.
