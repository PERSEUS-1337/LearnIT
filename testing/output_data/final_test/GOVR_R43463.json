The 113th Congress debated extending the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 to encourage international visitors to the U.S. The Brand USA program was extended through September 30, 2020. The travel and tourism industry has grown significantly post-World War II, supporting over 100 million jobs in 2013. The number of international tourist trips has increased from 25 million in 1950 to over 1 billion in 2013, with projections to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. Tourism is expected to account for 10% of global GDP by 2024. The travel industry is highly competitive, with Europe and North America losing market share to other destinations. The United States is the second-most popular destination for foreign visitors, with tourists spending an average of $4,500 domestically. Foreign visitors stay for over 17 nights and outspend domestic visitors. The United States received 6.2% of global tourism arrivals in 2012. In 2012, the United States received 6.2% of global tourism arrivals and accounted for over 15% of global spending on travel and tourism. The World Economic Forum ranked the US as the sixth-most competitive country in travel and tourism. However, UNWTO projections suggest that the US share of the global tourism market will decline as travelers explore other destinations. China's travel and tourism market is expanding rapidly, with 83 million Chinese travelers abroad in 2012, expected to surpass the US as the world's largest tourist market by 2023 in terms of GDP contribution. The annual number of Indian outbound travelers is expected to rise to 50 million by 2020, while Brazilians visiting the United States are predicted to climb to almost 3 million by 2019. The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures travel and tourism across industry categories, with tourism industries accounting for 2.6% of U.S. GDP in 2012. Domestic travelers were responsible for about 80% of this activity. Tourism output in 2013 reached over $850 billion, with domestic travelers accounting for 80% of the activity. Despite a 3.6% growth in tourism output, it was still 3% lower than the peak year of 2007. Tourism generates revenue for state and local governments through taxes on hotel rooms, rentals, and tickets, without burdening their own citizens. Selective sales taxes, including those on hotel rooms, rental cars, and certain items, generated $67 billion in 2012, accounting for 5% of state and local tax revenues. Sales taxes on amusements added $7 billion. A 2005 study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that rural counties with more tourism activities experienced higher population and job growth, along with other economic benefits. The study found that rural recreation and tourism development can provide greater economic diversification compared to other types of growth. The travel and tourism sector is labor-intensive, creating large employment opportunities with minimal training or education requirements. Approximately 5.4 million people were employed in travel and tourism in 2013, but employment levels had not fully recovered from the 2007-2009 recession. The travel and tourism industry is a significant employer, especially in states like California, Florida, and Texas. Wages are a major expense, with average compensation for employees in food services and retail trade services. Low wages are common due to seasonal or part-time jobs, low barriers to entry, and a young workforce. Worker turnover is higher in this industry compared to others. The turnover in travel and tourism businesses is higher than the overall labor force. Some segments of the industry pay higher wages, such as gambling, travel arrangement services, and motion picture arts, with average annual compensation ranging from $75,000 to over $100,000. Tourism exports refer to the money spent by foreign visitors in the US on travel-related goods and services. The U.S. Department of Commerce has refined travel statistics to cover all types of travel, including health and educational purposes. Foreign visitors tend to take longer trips and spend more per day. Tourism exports totaled $214.8 billion in 2013, accounting for 9% of all U.S. goods and services exports. Tourism exports have grown strongly over the past decade, except in 2009 due to poor economic conditions in Europe. In 2013, an estimated 61.9 million U.S. residents traveled outside the United States, with Mexico and Canada accounting for over half of outbound travel. The U.S. trade surplus in travel and tourism services grew from $16 billion to $78 billion between 2004 and 2013. Visitor volume is expected to exceed 90 million by 2019, with foreign visitors contributing significantly to the tourism industry. Foreign visitors account for a significant portion of U.S. travel and tourism spending, with estimates showing they contributed 24% to lodging, 20% to food and beverage, and 26% to air transportation demand in 2012. On average, foreigners spend more on their U.S. travels than Americans. For example, in 2011, the average Chinese visitor spent $7,107, the average Brazilian tourist $5,605, and the average Indian visitor $6,664. Visitors from the European Union made up a fifth of total visitor receipts in the United States in 2013. Receipts from emerging market visitors like China and Brazil have grown rapidly since 2008. Cultural heritage tourism is a leading area of tourism that focuses on authentic experiences representing the stories and people of the past and present. Activities include visiting museums, attending cultural events, and exploring national parks and monuments. The United States has established 49 National Heritage Areas to promote cultural heritage travel. The Bureau of Land Management in the United States promotes heritage tourism through workshops and educational activities. Sustainable tourism, such as ecotourism, focuses on utilizing natural resources while supporting local economies and minimizing environmental impact. Organizations like WTTC's greenglobe.org and blueflag.org verify eco-friendly facilities. Meetings and conventions account for over 40% of business travel spending in the US, with exhibit space increasing by 50% in the last 20 years. Exhibit space in the United States has increased by 50% over the last 20 years, with 44 new convention spaces planned or constructed since 2005. Medical tourism involves traveling to access medical services not available locally, with estimates of tourists ranging from 60,000 to 50 million annually. Agritourism supplements farming income with tourism activities, with 33,161 farms providing services valued at $704 million. Space tourism is being pursued by private companies like SpaceX. Space tourism is a growing industry with private companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic offering orbital and suborbital flights. Legal and policy questions surrounding space tourism were discussed in a 2014 hearing. Countries manage tourism policy at the national level, with some having dedicated ministers for tourism. In 2012, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region spent billions on marketing programs to promote international travel. In 2012, countries like Australia, Mexico, Canada, and South Africa invested over $100 million annually in marketing programs to attract international tourists. The United States focuses on promotional activities to encourage foreign residents to travel there. The Department of Commerce's Office of Travel and Tourism Industries works on improving the sector's international competitiveness. Regulation of travel and tourism is handled by various federal agencies, with state-level control over liquor licensing and casino gambling. In recent Congresses, lawmakers have enacted legislation to assist tourism-related industries and held hearings on the impact of travel and tourism on the U.S. economy. Federal involvement in tourism promotion dates back to the International Travel Act of 1961, which established the U.S. Travel Service. Funding for travel promotion was reinstated in 2003 through the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution. The Travel Promotion Act established the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board and Brand USA for international advertising. Funding is supported by a $10 fee on ESTA applications and a matching contribution from the U.S. tourism industry, capped at $100 million annually. Congress extended the TPA through September 30, 2020. The federal contribution to the Brand USA program is capped at $100 million a year, despite DHS collecting about $140 million annually from the $10 fee. Critics question the program's efficacy and the appropriateness of federal funds for tourism advertising. There is limited empirical evidence on the value of tourism advertising, making it challenging to isolate its impact from other factors affecting international travel to the U.S. A joint report by Oxford Economics and U.S. Travel found that Brand USA marketing in FY2013 generated 1.1 million additional trips and $3.4 billion in visitor spending. A study on a pilot travel marketing campaign in the UK from 2004 to 2008 brought 362,500 extra travelers to the U.S. Different states have varying methods to measure tourism marketing impact, with California showing the highest return on investment. In 2009, a study found that Colorado's tourism marketing activities led to a $20 return in state and local tax revenue for each dollar spent. After halting marketing in 1993, leisure visits to Colorado declined by 8.4% from 1994 to 1997, but rebounded after promotional activities resumed in 1998. The State Department's Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is crucial for encouraging foreign travel to the U.S., with nearly 20 million people entering under the VWP in FY2013. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has expanded to 38 countries, with nearly 20 million people entering under the VWP in FY2013. Concerns have been raised about the VWP's impact on national security due to lack of screening for travelers. President Obama established a Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness to increase international visitor volume to 100 million by 2021. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of 2015 (H.R. 158) would suspend a country's participation in the VWP if requirements are not met. In the 113th Congress, bills were considered to expand visa-free travel and ease the visa process. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 included provisions to increase the scope of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), reduce visa processing delays, and establish a premium processing category for visa services. Other bills proposed allowing Poland, Hong Kong, and Israel to participate in the VWP. U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened preclearance posts at foreign airports for passengers to clear customs before boarding flights to the United States. Preclearance posts at foreign airports allow travelers to clear customs before boarding flights to the United States, treating them as domestic passengers upon arrival. This potentially makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination. Preclearance is offered at airports in six countries, including the controversial Abu Dhabi facility. Critics argue that it gives an advantage to Etihad Airways over US carriers. Qatar and Dubai are also considering preclearance customs posts. In the 114th Congress, Representative Shelia Jackson Lee reintroduced the Putting Security First in Preclearance Act (H.R. 82) to require a security assessment before expanding customs preclearance operations. Representative Patrick Meehan introduced the Preclearance Authorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 3488) to examine the potential effects on the U.S. airline industry. Online travel companies not affiliated with lodging or transportation companies account for one-fifth of travel bookings made online in the United States. U.S. online travel sales are expected to grow to $145.2 billion. The online travel industry is experiencing growth, with U.S. online travel sales projected to reach $145.2 billion in 2014. There are ongoing disputes between online travel companies and state governments over hotel taxes, with differing opinions on tax collection. The National Conference of State Legislatures recommends taxes be based on the full retail price paid by the user. The vehicle rental industry has also raised concerns about state and local taxation policies. The vehicle rental industry has raised objections to state and local taxes, with 118 different excise taxes on car rentals in 43 states and the District of Columbia. Representative Steve Cohen introduced a bill to prohibit discriminatory taxes on rental vehicles, supported by various organizations to prevent price increases for consumers. The League of Cities, National Association of Counties, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and Government Finance Officers Association opposed a bill that would preempt state authority. Cruise ships from U.S. ports carried nearly 10 million passengers in 2013, with Florida's ports accounting for over 60% of embarkations. Congressional hearings have addressed safety concerns on cruise ships, leading to the adoption of the Cruise Industry Passenger Bill of Rights in 2013. Despite efforts to improve passenger security, the Cruise Passenger Protection Act and Cruise Vessel Consumer Confidence Act were not enacted by the 113th Congress. In July 2014, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on the Cruise Passenger Protection Act. In 2014, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation discussed legislation regarding federal agency spending on conferences. The proposed Conference Accountability Act aimed to limit expenditures and increase transparency by requiring agencies to post conference details online. The travel and tourism industry is impacted by various congressional actions, including federal funding for national parks, minimum wage, and visa policies. The travel and tourism industry is impacted by various congressional actions, including federal funding for national parks, minimum wage, visa and immigration reform policy, and proposals to expand online gambling. The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures the economic output of U.S. industries, but travel and tourism do not fit neatly into this regime due to its diverse consumption spending across industries. UNWTO spearheaded an international effort to create a consistent gauge of tourism's economic impact in the mid-1990s. The UNWTO led an international effort in the mid-1990s to create a consistent gauge of travel and tourism. The United States now uses Tourism Satellite Accounts (TTSAs) to measure spending by visitors, including those traveling for business, religious, or educational purposes. The TTSAs provide a broad look at travel and tourism as an economic sector. The United States uses Tourism Satellite Accounts (TTSAs) to measure spending by visitors for business, religious, or educational purposes. The TTSAs provide a broad economic sector view of travel and tourism, estimating the economic impact through various data sources. The BEA estimates direct spending on goods and services by travelers, including meals, hotel rooms, and taxi trips. Indirect spending related to travel and tourism is also considered. However, the sum of direct and indirect spending can be misleading in discussions of the economy. There is no agreed-upon system for creating state or local satellite accounts, and TTSAs have some shortcomings, such as not counting second homes used exclusively by owners for vacations. The TTSAs do not include second homes used exclusively by owners for vacations or consumer-owned vehicles in their measurements of the tourism industry. Adding data on personal cars could have increased the industry's size by over $50 billion in 1998."
