    "content": "Panama, with a population of 3.8 million, has seen political and economic progress since the 1989 U.S. intervention that removed General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power. The country has had five elected civilian governments since then, with a sixth set to take office in 2014. President Ricardo Martinelli, in office since 2009, has been popular despite criticism for his governing style. The economy, largely services-based, has been thriving due to the Panama Canal expansion project. The Panama Canal expansion project, started in 2007 and set to finish in early 2016, has spurred political progress in Panama. Elected civilian democracy has been sustained for nearly 25 years, a significant change from previous military rule under General Torrijos and General Noriega. President Endara's coalition government made strides in restoring democratic institutions post-Noriega, while President Balladares implemented economic reforms. The Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) implemented economic reforms including trade liberalization and privatization of state-owned enterprises. President P\u00e9rez Balladares attempted to amend the Constitution for presidential reelection but was rejected by Panamanians. President Mireya Moscoso partially reversed trade liberalization efforts, while President Mart\u00edn Torrijos initiated the Panama Canal expansion project and negotiated a free trade agreement with the US. Current President Ricardo Martinelli, from the Democratic Change (CD) party, won by a landslide in the May 2009 election. President Martinelli of the Democratic Change (CD) party won the May 2009 presidential election by a landslide and governed in a coalition with the Paname\u00f1ista Party until September 2011. The coalition fell apart due to a rupture in relations with Vice President Juan Carlos Varela. Despite this, Martinelli remained popular due to the strong performance of the Panamanian economy under his government, including the ongoing Canal expansion and other infrastructure projects. President Martinelli's public approval ratings dropped during his tenure due to strong opposition and protests over policy proposals. He was criticized for his heavy-handed approach to governing and not being consultative. In the 2014 elections, Vice President Varela won with 39% of the vote. Martinelli was ineligible for reelection due to constitutional restrictions. In Panama's electoral system, the President is elected by a simple majority. Varela defeated Arias and Navarro in the 2014 election. Initially, Arias led in polls with help from President Martinelli's popularity, but the race tightened. Controversy arose over Martinelli's wife being selected as the CD's vice presidential candidate, raising concerns about political influence. President-elect Varela, a businessman with an engineering degree from Georgia Tech, has been involved in politics since 2006. Despite a rift with President Martinelli in 2011, Varela served as Vice President and Minister of Foreign Relations. During the 2014 campaign, he advocated for various programs and vowed to combat inequality. Varela played a key role in shaping social policies, including monthly payments to seniors without pensions. President-elect Varela, a businessman with an engineering degree from Georgia Tech, has been involved in politics since 2006. He advocated for various programs during the 2014 campaign, including monthly payments to Panamanian seniors without pensions, housing, and scholarship programs for the poor. Anti-corruption was a major campaign theme for Varela, who hails from the private sector and worked for his family's rum company. Varela's vice presidential running mate, Isabel de Saint Malo, is a political independent who helped develop Varela's campaign platform and is set to become Minister of Foreign Affairs. Varela has indicated a willingness to resume diplomatic relations with Venezuela. President-elect Varela's coalition, led by Isabel de Saint Malo, is facing the challenge of securing legislative support for his agenda. The CD-led electoral coalition won 33 seats, the PRD won 24, and Varela's alliance won 13 seats in Panama's National Assembly elections. Varela, known for advocating anti-corruption measures, aims to build consensus in the new government. President-elect Varela's coalition and the PRD have agreed to a governance pact to secure majority support in the legislature. Analysts question the pact's long-term viability due to differing political orientations and factions within the PRD. The 2014 elections were deemed free and fair by independent observers, with some concerns raised about the electoral process. Panama's economy has been flourishing in recent years due to infrastructure projects like the Panama Canal expansion. Despite the global financial crisis, the economy weathered the storm and continued to grow, rebounding since then. The economy of Panama has rebounded with positive economic growth, averaging 9.4% from 2010-2013 and a forecast of 7% growth in 2014. The International Monetary Fund reported that Panama's economic performance remains strong, with well-capitalized banks. Strong economic growth has led to a reduction in poverty rates, with targeted social programs playing a significant role. Panama's Martinelli government implemented programs for seniors over 70 and students, providing monthly payments and grants. Despite being classified as an upper-middle-income economy, Panama still faces high inequality, especially in indigenous communities with limited access to basic services. The World Bank emphasizes the need for a more effective social protection system to accelerate poverty reduction in the country. The World Bank supports various projects in Panama, including health, social protection, rural development, environment, infrastructure, and public sector efficiency. U.S. relations with Panama have had historical tensions, particularly over the Panama Canal, but improved after the 1977 treaties. Relations deteriorated during General Manuel Noriega's rule but strengthened after Panama's return to democratic governance. A bilateral free trade agreement was approved in 2012. Panama, a key U.S. strategic partner, is vulnerable to drug trafficking and organized crime. The country has been a strong ally in the region and spoke out against the Venezuelan government's suppression of protests in 2014. Juan Carlos Varela's election in 2014 was supported by the U.S., ensuring continued cooperation. In July 2013, Panama detained a North Korean freighter carrying military weapons, violating U.N. sanctions. Vice President Biden praised Panama for its contribution to global security. Panama is set to host the Seventh Summit of the Americas in 2015, with a debate on inviting Cuba to participate. Panama's Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested inviting Cuba to the 2015 Summit of the Americas, causing controversy among Latin American nations. The United States and Canada opposed Cuba's attendance at the 2012 summit due to its lack of democracy. Several U.S. agencies provide support to Panama, including the State Department, DEA, Coast Guard, Homeland Security, and Defense Department, with Southcom offering military assistance for humanitarian and disaster relief efforts. Panama has not received large amounts of foreign aid from the United States due to its high per capita income and economic development progress. The U.S. provides small bilateral assistance to Panama, and the country also receives support through initiatives like the Container Security Initiative and the Megaports Initiative. Additionally, Panama hosts the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and has Peace Corps volunteers working on development projects. The U.S. provides small bilateral assistance to Panama, including support for border protection and training for defense personnel. Assistance in FY2013 was $3.4 million and in FY2014 an estimated $3 million. The FY2015 request is for $4 million, with funding for Foreign Military Financing, International Military Education and Training, and Nonproliferation programs. Under the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), Panama received approximately $51.2 million from FY2008 through FY2012 for programs aimed at crime prevention, justice sector reform, counternarcotics interdiction, and law enforcement professionalization. Funding figures for FY2013 and FY2014, as well as the FY2015 request, are not available. Overall CARSI funding amounted to $145.6 million in FY2013 and an estimated $161.5 million. The funding for CARSI in Panama was $145.6 million in FY2013 and an estimated $161.5 million in FY2014, with a request for $130 million in FY2015. Panama's cooperation in combating drug trafficking and money laundering is crucial due to its strategic location and transit routes for illicit drugs from South America. Drug trafficking organizations use Panama's remote areas and coastline for moving drugs. Panama's strategic location and well-developed transportation infrastructure make it vulnerable to drug trafficking and money laundering. The country's large financial sector and free trade zones contribute to illicit financial activities. In 2013, Panama seized 41 metric tons of cocaine, attributing the increase in interdiction to enhanced operational readiness of maritime vessels and U.S. support. In November 2013, Vice President Joe Biden praised Panama for its efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking and highlighted the strong partnership between the United States and Panama in law enforcement cooperation. U.S. assistance, mainly through CARSI, includes support for citizen security, law enforcement, and rule-of-law programs to enhance Panama's ability to combat drug trafficking and transnational crimes. Training and equipment have been provided to the Panamanian National Police for anti-gang enforcement and community policing under CARSI. U.S. support in Panama includes assistance to modernize and maintain security services, training in various areas, and collaboration with regional partners to combat illegal drug trafficking and terrorist organizations like the FARC. Panama's SENAFRONT conducted operations against the FARC in 2013, degrading their capabilities and eliminating their permanent presence in the country. However, the FARC still uses Panamanian territory for drug transit. Panama is labeled a \"major money laundering country\" by the State Department, facing challenges in combating money laundering due to factors like bearer share corporations, lack of cooperation among government agencies, inconsistent law enforcement, and a weak judicial system. Panama has improved its anti-money laundering efforts since 2000 when it was deemed non-cooperative in combating money laundering. Panama was previously labeled a 'non-cooperative country' in combating money laundering by the FATF. The government took comprehensive action by enacting laws and issuing decrees to improve operations against money laundering, leading to its removal from the FATF list in June 2001. Panama also improved financial transparency by signing a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the United States in November 2010 and enough tax agreements with other countries to be removed from the OECD's \"gray list\" by July 2011. Panama was removed from the OECD's \"gray list\" due to having at least 12 signed agreements for exchanging tax information. However, its legal system for tax information exchange is still under peer review. Concerns were raised by the U.S. regarding the use of bearer shares in Panama for money laundering, leading to the implementation of \"know your client\" legislation in 2011 to address this issue. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2013 highlighted bearer share corporations in Panama as a vulnerability in its regulatory framework. In October 2013, Panama and the United States signed an asset-forfeiture sharing agreement worth $36 million from a money laundering investigation. Panama has a services-based economy with a trade surplus of $10.1 billion with the United States in 2013. Major exports to the U.S. include repaired goods, seafood, gold, and major imports include oil, machinery, and aircraft. The United States exports to Panama include oil, machinery, electrical machinery, iron and steel products, aircraft, and agricultural products. The U.S. has a foreign direct investment (FDI) of $5.1 billion in Panama, accounting for 44% of all U.S. FDI in Central America. A free trade agreement (FTA) was negotiated in 2007 but not approved by the U.S. until October 2011. Panama's National Assembly approved the FTA in 2012, leading to a review of laws for implementation. In September 2012, Panama approved laws for FTA implementation, including copyright and intellectual property regulations. The United States and Panama signed a free trade agreement in October 2012, with President Martinelli approving laws for FTA implementation. The FTA aimed to make trade rules with the U.S. permanent and increase foreign investment in Panama. The agreement also provided access to Panama's services market and enhanced U.S. access to Panama's strategic shipping route. The United States and Panama signed a free trade agreement in October 2012, aiming to make trade rules permanent and increase foreign investment. Since then, over 87% of U.S. exports to Panama have been duty-free, with tariffs on most U.S. farm products phased out within 15 years. The agreement also provides improved access for U.S. companies to Panama's services market, including financial, telecommunications, and energy services. Panama has no formal restrictions on capital flows or discrimination between foreign and domestic investment. After signing a free trade agreement in 2012, the United States and Panama aimed to increase foreign investment. However, doing business in Panama comes with risks such as poor rule of law, corruption, and lack of skilled workers. Despite these challenges, U.S. companies are well represented in various sectors in Panama. The Hay-Buneau-Varilla Treaty established the Canal Zone managed by the United States \"as if it were sovereign\" and \"in perpetuity\" for the construction of the Panama Canal in 1914. Conflict arose over U.S. rights, leading to negotiations for new treaties in the 1960s. The Panama Canal Treaties were signed in 1977 by U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panama's General Omar Torrijos, ensuring the canal's permanent neutrality. The Neutrality Treaty and Panama Canal Treaty were signed in 1977 by U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panama's General Omar Torrijos. The Neutrality Treaty ensures the Canal remains open to all nations, allowing for military intervention if operations are interfered with. The Panama Canal Treaty gave the U.S. responsibility for operating and defending the Canal until December 31, 1999. After the Panama Canal Treaty terminated in 1999, the Panama Canal Authority took over operations, improving safety and efficiency. In 2012, Jorge Quijano became the new Canal administrator, succeeding Alberto Alem\u00e1n Zubieta. Quijano, an engineer, had been with the Canal since 1975. In 2006, the Panama Canal Authority recommended building a third channel and new locks to double the Canal's capacity. The $5.25 billion project was self-financed through toll increases and external financing. The expansion aimed to increase financial contributions to Panama, maintain competitiveness, capture growing tonnage demand, and improve productivity and safety. The Panama Canal expansion project, approved in 2006, aimed to double the Canal's capacity, increase financial contributions to Panama, and capture growing tonnage demand. Delays pushed the completion date to early 2016, with disputes over cost overruns with the construction consortium GUPC. The Panama Canal expansion project faced delays due to a two-week strike by construction workers in May 2014. The project was 76% complete by the end of May 2014 and is expected to reduce shipping rates between Asia and the U.S. Gulf and East coasts. It will also increase trade between Latin America and Asia, accommodate 98% of all containerships, and boost exports of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. to Asian markets. U.S. grain producers are expected to benefit from increased exports. U.S. grain producers are expected to benefit from increased exports due to the Panama Canal expansion, making them more competitive globally. Several U.S. ports are preparing to take advantage of the trade expansion, particularly with countries in South America like Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Panama's political and economic outlook is positive, with a strong services-based economy and 25 years of democratic rule. Panama's strong services-based economy, infrastructure projects, and large financial sector position the country well in international trade. Challenges include combating poverty, inequality, drug trafficking, money laundering, and organized crime. U.S. relations with Panama are expected to remain strong under the incoming government. Panama is set to host the Seventh Summit of the Americas in 2015. The State Department released various reports on Panama in 2013 and 2014, including Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Country Reports on Terrorism, International Religious Freedom Report, and International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. These reports highlight Panama's economic strengths, challenges in combating poverty and organized crime, and the country's upcoming role in hosting the Seventh Summit of the Americas in 2015. The State Department released reports on Panama in 2014, including the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, Investment Climate Statement, National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, and Trafficking in Persons Report. These reports provide insights into Panama's economic situation and efforts to combat various issues."
