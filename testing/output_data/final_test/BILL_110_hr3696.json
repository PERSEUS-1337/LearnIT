Eligibility requires few assets, excluding certain necessary assets like primary residence and government benefits. Traditional defined benefit plans do not count against the asset limit, allowing disabled individuals to qualify for the program. Persons with disabilities face challenges in accumulating retirement savings due to the current rules that count assets in defined contribution plans against their eligibility for Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits. This discourages them from saving for retirement during periods of employment, as they may have to liquidate their savings if their health deteriorates or they lose their job to qualify for benefits. The Act aims to encourage retirement savings and promote work for disabled individuals by disregarding up to $75,000 in retirement accounts when determining eligibility for Supplemental Security Income benefits. The Act excludes a limited value of retirement plans under the SSI program, disregarding up to $75,000 in retirement accounts for eligibility determination. The Social Security Act excludes retirement plans valued up to $75,000 for eligibility determination under the SSI program. The Social Security Act excludes retirement plans valued up to $75,000 for eligibility determination under the SSI program. The Commissioner of Social Security determines and publishes a dollar amount for the succeeding calendar year for section 1613(a)(16) purposes annually. This amount is based on the Consumer Price Index ratio. The Consumer Price Index for 2007 is used to round product prices for SSI eligibility. The term 'Consumer Price Index' refers to the CPI-W issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, income exclusion rules are amended to include interest earnings on resources. The amendments made by this section apply to benefits for calendar months beginning after the enactment of this Act, excluding interest earnings on excluded resources."
