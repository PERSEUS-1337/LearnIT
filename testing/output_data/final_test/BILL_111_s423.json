    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009\". Congress finds that insufficient, late, and unpredictable funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs for health care endangers the viability of the health care system. Insufficient funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs health care programs over the past decade has led to rationing of care and the need for supplemental appropriations. Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding is crucial to ensure all sick and disabled veterans have access to high-quality care. Proper funding is crucial for the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet veterans' needs effectively. SEC. 3. TWO-FISCAL YEAR BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL CARE ACCOUNTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. Sec. 113A of title 38, United States Code, allows for two-fiscal year budget authority for certain medical care accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs starting from fiscal year 2011. This includes new discretionary budget authority for medical care accounts of the Veterans Health Administration. The Veterans Health Administration budget authority includes medical services, support, compliance, and facilities. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 1 of the title. SEC. 4. Comptroller General to study baseline model projections of Department of Veterans Affairs for health care expenditures. The Comptroller General will study the accuracy of budget projections made by the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model for estimating health care expenditures of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Reports will be submitted annually to Congress and the Secretary regarding the findings. The report under this paragraph will include a statement on the consistency of the President's budget request for Department of Veterans Affairs health care expenditures with anticipated expenditures determined by the Model. Additional information may be included as deemed appropriate by the Comptroller General, and each report will be made available to the public. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
