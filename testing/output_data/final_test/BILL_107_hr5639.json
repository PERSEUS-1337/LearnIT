    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Texas Band of Kickapoo Act Amendments.\" The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the Texas Band of Kickapoo, a subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, faced challenges due to their migratory nature between Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico, leading to unclear citizenship rights and eligibility for Federal services. Despite living primarily in Texas without land ownership, members of the Texas Band of Kickapoo were at risk due to lack of access to services. In 1983, the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act was enacted to confirm the United States citizenship of Kickapoos residing in Texas and their eligibility for Federal services. Some Kickapoos lack written records to prove their citizenship and are unaware that their right to apply for collective citizenship under the Act has expired. Amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act is needed to establish modified naturalization procedures for the Kickapoos' eligibility. In 1983, the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act confirmed the US citizenship of Kickapoos in Texas. The Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma acquired land in Texas for Federal services. Some Texas Band members formed the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas in 1989. Disputes have arisen since the early 1990s. Since the early 1990s, disputes have arisen over the beneficial ownership of trust land in Maverick County, Texas between the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas. Lack of clarity has led to evictions and lack of services for tribal members, hindering the intent of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act. Congress needs to clarify ownership to ensure both tribes have a land base in Texas for services and housing. The Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas should have their US citizenship confirmed, border crossing ability clarified, and receive Federal services for Indians. Land title held in trust by the US under the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act should be transferred from Oklahoma to Texas, with replacement land in Texas accepted into trust for Texas Kickapoo members. The Texas Band of Kickapoo Act (25 U.S.C. 1300b-12) is amended to define key terms.

MEMBERSHIP ROLLS; CITIZENSHIP ELIGIBILITY. This section of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act is amended to update membership rolls and compile citizenship eligibility lists. The Kickapoo tribes of Oklahoma and Texas are required to update their membership rolls and compile lists of tribal members residing permanently in the US but not born there. The Secretary will publish notice of completion of the citizenship eligibility list for use in approving applications for certificates of citizenship. The Texas Band of Kickapoo Act Amendments grant border crossing rights to individuals entitled to enter the US under specific conditions until a final determination is made on their application. Additionally, Section 341 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include provisions for citizenship eligibility. An individual of Kickapoo descent listed on a citizenship eligibility list can be issued a certificate of citizenship upon meeting certain requirements and taking the oath of allegiance. This provision is part of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act Amendments and falls under Section 341 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma can relinquish its claim to land in exchange for replacement land. The United States holds a trust for a specific parcel of land in Maverick County, Texas, totaling 125.43 acres. The land was conveyed from the Veteran's Land Board of Texas to Arthur Meixner and is recorded in the Maverick County Deed Records.
