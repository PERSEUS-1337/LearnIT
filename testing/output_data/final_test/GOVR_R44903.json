    "content": "Internal Revenue Code Section 36B, authorized by the ACA, provides a premium tax credit to help individuals pay for health insurance. The credit applies to qualified health plans offered through exchanges, not off-exchange or catastrophic plans. It is refundable and advanceable, allowing individuals to claim it on their taxes or receive it monthly. The ACA Section 1411 provides premium tax credits to eligible individuals based on their household income and the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plan in their area. The credit amount varies per individual, and the required premium contribution is capped according to modified adjusted gross income. The ACA Section 1412 established an advance payment program for premium credits based on income levels relative to the federal poverty level. Credits are reconciled at tax time, with any excess amount repaid to the federal government. For tax years 2018 and 2019, any excess premium tax credits overpaid by individuals must be repaid in full to the federal government, regardless of income level. Additionally, a plan providing coverage for abortions, except in specific circumstances, will be excluded from the definition of Qualified Health Plans starting in 2018. The new provision would repeal authorization for the premium tax credit for taxable years beginning in 2020, along with relevant ACA provisions on eligibility determinations and receiving the premium credit in advance. It would also amend IRC Section 6103(l) regarding taxpayer information disclosure. Additionally, IRC Section 45R, added by ACA Section 1421, provided a small business health insurance tax credit to help make premiums more affordable for certain small employers. The small business health insurance tax credit is available for employers with fewer than 25 employees and average annual wages below a specified cap. Employers must cover at least 50% of their employees' self-only health insurance. The credit is only available for two consecutive tax years and excludes health plans covering abortions, except in specific circumstances. The small employer health insurance credit would not be available for taxable years beginning in 2020. The individual mandate, created by ACA Section 1501, requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. Certain exemptions apply, and the mandate went into effect in 2014. Non-exempt individuals must pay a penalty for each month of noncompliance. The penalty for not maintaining health insurance coverage under ACA Section 5000A has a percentage of income or a flat dollar amount, with the percentage increasing from 1.0% in 2014 to 2.5% in 2016. Section 104 proposes to eliminate this penalty retroactively from 2016 by reducing the percentage to 0% and the flat dollar amount to $0. Employer tax penalties under IRC Section 4980H apply to all types of employers, including government entities and nonprofits exempt from federal income taxes. Section 105 proposes to eliminate tax penalties for large employers under IRC Section 4980H retroactively from 2016, reducing penalties to $0. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) supports 56 affiliates operating 650 health centers in the US, with government funding as its primary source. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) relies heavily on government funding, with federal funds accounting for about one-third of its total revenue in 2013. The largest source of federal funding for PPFA is reimbursements for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries, totaling approximately $390 million in 2013. PPFA received reimbursements or expended funds from discretionary programs and direct spending, including Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, Social Services Block Grant, Crime Victims Fund, Personal Responsibility Education Program, and SNAP. In FY2012, GAO found that PPFA used discretionary funds from Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grants programs provided to states, some of which were used for services. Federal funds are generally not used for abortions, except in specific cases like rape, incest, or endangerment of the mother's life, due to provisions like the Hyde amendment. Similar restrictions exist in appropriations for various departments and programs. Section 106 of the draft bill aims to prohibit federal funds from being provided to entities that perform abortions not meeting Hyde amendment exceptions, using nonfederal funding sources. No comprehensive list or source exists detailing federal funding received by these entities. The draft bill aims to prohibit federal funds from going to entities that perform non-Hyde amendment compliant abortions using nonfederal funds. The provision targets a managed-care organization for a one-year period, disregarding certain programmatic rules like the Medicaid freedom of choice of provider requirement. It defines a \"prohibited entity\" based on IRS designation, essential community provider status, and abortion provision. Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliates are the main organization affected by the provision in the draft bill, which aims to restrict federal funds from going to entities that perform non-Hyde amendment compliant abortions. The organization received over $350 million in Medicaid expenditures in FY2014. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state law, with states setting criteria within federal standards. Individuals must meet categorical and financial criteria, as well as residency, immigration status, and documentation requirements. The ACA made changes to Medicaid eligibility, including the Medicaid Expansion. States can apply for waivers to expand coverage beyond mandatory and optional groups. The ACA established 133% of FPL as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income-eligibility level for most non-elderly individuals starting January 1, 2014. The U.S. Supreme Court made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states. As of January 1, 2014, 24 states and the District of Columbia implemented the expansion, with seven more states following suit. Additionally, the ACA created an optional Medicaid eligibility category for non-elderly individuals with income above 133% of FPL. The ACA established 133% of FPL as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income-eligibility level for most non-elderly individuals starting January 1, 2014. The Medicaid expansion option for states to extend coverage to adults above 133% of FPL would be repealed by December 31, 2019. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with varying federal medical assistance percentage rates based on state per capita incomes. The ACA introduced exceptions to the regular FMAP rate for certain states, populations, and services, including the newly eligible federal matching rate, expansion state federal matching rate, and a six-percentage-point increase for services covered under the Community First Choice option. Additionally, the ACA increased the Medicaid FMAP rate for all territories from 50% to 55% starting July 1. The ACA increased the Medicaid FMAP rate for territories to 55% from 50% starting July 1, 2011. It also repealed various matching rates and increased FMAP rates for certain options on January 1, 2020. Additionally, it changed the FMAP rate for territories back to 50% on or after January 1, 2020. Prior to the ACA, states could enroll certain groups for a limited time based on a preliminary determination of Medicaid eligibility by specified providers. Certain specified Medicaid providers, known as qualified entities, could make presumptive-eligibility determinations for Medicaid. The type of entity depended on the beneficiary's eligibility category, such as clinic providers for pregnant women or agencies serving low-income children. Individuals found presumptively eligible had to formally apply for coverage within a specified time frame. The ACA expanded Medicaid presumptive-eligibility determinations, allowing all Medicaid-participating hospitals to make determinations for various eligibility groups starting January 1, 2014. States could also provide a presumptive-eligibility period for specific groups like children, pregnant women, low-income families, and individuals in foster care under 26. After January 1, 2020, hospitals participating in Medicaid can no longer make presumptive-eligibility determinations. States must coordinate eligibility and enrollment systems for low-income subsidy programs under the ACA. The option for states to provide a presumptive-eligibility period for children and pregnant women will be repealed. The repeal of the state option for presumptive-eligibility after December 31, 2019, affects the ACA expansion group, mandatory foster care group, and low-income families. States are no longer required to coordinate eligibility and enrollment systems for ACA low-income subsidy programs starting January 1, 2020. States implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion must provide alternative benefit plan (ABP) coverage. The ACA made significant changes to Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP) coverage, requiring it to include at least the 10 essential health benefits. Medicaid ABP coverage would no longer apply after December 31, 2019. After December 31, 2019, Medicaid ABP coverage would no longer be required to include essential health benefits. SSA Section 1923 mandated Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals treating low-income patients to address their financial challenges due to serving uninsured or Medicaid enrollees. Medicaid DSH funding is capped, with each state receiving an annual allotment for these payments. The ACA reduced the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through its health insurance coverage provisions, leading to less need for Medicaid DSH payments. Current law includes aggregate reductions to Medicaid DSH allotments for FY2018 through FY2025, with allotments reverting to pre-reduction levels after FY2025. Section 108 would repeal these reductions. Section 108 would repeal the Medicaid DSH allotment reductions, while Section 109 would delay implementation of the Cadillac tax until 2026. The tax imposes a 40% rate on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage exceeding a specified limit. Under the IRC, taxpayers can use various tax-advantaged health accounts for qualified medical expenses. ACA Section 110 would remove the requirement for prescribed drugs or insulin to be considered qualified expenses for these accounts, effective in 2017. ACA Section 9004 imposed a 20% tax on distributions from Archer MSAs and HSAs. Section 111 of the ACA amended IRC Sections 220 and 223 to reduce the tax rate on distributions from Archer MSAs and HSAs used for non-medical expenses to 15% and 10% respectively, effective after December 31, 2016. Employers can establish cafeteria plans under IRC Section 125, allowing employees to choose between cash and nontaxable benefits like health insurance without being taxed on the latter. ACA Section 9005 amended IRC Section 125(i) to limit health FSA contributions to $2,500 per year, indexed for inflation. Section 112 would repeal this limit starting in 2018. ACA Section 9008 imposed a tax on manufacturers/importers of branded prescription drugs. The tax is imposed on manufacturers and importers with branded prescription drug sales over $5 million to certain government programs. A new excise tax on medical devices, equal to 2.3% of the sales price, was implemented in 2013. A two-year moratorium on the tax was provided in 2016, and it does not apply to sales from 2016 to 2017. Amendments are proposed to repeal the medical device excise tax starting in 2018. The medical device excise tax under IRC Section 4191 would no longer apply to sales after December 31, 2017. ACA Section 9010 imposes an annual fee on certain health insurers based on net health care premiums written, with the fee set at varying amounts from 2014 to 2018. Insurers are apportioned the fee based on their net premiums written, with exemptions for the first $25 million. The fee imposed on health insurers is based on net premiums written, with varying amounts set from 2014 to 2018. The fee applies to 50% of net premiums above $25 million and up to $50 million, and 100% of net premiums exceeding $50 million. Certain health insurers or insurance arrangements are exempt, including self-insured plans, voluntary employees' beneficiary associations, and governmental entities. Tax-exempt entities only include 50% of net premiums in determining market share. ACA Section 9010(j) made these provisions effective for calendar years after December 31, 2013, with a one-year moratorium provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The ACA Section 9010(j) would amend the annual fee provision to exempt it for 2017. Employers providing Medicare-eligible retirees with prescription drug coverage meeting federal standards can receive federal subsidy payments equal to 28% of actual spending exceeding $400, up to $8,250. These subsidies were created to incentivize employers to maintain drug coverage for retirees. Employers can exclude qualified retiree prescription drug plan subsidies from gross income under IRC Section 139A. The ACA Section 9012 amended IRC Section 139A to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage. The deduction for retiree drug costs is reduced by the federal subsidy received. Section 116 would reinstate prior law to allow business-expense deductions without subsidy reduction. Effective for taxable years after December 31, 2016, taxpayers can deduct medical expenses exceeding 10% of their income under IRC Section 213. The medical-expense deduction threshold was reduced to 7.5% for all taxpayers by ACA Section 117, effective from tax year 2017. ACA Sections 9015 and 10906 imposed a Medicare Hospital Insurance surtax of 0.9% on taxpayers with income over specified thresholds. Section 118 proposes to repeal the 0.9% Medicare surtax, Section 119 aims to eliminate the tax on indoor tanning services, and HCERA Section 1402 imposed a 3.8% net investment tax on high-income taxpayers. Section 120 would repeal the net investment tax on high-income individuals, estates, and trusts starting in 2017. Employers can deduct employee remuneration as business expenses under IRC Section 162, with limitations. ACA Section 9014(b) imposed a $500,000 limit on remuneration deductions for health insurance providers under IRC Section 162(m)(6). Section 121 would terminate this provision in 2017. ACA Section 4002 established the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) with permanent annual funding for national health initiatives. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) is a permanent annual appropriation intended to support national investment in prevention and public health programs. PPHF funds are distributed to HHS agencies, particularly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Congress can direct the distribution of funds, with appropriations increasing from $500 million in FY2010 to $2 billion in FY2015 and subsequent years. Amendments have been made to use PPHF funds as offsets for other activities. Annual appropriations under current law are $500 million for FY2010, $1.0 billion for FY2012 through FY2017, and $900 million for FY2018 and FY2019. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) has annual appropriations ranging from $500 million in FY2010 to $2 billion in FY2015 and subsequent years. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) supports community-based substance abuse and mental health treatment and prevention services through formula grants and competitive grant programs. SAMHSA's programs are authorized under the Public Health Service Act Title V. Section 202 authorizes $750 million for each of FY2018 and FY2019 to award grants to states for substance abuse and mental health needs, including improving drug monitoring programs and prevention activities. The ACA Section 10503 created the Community Health Center Fund, providing mandatory appropriations to the Health Center Program from FY2011 through FY2015. This program offers grants to outpatient primary care facilities serving underserved populations in health professional shortage areas. The appropriations were extended through FY2017 by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, allocating $3.6 billion for each of FY2016-FY2017. The Community Health Center Fund has been increasingly contributing to the Health Center Program's appropriation, ranging from 39% to 70% from FY2011 to FY2017. For FY2018, the Fund will not receive a mandatory appropriation. ACA Section 1402 provides subsidies to eligible individuals to reduce cost-sharing expenses for health insurance plans in the individual market. The ACA Section 1402 provides cost-sharing subsidies for eligible individuals in the individual market exchange plans. These subsidies help lower out-of-pocket limits and reduce actual cost-sharing requirements. The Obama Administration made payments to insurers for these reductions using funds from premium subsidies, leading to a lawsuit by the House of Representatives claiming a violation of the appropriations clause of the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Obama Administration's payment of cost-sharing reimbursements was unconstitutional due to lack of valid appropriation by Congress. The court stopped the payments but delayed the decision pending appeal. If the appeal doesn't proceed, the court's decision could prevent the government from reimbursing insurers for cost-sharing reductions without further congressional action. Section 204 would appropriate funds for cost-sharing subsidies until December 31, 2019. Section 205 would repeal ACA Section 1402, ending cost-sharing subsidies and payments to issuers for reductions, effective for plan years starting in 2020. Payments and adjustments for plan years 2018 and 2019 could be available until December 31, 2020."
