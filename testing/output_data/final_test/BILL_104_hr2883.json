The amendment eliminates the Medicaid mandate for state recoveries and revises the definition of estate, applying to medical assistance for individuals dying on or after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3 restricts the recovery of medical assistance properly paid in other federally assisted medical assistance programs. No Federal funds will be paid to a State under a State medical assistance program unless certain conditions are met, including limitations on imposing liens on individuals' property for medical assistance. Liens can only be imposed with a court judgment for incorrectly paid benefits or on real property of individuals in specific medical facilities. The State program cannot impose a lien on individuals in medical institutions who are required to spend most of their income on medical care, and cannot be discharged and return home, unless specified conditions are met. No lien can be imposed on an individual's home if their spouse, child under 21 who is blind or disabled, or sibling with equity interest and residing in the home for at least a year before admission to a medical institution. Any lien imposed dissolves upon discharge from the medical institution and return home. No adjustment or recovery of medical assistance paid on behalf of an individual under the State program can be made, except in specific cases like from the individual's estate or sale of property, subject to a lien imposed on account of the assistance. Adjustment or recovery can only occur after the individual's death. Adjustment or recovery of medical assistance can only be made after the individual's death, when certain conditions are met, such as no surviving child under age 21, or blindness or disability as defined by the Social Security Act. A lien on the individual's home can only be enforced if no sibling resided in the home for at least one year before. No child of the individual, who resided in the home for at least two years before admission to a medical institution and provided care allowing the individual to stay at home, can lawfully reside in the home continuously since admission. The State agency can waive certain requirements for individuals admitted to medical institutions if it causes undue hardship. The term \"estate\" includes all assets of a deceased individual as defined by state probate law. State probate law defines the term \"State\" to include various territories. The term \"State medical assistance program\" refers to federal programs providing medical assistance to states."
