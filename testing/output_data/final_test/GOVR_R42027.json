It also includes policy changes for programs serving children in foster care and their families. Title II renews the authority for HHS to approve child welfare demonstration projects for three years (FY2012-FY2014). Title II of the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act renews the authority for HHS to approve child welfare demonstration projects for three years (FY2012-FY2014) and includes policy changes related to state eligibility and HHS approval of these projects. The bill was introduced in the House and Senate in 2011, passed by both chambers, and signed into law by President Barack Obama in September 2011. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in September 2011, extends funding authorization for child welfare programs under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act for five years. This includes programs like the Child Welfare Services Program and the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in September 2011, extends funding authorization for child welfare programs under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act for five years. This includes programs like the Child Welfare Services Program and the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program. The Act provides annual mandatory funding authorization for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program for five years at $345 million and extends discretionary funding authorization for the same period at $200 million. It also includes funding for the Court Improvement Program, regional partnerships to assist children affected by parental substance abuse, and grants to states for monthly caseworker visits. The Act does not extend program or funding authorization for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program. The Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program received $49 million annually for FY2007-FY2010 but no funding for FY2011. The National Random Sample Study of Child Welfare did not receive funding under P.L. 112-34. The study collects data on children and families in contact with child welfare agencies and received $6 million in mandatory funds for FY2011. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act makes adjustments to federal child welfare requirements, including the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program aimed at preventing child maltreatment. States must meet specific federal requirements to receive formula grant funds for child welfare services. The Safe and Stable program requires states to spend at least 90% of funds on family support, preservation, reunification, and adoption services. States must also allocate significant portions of funds to each category. Family support services aim to strengthen families, improve parenting skills, ensure children's safety, and promote their development. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allows states to use funds for mentoring programs for children. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allows states to use funds for mentoring programs for children, which involve one-on-one relationships with trained adult volunteers. It also revises the definition of \"time-limited family reunification services\" in the Safe and Stable program to include counseling, substance abuse treatment, domestic violence assistance, temporary child care, and transportation. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act expands services for children in foster care to include peer-to-peer mentoring, support groups, and activities to facilitate family connections. States are now required to develop protocols for the use of psychotropic medication and address emotional trauma in their oversight plans. The oversight plan for children in foster care must address emotional trauma, including child abuse/neglect and removal from biological homes. States must also describe activities for young children under four to meet developmental needs and shorten time without a permanent family. Education stability planning provisions ensure timely enrollment in appropriate schools during placement moves in foster care. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires regular caseworker visits for children in foster care to achieve permanency goals and placement stability. It also mandates obtaining credit reports for youth aged 16 and older to prevent identity theft. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act mandates regular caseworker visits for children in foster care to ensure permanency goals and placement stability. States receive funding for formula grants to support monthly caseworker visits, with a focus on quality and frequency. States must have standards in place to guarantee that at least 90% of children in foster care receive a monthly visit from their caseworker. In FY2007, only one state reported visiting 90% of children in foster care monthly. By FY2010, seven states achieved this goal, with nine states visiting less than half of children monthly. The average percentage of children visited monthly improved from 42% in FY2007 to 71% in FY2010. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act aims to ensure regular caseworker visits for children in foster care. The Improvement and Innovation Act requires states to ensure monthly visits for children in foster care, with increasing visit completion percentages over the years. States failing to meet visitation goals must provide a higher percentage of program costs. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires states to increase non-federal funding for Child Welfare Services if they fail to meet caseworker visit percentage goals. Failure to provide additional funding makes states ineligible for full federal allotments. Additionally, the Act changes how compliance with monthly caseworker visit percentages is calculated. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act changes how compliance with monthly caseworker visit percentages is calculated. For example, a state's monthly caseworker visit percentage under the Act could be 96%, compared to 50% under the current calculation method. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires states to ensure that at least 50% of all caseworker visits with children in foster care occur where the child lives. Failure to meet this benchmark results in reduced federal cost sharing in the Child Welfare Services program. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act mandates that states must meet specific benchmarks for caseworker visits with children in foster care. Failure to meet these benchmarks results in reduced federal cost sharing in the Child Welfare Services program. Additionally, states are required to provide data on the share of children in foster care who received visits and the number of visits that occurred where the child lives. The Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires states to report monthly caseworker visit data, funded by grants from FY2006 onwards. States must use these funds to enhance caseworker recruitment, retention, training, and technology access. A total of $95 million was allocated across FY2006-FY2011, with $20 million in each of FY2010 and FY2011. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allocates $20 million annually from FY2012-FY2016 for the Safe and Stable Program to improve caseworker visits for children in foster care. States must enhance monthly caseworker visits, focus on decision-making, and address retention, recruitment, and training. Additionally, states must report on child maltreatment-related fatalities, and HHS must monitor the use of funds. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires state child welfare agencies to provide data on child abuse or neglect deaths annually to HHS. GAO will study federal funding sources for child welfare services and access to these services for children and families. The national number of children who died in FY2009 due to child abuse or neglect likely understates the total child deaths. States must describe sources of information used in reporting child maltreatment-related fatalities and provide information on planned and actual spending for child welfare-related services. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires states to submit annual financial reports on child welfare services by June 30, with HHS compiling and submitting the data to congressional committees by September 30. The compilation includes national totals for planned and actual spending on the Safe and Stable program. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act mandates states to report on child welfare services spending by June 30, with HHS compiling and sharing the data with congressional committees by September 30. Additionally, GAO must submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment, identifying alternative funding sources for programs like Safe and Stable and assessing the needs of eligible families. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allocates funds for underserved communities, supports for caseworkers, substance abuse services, and preventive programs. It reserves $30 million for the Court Improvement Program annually and allows tribal courts to receive grants. The Court Improvement Program funding supports three types of grants for tribal court improvement: basic, data, and training. These grants aim to enhance child welfare proceedings, improve data collection, and increase knowledge of legal personnel. P.L. 112-34 expands the purposes of basic and training grants to include strengthening family engagement in child welfare proceedings. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allocates funding for Court Improvement Program grants to support family engagement in child welfare proceedings, concurrent planning for adoption, and family reunification efforts. The program received $32 million in FY2011, with $30 million reserved from mandatory funding and $2 million from discretionary funding. Each of the three Court Improvement grants received $10 million in mandatory funds, while the basic grant received $12 million in total funding. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allocates funding for Court Improvement Program grants. It reserves $1 million for competitive grants to tribal courts and reduces funds for basic grants to state highest courts by the same amount. Basic court improvement activities will receive $9 million plus 3.3% of any discretionary funds, while data and training grants will each receive $10 million in mandatory funds for FY2012-FY2016. Eligible tribal courts are defined as the highest court. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allocates funding for Court Improvement Program grants, with $1 million reserved for competitive grants to tribal courts. Eligible tribal courts are defined as the highest court of any tribe or tribal consortium operating a Title IV-E program, working towards approval of a Title IV-E plan, or responsible for adoption and foster care proceedings. Highest state courts were required to submit separate applications for Court Improvement grants and entitled to $85,000 for each successful grant application, plus a share of remaining funds based on the under-age-21 population in their state. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allows courts to access funds for basic, data, and training purposes through a single application. Courts must specify the grant types they are applying for and meet relevant application requirements. They are entitled to $85,000 for each grant type plus additional funds based on the under-age-21 population in their state. Congress provided $145 million in mandatory funds between FY2007 and FY2011 to support grants for regional partnerships improving outcomes for children at risk of entering foster care due to parental abuse. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act provides funding for regional partnerships to support children at risk of entering foster care due to parental substance abuse. Funding of $20 million annually was allocated for these grants in FY2010 and FY2011, with a total of $100 million reserved over five years (FY2012-FY2016). The focus has shifted from methamphetamine abuse to substance abuse in general, allowing current grantees to apply for extensions and multiple grants. Administrative expenditures under this program are limited by law. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act sets limits on HHS administrative expenditures for grants supporting children at risk of foster care due to parental substance abuse. Evaluations of grants are required for two periods, and definitions of \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribal organization\" are standardized across programs. The Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act defines \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribal organization\" for the Child Welfare Services program. Title IV-B requires HHS to issue regulations on data reporting requirements. The policy aims to standardize data reporting for Title IV-B to improve interstate communication about benefits and services for children and families, reduce fraud, and enhance services. Title II allows HHS to waive federal child welfare policy requirements for states to conduct demonstration projects promoting child welfare objectives. Title IV-B authorizes federal grants to states for services supporting families and children's safety and stability. Title IV-E provides federal reimbursement to states for foster care costs and assistance for children leaving foster care for adoption or guardianship. The primary purposes are to ensure child safety, secure permanence, and enhance well-being. HHS has the authority to approve up to 10 demonstration projects annually. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act renews HHS authority to approve up to 10 demonstration projects annually for three years. Projects can last up to five years, with the new stipulation that no project can operate after September 30, 2019. Additional requirements are established for states implementing new demonstration projects. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act renews HHS authority to approve up to 10 demonstration projects annually for three years, with new requirements for states seeking to implement new projects from FY2012 to FY2014. States must demonstrate effective child welfare policies, identify project goals, and focus on increasing permanence for children, improving outcomes for children in their own homes, and preventing child abuse and neglect. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act requires states to implement at least 2 out of 10 child welfare program improvement policies, such as establishing a bill of rights, developing child-specific health care planning, and reducing the use of congregate care for children and youth. These policies aim to prevent child abuse and neglect, increase permanence for children, and improve outcomes for children in their own homes. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act mandates states to implement various child welfare program improvement policies, including reducing congregate care for children and youth, placing siblings together in foster care, recruiting and retaining high-quality foster parents, providing support for youth in care, allowing older youth to reconnect with biological family, and offering programs to prevent children from entering foster care or to provide permanency. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act requires states to implement policies to prevent children from entering foster care or to provide permanency, such as family support services, substance abuse treatment, and addressing domestic violence. States must implement at least one improvement policy after applying for a waiver project, with HHS able to terminate a state's authority if significant progress is not made within three years. The law allows states to propose demonstration projects consistent with federal child welfare policy. Two specific projects include addressing domestic violence leading to foster care placement and allowing foster care payments for children in long-term therapeutic family treatment centers. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allows states to propose demonstration projects related to child welfare, including services such as substance abuse treatment, family counseling, parenting skills training, and job training. States must provide an accounting of funds used for these projects and conduct independent evaluations. The waiver project for child welfare services requires an independent evaluation approved by HHS, allowing a comparison of outcomes for children and families served under the project. The law does not specify the evaluation design to be used, but the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act removes the requirement for states to describe how children and families will be randomly assigned to groups for the project. Beginning in FY2010, tribes can operate a Title IV-E program directly with federal support for foster care, adoption, and guardianship. Approval by HHS is required for tribes to receive federal reimbursement. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allows tribal entities with approved Title IV-E programs to apply for child welfare waivers, replacing the need for interim and final reports with periodic updates on program strategies. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act allows tribal entities with approved Title IV-E programs to apply for child welfare waivers, requiring periodic reports on programs and outcomes. HHS must provide reports to congressional committees and analyze project evaluations for recommendations. Amendments related to waiver authority are effective since September 30, 2011, while data standardization amendments are effective since October 1, 2012. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act amendments, effective since October 1, 2011, include provisions for states to comply with new requirements. Identical versions of the Act were introduced in the House and Senate in September 2011. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act amendments, effective since October 1, 2011, include provisions previously included in related bills introduced by various Senators and Representatives. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act was introduced following hearings by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee. The House Ways and Means Committee unanimously agreed to report the bill favorably, leading to its passage in the full House on September 21, 2011. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1542 favorably to the Senate floor, which was passed unanimously by the full Senate as H.R. 2883. The bill was signed into law on September 30, 2011 (P.L. 112-34) with no significant direct spending costs estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO estimated that the new requirements in the bill would have a significant effect on federal spending, but assumed that additional state spending would be small. The bill extended funding authorization for Child Welfare Services and the Safe and Stable program for five years. Funding amounts were equal to previous years, but actual funding is at the discretion of Congress. The actual funding for Child Welfare Services and the Safe and Stable program is determined by Congress during the annual appropriations process. In FY2011, the discretionary funding for these programs was significantly reduced."
