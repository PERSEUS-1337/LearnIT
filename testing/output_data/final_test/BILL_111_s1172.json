    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rubbish to Renewables Act of 2009\". Congress finds that municipal solid waste can be a substantial source of clean, renewable energy by collecting methane from landfills. Landfills can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to clean energy policies. Further investment is needed to develop new technologies for converting waste into energy, creating jobs and reducing emissions. Investing in projects can create jobs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease US reliance on foreign oil. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a concise statement defining terms within a specific context. The term \"eligible project\" in this Act refers to projects that produce clean, renewable energy from municipal solid waste, including methane from landfills, using technologies like anaerobic digestion, plasma arc, or thermal gasification. Projects using oxidizing technologies like combustion are excluded. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"greenhouse gas\" which includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. It also defines \"municipal solid waste\" as material discarded by households and public lodgings for disposal. The curr_chunk defines \"municipal solid waste\" as material discarded by commercial, institutional, and industrial sources that is essentially the same as household waste and not regulated as hazardous waste. The term \"municipal solid waste\" includes appliances, clothing, consumer product packaging, cosmetics, debris from construction, disposable diapers, food containers, food waste, household hazardous waste, office supplies, paper, and yard waste. It does not include hazardous waste. The term \"municipal solid waste\" includes various items like appliances, clothing, food containers, and yard waste. It does not include hazardous waste or solid waste resulting from response actions under certain environmental laws. The term \"recyclable material\" refers to material separated from waste for disposal or managed separately, including scrap rubber for fuel. Solid waste generated by an industrial facility and transported for treatment, storage, or disposal to a compliant facility owned or operated by the waste generator. Medical waste, combustion ash from resource recovery facilities or municipal incinerators, and waste located on property owned by the generator or an affiliated company are exempt from regulations. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and \"solid waste\" is defined as per section 1004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. SEC. 4. GRANTS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. The Secretary will establish a grant program to fund projects that promote renewable energy from municipal solid waste, support technology development, create clean energy jobs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve landfill space. Eligible entities can apply for grants up to $10,000,000. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications based on renewable energy generation, greenhouse gas emission reductions, innovative technology, replication potential, landfill space preservation, and job creation. $250,000,000 is authorized for this grant program annually. $250,000,000 appropriated annually for grant program from 2010 to 2013. SEC. 5. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH LANDFILLS. Legislation enacted after this Act can consider landfill gas control measures that exceed emission reduction requirements as meeting additionality criteria. Landfill gas control measures meeting criteria can qualify as domestic offsets by reducing greenhouse gas emissions below baseline levels."
