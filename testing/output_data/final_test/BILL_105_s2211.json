It includes a section on mandatory congressional review, which amends Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, by adding a new subchapter for the mandatory review of certain rules. Sec. 815 states that a rule establishing or increasing a tax cannot take effect before a specific bill is enacted and is not subject to review under subchapter I.

Sec. 817 outlines the timeline for approval of the bill. Sec. 817 outlines the timeline for approval of a bill introduced by the Majority Leader of each House of Congress within 3 legislative days after an agency submits a report under section 816. If the bill is not introduced, any Member of that House may introduce it within 7 legislative days. The bill is then referred to the Committees in each House with jurisdiction over the rule involved. Any House committee must report a bill without amendment, with or without recommendation, within 30 calendar days of its introduction. If the committee fails to do so, a Member can move to discharge the committee from further consideration of the bill. The motion is highly privileged and limited to one hour of debate, divided equally between the proponent and opponent. After a bill is reported or a committee has been discharged from further consideration, it is in order to move that the House resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for consideration of the bill. All points of order against the bill and consideration of the bill are waived. The motion is highly privileged and a motion to reconsider the vote is not in order. In the Committee of the Whole, the first reading of the bill is skipped. General debate is limited to one hour, controlled by a proponent and an opponent. The bill is then open for amendment under the five-minute rule. After consideration, the Committee reports the bill to the House without further motion. Appeals on House rules regarding bill procedures are decided without debate. Any Senate-introduced bill is referred for consideration. When a bill is introduced in the Senate, it must be referred to the appropriate committee. The committee must report the bill without amendment within 30 days of its introduction. If the committee fails to do so, it is automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill. Bills received from the House of Representatives are not referred to committee and are placed on the Calendar. Motion to proceed to consider a bill is not debatable and cannot be reconsidered. After 10 hours of consideration, the Senate must vote on a bill without further debate, except for a motion to reconsider or table. A single motion to extend the time for consideration by 5 hours is allowed. Debate time on the bill is divided between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. A motion to recommit a bill is not permitted. If the Senate has read a bill for the third time, it can be considered at any time.

It recognizes the constitutional right of either House to change rules related to bills. Sec. 818 of the Congressional rulemaking power allows either House to change rules related to the procedure for bills at any time, to the same extent as any other rule of that House. SEC. 3. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.

Section 817 of title 5, United States Code applies to each rule described, except for certain cases. During the 60-day period after an approval bill is introduced under section 817, the applicable rule remains in effect. If the bill is not enacted within 60 days, the rule will have no force or effect."
