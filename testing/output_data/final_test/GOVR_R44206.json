    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, authorizes federal aid programs for individuals and institutions of higher education. The most recent reauthorization was in 2008 under the Higher Education Opportunity Act. Appropriations were authorized through FY2014, extended to FY2015, and additional funding was provided through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided additional appropriations for HEA programs through FY2016, extending their operation until September 30, 2016. Further legislative action is needed for these provisions to continue beyond that date. Some HEA programs have permanent authorization of appropriations, while others have expired authorizations. For example, Teacher Quality Partnership Grants' authorizations expired in FY2011. The General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) allows for a one-year extension of program authorization if no new law is enacted. This extension does not apply to commissions, councils, or committees required by statute to terminate. The General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) allows for a one-year extension of program authorization if no new law is enacted, excluding commissions, councils, or committees required by statute to terminate on a specific date. Two HEA committees had termination dates in FY2015, with most HEA programs and authorizations automatically extended through FY2015 at the same levels as FY2014. Most HEA programs were automatically extended through FY2015 under GEPA and subsequently through FY2016. Additional legislative action is needed for these expiring provisions to continue beyond September 30, 2016. The implications of expiration depend on the nature of the provision, whether it establishes authority or authorizes appropriations. The Comptroller General has clarified that there is no constitutional or general requirement for subsequent congressional action. The Comptroller General clarified that appropriations do not always require prior authorization and can provide legal authority for agencies to spend money even if an authorization has lapsed. If an authorization of appropriations expires but the underlying authority for an activity remains, the agency can still take actions based on that authority. The agency can continue to take actions based on existing authority even if appropriations are available. Extension of HEA authorization provisions that expired in FY2014 could be addressed through authorization or appropriations processes. Programs may continue to operate if funds are appropriated, but explicit extensions are needed for programs with terminated authority. The HEA provisions that expired in FY2015 could be extended through a law or additional appropriations to ensure continued operation. Prior to the HEOA in 2008, programs were extended through Higher Education Extension Acts. An appropriation for a program with an expired authorization of appropriations would ensure its continued operation. For example, Teacher Quality Partnership Grants remain operational through funding provided in previous appropriations acts beyond FY2015. Explicit extension may be needed for advisory committees to continue beyond FY2015. In the event a regular appropriations bill is not enacted before the expiration date of HEA provisions, a continuing resolution (CR) could provide funding for their continued operation. A CR or other appropriations law may be necessary for programs with explicit termination dates to ensure their continued operation. For programs with explicit termination dates, specific language in a CR or appropriations law may be needed to continue operations. Various measures were taken starting in September 2015 to provide additional appropriations for federal programs beyond FY2015, including three CRs and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), which provided funding for many HEA programs through FY2016. This allowed HEA programs set to expire at the end of FY2015 to continue operating through December. The GEPA provisions, set to expire at the end of FY2015, continued to operate through December 18, 2015, under various CRs and will continue through FY2016 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance disbanded immediately upon the expiration of its authorization due to lack of funding or extension. The Federal Perkins Loan program received authorization for continued operation but no additional funding under separate legislation. The Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 allows institutions to award Perkins Loans to eligible students until September 30, 2017 for undergraduates and September 30, 2016 for graduate students. No additional appropriations are allowed beyond these dates, leading to a potential funding gap and program suspension if further funding is not provided. In certain situations, programs may resume once funds are appropriated, with authorization extensions enacted as if no funding gap occurred. For example, the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014 provided appropriations for federal programs after a funding gap. This is relevant for programs with specific termination dates, requiring additional action to continue operation. Congress may be able to restore committees through provisions in a CR if programs do not receive an extension before termination. The Compact of Free Association allows students and IHEs from Freely Associated States to participate in HEA programs. Students from Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau are eligible for federal student aid programs through FY2023. The Compact of Free Association extended eligibility for students and IHEs in Palau to receive appropriations for and participate in certain programs through FY2015. Subsequent legislative actions extended these provisions through FY2016, but without further action, the extension would expire on September 30, 2016. The curr_chunk provides information on the discretionary authorization of appropriations or mandatory budget authority for HEA programs and activities, including details such as the HEA section authorizing funds, classification of budget authority, authorized amounts, duration of authorization, and appropriations for FY2016."
