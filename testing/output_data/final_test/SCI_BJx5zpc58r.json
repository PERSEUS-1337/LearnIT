    "content": "Neural network models have shown excellent performance in abstractive summarization by treating it as language modeling. This approach achieves competitive ROUGE scores without complex decoding methods, relying on nucleus sampling and greedy decoding. The models encode the source document and decode it into a summarized version. Neural network models excel in abstractive summarization by encoding and decoding source documents. Traditional sequence-to-sequence learning lacks a direct copy mechanism, but attention and Pointer Networks have been used to address this issue. Large-scale pretraining on unlabeled corpora has shown significant benefits. Large-scale pretraining on unlabeled corpora has shown benefits for transfer learning tasks. A simple method using decoder-only transformer language model with transfer learning achieves competitive performance in abstractive summarization without traditional sequence-to-sequence architectures. This highlights the effectiveness of finetuning language models trained on open domain text. Decoder-only Transformers are used for learning language modeling and sequence transduction in aligned domains. The model limits attention to specific tokens for predicting the next token. It utilizes transformer blocks with self-attention and modifications like moving Layer Normalization to the beginning of each block. Decoder-only Sequence Transduction is applied for summarization tasks using paired documents. The model for learning language modeling and sequence transduction in aligned domains combines source document and reference summary sequences using special learnable vectors. It includes segment-specific embeddings and positional encodings, with the model being fed three sequences: concatenation of the source document and summary, positional encodings for the summary, and segment-specific encodings. The model modifies the position encoding and adds a trainable weight for the source and summary segments. The model incorporates position encoding modifications and a trainable weight for segment encoding. Data-driven subword encoding is utilized through Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). The model is trained on the CNN/Daily Mail corpus, with source articles limited to 400 tokens and summaries to 100 tokens during training. The model is trained on the CNN/Daily Mail corpus with source articles limited to 400 tokens and summaries to 100 tokens. Experiments are conducted on the Extreme Summarization (XSum) corpus, showing the need for semantic distillation. Two training regimes are explored for CNN-DM, including finetuning on a pre-trained model and full training from scratch. The model is trained on the CNN/Daily Mail corpus with limited source articles and summaries. Experiments on the XSum corpus highlight the need for semantic distillation. Different training regimes are explored for CNN-DM, including finetuning on a pre-trained model and full training from scratch. The training uses a batch size of 10 and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125. Greedy decoding and nucleus sampling are compared for decoding, with a preference for shorter summaries avoided using a likelihood normalization term. Evaluation is done using the ROUGE metric on the F1 variants of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L. Our method's competitive performance on the CNN-DM dataset is highlighted through ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 metrics, even without complex architectures. Finetuning a well-trained language model shows a significant performance improvement, aligning with recent trends in self-supervised learning approaches. The study demonstrates competitive performance on the XSum dataset using a simple approach to abstractive summarization with decoder-only transformers. The results show effectiveness without traditional summarization tools like sequence-to-sequence modeling and coverage mechanisms.
