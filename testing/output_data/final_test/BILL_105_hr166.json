If an action is taken against a State employer, it must be brought in the name of the United States, and the person bringing the action has the right to conduct it. The \"Veterans' Job Protection Act\" allows complaints to be referred to the Attorney General for relief in a United States district court. If an action is taken against a State employer, it must be brought in the name of the United States. The United States may intervene in the action at a later date upon a showing of good cause. If the United States proceeds with the action, it has the primary responsibility for prosecuting it and may settle with the defendant despite objections from the person initiating the action. After a hearing, the court may limit the participation of the person initiating the action if it would cause harassment or undue burden to the defendant. If the United States does not intervene and the person prevails or settles the claim, they shall receive appropriate relief, including compensation or liquidated damages paid from the action's proceeds. They will also receive reasonable expenses as determined by the court. The court may award reasonable expenses, attorneys' fees, and costs against the defendant in actions brought under this subsection. The United States is not liable for expenses incurred in such actions. The amendments apply to actions under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, that are not final on the enactment date. The court may substitute parties to the action to proceed accordingly."
