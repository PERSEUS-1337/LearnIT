    "title": "AB 1211",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define a \"health facility\" as a place for the diagnosis, care, prevention, and treatment of human illness, including convalescence and rehabilitation, for 24-hour stays or longer. A general acute care hospital is a health facility with a governing body and medical staff providing 24-hour inpatient care and basic services. It may have multiple physical plants and can contract for surgical and anesthesia services. A general acute care hospital may provide surgery and anesthesia services through a contract with another acute care hospital. The State Department of Developmental Services hospital at Agnews Developmental Center can also provide these services through a contract until June 30, 2007. Hospitals operated by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Department of Veterans Affairs can offer surgery and anesthesia services during normal weekday working hours only. A \"rural general acute care hospital\" is not required to provide surgery and anesthesia services. It must meet specific criteria based on peer group designation and bed count in a small population area according to the 1980 federal census. An acute psychiatric hospital provides 24-hour inpatient care for individuals with mental health disorders or other patients referred to in specific sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code. A skilled nursing facility offers skilled nursing care and supportive care to patients needing extended skilled nursing care, including small house skilled nursing facilities. An intermediate care facility provides inpatient care to patients with recurring need for skilled nursing supervision but not continuous skilled nursing care. An intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled habilitative offers personal care and health services to individuals with developmental disabilities. A special hospital provides inpatient or outpatient care in dentistry or maternity. An intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled provides 24-hour personal care, habilitation, developmental, and supportive health services to individuals with developmental disabilities who have intermittent recurring needs for skilled nursing care. A congregate living health facility is a residential home with up to 18 beds that provides inpatient care, including medical supervision, skilled nursing, pharmacy, dietary, and recreational services. Residents must primarily need skilled nursing care on a recurring basis. The facility must also offer services for mentally alert individuals with physical disabilities, including those who may be ventilator dependent. Services for individuals with terminal or life-threatening illnesses are provided in congregate living health facilities. Terminal illness is defined as having a life expectancy of six months or less, while a life-threatening illness is one that can lead to death within five years. Services for persons who are catastrophically and severely disabled, who acquired their disability through trauma or nondegenerative neurologic illness, can receive active rehabilitation services in congregate living health facilities. These services include speech, physical, and occupational therapy. The facility's license specifies the types of individuals it can serve, and a facility operated by a city and county for this purpose may have a capacity of 59 beds. A congregate living health facility not operated by a city and county in counties with a population of 500,000 or more may have up to 25 beds for terminally ill patients. The facility must provide a noninstitutional, homelike environment. A correctional treatment center is a health facility that provides inpatient services to inmates who do not require general acute care. It offers basic services such as physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, nursing, pharmacy, and dietary services. A correctional treatment center may offer laboratory, radiology, perinatal, and other approved services. Correctional treatment centers must meet requirements similar to surgical clinics for outpatient surgical care with anesthesia. They need written agreements with hospitals for inmate health needs, must have 24-hour physician services, and should not replace general acute care hospitals at specific facilities. Regulations for correctional treatment centers operated by various entities shall not be effective until January 1, 1996, and until then, these facilities are exempt from licensing requirements. An ICF/DD-CN is a homelike facility with 4 to 8 beds providing 24-hour personal care, developmental services, and nursing supervision for individuals with developmental disabilities requiring continuous skilled nursing care. The facility serves medically fragile individuals with developmental disabilities or significant developmental delays. Licensing regulations will apply to ICF/DD-CN facilities upon adoption. ICF/DD-CN facilities must apply for licensure within 90 days of regulations becoming effective and can operate under certain sections until their application is approved or denied. A hospice facility is a health facility with a capacity of no more than 24 beds that provides hospice services, including routine care, continuous care, inpatient respite care, and inpatient hospice care. It is operated by a licensed provider of hospice services certified under federal regulations. SEC. 2. This act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. SEC. 3. This act is an urgency statute for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. To ensure immediate access to essential care for eligible patients in congregate living health facilities and to address current waiting lists, this act must take effect without delay."
