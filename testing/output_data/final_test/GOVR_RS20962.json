    "content": "The Western Sahara was a Spanish possession until the mid-1970s when Spain planned to decolonize the region. Morocco and Mauritania opposed this plan and claimed the territory, motivated by its resources. The International Court of Justice found no tie of territorial sovereignty between Morocco and Western Sahara. In response, Morocco launched a \"Green March\" to claim the region, leading Spain to withdraw and transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian administration. In the 1970s, Spain agreed to transfer Western Sahara to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian administration. The Polisario, with Algeria's support, established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 1976. Mauritania signed a peace treaty with the Polisario in 1979, leading Morocco to occupy Mauritania's sector and build a sand wall to separate its occupied territory from the Polisario and Sahrawi refugees. The United Nations proposed a settlement plan in 1988 for the conflict between Morocco's armed forces and Polisario guerrillas in Western Sahara. A cease-fire was arranged in 1991, leading to the establishment of MINURSO for a referendum on independence or integration into Morocco. James A. Baker III brokered an agreement in 1997 to restart voter identification, completed in 1999 with 86,000 voters identified. The United Nations proposed a settlement plan in 1988 for the conflict in Western Sahara. MINURSO faced over 130,000 appeals by individuals denied voter identification, backed by Morocco. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1301 (2000) suggested alternatives to a referendum due to difficulties in cooperation between Morocco, Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania. The U.N. lacked a mechanism to enforce the results of a referendum. The United Nations proposed a settlement plan in 1988 for the conflict in Western Sahara, but faced challenges with over 130,000 appeals by individuals denied voter identification. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1301 (2000) suggested alternatives to a referendum due to difficulties in cooperation between Morocco, Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania. The executive and legislative bodies in Western Sahara would be elected, with Morocco controlling foreign relations, national security, and defense. A referendum on final status was planned within five years, with residency in Western Sahara as the sole criterion for voting. Morocco accepted the framework, but Algeria and Polisario were critical. Annan hoped for negotiations to reach a consensus. In response to challenges in resolving the conflict in Western Sahara, Annan proposed four options, including a possible division of the territory or the withdrawal of U.N. involvement. The Security Council requested a new plan from Baker for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. Baker presented the Baker Peace Plan in January 2003, which called for a U.N.-organized referendum for voters to choose between integration with Morocco, autonomy, or independence. The Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees repatriation list as of October 2000 included residents of Western Sahara since December 30, 1999. The U.N. would determine voters for a referendum, with Morocco controlling foreign relations and security. Morocco objected to the referendum option and preferred autonomy as a solution, calling for negotiations with Algeria. Algeria supported the Baker Plan for self-determination. Algeria supported the Baker Plan for self-determination in Western Sahara, while the Polisario insisted on the right to choose self-determination in a referendum. James Baker resigned as the U.N. Secretary-General's personal envoy in 2004, leading to the cessation of U.N. referendum-related activities. In 2005, Peter van Walsum was appointed as the new envoy but faced challenges in drafting a new plan due to Morocco's stance on excluding independence. The U.N. could not endorse a plan excluding a referendum with independence as an option. Van Walsum reported that the Western Sahara was not high on the international political agenda, leading to a deadlock or direct negotiations. Security Council Resolution 1754 (2007) called for negotiations without preconditions for self-determination. Morocco and the Polisario met four times but were unwilling to discuss each other's proposals. Since independence, Morocco and Algeria have vied for regional dominance, with the Western Sahara conflict serving as a focal point. The Polisario accused Van Walsum of bias in favor of Morocco, leading to his replacement in negotiations. The issue has united Moroccans in support of the monarchy. King Mohammed VI has reinforced Morocco's claim to Western Sahara since 1999, investing in the region to assert sovereignty. The territory, despite being a financial burden, holds economic potential. Morocco sees it as a check on Algeria's ambitions. The king proposed decentralization for the Sahara in 2001 and emphasized respect for Morocco's territorial integrity in 2002. In 2007, Morocco presented an autonomy plan for the region. Morocco presented an autonomy plan for Western Sahara under its sovereignty in 2007. Algeria views the region as a decolonization campaign and a way to keep Morocco diplomatically isolated. Algeria supports Polisario's independence claims, leading to Morocco's isolation in Africa. Algeria's influence in Sub-Saharan Africa helped secure SADR's AU membership. Morocco, not an AU member, suspended its membership in 1984 over SADR recognition. U.S. diplomat Christopher Ross has been involved in Western Sahara talks since 2009. In 2012, U.N. envoy Christopher Ross faced criticism from Morocco for biased guidance. Despite this, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon supported Ross, who continued in his position. Ross visited Western Sahara and announced a new approach to move negotiations forward. U.N. envoy Christopher Ross aims to break the stalemate in negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario through shuttle diplomacy and confidence-building measures. MINURSO faces challenges in a volatile political and security environment, with violations of the cease-fire favoring Morocco. The U.N. Secretary-General's report suggests an extension of MINURSO's mandate. The report highlights challenges facing MINURSO, such as a shortage of military personnel and exposure to terrorist threats. The budget has slightly decreased in recent years, and concerns have been raised about human rights in Moroccan-administered Western Sahara. The State Department's human rights report on Western Sahara highlights government restrictions on civil liberties, arbitrary detention of pro-independence advocates, and the use of disproportionate force by Moroccan security forces to suppress protests. Morocco also restricts entry to foreign visitors sympathetic to the Polisario and limits the activities of pro-independence civil society groups. The U.S.-based organization Human Rights Watch and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture have reported evidence of torture used to extract \"confessions\" from Sahrawi prisoners. Positive developments in human rights include expanded activities by Morocco's National Human Rights Council and efforts by King Mohammed VI to address past human rights abuses. Concerns over freedom of expression and movement in Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria have been raised. There are few recent independent reports on conditions in the Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for human rights monitoring in both Moroccan-administered areas and the camps. The Polisario and human rights advocates want the U.N. Security Council to add human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, but Morocco strongly opposes this. In 2013, U.S. officials proposed adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, leading to backlash from Morocco. Concerns over terrorism and insecurity in the region surrounding Western Sahara have escalated with the spike in regional arms and combatant flows after the fall of the Qadhafi regime in Libya, the Mali crisis in 2012, and violent attacks on U.S. facilities in 2012-2013. A complex array of violent extremist groups have emerged in the region. In October 2011, three European aid workers were kidnapped from the Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria. A splinter faction of AQIM, MUJWA, claimed responsibility for kidnapping aid workers from the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria. There are concerns about AQIM's recruitment and smuggling operations in the camps. Moroccan officials fear that an independent Western Sahara could be vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. The Polisario denies links to AQIM and accuses Moroccan security services of supporting terrorist networks. The United States has not recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara or the SADR. The U.S. supported the U.N. settlement plan and the Baker Plan. President George W. Bush expressed understanding of Morocco's sensitivity over the Sahara issue in 2003. The U.S. did not seek to impose a solution. The State Department described Morocco's 2007 autonomy plan as serious and credible. In 2008, the State Department urged parties to focus on establishing a mutually acceptable autonomy regime in Western Sahara. In 2009, Hillary Clinton stated U.S. support for U.N.-led mediation efforts. In 2011, she called Morocco's autonomy plan \"serious, realistic, and credible.\" Clinton reiterated U.S. support for U.N.-backed talks in 2012. In January 2012, Clinton expressed support for finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara during a meeting with the Algerian Foreign Minister. The U.S. continued to back negotiations led by the United Nations and encouraged all parties, including Algeria, to be actively involved in seeking a resolution. This stance was reiterated in joint statements with Morocco in 2012, 2013, and 2014, highlighting the importance of U.S.-Moroccan relations and Morocco's role as a key regional ally and counterterrorism partner. U.S. officials consider Morocco a key ally in the region, especially in counterterrorism efforts and Middle East policy. They prefer a solution to the Western Sahara dispute that does not destabilize Mohammed VI's rule or harm U.S.-Moroccan security cooperation. The U.N.-led process is emphasized to avoid antagonizing Algeria, with the belief that a settlement could promote regional stability and economic prosperity. The U.N. Security Council recently reauthorized MINURSO, increasing its troop ceiling by 15 military observers. The U.N. Security Council recently reauthorized MINURSO, increasing its troop ceiling by 15 military observers to a total authorized level of 237 military personnel and six police officers. The United States supports this increase and contributes funding to MINURSO but does not provide uniformed personnel. The Obama Administration has requested $17.5 million for MINURSO in FY2015. The U.N. Security Council reauthorized MINURSO with increased troop levels. U.S. diplomats supported human rights monitoring in MINURSO's mandate, leading to Morocco's opposition. However, human rights monitoring was not added. Congressional positions vary on Morocco's autonomy initiative and human rights concerns in Western Sahara. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act allows bilateral economic assistance for Morocco to be used in Western Sahara. Funds cannot be programmed in Western Sahara to avoid acknowledging Moroccan sovereignty. The act also requires reporting on human rights conditions in Western Sahara. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act allows bilateral economic assistance for Morocco to be used in Western Sahara, with reporting required on human rights conditions. In FY2012, the government of Morocco was urged to respect human rights in Western Sahara, including releasing political prisoners and supporting U.N. monitoring efforts. Despite diplomatic efforts, the stalemate continues, and a comprehensive review may be needed if no progress is made by April 2015. In 2013, the U.N. Secretary-General reported to the Security Council on the urgent need to address instability in the Sahel region, including the Western Sahara dispute. The Polisario seeks self-determination through a referendum, while Morocco proposes autonomy under its sovereignty. Some Sahrawis feel caught between the two sides, with uncertain international leverage. Regional instability may impact U.S. officials' approach. The Polisario periodically threatens armed struggle but relies on Algeria for support. Despite poor Morocco-Algeria relations, the Polisario is outmatched by the Moroccan army. Protests against Morocco are encouraged, but terrorism has not been used. The Polisario has encouraged pro-independence protests against Morocco but denies links to terrorism. Morocco insists on its autonomy proposal as the best solution, citing investments in the region and governance reforms. The Economic, Social, and Environmental Council proposed a new development model for the territory. The reports propose a new development model for the territory focusing on sustainability, participatory democracy, and social cohesion. King Mohammed VI aims for decentralization to empower residents. International investor interest has grown due to offshore oil exploration. The Polisario opposes resource extraction agreements with Morocco and has its own agreements with oil companies. The territory's status under international law is uncertain. The status of the territory under international law complicates investor operations. If oil is found, it could heighten the conflict stakes. Aid is provided to Sahrawi refugees in Tindouf by UNHCR, World Food Program, and humanitarian organizations. The camps are administered by Polisario, with Algeria not allowing a census of inhabitants. Observers suggest the refugee numbers may be lower than reported, with concerns of aid diversion. Limited reports on camp conditions and disputed refugee numbers contribute to socioeconomic hardships and dissatisfaction among the youth. Relations between Morocco and Algeria are strained due to the unresolved Western Sahara issue, leading to dissatisfaction among refugees, especially the youth. The border between the two countries has been closed since 1994, hindering normalization. The Western Sahara dispute also contributes to the inactivity of the Arab Maghreb Union, of which both countries are members."
