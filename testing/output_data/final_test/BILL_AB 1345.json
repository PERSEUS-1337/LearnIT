    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the historical role of fire in California's forest ecosystems and the negative impact of fire suppression efforts, leading to unnaturally high fuel accumulations and increased wildfire risk. Historically, fire regimes in California were frequent, burning with less intensity and mainly surface fuels. Today's forest fires are more catastrophic, devastating wide areas, threatening buildings and life, and causing severe erosion. California is expected to experience more large fires in the future, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions, potentially rising by over 50% in the next 70 years. The 2013 Rim Fire burned 250,000 acres over 69 days, causing economic and environmental damage, destroying habitat for rare animals, and releasing 11 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. The fire's growth was attributed to a century of fuel buildup from fire suppression policies. The 2007 Angora Fire emitted 143,000 tons of greenhouse gases, with potential emissions reduced by lowering tree density. The state board, in consultation with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, will estimate and develop an emissions baseline for wildfires in California between 1990 and 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The state board and Department of Forestry and Fire Protection annually estimate greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires, considering emissions from federally managed lands. The Legislature appropriates funds to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state. Beginning in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, 35 percent of annual proceeds are continuously appropriated for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs. This includes funds for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program and the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program. The Controller allocates funds based on program requirements and distribution formula. Twenty percent of annual proceeds are appropriated to the Strategic Growth Council for Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, with at least 10 percent for affordable housing. In the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, 25% of the fund's annual proceeds are appropriated to the High-Speed Rail Authority for project costs, environmental review, design, and loan repayment. Beginning in the 2016-17 fiscal year, $100 million is continuously appropriated to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection from the fund to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by preventing catastrophic wildfires through vegetation management, biomass energy incentives, private actions incentives, and reforestation of burned lands. Annual proceeds for calculations will not include funds subject to Section 39719.1. The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is tasked with developing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires by 20% below the baseline by 2035. Strategies may include vegetation management, biomass energy incentives, and other measures. The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is developing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires. This includes vegetation management, biomass energy incentives, private actions to reduce wildfire risk, reforestation of burned lands, and agreements with the federal government."
