    "content": "The Supreme Court ruled in Digital Realty, Inc. v. Somers that the whistleblower protections under Section 922 of Dodd-Frank do not apply to internal whistleblowers who report violations within their organizations. This decision narrowed the scope of the whistleblower program at the SEC created by Dodd-Frank, which provides incentives and protections for securities law whistleblowers. The Supreme Court's ruling in Digital Realty narrowed Dodd-Frank's whistleblower protections for internal whistleblowers reporting violations within their organizations. Section 922 of Dodd-Frank establishes incentives and protections for whistleblowers reporting securities law violations, aiming to improve SEC regulation and enforcement. The new whistleblower program introduced by Dodd-Frank provides monetary incentives and anti-retaliation protections for whistleblowers who report securities law violations to the SEC. Eligible whistleblowers who provide original information leading to successful enforcement actions with sanctions over one million dollars can receive financial awards ranging from 10 to 30 percent of the collected sanctions. The SEC determines the exact award amount based on various factors. The SEC's whistleblower program, established by Dodd-Frank, provides incentives for individuals who report securities law violations. The program excludes whistleblowers convicted of related criminal violations. In its seventh year, the program has resulted in $975 million in monetary sanctions, with funds returned to investors. The SEC's whistleblower program, established by Dodd-Frank, has resulted in $975 million in monetary sanctions, with funds returned to investors. The program has awarded $160 million in whistleblower awards, with the largest award being $83 million to three whistleblowers. The Financial CHOICE Act passed by the House of Representatives in June 2017 may exclude certain whistleblowers from eligibility for financial incentive awards. The CHOICE Act may deny whistleblower awards to those complicit in or failing to prevent reported misconduct, potentially reducing the pool of whistleblowers. Critics argue this could hinder reporting by those in subordinate positions to wrongdoers, while supporters believe the program should not reward inaction. Section 922 of the CHOICE Act enhances anti-retaliation protections for whistleblowers, allowing individuals to sue employers for retaliation. The SEC has focused on restrictions in separation agreements that hinder reporting of securities law violations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) provides significant whistleblower protection in federal securities law, allowing employees to report violations to regulatory agencies, Congress, or supervisors without retaliation. This protection includes reinstatement, double back pay, interest, and compensation for litigation costs and fees. The Dodd-Frank Act references SOX in its anti-retaliation provision, emphasizing the importance of understanding the pre-existing protections available under SOX for whistleblowers. SOX mandates audit committees to establish procedures for internal complaints and reporting of suspected abuses within public companies. Auditors and attorneys must report violations internally before going to an outside agency. Employees can file complaints with the Secretary of Labor within 180 days of retaliatory conduct, with remedies including reinstatement, backpay, and special damages. Dodd-Frank provides more generous protections for whistleblowers compared to SOX, offering longer statute of limitations, reinstatement, and double backpay as remedies. The anti-retaliation provision prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblowers who report securities law violations to the SEC. The anti-retaliation provision under Dodd-Frank protects whistleblowers who report securities law violations to the SEC, as well as those who assist in investigations. It also covers whistleblowers who make disclosures required under SOX. The definition of \"whistleblower\" in Dodd-Frank complicates the scope of protection. The definition of \"whistleblower\" in Dodd-Frank complicates protection for internal whistleblowers, as it suggests reporting to the SEC is necessary. The case of Digital Realty highlights this tension, where an employee was fired after internally reporting securities law violations. Somers filed a lawsuit alleging violations of Section 922, which was dismissed for not reporting to the SEC. The Ninth Circuit ruled he could sue under Dodd-Frank without reporting to the SEC, creating a circuit split. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation provision protects internal whistleblowers, in line with the SEC's definition of \"whistleblower\" to include them. This interpretation aims to prevent a narrow reading that would undermine the statute's purpose. The Fifth Circuit ruled in Asadi v. G.E. Energy (USA), L.L.C. that to qualify as a \"whistleblower\" under Dodd-Frank, an individual must report a suspected violation to the SEC. The court determined that the reference to SOX in the anti-retaliation provision does not expand the definition of a \"whistleblower\" and emphasized the importance of reporting to the Commission. The court also discussed a scenario where third category whistleblower protections would apply under a more limited reading of the definition. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a whistleblower under Dodd-Frank must report to the SEC to qualify, stating that internal reporting would render SOX protections moot. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the statutory definition of \"whistleblower\" must be followed, resolving the case in favor of Digital Realty. The Supreme Court emphasized the purpose of the enhanced whistleblower provision in Digital Realty case, quoting Dodd-Frank's Senate Report. It rejected arguments that reporting to the SEC was necessary to qualify as a whistleblower, stating that the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation provision would still protect those who report internally and to the SEC. The Digital Realty decision clarified that internal whistleblowers must rely on SOX protections, which are less advantageous than those under Dodd-Frank. Despite this, both internal and external whistleblower reporting are still protected under federal law. The ruling may impact the enforcement of federal securities law by limiting relief for internal whistleblowers, who historically outnumber external whistleblowers. The Digital Realty decision favors incentivizing reporting of securities law violations to authorities over internal compliance efforts, potentially increasing the risk of noncompliance with federal law. The impact on corporations subject to Dodd-Frank's whistleblower provisions remains unclear. Notable amici like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported a narrower \"whistleblower\" definition to avoid increased costs for companies facing more whistleblower actions in federal court. The Digital Realty decision may lead to an increase in whistleblower reports to the SEC, potentially resulting in more regulatory actions and higher costs for companies. The ruling could shift the focus from internal resolutions to external reporting, impacting the efficiency of weeding out non-meritorious claims. The long-term effects on companies and compliance with Dodd-Frank regulations are yet to be determined. The SEC adopted the final pay ratio disclosure rule on August 5, 2015, requiring companies to disclose the annual total compensation of their CEO compared to the median employee's compensation. Companies began making pay ratio disclosures in 2017, with a wide range of ratios reported. This provision is part of Title IX of Dodd-Frank, focusing on \"Accountability and Executive.\" Title IX of Dodd-Frank includes provisions for transparency and shareholder involvement in executive compensation. Section 951 mandates \"say on pay\" votes every three years, while Section 953(a) requires \"pay versus performance\" disclosure in annual proxy statements. These measures aim to address risky behavior incentivized by executive compensation. The SEC adopted the Rule to enable shareholders to cast \"say on pay\" votes and show the relationship between executive compensation and financial performance, as mandated by Dodd-Frank's provisions for transparency in executive compensation. The disclosure of executive pay in relation to performance aims to enhance corporate responsibility and shareholder evaluation. Interpretations of the pay ratio disclosure rule vary among SEC Commissioners, public commenters, and commentators. Former SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White acknowledged the divided views on this requirement. The pay ratio disclosure requirement has sparked divided opinions among SEC Commissioners and public commenters. Supporters believe it will deter executive pay practices that led to the financial crisis and reduce wealth inequality, while dissenting Commissioners see it as a mere \"name and shame\" exercise with no apparent shareholder benefits. The pay ratio disclosure rule aims to lower CEO pay by shaming companies. Concerns were raised about potential government actions tying corporate tax rates to pay ratios. Compliance costs were estimated at $1.3 billion, with exemptions for certain issuers. The SEC's pay ratio calculation rule is flexible and aims to comply with statutory requirements while considering compliance costs. Issuers must use specific standards for calculating executive pay, with reasonable estimates allowed for annual total compensation. The rule requires the median worker-CEO pay ratio to be calculated. The SEC's pay ratio calculation rule under Dodd-Frank requires companies to calculate the median worker-CEO pay ratio using the annual total compensation of all employees, including part-time, temporary, and foreign employees. Annualizing pay for part-time or temporary employees is not allowed, but new hires' pay can be annualized. Contractors employed by third parties are not included in the definition of employees for this calculation. The SEC's pay ratio calculation rule allows for exemptions regarding workers' compensation inclusion. The exemptions include the Data Privacy Exemption, where employees in countries with strict data privacy laws can be excluded, and the De minimis Exemption, allowing up to 5% exclusion of non-U.S. employees. Any exclusions must be disclosed. The SEC's pay ratio calculation rule allows for exemptions regarding workers' compensation inclusion. Exemptions must be disclosed, including the jurisdiction(s) and approximate number of employees at issue. The definition of \"employee\" under the Rule is broad, causing difficulties for registrants as it does not align with other legal definitions. Recent SEC guidance clarified that registrants may use their existing records for pay ratio calculations. Recent SEC guidance clarified that registrants may use existing payroll and tax records to determine their employee pool for pay ratio calculations. Registrants have the flexibility to choose a reasonable method to identify the median employee and calculate annual total compensation, including using statistical sampling or consistently applied compensation measures. The methodology used must be disclosed in public filings. The Rule allows registrants to choose a determination date within the last three months of their fiscal year to identify the median employee, departing from the initial proposal of a fixed date. This change was made to avoid disproportionate effects on companies with seasonal workers. The chosen date must be disclosed in public filings, and if changed annually, the reason must be provided. Registrants are required to identify the median employee every three years instead of annually. The SEC Rule allows registrants to identify the median employee every three years if there have been no significant changes in employee population or compensation arrangements. Cost of living adjustments can be made for employees in different jurisdictions, with non-adjusted figures also disclosed. The SEC Rule allows registrants to supplement the pay ratio disclosure with additional information or supplemental ratios, but the main practical problem is the difficulty in making direct comparisons between companies. The SEC's focus is on helping shareholders understand a registrant's compensation and pay ratio disclosures rather than comparing them to other companies. Given the challenges in making direct comparisons between companies, commentators advise registrants to contextualize their disclosure with additional ratios or information. The lack of purely comparable ratios may pose challenges to the SEC's pay ratio rule, potentially leading to legal challenges in the future. The pay ratio rule may face legal challenges based on requirements for agency rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act and securities law requirements for SEC rulemaking. Courts can invalidate agency determinations that are arbitrary or not in accordance with the law, and the SEC must consider promoting efficiency, competition, and capital formation. These principles are crucial in a court's assessment. The SEC's consideration of the pay ratio rule may face legal challenges for not adequately assessing the impact of flexible approaches on pay ratio disclosure accuracy. Commissioner Piwowar questioned the effect of different methodologies for determining the median employee and the 5% de minimis exception for foreign workers. The SEC should have evaluated if these allowances would deviate from a strict \"annual total compensation\" approach under Item 402. The SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis conducted a study on the impact of excluding different percentages of employees on the pay ratio calculation. It found that a 5% exclusion could result in a 6.9% range of deviation, confirming minimal effects on the ratio calculation. Legal challenges may arise regarding the SEC's analysis of the costs and benefits of the Rule, with concerns raised about the adequacy of assessing economic effects. Some argue that the SEC should have further assessed the costs of specific portions of the Rule, like allowing a flexible calculation date. Critics also point out the lack of quantifying benefits for a cost-benefit analysis. The Rule may face challenges due to the SEC's failure to conduct investor testing on how pay ratio information would be used, as required by Section 912 of Dodd-Frank. The SEC may engage in temporary investor testing programs to evaluate rules or programs in the public interest or to protect investors. Critics argue that without empirical testing, it is unclear if investors would use pay ratio for direct comparison among registrants. The D.C. Circuit has recognized that agencies do not need to base every action on empirical data. The Financial CHOICE Act passed by the House of Representatives in June 2017 would eliminate the pay ratio provision. The Financial CHOICE Act passed by the House of Representatives in June 2017 aims to repeal many Dodd-Frank provisions, including the pay ratio provision in Section 953(b). The SEC called for further comments on compliance difficulties with the Rule, but it is unclear what action they will take. Dodd-Frank also requires the SEC to enforce other disclosure rules, such as the \"conflict minerals\" and \"resource extraction\" rules under Title XV. The \"conflict minerals\" and \"resource extraction\" rules require disclosures on mineral sources and government payments for natural resource development. These rules aim to bring social and political change in foreign countries, addressing armed conflict in the DRC and reducing corruption in resource-rich nations. Despite skepticism from courts, distinctions exist between these rules and the pay ratio disclosure rule. The conflict minerals rule targets the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals. The conflict minerals rule aims to address the exploitation of minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo financing conflict and contributing to a humanitarian crisis. Companies must conduct inquiries and due diligence for tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold in their products. The D.C. Circuit ruled against the requirement to label minerals as \"DRC conflict free.\" The NAM case challenged the conflict minerals rule's requirement to label minerals as \"DRC conflict free\" and raised First Amendment concerns regarding compelled speech. The case questioned the level of scrutiny courts should apply to such speech restrictions, with the Supreme Court's Central Hudson test requiring a substantial government interest directly advanced by a narrowly tailored restriction on speech. The Supreme Court ruled in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel that a rule regulating a lawyer's deceptive advertisement merited a lower level of scrutiny. The D.C. Circuit initially applied Central Hudson's intermediate test to the conflict minerals rule but later overturned this decision in American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, expanding the application of Zauderer scrutiny to disclosures required for other government interests. This led to a reevaluation of the initial decision, with a three-judge panel still holding that Central Hudson scrutiny applied to the conflict minerals rule. The D.C. Circuit applied Zauderer scrutiny to the conflict minerals rule, citing the uncertainty of First Amendment commercial speech doctrine. It found that the required disclosures did not meet an adequate government objective and went beyond presenting purely factual information, potentially implying ethical issues with products. The pay ratio disclosure rule may face a First Amendment challenge, with questions about the level of scrutiny that applies. The rule does not directly relate to advertising, suggesting Central Hudson scrutiny may apply. The broader view of Zauderer scrutiny from the American Meat Institute ruling could also be relevant. The D.C. Circuit has recognized limited First Amendment scrutiny for government-mandated disclosures in the securities industry. The pay ratio rule may face First Amendment scrutiny, with questions about the level of scrutiny that applies. The rule shares similarities with the rule upheld in American Meat Institute, which required disclosure of \"country of origin\" information for meat products. The court held that the relationship between the rule's means and ends was adequate under Zauderer. The SEC's goal of providing information to investors through numerical figures may be viewed similarly to the rule in American Meat Institute. The SEC is reevaluating the conflict minerals rule after the D.C. Circuit's decision in NAM. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 aims to repeal the section of Dodd-Frank authorizing the conflict minerals rule. The CHOICE Act of 2017 seeks to repeal the conflict minerals rule under Dodd-Frank, which aimed to increase transparency in payments made by companies to governments for resource development. The rule was vacated by a court in 2013 and later legislatively repealed in early 2017. The court vacated an initial version of the resource extraction rule, finding that the SEC misinterpreted Dodd-Frank by requiring public disclosure of government payments. The court criticized the SEC for not providing exemptions to the disclosure rule, despite industry concerns about legality in certain countries. The SEC passed a revised rule in 2016. The SEC's revised resource extraction rule in 2016 allowed companies to apply for exemptions on a case-by-case basis. Congress revoked the rule in 2017, but the SEC still has the power to create a new rule. The Financial CHOICE Act aims to repeal Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank, but this is not included in the Senate's recent legislation."
