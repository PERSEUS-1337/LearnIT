    "content": "The report discusses the compliance of the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) with WTO Green Box rules. Questions have been raised about the USDA implementation rules for CSP and the use of CRP land for activities like harvesting hay and grazing. Both programs are important policy tools, but certain aspects may be ambiguous in terms of WTO rule compliance. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) is a voluntary program under the 2002 farm bill that provides financial and technical assistance for conservation on tribal and private working lands. Unlike other programs, CSP allows payments for conservation on land that remains in production. The program is administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on a watershed basis to prioritize funding in high-impact areas. In FY2006, USDA spent $259 million on 19,375 CSP contracts covering 15.8 million acres. In FY2006, 4,400 new CSP contracts were added, covering 15.8 million acres with an average outlay of $16.40 per acre. Participants prepare a CSP contract with a stewardship plan detailing conservation activities. Contracts last 5 to 10 years and offer three levels of participation with increasing resource management standards. Participants may receive four types of payments based on their stewardship plan. The CSP program offers various types of payments, including one-time new practice cost-share payments and enhanced payments. These payments are calculated based on the number of acres enrolled in CSP, stewardship payment rate, tier factor, and tier reduction factor. The reduction factor aims to distribute limited funding towards targeted activities. Additionally, USDA and producers share specific costs incurred in meeting contract obligations. Payments for new and existing practices are restricted by the farm bill. The CSP program offers various types of payments, including one-time new practice cost-share payments and enhancement payments. USDA and producers share specific costs in meeting contract obligations. Payments for new and existing practices are restricted by the farm bill to not exceed 75% of the practice cost, with exceptions for beginning farmers and ranchers. USDA has implemented restrictions to minimize paperwork, such as flat rates for existing practice payments and a cap on new practice payments. Enhancement payments are available for exceptional conservation efforts and additional practices that provide increased resource benefits. NRCS aims to base enhancement payments on objective measures of adoption cost or environmental benefit. The CSP program offers various types of payments, including one-time new practice cost-share payments and enhancement payments. Payments are restricted by the farm bill to not exceed certain percentages of the unadjusted stewardship payment. Funding for CSP totaled $505.4 million from FY2003 to FY2006, with no new contracts funded in FY2007. In FY2007, CSP outlays will be limited to existing contracts, mostly for cost-share payments. Outlays in FY2006 were $259 million, with $7.1 million for stewardship payments and $2.6 million for enhancement payments. CSP payments must comply with WTO Green Box criteria, reimbursing costs incurred or income forgone. Bonus or incentive payments exceeding costs could raise compliance questions. The compliance status of CSP payments could be questioned. Cost-share payments align with reimbursing extra costs or loss of income for CSP program compliance. Stewardship payments may have a bonus or incentive aspect based on participation levels. Enhancement payments are seen as a bonus for exceeding contract practices, but their value limit is unclear. The combined effect of tier and reduction factors on stewardship payments reduces them to a minor share of the 2001 average rental rate. Even bonus-like payments could be classified as Green Box eligible direct payments under certain criteria. Stewardship payments in the CSP program may comply with specific criteria outlined in paragraph 6, despite initial concerns about violating payment regulations based on land use. Analysts from the EU and US have debated this issue. Various policy analysts from the EU and US have debated the merits of bonus-type conservation payments in the context of WTO regulations. The current Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations has not focused on Green Box criteria or included provisions for conservation bonus-type payments. It is uncertain if the Green Box criteria will be a significant factor in the final Doha Round agreement. The vulnerability of ambiguous bonus-type payments to WTO challenges remains a concern. The vulnerability of bonus-type conservation payments to WTO challenges is correlated with subsidy outlays. USDA programs attract more scrutiny with large subsidy payments. CSP funding has been relatively small compared to total farm support programs. CSP payments are targeted to conservation practices and are minimally trade-distorting. If CSP funding levels were to greatly expand, they could attract greater attention. The Congressional Budget Office projected steady increase in CSP program outlays from $259 million in FY2006 to $769 million by FY2013. The Administration's farm bill proposal aims to make CSP fully WTO-compatible by replacing current payments with a single \"enhancement payment\" based on producer's income forgone and costs incurred for conservation practices. The Conservation Reserve Program, enacted in 1985, provides payments to farmers to take highly erodible or environmentally sensitive cropland out of production for conservation purposes. The program aims to conserve soil and water resources by incentivizing farmers to implement conservation practices. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the federal government's largest private land retirement program, with outlays totaling $1.8 billion in FY2006. It covers almost 37 million acres and is administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency. CRP payments are considered Green Box-compliant under WTO guidelines if used to retire land from agricultural production for at least three years. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows for modification or waiver of contracts to permit agricultural production activities like harvesting hay, livestock grazing, and potentially biomass feedstock production for bioenergy. Policymakers have considered CRP land for renewable energy projects like wind turbines. The Secretary of Agriculture has allowed harvesting hay and grazing on CRP lands during severe droughts to help livestock managers facing hardship. Despite potential violations of CRP conditions, USDA classified subsidy outlays as Green Box resource retirement program payments. The 2002 farm bill formalized the use of CRP land for harvesting hay and grazing during droughts, with a possible exemption for biomass harvesting or wind turbine installation. The Secretary of Agriculture may permit managed harvesting and grazing on CRP lands for conservation purposes, including during droughts or emergencies, with a reduction in rental payment under the contract. The Secretary of Agriculture may permit managed harvesting and grazing on CRP lands for conservation purposes, including during droughts or emergencies, with a reduction in rental payment under the contract. WTO rules do not allow exceptions to the eligibility requirement that the land be removed from marketable agricultural production, potentially conflicting with the 2002 farm bill exception for harvesting hay and grazing on CRP land. Generation of electric energy by wind turbines on CRP land is not exempt from these rules. Future commercial biomass harvesting on CRP land may be considered an agricultural production activity, especially with the growing interest in cellulosic ethanol production. This could potentially lead to significant exports of U.S. biofuels and impact the use of import barriers on foreign biofuels. Biomass harvesting may attract criticism if done extensively with large subsidies, potentially affecting the classification of such activities. Potential reclassification of CRP land use from a retirement program to an environmental program under U.S. farm legislation could help avoid WTO challenges. This includes addressing ambiguities in notification of CSP payments and agricultural activities on CRP land. This tactic aims to minimize the impact of a $0.54 per gallon tariff on foreign biofuels."
