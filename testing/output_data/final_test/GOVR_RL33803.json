    "content": "During the 1970-1973 period, Congress considered proposals to restrict U.S. military operations in Indochina and require troop withdrawal from Vietnam in response to growing controversy over U.S. involvement. The Nixon Administration's policies included a staged withdrawal of troops from Vietnam as part of the Vietnamization strategy. Troop levels decreased from 539,000 in June 1969 to 415,000 by the end of 1972. According to Department of Defense statistics, U.S. troop levels decreased significantly from 539,000 in June 1969 to 21,500 in January 1973. In 1974, a bill was passed to limit personnel levels in Indochina to 4,000 by mid-1975 and 3,000 by the end of 1975. The Nixon Administration did not set a goal for total withdrawal of U.S. forces or an end to combat operations in Vietnam, with the Air Force continuing bombing missions. Congress proposed amendments to withdraw troops and end combat operations, but none were passed into law. The incursion of U.S. ground forces into eastern Cambodia ordered by President Nixon in April 1970 led to congressional amendments prohibiting further ground forces and aerial bombing in Cambodia. The \"Cooper-Church\" amendment in January 1971 banned reintroduction of ground forces, while bills in 1973 ended funding for bombing on August 15, 1973. This incursion influenced congressional efforts to restrict U.S. military operations. The \"Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\" was signed between the United States and North Vietnam on January 27, 1973, leading to the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from South Vietnam by March 1973. President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger faced challenges in securing the support of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu during negotiations. President Nixon and other Administration officials hinted publicly in March 1973 that the United States would intervene militarily if North Vietnam violated the cease-fire agreement. President Nixon submitted a report to Congress asserting that the United States would not tolerate communist violations of the agreement and would take swift retaliatory action if Hanoi failed to abide by the terms. This included the possibility of renewing U.S. bombing of North Vietnam and North Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam. In 1971 and 1972, Nixon ordered heavy bombing of communist forces in South Vietnam as U.S. ground forces were withdrawn. This influenced Congress to pass legislation in mid-1973 cutting off funding for combat operations in Vietnam. The proposals to cut off funds generally prohibit obligating or expending funds in a particular bill after Congress has appropriated the funds. Funding prohibitions apply to specific countries and types of military activities, with some cases prohibiting funds for certain military operations like combat operations. Funding cutoffs in bills were implemented based on specific conditions or events, such as negotiating a cease-fire or the safe withdrawal of troops. The President could recommend extending deadlines if conditions were not met, and Congress could reverse funding prohibitions by authorizing the activity. These restrictions applied to funds included in the bill and were set to take effect on or after a specified date. Funding restrictions in bills were applied based on specific conditions or events, such as negotiating a cease-fire or safe troop withdrawal. The restrictions applied to various types of bills and prohibited a range of military activities, from specific attacks to general combat operations. The well-known McGovern-Hatfield amendment in 1970 combined several of these elements. The 1970 McGovern-Hatfield amendment combined elements of funding restrictions for military activities in Vietnam, setting deadlines for troop levels and withdrawal, and giving the President some flexibility to propose alternatives. It limited troop levels to 280,000 armed forces after April 30, 1971, with a provision for a 60-day extension if necessary. The expenditure of funds was restricted to the safe withdrawal of remaining forces or providing asylum to endangered Vietnamese until December 31, 1971. In June 1971, several proposals were considered by Congress during the Indochina conflict, including amendments by Senator Mansfield for the termination of U.S. military operations and withdrawal of troops. While some of these amendments were enacted in the fall of 1971, no specific deadline was set. Ultimately, all U.S. troops were withdrawn by March 1973 as required. The U.S. troops were withdrawn by March 1973 as required by the Paris Peace accords, following the first Mansfield amendment. Congress also considered provisions for troop removal in Somalia in 1993 and repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1971. Funding restrictions on military operations were imposed by the Cooper-Church Amendment. The United States is prohibited from financing the introduction of ground troops into Cambodia or providing advisers to Cambodian military forces. Additionally, funds cannot be used for combat activities by US military forces in North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia after August 15, 1973. P.L. 93-124 amends a joint resolution by changing a date and P.L. 93-50 prohibits funds for aiding North Vietnam and combat activities in Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam by US forces. After August 15, 1973, no funds previously or subsequently appropriated can be used to finance US military involvement in hostilities in North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia without specific authorization from Congress. Additionally, no funds can be used to provide assistance to North Vietnam without congressional approval. The Byrd Amendment, P.L. 103-139, limits the total number of civilian officers, employees, and members of the Armed Forces of the United States present in South Vietnam. After six months, the total number cannot exceed four thousand, with not more than two thousand five hundred being members of the armed forces. After one year, the total number cannot exceed three thousand, with not more than one thousand five hundred being members of the armed forces. The Byrd Amendment, P.L. 103-139, limits the number of US military personnel in Somalia for force protection and advisory roles under the Department of Defense until March 31, 1994, with the possibility of extension if approved by Congress. The President of the United States has control over US commanders in Somalia and is urged to seek additional troops from UN member countries. The Cooper-Church Amendment prohibits the use of funds for retaining American forces in Cambodia after July 1, 1970 without specific authorization by law. The Cooper-Church Amendment prohibits the expenditure of funds for retaining US forces in Cambodia after July 1, 1970, including paying compensation or allowances, providing military instruction, or engaging in combat activities in support of Cambodian forces. The President's constitutional power as Commander in Chief is not impugned, including the protection of US armed forces deployed overseas. The McGovern-Hatfield Amendment restricts the use of funds to maintain more than 280,000 troops in Vietnam after April 30, 1971. It outlines objectives for the withdrawal of armed forces by December 31, 1971, securing the release of prisoners of war, and providing asylum for Vietnamese individuals. The McGovern-Hatfield Amendment outlines objectives for the withdrawal of armed forces from Vietnam by December 31, 1971, including securing the release of prisoners of war, providing asylum for endangered Vietnamese individuals, and offering assistance to the Republic of Vietnam. If the President finds that American forces are in unanticipated danger, he can suspend certain provisions for up to 60 days and submit recommendations to Congress for approval. The McGovern-Hatfield Amendment prohibits the use of funds for US military operations in Indochina after December 31, 1971. The President can ensure the safety of American forces during withdrawal, provide asylum for at-risk individuals, and offer assistance to Indochina nations with Congress approval. If American prisoners of war are not released within 60 days, certain provisions can be suspended. The Chiles Amendment, H.R. 6531 Sec. 302, states that no funds can be used after June 1, 1972, to support US military operations in Indochina. The President can still ensure the safety of American forces during withdrawal and provide asylum with Congress approval. If American prisoners of war are not released by December 31, 1971, provisions can be extended for sixty days. The Cook Amendment, H.R. 6531 Sec. 302, aims to terminate US military involvement in Indochina within nine months and withdraw all forces. Assistance can be provided to South Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians in danger, with Congress approval. This policy is contingent on the release of American prisoners of war by a specified date. The Cook Amendment, H.R. 6531 Sec. 302, calls for the withdrawal of all US military forces and equipment from South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia within nine months. No funds can be used to support US military operations in these countries after nine months unless there is a firm commitment for the release of American prisoners of war held by North Vietnam. Congress may decide to extend subsection (a) provisions after receiving a report from the President, with one-third of House members able to sponsor a bill to continue the provisions. The section outlines the process for bills or resolutions referred to a committee in Congress, stating they must be reported within three days unless determined otherwise by a House vote. It also specifies that any bill reported becomes pending business and must be voted on within three days, unless decided otherwise. The section does not affect the President's authority to ensure the safety of the Armed Forces during withdrawal from South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, or to arrange asylum for South Vietnamese. The text discusses provisions related to the withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, including arranging asylum for endangered individuals and providing assistance to the nations of Indochina. It also includes the Nedzi-Whalen Amendment, which prohibits the use of funds for military operations in the region after December 31, 1971, unless necessary for the safe withdrawal of personnel or return of prisoners of war. The section recommends Congress to set a new date within the fiscal year to achieve objectives related to the withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
