    "content": "President Bush announced on June 18, 2008, his plan to open areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for oil and gas development, reversing his previous position and lifting the executive ban on the OCS. Senator John McCain and others have called on Congress to lift offshore drilling moratoria as well. The Administration aims to start planning a new five-year leasing program to begin in 2010, two years ahead of schedule, superseding the current program from 2007-2012. The President lifted the executive ban on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for oil and gas development in 2010. Congress introduced legislation to lift the congressional prohibition on leasing and development in the OCS. The House passed H.R. 6899 to allow leasing in OCS areas, despite opposition. The House defeated an alternative bill, H.R. 6709, and an attempt to lift the offshore moratoria was also defeated. A measure to increase rental fees on non-producing oil and gas leases was also defeated. Oil and gas leasing has been prohibited on much of the outer continental shelf since the 1980s. The annual Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill from 1982-2006 restricted offshore leasing to the Gulf of Mexico and parts of Alaska. Presidents Bush and Clinton imposed moratoria on offshore leasing until 2012. Debate surrounds the environmental risks of offshore drilling versus the need for domestic oil and gas production for energy security. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 governs leasing of OCS lands. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 governs the leasing of OCS lands to protect the environment and generate revenues for the federal government. The leasing process involves submitting five-year programs specifying areas to be offered, including environmental impact statements. The latest plan took effect in 2002, with public hearings for the 2007-2012 program ongoing. States and interest groups are providing comments on future lease sale areas, seeking a larger share of federal revenues and assistance for coastal areas. Proponents of proposals seek more assistance for coastal areas affected by offshore energy development, focusing on federal revenues and coastal destruction, especially in Louisiana. Currently, affected states receive revenue from offshore oil and gas leases, but at a lower rate compared to states with onshore federal leases. Opponents argue against increasing assistance for coastal areas. Opponents raise concerns about the budget implications of redirecting revenues to states with onshore federal leases."
