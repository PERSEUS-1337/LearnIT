    "title": "SB 704",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1091 of the Government Code is amended to clarify that an officer can be involved in a contract if they have only a remote interest, disclose it, and have it noted in official records, with the contract then being authorized, approved, or ratified by the body or board without counting the officer's vote. In Section 1091 of the Government Code, an officer can participate in a contract if they have a remote interest, disclose it, and have it recorded in official documents. The contract must then be authorized, approved, or ratified by the governing body without the officer's vote counting. The Government Code allows an officer to participate in a contract with a contracting party under certain conditions, including if the officer has a remote interest, discloses it, and has it recorded. Time of employment with the contracting party by the officer is counted in computing the three-year period specified, even if the organization changes within three years, as long as the ownership remains the same or substantially similar. Employees or agents of the contracting party can also be involved in the contract under specific conditions. The agency officer can participate in a contract with a local public agency under specific conditions, including competitive bidding, no personal services, not in a primary management role with the contracting party, and not involved in formulating the bid. The contracting party must have 10 or more employees, be the lowest responsible bidder, and the employee or agent must not have a direct interest in the contracting party. Other exceptions include a parent earning from a minor child's services, and a landlord or tenant of the contracting party. (5) Exceptions to the conflict of interest rule include a landlord or tenant of the contracting party, an attorney, owner, officer, employee, or agent of a firm providing services to the contracting party without receiving remuneration, and a member of a nonprofit corporation engaged in agricultural merchandising or water supply. (8) A supplier of goods or services to the contracting party for at least five years prior to their election or appointment.\n(9) Subject to Section 1090 in any contract under the California Land Conservation Act of 1965.\n(10) A director or person with 10% ownership in a bank, bank holding company, or savings and loan association with a relationship to the contract party. (11) Applies to employees of consulting firms in engineering, architecture, or planning roles, excluding those in primary management positions. (12) Pertains to elected officials involved in housing assistance contracts under Section 8 of the US Housing Act, with exceptions for existing contracts before November 1, 1986. (13) A person receiving salary, per diem, or reimbursement from a government entity. (14) A person owning less than 3 percent of shares in a for-profit corporation where ownership is from employment with the corporation. (15) A party to litigation involving the body or board of which the officer is a member, with specific conditions for the agreement to serve the public interest. A person who is an officer or employee of an investor-owned utility regulated by the Public Utilities Commission can be involved in a contract with a state, county, district, judicial district, or city body or board they are a member of, as long as the contract is funded by utility consumers, provides no individual benefit to the person, and the utility receives no direct financial profit. The person can be involved in a contract if they recuse themselves from participation, the contract is authorized by the Public Utilities Commission, or if they are an owner/partner of a firm serving on an unelected board or commission. This section does not apply if an officer influences another member to enter into the contract. The willful failure of an officer to disclose their interest in a contract is punishable, but it does not void the contract unless the other party was aware of the officer's interest at the time of execution."
