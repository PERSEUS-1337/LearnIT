    "content": "The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is seen as a key organization for promoting U.S. goals of liberalizing international trade and investment in Asia. APEC also provides a platform for bilateral discussions on non-economic issues like international security and human rights. Congressional interest in APEC is evident in calls for a comprehensive strategy to address China's emergence economically, diplomatically, and militarily, and to encourage adherence to international norms. The comprehensive strategy for U.S. engagement in East Asia should focus on revitalizing trade, international security, and human rights. APEC is seen as a key forum for pursuing regional initiatives that complement bilateral efforts. The Bush Administration views APEC as a model for regional economic integration. The White House sees APEC as a model for regional economic integration in the Asia Pacific, allowing the US to play a significant role in the region's development. Some ASEAN members are exploring alternative regional economic models. The Bush Administration's interest in APEC may impact the 110th Congress in terms of financial support, trade legislation, and oversight. The 110th Congress may increase oversight of APEC-related activities and programs of the U.S. Trade Representative and other federal departments. APEC's organizational structure may make it difficult for the United States to promote its positions on various issues. APEC is an association of 21 member economies bordering the Pacific Ocean. APEC is an association of 21 member economies working together to promote economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Established in 1989, APEC aims for free and open trade by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies. It operates on consensus-based decision-making and includes Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan as members. APEC operates on consensus-based decision-making with voluntary commitments for trade liberalization policies. There are no formal enforcement mechanisms, and members can join cooperative arrangements at their own pace. The approach is known as \"open regionalism\" and aims for easier implementation of commitments through common goals. APEC operates on consensus-based decision-making with voluntary commitments for trade liberalization policies. The organization believes that seeking consensus views can lead to faster progress towards its goals compared to traditional trade agreements, which often result in confrontation and difficulties in reaching agreements. APEC aims to meet the Bogor Goals through cooperation in liberalizing merchandise, service trade, and international investment. APEC focuses on trade liberalization through consensus-based decision-making and voluntary commitments. Members discuss domestic regulations to facilitate international business and engage in ECOTECH for training and cooperation. The Osaka Action Agenda emphasizes APEC's opposition to inward-looking trading blocs and outlines fundamental principles for trade and investment liberalization. APEC's organization includes a small Secretariat in Singapore. APEC's organization consists of a small Secretariat in Singapore, overseeing various groups like the Committee on Trade and Investment, the Economic Committee, and the Steering Committee on ECOTECH. The annual Leaders' Meeting sets goals and provides momentum for the process, attended by heads of state. The annual APEC Leaders' Meeting, held in October or November each year, is attended by heads of state except for Taiwan and Hong Kong representatives due to China's objections. The first meeting took place in 1993 on Blake Island near Seattle, Washington. Major decisions are made and initiatives are announced at the meeting, which also serves as a platform for bilateral discussions on economic, security, and human rights issues. Decisions are first considered in Ministerial Meetings throughout the year. The APEC organization focuses on human resources development, energy, environment, science and technology, and small and medium-sized enterprises. The annual Joint Ministerial Meeting precedes the Leaders' Meeting and is attended by foreign trade or commerce ministers from member states. The Senior Officials coordinate activities within APEC under the direction of various ministers. The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) provides advice on implementing the APEC agenda and specific business-related issues. The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) provides advice on implementing the APEC agenda and specific business-related issues. APEC has ten working groups focusing on areas such as Trade and Investment Data, Energy Cooperation, and Tourism, with each group led by one or more members. The APEC chair rotates annually among member countries. The APEC chair rotates annually among member countries, with decisions based on consensus approach. Members can delay or refrain from actions without facing sanctions. All decisions must be implemented in accordance with the Osaka Action Agenda. APEC actions are implemented at three levels: individual member actions, actions within APEC, and collective APEC actions with other organizations. Individual Action Plans (IAPs) are submitted annually by members at the Ministerial Meeting to advance trade goals. The Osaka Action Agenda promotes consultation, submission, and review of IAPs for comparability and cooperation. APEC's internal actions involve research on trade liberalization, best practices exchange, and policy standardization. Working groups may create collective action plans (CAPs) to promote trade facilitation. The APEC Business Travel Card allows fast-track entry and visa-free travel among members. APEC's collective actions focus on advancing trade and investment liberalization, particularly in helping complete the Doha Round of the WTO. Key areas of commitment include trade-distorting farm support, market access in agriculture, industrial tariffs, and services trade. Australia chaired APEC in 2007, hosting various meetings with goals for further studies on trade. In 2006, goals were set for APEC 2007, focusing on promoting regional economic integration. The official theme was \"Strengthening Our Community, Building a Sustainable Future.\" The main topics for the meetings in Sydney were climate change, regional economic integration, energy security, and counter-terrorism efforts. The major APEC meetings in 2007 were held in Sydney in September, including the 15th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and the 19th APEC Ministerial Meeting. The U.S. delegation was led by President George W. Bush. The 19th APEC Ministerial Meeting was held with the U.S. delegation led by Secretary Rice. A joint declaration and statement were released focusing on key topics for 2007. Climate change was a major issue at the Economic Leaders' Meeting, with leaders emphasizing its importance and commitment to addressing it. At the 19th APEC Ministerial Meeting, leaders expressed support for a post-2012 international climate change arrangement to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol. APEC members pledged to take specific actions on climate change, including setting a regional goal of reducing energy intensity by 25% by 2030, increasing forest coverage by 20 million hectares by 2020, and establishing networks for energy technology and sustainable forest management. Additionally, APEC leaders issued a statement on ongoing WTO negotiations. The APEC leaders issued a joint statement on ongoing WTO negotiations, emphasizing the need for ambitious and balanced results that improve market access and reduce trade-distorting subsidies. They called for all APEC members to participate in the talks in Geneva and resume negotiations based on draft texts. Unlike the 2006 meetings, regional economic integration was not the main focus in 2007. In 2007, APEC economic leaders endorsed a report on strengthening regional economic integration, reaffirming commitment to the Bogor Goals and supporting a multilateral trading system. They prioritized the successful conclusion of the Doha Round and also backed regional trade agreements and the potential for a Free Trade Area for the Asia-Pacific. The annual meetings serve as a platform for members to update on their individual plans and for APEC to provide guidance on trade liberalization and facilitation. APEC leaders endorsed three specific areas to accelerate trade and investment liberalization: reducing barriers through FTAs and RTAs, improving the regional business environment, and facilitating integration in sectors like transportation and energy. They welcomed completion of IAP Peer Reviews and endorsed revised CAPs for free trade goals. APEC also approved a Trade Facilitation Action Plan in 2007. The APEC Trade Facilitation Action Plan endorsed in 2007 aimed to reduce trade transaction costs by 5% by 2010. The United States joined the APEC Business Travel Card Scheme, allowing expedited visa interviews and fast-track immigration lanes for card holders. Additionally, the US designated East Timor and Liberia as \"beneficiary developing countries\" in its 2007 IAP. The United States designated East Timor and Liberia as \"beneficiary developing countries\" under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to foster trade. It also implemented bilateral free trade agreements and investment treaties to lower trade barriers. Additionally, agreements with Bahrain, Morocco, Uruguay, and the U.S.-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement were put into force. The U.S. announced a contribution of $1.5 million to APEC's Trade and Investment Liberalization and Facilitation Special Account. APEC has expanded its agenda to address issues of \"human security,\" including terrorism, disease, natural disasters, and product safety. Leaders agreed to strengthen food and consumer product safety standards without hindering trade. They also reaffirmed their commitment to dismantle terrorist groups. The Leaders at APEC reaffirmed their commitment to combat terrorism, eliminate weapons of mass destruction, and protect financial systems. They also focused on addressing pandemics, HIV/AIDS, and natural disasters, including concerns about another major disaster post-2004 tsunami. Congress passed the \"Tsunami Warning and Education Act\" in December 2005 to increase funding for the tsunami warning system. The Leaders at APEC addressed economic risks, emphasizing the need for expanded trade and investment. They also focused on making APEC more efficient by establishing the APEC Support Unit and continuing the moratorium on new members until 2010, which was seen as a setback for India. President Bush highlighted the growth of democracy in the Asia Pacific region during his speech at the APEC business summit. He mentioned that countries like East Timor, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan have become democracies over the years. Additionally, there is interest from countries like Colombia, Panama, Burma, Cambodia, Ecuador, Laos, Macau, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to join APEC. President Bush called for efforts to bring democracy to Burma and North Korea, and expressed support for free and fair elections in Thailand. He also encouraged Russia's leaders to respect checks and balances in democracy and urged China to demonstrate greater openness and tolerance during the 2008 Olympics. President Bush proposed the creation of a new Asia Pacific Democracy Partnership to support democratic values and institutions in the region. No details were provided on membership or financing of the partnership. During the APEC meetings in 2007, APEC announced the publication of its \"Code of Conduct for Business\" as part of its anti-corruption campaign. The United States and Russia were chosen to host the 2011 and 2012 meetings respectively. The 2008 meetings are scheduled to be held in Lima, Peru. The annual APEC Leaders' Meeting allows the U.S. President to hold bilateral meetings with key government leaders, including officials from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. During the 2007 APEC Leaders' Meeting, President Bush held bilateral meetings with leaders from Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and ASEAN countries. The meeting with Prime Minister Howard was initially scheduled after the Leaders' Meeting. President Bush's decision to leave early caused the bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Howard to be rescheduled to September 4, 2007, leading to friction between Australia and the United States. The main outcome of the meeting was the signing of the U.S.-Australia Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty, allowing military articles to be exported between the two nations without prior government approval. President Bush intended to submit the treaty to the U.S. Senate for approval. President Bush intended to submit the new treaty with Australia to the U.S. Senate for approval. The leaders discussed climate change, conditions in the Middle East, and situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush also expressed concerns about the military government in Burma. Additionally, he met with Australia's opposition Labour Party leader, Kevin Rudd, on September 6, 2007. President Bush met with China's President Hu Jintao on September 6, 2007, discussing North Korea, Sudan, climate change, and economic relations. President Hu focused on climate change, Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, the Iranian nuclear issue, and Sudan, describing the conversation as \"candid and friendly.\" During a meeting with President Bush, Indonesia's President discussed the country's \"struggle against extremism\" and military cooperation with the United States. President Bush praised Indonesia's efforts on climate change and highlighted their work in forest and coral reef preservation. Prime Minister Abe summarized their discussion on climate change, terrorism, and the Japanese-American military refueling operation in the Indian Ocean. President Bush met with various world leaders in September 2007, discussing topics such as energy security, missile defense, WTO accession, Iran's nuclear program, and environmental issues. He also met with South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun to talk about the six-party talks with North Korea and the situation in Iraq. The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement was not mentioned in the meeting summary, with the focus instead on talks with North Korea and the prospects for the end of the Korean War. President Roh asked President Bush for clearer messaging on a supposed U.S. position. President Roh asked President Bush for clarity on the U.S. position regarding the end of the Korean War. President Bush reiterated the condition for ending the war, linking it to North Korea's weapons programs. Speculation arose about a possible omission in the meeting summary or a translation error. President Roh's actions deviated from the norm, sparking international media and analyst discussions. During a meeting with President Bush, President Roh's break from protocol caused tension, leading to speculation about lingering tensions between the two presidents. President Bush announced the creation of the Ambassador to ASEAN position and plans to host a meeting to celebrate 30 years of U.S.-ASEAN relations. Questions arose about Burma's attendance due to the U.S. ban on economic relations with the country. Deputy National Security Advisor Jim Jeffrey mentioned working out attendance details at a later time. The Bush Administration highlighted key outcomes of the APEC meetings in Sydney, including progress on a FTAAP, endorsement of a report on regional economic integration, agreement on climate control, and a joint statement on WTO negotiations. The White House is concerned about Asian APEC members' hesitance to fully participate in the upcoming meetings in Lima, Peru. Progress was seen in obtaining more interest and support for the concept of an FTAAP. The endorsement of a report on regional economic integration at the APEC meetings in Sydney was seen as a significant step towards exploring the feasibility of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). Despite some skepticism from China, Japan, and ASEAN members, specific research projects outlined in the report could lead to a larger feasibility study for a FTAAP. The report also covers \"agreed actions\" on trade and investment liberalization, further advancing discussions on the FTAAP. The APEC meetings in Sydney endorsed a report on regional economic integration, focusing on promoting high-quality RTAs/FTAs, reducing trade barriers, supporting structural reform, strengthening financial markets, improving key sectors, and capacity building for developing economies. The joint declaration on climate control included the US and China, finding common ground on pollution reduction efforts. The significance of the joint statement on WTO negotiations was also highlighted. The Bush Administration views this year's APEC joint statement on WTO negotiations as softer in tone and less specific than last year's. However, it is seen as valuable with all 21 members endorsing completing the Doha Round negotiations. There has been mixed attitude within APEC regarding members from the eastern rim of the Pacific Ocean, with some Asian members having strong economic ties to the United States. This could make it challenging for them to garner enough domestic support to finance a delegation. Some Asian members struggle to fund a delegation to APEC meetings in Lima, fearing reduced representation may hinder progress. President Bush's early departure was criticized as damaging relations with Australia and hindering U.S. agenda. President Bush's top advisors recommended he not attend APEC meetings due to concerns over misstatements and lack of attention to the Asia Pacific Region. Secretary Rice's decision to depart with him exacerbated regional concerns. The media questioned if his early departure sends the wrong signal to the region. The Bush Administration's lack of attention to the Asia Pacific Region raised concerns about China's increasing influence. Deputy National Security Advisor Dan Price reassured that the U.S. commitment to the region is permanent and growing. President Bush's schedule changes caused tension with Australia's Prime Minister Howard. Minister Howard's requests for President Bush to stay for the APEC meetings were unmet, leading to changes in security arrangements and a high security bill. The joint declaration on climate control at the APEC Leaders' meeting received mixed responses, with some seeing it as a positive step towards a post-Kyoto Protocol agreement, while others criticized its voluntary nature. Some critics questioned the value of the voluntary emission reduction goals in the joint declaration on climate control at the 2007 APEC meetings, suggesting domestic political factors influenced APEC's agreement. The report on regional economic integration was criticized for being too general and lacking clear direction, focusing on FTAs, RTAs, and the potential for a \"Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific\" without exploring potential implications. The report on regional economic integration at the 2007 APEC meetings endorses greater trade and investment liberalization without addressing potential contradictions. President Bush's proposal of an \"Asia-Pacific Democracy Partnership\" received modest attention, with concerns raised about membership and financing. Some APEC members were apprehensive about how participation in the ADP would affect their relations with China. The APEC's primary goal is to promote international trade through liberalization and facilitation. APEC members have reduced trade restrictions since 1993, but the growth of APEC exports slowed in 1995, with notable downturns in 1998 and 2001 due to the Asia financial crisis and the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Since 2001, world export growth has increased, with APEC export growth outpacing it. APEC's import growth has also been faster than world imports since 1981, except for a decline in 1997 and 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis. Import levels recovered in 1999 and 2000 but dropped again after the September 11 attacks. Import levels grew modestly in 2002 for both APEC and the world, accelerating from 2003 onwards. Since 2001, APEC's import growth rate has outpaced that of the world, with uncertainties about whether this is due to trade liberalization or other economic factors. APEC's members, including fast-growing economies like China and Vietnam, contribute to its higher economic growth rate, potentially explaining its better trade performance compared to global figures. However, concerns arise as intra-APEC exports and imports are growing faster than total APEC trade. The faster growth of intra-APEC trade raises concerns about possible trade diversion. APEC's open regionalism approach aims to liberalize regional and global trade through actions like forming coalitions during WTO negotiations. The APEC Geneva Caucus during WTO negotiations exemplifies how APEC promotes trade liberalization. APEC has been a positive force for trade liberalization within the WTO. The growth of Asia-Pacific bilateral trade agreements has led to competitive liberalization, creating a complex web of FTAs. The growth of bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) among APEC members could lead to an APEC-wide regional trade agreement (RTA) like the proposed FTAAP. Some experts see this as a step towards forming a RTA, while others view the proliferation of BTAs as a barrier to trade liberalization due to fragmentation and lack of coordination. The emerging BTAs in Asia face challenges such as WTO-incompatibility, narrow sector focus, and discriminatory rules of origin. These politically motivated agreements result in quick-fix deals, carve out sensitive sectors, and struggle to address domestic regulatory barriers. Power dynamics can lead to asymmetrical deals, hindering the potential merger into an Asia-Pacific RTA. Concerns exist that such an agreement could institutionalize trade barriers in the region. The rising number of BTAs in Asia is hindering the formation of a FTAAP and progress in the Doha Round, despite efforts by APEC. Scholars argue that harmonizing heterogeneous bilateral FTAs into a unified regional agreement is a significant challenge. Some experts believe APEC should advocate for a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) to counteract the rising number of bilateral trade agreements in Asia, which are seen as hindering progress in the Doha Round and the formation of a FTAAP. This could potentially improve prospects for the Doha Round by encouraging non-APEC members to prioritize progress at the WTO. Some experts suggest that APEC should push for a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) to address the proliferation of bilateral trade agreements in Asia. This could enhance the prospects for the Doha Round by urging non-APEC members to focus on WTO progress. APEC could play key roles in organizing meetings, reinforcing trade goals, developing model measures for FTAs, and promoting WTO-plus FTAs. APEC initially focused on economic issues, avoiding political matters to prevent divisions among members. Non-economic issues were discussed in bilateral meetings. In 2001, security was added to the agenda following the 9/11 attacks, shifting focus from purely economic goals. Since 2001, APEC has included non-economic issues in its agenda, with a focus on \"human security\" encompassing terrorism, disease, and disasters. Concerns about terrorism among APEC members include domestic extremists, international terrorist networks using financial institutions in the Asia-Pacific region, restricting the movement of suspected terrorists, and prioritizing trade security. APEC prioritizes trade security and counter-terrorism efforts through the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTTF) in 2002. The CTTF coordinates capacity building, technical assistance programs, and cooperation with international organizations to address counter-terrorism needs. Each APEC member has a Counter-Terrorism Action Plan (CTAP) in place to enhance security measures. APEC member countries have a Counter-Terrorism Action Plan (CTAP) focusing on secure trade. The \"Secure Trade in the APEC Region (STAR) Initiative\" was created in 2002 to enhance security in seaports, airports, and access points. The STAR Conference in 2007 aimed to improve security while managing costs. APEC also established a Health Task Force (HTF) in 2003 to address emerging infectious diseases like SARS. The Health Task Force (HTF) was established in 2003 by APEC to address emerging infectious diseases like SARS, avian influenza, and HIV/AIDS. In 2008, it was transformed into the Health Working Group (HWG) to focus on exchanging medical information, rapid-response programs, and sharing best practices for disease containment. APEC's efforts have included holding meetings to discuss identifying and responding to outbreaks more rapidly. APEC's Health Task Force (HTF) addresses emerging infectious diseases like SARS, avian influenza, and HIV/AIDS. The HTF fosters information exchange and workplace management of HIV/AIDS. APEC also focuses on natural disaster preparedness, highlighted by the devastating 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. In response to the Indian Ocean tsunami, APEC Senior Officials adopted an \"APEC Strategy on Response to and Preparedness for Natural Disasters and Emergencies\" in March 2005. They established APEC's \"Task Force for Emergency Preparedness (TFEP)\" to improve seismic monitoring systems, disaster response infrastructure, and public education systems. APEC members are also providing additional funding for natural disaster warning systems, supported by the \"Tsunami Warning and Education Act\" passed by Congress in December 2006. The Tsunami Warning and Education Act, signed by the President on December 20, 2006, authorizes funding to enhance the Pacific Tsunami Warning System. It allocates $25 million in FY2008, with an annual increase of $1 million until FY2012. APEC is recognized as a key regional institution for promoting open trade and economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Congressional interest in APEC focuses on financial support and oversight of U.S. participation. The U.S. provides financial support for APEC through appropriations for international organizations. The current direct financial support is $601,000 per year. APEC member nations are eligible for a loan guarantee program related to defense articles and services. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 emphasize the importance of fair trade in agricultural products and combating terrorism financing through international fora like APEC. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 included a sense of Congress for a comprehensive strategy to address China's emergence economically, diplomatically, and militarily, promote trade relations, and encourage adherence to international norms. APEC is highlighted as a mechanism for revitalizing US engagement in East Asia. In the 110th Congress, issues related to APEC could arise in various ways, including financial support, policy expressions, and oversight. A proposed bill, the United States-China Diplomatic Expansion Act of 2007 (H.R. 3272), would allocate funds for a new consulate in China, additional personnel for the U.S. diplomatic mission, Chinese language programs, and rule of law initiatives. The proposed bill, United States-China Diplomatic Expansion Act of 2007, allocates funds for a new consulate in China, additional personnel for the U.S. diplomatic mission, Chinese language programs, and rule of law initiatives. It also authorizes $3 million for a U.S. contribution to APEC, with the level of financial support for APEC being a key issue. The U.S.-Australia Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty signed during APEC meetings would require Senate approval, as would the appointment of an \"Ambassador to ASEAN.\" Congress may choose to set funding levels for APEC independently. Negotiations under APEC could raise labor and environmental issues, with potential sanctions for violations. The U.S. aims to complete the Doha Round, complicated by trade deficits with some APEC members. The U.S. may need to address macroeconomic conditions affecting the trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit and specific trade disputes with some APEC members make the prospects for adjustments in the U.S. offer on Doha uncertain. APEC members are called to break through current deadlocks, aiming for an ambitious, balanced result in WTO negotiations that would require congressional action on legislation affecting farm income and price support programs. Efforts to complete the Doha Round may affect trade agreements like P.L. 107-171, raising debates on trade liberalization's impact on U.S. industries and economic security. Congress may also address human security issues related to U.S. involvement in APEC, such as concerns over the APEC Business Travel Card and potential health threats like influenza pandemics. APEC serves as a key forum for geopolitical discussions. APEC is a crucial forum for geopolitical discussions, and the United States sees it as a way to engage with the Asia-Pacific region. Many experts believe APEC could help advance U.S. interests in Asia, especially as China's influence in the region grows. The United States should re-energize its involvement in Asian trade discussions to compete with China. The United States should re-energize its involvement in Asian trade discussions and elevate the importance of APEC to assert U.S. leadership. Some suggest increased financial assistance and reforms focusing on trade facilitation and economic integration within APEC. The annual Leaders' Meeting provides prestige and opportunities for interaction with top U.S. officials, including smaller countries' heads of state. APEC includes Taiwan and Hong Kong as member economies, unlike the EAS. The official APEC web page, http://www.apec.org/, provides details about past APEC Meetings."
