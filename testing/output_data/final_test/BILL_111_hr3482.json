    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Development Act\" may be cited as the Act. It focuses on developing renewable energy on federal lands. The Secretary of the Interior will implement a program for leasing Federal lands for commercial renewable energy systems like solar, wind, and geothermal. The Bureau of Land Management will identify 6,400,000 acres of suitable lands in various states for leasing. The Secretary of the Interior will lease Federal lands for renewable energy systems like solar, wind, and geothermal. Lease sites must be suitable and feasible, with minimum acreage requirements. The Secretary will release lease sites in increments, with a target of 79,012 acres by 2010. The Secretary of the Interior will lease Federal lands for renewable energy systems, excluding certain types of Federal lands. The leasing program aims to reach milestones of increasing acreage each year, starting from 79,012 acres in 2010 to 6,400,000 acres in 2019. The Secretary of the Interior will lease Federal lands for renewable energy systems, excluding certain types of Federal lands such as National Scenic and Historic Trails, Monuments, Resource Natural Areas, and lands requested by the Governor of a State to be removed from consideration for renewable energy development. Competitive lease sale requirements include accepting nominations for leasing at any time and leasing to the highest responsible qualified bidder. The Secretary will hold competitive lease sales annually for Federal lands, with noncompetitive leasing available for tracts without bids. Priority is given to timely processing of lease applications for Federal lands for renewable energy installation. Leases for renewable energy systems on Federal lands are effective for 30 years, with an option to renew for another 30 years. The Secretary of the Interior must complete a programmatic environmental impact statement for the renewable energy leasing program within 18 months of this Act's enactment. A final regulation implementing this section must be published within 6 months of the statement's completion. Additionally, amendments are made to the deposit and use of geothermal lease revenues. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study within 2 years of the Act's enactment to identify barriers to energy transmission on Federal lands and the need for energy transmission corridors to address congestion."
