    "content": "The Act titled \"Firefighter Fatality Reduction Act of 2008\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that each year in the United States, over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty, with tens of thousands more injured. The Federal Government has a vested interest in protecting firefighter health and safety to effectively respond to disasters. Adequate training, protective equipment, staffing levels, operating procedures, and firefighter fitness can reduce avoidable fatalities. The fire services, along with government agencies and private-sector partners, have collaborated to develop national consensus standards. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health works with standards-making bodies to develop national consensus standards for safe fire department operations. These standards are crucial for ensuring firefighter health and safety, as failure to follow them has been linked to many firefighter deaths. A comprehensive assessment of fire department compliance with these standards would help enhance public safety and reduce avoidable firefighter fatalities. The Department of Homeland Security conducts a survey to assess fire department compliance with national consensus standards for safe operations. The Secretary of Homeland Security will survey all fire departments in the United States to determine compliance with national consensus standards for staffing, training, safe operations, personal protective equipment, and fitness. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within two years of the enactment of the Act. Establishment of task force to enhance firefighter safety. Establishment of a task force named \"Task Force to Enhance Firefighter Safety\" by the Secretary of Homeland Security within 120 days of submitting a required report to Congress. The Task Force members, appointed from the general public, will include representatives from national firefighter organizations, standards-setting bodies, and other individuals as determined by the Secretary. The Task Force, appointed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, includes representatives from national firefighter organizations and other individuals as deemed appropriate. The Secretary may also invite representatives from other US departments and agencies with an interest in the fire service. The Task Force will develop a plan to enhance firefighter safety by increasing compliance with national consensus standards for staffing, training, and safety. The Task Force, appointed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, will develop a plan to enhance firefighter safety by increasing compliance with national consensus standards for staffing, training, safe operations, personal protective equipment, and fitness. The Task Force will also consider ways to promote compliance with these standards by fire departments at the federal, state, and local levels. Additionally, the Task Force is required to submit a report to Congress and the Secretary within one year of its establishment, containing findings, recommendations, and the plan described. The term \"national consensus standards\" in this Act refers to the latest edition of standards for staffing, training, safe operations, personal protective equipment, and fitness available at the time of enactment."
