    "content": "The U.S.-Canadian border is approximately 3,987 miles long, excluding Alaska, while the U.S.-Mexican border is about 1,933 miles long. Alaska shares a 1,538-mile border with Canada. The tables list the states sharing borders with Canada and Mexico. NOAA has surveyed the U.S. coastline multiple times, with figures dating back to 1915. The coastline measurements for the 50 states are based on large scale nautical charts, resulting in a total of 12,383 miles. Another measurement using smaller scale nautical charts more than doubles this to 29,093 miles. The figures used by NOAA for the Coastal Zone Management program differ due to the effects of tides and arbitrary decisions about measuring bays, coves, islands, and inlets. The NOAA administers the Coastal Zone Management program with a coastline measurement of 88,612 miles (excluding the Great Lakes). Variations in shoreline figures are due to natural occurrences and different measurement methods. The measurements were taken in 1970 by the International Coordinating Committee on the Great Lakes Basic Hydraulic and Hydrologic Data. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports and other publications related to border security and patrols. It includes reports on legal issues, military support, inspections practices, and U.S. perimeter protection. The list also includes a publication on shore and sea boundaries by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce. The curr_chunk provides historical information on treaties between the United States and Mexico regarding the international boundary, including the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty of 1848 and the Treaty of 1853. It also includes information on maintaining the Rio Grande and Colorado Rivers, as well as current reports and solutions for boundary and water problems by the International Boundary and Water Commission. The curr_chunk provides details on the Treaty of 1908 between the United States and Canada, which completed the mapping of the international boundary from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. It also includes information on U.S.-Canadian border history and boundary markings along open vistas."
