    "content": "The right to make motions to recommit in the House of Representatives is a prerogative of the minority party. The motion must be offered after the previous question is ordered on a measure, but before the final passage vote. There are two forms of recommittal motion: a simple motion and a motion with instructions, both having equal privilege on the House floor. This report discusses recommittal motions in the House of Representatives, including the two forms of motion, rules, minority's prerogative, and procedures for disposing of motions. Emphasis is on motions to recommit bills and conference reports. Data on motions made from the 101st to the 109th Congress are presented. Motions can be offered during initial House floor consideration of bills and resolutions, but not under the \"suspension of the rules\" procedure. Table 1 displays data on motions to recommit bills and conference reports from the 101st to the 109th Congress. Restrictions exist for moving to recommit simple resolutions, concurrent resolutions, and joint resolutions. Joint resolutions in the House can be used to disapprove or approve specific executive actions under special expedited procedures. A simple motion to recommit a bill gives the minority a final chance to reject the measure by sending it back to the committee that reported it. This motion indirectly allows the House to \"kill\" a bill without a direct vote on its final passage. A motion to recommit with instructions provides the minority a last chance to amend a bill by sending it back to committee with specific directions for changes. This allows for the bill to be modified to align more closely with the minority party's policy views. The instructions typically include an amendment to be added to the bill, with the committee required to report back to the House promptly. A recommittal motion with amendatory instructions allows for immediate action by the committee, bypassing the need to send the bill back for further review. The chairman reports the bill back to the House with the specified amendment, which then becomes the pending question for the House to decide on. If the amendment is adopted, the House proceeds to vote on passing the bill with the amendment. Table 2 presents data on motions to recommit bills from the 101st to the 109th Congress. The majority of motions contained instructions, which must be germane to the underlying measure. Instructions proposing amendments not in order are ruled out of order. For example, in the 103rd Congress, a motion to recommit H.R. 3221 was ruled out of order for proposing an amendment unrelated to the bill. Amendatory instructions in a recommittal motion cannot propose to strike out an amendment already adopted by the House or amend a portion of the bill already amended in its entirety. However, the motion can propose an amendment that was earlier rejected by the Committee of the Whole or the House. When a special rule anticipates consideration of an amendment in the nature of a substitute, it usually includes a motion to recommit \"with or without instructions.\" Amendatory instructions in the recommittal motion must align with the resolution's provisions, such as prohibitions on specific amendments. Instructions must also comply with rule-making provisions of law, like those in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. In the context of motions to recommit bills, instructions must align with the resolution's provisions and comply with applicable House rules. Non-amendatory instructions may direct committees to take specific actions within the scope of the instructions. For example, in the 104th Congress, a bill was recommitted with amendatory instructions to report the bill. The House adopted a recommittal motion with amendatory instructions to add a new section to H.R. 1555 requiring TV sets in the US to have a \"v-chip\" technology. Representative Markey's motion was amended by Representative Coburn's substitute, which did not include the \"v-chip\" requirement. The Markey amendment, as amended by the Coburn substitute, was adopted without a direct vote in the Committee of the Whole. Representative Markey secured a vote on the \"v-chip\" mandate by motioning to recommit H.R. 1555 to the Committee on Commerce. The bill was reported back with the original Markey amendment text and was approved by the House. H.R. 1555 was then passed with both the Coburn substitute and the original Markey text. The minority party used a motion to recommit with instructions to secure a House vote on its policy alternative. A rules change in the 104th Congress guarantees the minority's right to offer such a motion. The parliamentary language and procedural steps during the House's consideration of Representative Markey's motion to recommit with instructions are detailed in the Congressional Record of August 4, 1995. Markey's motion to recommit with instructions was opposed to the bill. After a debate, the previous question on the recommittal motion was ordered. After a debate, the House adopted the motion to recommit H.R. 1555 with an amendment, 224 to 199. Representative Bliley reported the bill back with the approved amendment, which was considered as read and printed in the Congressional Record. The amendment was agreed to. The House adopted the motion to recommit H.R. 1555 with an amendment, followed by a record vote on the bill's final passage, which passed 305-117. Motions to recommit conference reports can be simple or contain instructions, with the purpose of further negotiation. House conferees are given advisory instructions on what to achieve during negotiations, typically to uphold the House position on certain issues or to disagree with the Senate. These instructions are not binding and must stay within the scope of differences between the House and Senate positions in the conference. For example, in the 102nd Congress, a motion to recommit a conference report on campaign finance reform legislation was ruled out of order for exceeding the scope of differences. A recommittal motion with instructions within the scope of differences was proposed but defeated. Instructions in motions to recommit conference reports do not direct conferees to report back \"forthwith\" as with bills. House conferees carry original papers back to conference when a motion to recommit a conference report is adopted. The House can only vote to accept or reject a conference report once the Senate has acted on it. A motion to recommit a conference report can only be offered after the previous question has been ordered. The majority of motions to recommit conference reports contain instructions. During a 17-year period, the House adopted only one simple motion to recommit a conference report. The majority of motions to recommit conference reports contained instructions, including the first two conference reports on H.R. 1977 in the 104th Congress. The House instructed its conferees to insist on the House's \"pro-freeze\" position regarding a Senate amendment that ended a one-year freeze on the transfer of federal lands to mining companies. The House managers did not uphold the House's \"pro-freeze\" position in the conference report on H.R. 1977. Representative Sidney Yates moved to recommit the report with instructions, which was adopted with majority support. A second conference report was approved, including the House's \"pro-freeze\" position with a condition related to mining legislation. The House adopted a motion to recommit the new conference report on H.R. 1977 with instructions to insist on the House position on Senate amendments 158 and 108. The third conference report extended the one-year freeze without conditions and reached a compromise on the Tongass National Forest issue. Representative Ralph Regula explained the details of the third conference report. The House rejected a motion to recommit the conference report on H.R. 1977 regarding the Tongass National Forest, with a vote of 187-241, and then adopted the report with a vote of 244-181. This illustrates how motions to recommit with instructions can impact conference committee negotiations. The House had previously recommitted two conference reports for the same reason - the conference's rejection of the House position on Senate amendment 178. The House rejected a motion to recommit the conference report on H.R. 1977 regarding the Tongass National Forest, with a vote of 187-241, and then adopted the report with a vote of 244-181. Motions to recommit are governed by Rule XIX, clause 2, and Rule XIII, clause 6(c)(2), influencing the work of the conference committee as a whole. Rule XIII, clause 6(c)(2) states that the Committee on Rules cannot report a rule preventing the motion to recommit a bill, typically offered by a member of the minority party. This rule was amended in 1995 and further changes were made at the start of the 104th Congress. Before 1909, the motion to recommit was not limited to the minority party. Before 1909, the motion to recommit was typically given to a Representative friendly to a measure for the purpose of perfecting it. In 1909, Rule XIX was amended to give preferential recognition to a Member opposed to the measure. House precedents established that minority party Members should be given this recognition. From 1934 to the start of the 104th Congress, the minority was only guaranteed the right to offer a simple motion to recommit. Before 1971, a recommittal motion with amendatory instructions was the only way for the minority to secure a recorded House vote on their policy alternative. However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Rules Committee started issuing special rules that limited floor amendments in the Committee of the Whole, restricting the minority's ability to propose amendments. This led to situations where the Republican minority could only propose amendments through a motion to recommit with amendatory instructions. During the 104th Congress, the House amended its rules to prevent the Rules Committee from issuing special rules that restricted the minority from offering a motion to recommit with instructions to a bill or joint resolution. This change was a response to challenges by the Republican minority in earlier Congresses. The House's rules now explicitly recognize the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit bills and joint resolutions. The Speaker first looks to the Minority Leader or designee, then to minority members of the committee reporting the bill, and finally to other minority and majority members. The Speaker gives preferential recognition to a Member opposed to the bill when seeking to offer a recommittal motion. Debate is not allowed on a simple motion to recommit, except by unanimous consent. For motions with instructions, ten minutes of debate is allowed for bills or joint resolutions. Under clause 2(c) of the rule, debate time for a recommittal motion can be extended to one hour upon demand of the majority floor manager. The chair rules on the motion's order in response to a point of order. A Member may make such a point of order immediately after the motion is read. In situations where debate on the recommittal motion is permitted, the chair decides whether to sustain or overrule a point of order before proceeding with the motion. If the point of order is sustained, a new motion to recommit can be offered in a timely manner. Points of order raised under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 are handled differently, with the House voting on whether to consider the matter after twenty minutes of debate. The House voted not to consider a motion to recommit with instructions due to an unfunded governmental mandate claim. Members rarely offer amendments to recommittal motions, with only three opportunities for offering an amendment before the House votes on the motion. An amendment can be offered for debatable recommittal motions once debate is completed, controlled by the mover of the motion. For both debatable and non-debatable motions to recommit, an amendment can be offered if the Member who offered the motion does not move the previous question. When a motion is made and a Member seeks to offer an amendment, the motion's sponsor can still move the previous question to prevent House consideration of the amendment. If the previous question on the recommittal motion is defeated, an amendment can be offered. The previous question on the recommittal motion is usually ordered without objection, but a Member can demand a formal vote on it. If the House rejects the motion, the opposition leader can offer an amendment regardless of party affiliation. The Member proposing an amendment does not need to be opposed to the bill. Debate is not allowed on an amendment to a recommittal motion, even if the underlying motion was debatable. Supporters of the amendment can explain and advocate for its adoption before offering it. The amendment must be relevant to the underlying measure, not necessarily to the instructions in the recommittal motion. A point of order against the amendment is timely if raised immediately after it is read. A point of order against an amendment is timely if raised immediately after it is read. If sustained, another amendment can be offered unless the House orders the previous question. A motion to recommit a bill can be amended to change committees or add instructions. Instructions in a recommittal motion can be amended or deleted, and new instructions can be substituted. Substituting new instructions may interfere with the minority's right to move recommitment. The House must approve an amendment to a recommittal motion by a simple majority vote. Only one valid motion to recommit is allowed. Data on motions to recommit from the 101st to the 109th Congress are provided in Table 4. In the 101st to 109th Congress, data on motions to recommit show an increase in offered motions but no change in adoption rate. The Appendix details the 39 motions adopted by the House, including bill number, title, date adopted, vote results, instructions, and unique aspects of disposition."
