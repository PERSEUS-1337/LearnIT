    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a grants and civil rights statute providing federal funding for the education of children with disabilities. It requires the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and includes detailed due process provisions. In 2004, President Bush signed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which made significant changes to IDEA, particularly regarding the discipline of children with disabilities. Children with disabilities are not immune from disciplinary procedures under IDEA, but the procedures differ from those for children without disabilities. Children with disabilities are subject to disciplinary procedures under IDEA, with options including removal to another setting, suspension for up to 10 school days, placement in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 school days for serious offenses, and potential placement in an interim alternative educational setting if maintaining the current placement poses a risk of injury. When a child with a disability violates a code of conduct, a manifestation determination review must be conducted to see if the behavior is related to the disability or the failure to implement the IEP. If not related, long-term disciplinary action like expulsion may occur, but educational services must continue. P.L. 108-446 added provisions for schools to have more flexibility in handling misbehavior by children with disabilities, including placing them in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days. The IDEA law allows for placing a child with a disability in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days, even if the child has caused serious bodily injury. Changes have been made regarding the manifestation determination process and the placement of children with disabilities when there is disagreement. The discipline of children with disabilities may seem complex, but understanding IDEA's history helps clarify the logic behind it. The enactment of P.L. 94-142 was motivated by the lack of education for children with disabilities, leading to judicial decisions like PARC v. State of Pennsylvania and Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia. Congress provided grants to states to assist in funding education for children with disabilities and set specific requirements for receiving federal funds. These requirements did not include a discipline provision but focused on ensuring services for children with disabilities. The IDEA statute includes a \"stay put\" provision to prevent discrimination against children with disabilities by allowing them to remain in their current educational placement during disputes. The Honig v. Doe case raised questions about exceptions to this rule for children exhibiting violent behavior. The Supreme Court ruled in the Honig v. Doe case that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, even those with behavioral issues. However, schools can temporarily suspend students who pose an immediate threat to others for up to 10 days. If parents refuse to change the placement of a dangerous child, schools can seek court intervention after the 10-day period. The 10-day respite allows school officials to seek judicial relief under section 1415(e)(2), known as a Honig injunction. Congress amended IDEA to give schools authority to remove a child with a disability for bringing weapons or drugs to school, expanded in 1997 and 2004 reauthorizations. The Department of Education received inquiries from schools regarding this provision. The Department of Education (ED) issued a memorandum in 1995 addressing discipline issues in schools, including the use of manifestation determinations. Schools must conduct a manifestation determination before suspending or expelling a child with a disability for more than 10 days. If the behavior is not related to the disability, the school can proceed with the suspension or expulsion but must continue to provide educational services. If the behavior is related to the disability, the school must notify the parent of any recommended change in placement, and the parent can invoke the stay put provision. Honig injunctions are appropriate when a school believes changing the placement of a child with a disability is necessary. Under P.L. 108-446, a child with a disability can face disciplinary procedures, but with amendments to the manifestation determination and stay put on appeals provisions. Educational services must continue for children with disabilities even if they are suspended or expelled. The House passed bill, H.R. 1350, aimed to treat all children equally in discipline, with exceptions for children with disabilities. Under P.L. 108-446, disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities were amended to include options such as removal to another setting, suspension for up to 10 school days, or placement in an interim alternative education setting for serious offenses. The Senate bill, S. 1248, aimed to simplify and make discipline fairer for all students. Under P.L. 108-446, disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities were amended to include options such as removal to another setting, suspension for up to 10 school days, or placement in an interim alternative education setting for serious offenses. School officials may seek a Honig injunction if they are unable to reach agreement with a student's parents and feel that the new statutory provisions are not sufficient. If a child's behavior is not a manifestation of a disability, long-term disciplinary action may be taken. The 2004 reauthorization of disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities allows school personnel to consider unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when deciding on a change in placement for a child who violates the code of conduct. These unique circumstances are best determined at the local level by school personnel familiar with the child's behavior and history. The regulations allow school personnel to consider unique circumstances when deciding on a change in placement for a child with a disability who violates the code of conduct. This includes factors such as disciplinary history, understanding consequences, remorse, and support provided prior to the violation. School personnel can remove the child to an interim alternative educational setting, another setting, or suspension for up to 10 school days, as long as it does not constitute a change in placement. The 10-day rule was added to IDEA in 1997 and codified existing practice. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA changed the 10-day suspension rule to 10 school days, adding additional time to disciplinary procedures. School personnel, in consultation with teachers, determine necessary services for a child removed for more than 10 school days. The regulations state that a child removed for more than 10 school days must still receive educational services to ensure they can participate in the general curriculum and work towards their IEP goals. The school is not required to provide the exact same services as before the suspension, but the services provided must enable the child to continue participating in the general curriculum. P.L. 108-446 allows school personnel to temporarily move a student to an alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days in cases involving weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury. An LEA can request a change in placement if maintaining the current placement is likely to result in harm. The Senate report highlighted the need for this provision to address safety concerns in schools. The Senate report emphasized the necessity of allowing schools to temporarily move a student to a different setting for safety reasons. It was suggested that the burden of proof should lie with the public agency when arguing for a child's removal due to potential harm. The IDEA statute does not address this issue, but it was noted that the burden of proof in IDEA proceedings was discussed in a recent Supreme Court decision. The recent Supreme Court decision clarified that the burden of persuasion in a hearing challenging the validity of an IEP is on the party seeking relief. If a public agency requests a child be moved to an interim alternative educational setting, the burden of persuasion is on the agency. The regulations allow a school district to seek a subsequent hearing to continue the child in the interim placement if returning the child to the original placement may result in harm. When a child with a disability faces a change in placement due to behavioral issues, they must still receive educational services to support their participation in the general curriculum and progress towards IEP goals. This includes a functional behavioral assessment, intervention services, and modifications to prevent future behavioral violations. Public agencies are required to provide services during short-term removals if similar services are provided to non-disabled students. The concept of a manifestation determination is crucial in these situations. The concept of a manifestation determination originated in policy interpretations of IDEA by the Department of Education. It requires a review of relevant information to determine if a child's behavior is related to their disability when changing their placement due to a violation of student conduct. The manifestation determination requires a review of relevant information to determine if a child's behavior is related to their disability when changing their placement due to a violation of student conduct. The conduct is considered a manifestation of the child's disability if determined by the parent, LEA, and relevant members of the IEP team. A functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention plan must be implemented for the child in such cases. The IEP team conducts an assessment before addressing behavior issues, reviewing and modifying behavior intervention plans as needed. The child should be returned to their original placement unless a change is agreed upon or an interim alternative setting is used temporarily. The manifestation determination process is emphasized for careful consideration of behavior across different settings. The manifestation determination process analyzes behavior to determine if it is a result of the child's disability, ensuring fair discipline for disabled children. P.L. 108-446 states that if a child's behavior is not related to their disability, disciplinary procedures for children without disabilities may be applied, with the provision of a free appropriate public education. Parents or LEAs can request a hearing if they disagree with placement decisions or believe the current placement may harm the child or others. The new law outlines the authority of a hearing officer to make determinations regarding placement changes for children with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 modified the \"stay put\" provision in appeals. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 modified the \"stay put\" provision in appeals, ensuring that children with disabilities remain in their current educational placement during \u00a7615 proceedings, with an exception for those in interim alternative educational settings. The current law requires an expedited hearing within 20 school days of the request, with a decision made within 10 school days after the hearing. The Senate report emphasized that a hearing officer's reversal of a manifestation determination should not allow a child to be removed early from an interim alternative educational setting for serious violations. Congress grappled with children subject to disciplinary actions who later claimed they were disabled and entitled to IDEA protections. Judicial decisions raised concerns about potential abuse of IDEA protections. If a parent contests claims of a child carrying a weapon, bringing drugs, or causing serious bodily harm, the child may return to their original placement if a hearing officer overturns the school district's decision. Similarly, if a parent disputes the provision of a free appropriate public education in the interim alternative setting, the child's placement could change before the 45-day period expires. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA maintains protections for children not yet identified as eligible for special education, with changes regarding when a LEA is deemed to have knowledge of a child's disability. Parents expressing concerns in writing or requesting evaluations trigger this knowledge. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA removed the provision that allowed a LEA to be deemed to have knowledge of a child's disability based on behavior or performance. A new exception states that a LEA will not be deemed to have knowledge if the parent has not allowed an evaluation, refused services, or if the child was evaluated and determined not to have a disability. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA removed the provision allowing a LEA to be deemed to have knowledge of a child's disability based on behavior or performance. If the LEA has no basis of knowledge of a student being a child with a disability, the child may be subject to disciplinary measures applicable to children without disabilities. If an evaluation is requested during disciplinary measures, it must be expedited. Special education and related services will be provided if the child is found to have a disability. The 2004 reauthorization maintains requirements regarding referral to law enforcement authorities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 maintains requirements for reporting crimes committed by children with disabilities to law enforcement authorities. It also addresses the transfer of disciplinary information to ensure schools are informed about a child's past behavior. States have the discretion to require local educational agencies to include disciplinary actions in a child's records. Children with disabilities may have disciplinary information included in their records, which can be transmitted to schools for safety reasons. This information should be treated the same as records of children without disabilities."
