The Manufacturing Extension Partnership provides critical services to small and midsized manufacturers, helping them grow, improve productivity, and compete in domestic and international markets. It has created or retained over 57,000 manufacturing jobs, contributing to job growth in the sector. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership has delivered significant cost savings and increased sales. Federal funding is matched by State and local governments. State budget strains led to funding cuts in some centers, shifting costs to small manufacturers and jeopardizing services. The availability of Manufacturing Extension Partnership services is at risk. Reducing the matching requirement for participants will ease the burden on State budgets and small manufacturers, ensuring critical services and job creation in the manufacturing sector. The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program is outlined in Section 2. Section 25(c) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to adjust cost share requirements for applicants. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to adjust cost share requirements for applicants. The Secretary will establish criteria for determining a Center's cost share, not to exceed 50% of costs incurred. The Secretary will review each Center's cost share annually and make adjustments as needed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to adjust cost share requirements for applicants. The changes include replacing \"50 percent\" with \"cost share\" and \"Center's contribution\" with \"Center's cost share.\" Additionally, adjustments are made to funding levels, with the requirement that funding be at least 50 percent unless determined otherwise."
