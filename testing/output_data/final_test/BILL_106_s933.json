    "content": "The tax treatment of Alaska Native settlement trusts is addressed in Section 1. Tax Exemption for Alaska Native Settlement Trusts under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with special rules for taxation outlined in Section 501. Tax rules for Settlement Trusts: If an election is in effect, no income inclusion for beneficiaries due to contributions in that year. Subchapter J and section 1(e) provisions do not apply. If no election, different rules apply. If a Settlement Trust elects to have certain provisions apply, the tax rules will be different for the trust and its beneficiaries. The election must be made before the due date for filing the trust's tax return for the first taxable year after the enactment of the subsection. An election under subparagraph (A) must be made before the due date for filing the trust's tax return for the first taxable year after the enactment of this subsection. Once made, the election applies to the 1st taxable year described and all subsequent years, and cannot be revoked. Special rules apply if transfer restrictions are modified, allowing disposal of beneficial interests in a Settlement Trust. The trust cannot be disposed of in a way that violates the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. If such a disposition is allowed, any previous election made regarding the trust is revoked, and a tax is imposed on the trust. The tax imposed on a trust is based on the fair market value of its assets at the end of the taxable year and the highest tax rate for that year. This tax is in place of any other taxes for that year. Stock in a corporation held by a Settlement Trust can be disposed of under certain conditions. The tax imposed on a trust is based on the fair market value of its assets at the end of the taxable year and the highest tax rate for that year. Stock in a corporation held by a Settlement Trust can be disposed of in a manner not permitted by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. If assets are transferred to the trust after such disposition is allowed, the trust will be subject to the same rules as if it permitted dispositions not allowed by the Act. Any tax imposed in this scenario is treated as an excise tax for tax purposes. If a Settlement Trust fails to distribute at least 55 percent of its adjusted taxable income for a taxable year, a tax will be imposed on the trust under section 1(e) on the amount of the failure. This tax is treated as an excise tax for tax purposes. For tax purposes, a Settlement Trust can designate distributions made within 65 days after the close of a taxable year as made on the last day of that year. Adjusted taxable income is calculated without certain deductions. If an election is in effect, tax treatment of distributions to beneficiaries varies. For tax purposes, a Settlement Trust can designate distributions made within 65 days after the close of a taxable year as made on the last day of that year. Distributions to beneficiaries are included in their gross income as ordinary income based on whether an election is in effect or not. Definitions for terms like 'Native Corporation' and 'Settlement Trust' are provided in the subsection.

The text discusses tax withholding on distributions by electing ANCSA Settlement Trusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax imposed on payments is exempt if it does not exceed a certain amount annually. The term 'annualized tax' is defined as the tax on the excess of the annualized payment over a specified amount. Amounts are annualized as prescribed in the subsection. The subsection exempts third party payments for educational, funeral, or medical benefits from tax withholding. Electing trusts can choose alternate withholding procedures specified by the Secretary. Coordination with other sections of the Internal Revenue Code is required. Payments subject to withholding under this chapter are treated as wages paid by an employer to an employee. Reporting requirements for distributions from Alaska Native Settlement Trusts are specified, including information on the character of the distribution and any tax deductions. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years of Settlement Trusts ending after the date of enactment and to contributions to such trusts after that date."
