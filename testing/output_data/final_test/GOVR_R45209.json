It allows Members, officials, and the public to track Congress actions. The Journal is printed, distributed, and posted online after each session. Approval is announced by the Speaker at the start of each legislative day, with automatic agreement unless a Member calls for a vote. The House Journal is the official record of House proceedings, listing legislative actions and serving as evidence in legal proceedings. It is approved by the Speaker at the start of each legislative day. The daily Journal of Congress is approved by the Speaker at the start of each legislative day and contains proceedings between the commencement and adjournment of the day. GPO prints a bound book and digital copy of the session Journal. The Constitution mandates both houses to maintain and publish journals of their proceedings, including presidential veto messages and recorded \"yeas and nays\" votes by Members. The House controls its Journal of proceedings, deciding what to include beyond constitutional requirements. Since the first Congress, it has determined which proceedings to record, such as bill introductions, committee reports, and documents. The House controls its Journal of proceedings, deciding what to include beyond constitutional requirements. It determines which proceedings to record, such as bill introductions, committee reports, and documents, including referral, committee and conference reports, documents, petitions, memorials, points of order, disposition of measures, messages, daily commencement and adjournment times, and record votes conducted electronically. Proceedings are defined in the House Manual, House Practice, and collections of House precedents, outlining routine and less common proceedings like discharge petitions, debate limitations, unanimous consent agreements, and expungements from the Congressional Record. House Rule XX outlines requirements for recording votes and quorum calls in the Journal. Statutes also specify certain proceedings to be entered into the Journal, such as newly sworn Members' oaths of office and the confirmation of presidential electoral votes. The Journal records election results and electoral votes by state, but does not include reasons, statements, deliberations, or unsuccessful motions. It also does not record parliamentary inquiries or non-legislative matters. The House controls the Journal's contents and decides what actions are included. The House Journal is the official record of actions taken by the House, following the practice of the British Parliament. It is approved by the Speaker and becomes official when the House agrees. The duty to keep a journal is mandated by the Constitution, with the British House of Commons having a similar practice since the 1500s. The Articles of Confederation also directed the publication of a monthly journal of proceedings. The U.S. Constitution mandates the duty to keep and publish House and Senate records of proceedings, with delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 divided over the mandate to have them published. Delegate James Wilson argued for transparency, stating that the people have a right to know what their agents are doing. Legal commentators have since interpreted the Constitution's clauses on this matter. Legal commentators have interpreted the Constitution's clauses on the duty to keep a journal, emphasizing transparency, accountability to constituents, and an educated public. The main purpose of the legislative Journals is to ensure that the proceedings are a matter of public record. The House Journal is the official record of House proceedings and can be accessed online by the public. It is used as evidence in legal proceedings, and the Speaker's approval of the Journal is the first order of business during each session. The House Journal is the official record of House proceedings. The Speaker's approval of the Journal is the first order of business during each session, where a vote can be demanded by a Member. The Journal clerk records handwritten notes daily, which are then typed, proofed, and presented to the House Parliamentarian for review. If there is no objection, the House proceeds to the Pledge of Allegiance and legislative business. If a Member objects, they can rise and voice their objection. If a Member objects to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, they can demand a vote by rising and stating their objection. The Speaker will conduct a voice vote, and if necessary, a record vote can be requested with the support of one-fifth of the Members present. A Member can also object by noting the absence of a quorum, which would automatically trigger a record vote. If a quorum is not present, the Speaker can hold a record vote to ascertain a quorum or postpone further proceedings. Later, the Speaker can put the question on approving the Journal with a voice vote. A Member can object by noting the absence of a quorum, demanding the yeas and nays, or a recorded vote. In current practice, the Journal is not read unless the House votes against the Speaker's approval. If the House votes against approval, a Member can make a privileged motion to have the Journal read, which can be decided by the House without debate. The Clerk then reads the previous day's Journal, omitting certain details unless a full reading is demanded. In current practice, the Journal is not read unless the House votes against the Speaker's approval. If the House rejects the motion to approve the Journal \"as read,\" it can be amended by unanimous consent or motion. Amendment by motion can correct the previous day's Journal within the same Congress. The motion to amend occurs after the House rejects the Speaker's approval or the Clerk reads the Journal. It is not in order after the House approves the Journal or if the previous question has been demanded. A Member may move to amend the Journal by inserting, striking, or striking and inserting specific content. The House can amend its Journal to reflect omitted or incorrect procedures by motion or unanimous consent, as stated in Cannon's Precedents. In 1912, the Speaker suggested amending the Journal to show that a necessary procedural motion had been observed, emphasizing the House's control over its proceedings. Between 1990 and 2016, Journal approval votes rarely failed, with only one voice vote in 1990 when the House rejected the Speaker's approval. Representative Robert Walker demanded a vote on the approval, which led to the Journal of the last day's proceedings being read by unanimous consent. During the Journal reading, Walker requested unanimous consent for open amendment. He moved to strike an executive communication on government transparency, citing House reluctance to work openly. Representative Kyl acknowledged Walker's symbolic gesture, highlighting the importance of discussing substantive issues. During the House session, Walker requested open amendment and highlighted the importance of discussing substantive issues. The amendment was approved by voice vote, and the Journal was approved as amended. The approval rate for Journal votes is 75%, with party and political considerations possibly influencing the decision to demand or vote against approval. When a Member demands a vote to agree to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, it may be seen as an attempt to amend the Journal's contents. Motions to amend are in order only after the House votes against the Speaker's approval. The most common way to amend the Journal is by unanimous consent, unrelated to a Journal-approval vote. Journal-approval votes may be used to protest actions or delay legislative business, providing opportunities for Members to criticize practices related or unrelated to the Journal's contents. Since 1983, the Speaker can delay Journal record votes to allow for other business before approval. Representative Harry Reid acknowledged using Journal votes as a protest tool. In 1993, a Journal vote served as both protest and delay tactic. In 1993, a Journal vote was used as a protest and dilatory action by Representative Gerald Solomon, who objected to leadership's restrictions on debate and amendments. This action was taken under House Rule XX, allowing Members to challenge the results of a voice vote by noting the absence of a quorum, triggering a subsequent record vote to verify the quorum's presence. Representative Robert Walker argued that changes to quorum procedures led to an increase in Journal-approval votes. He emphasized the importance of these votes in determining if there are enough Members present to conduct business. Walker highlighted the necessity of Journal votes due to the elimination of quorum calls by the Democratic Party. Assessing a quorum through Journal-approval votes also serves to gather Members before important votes or leadership announcements. Walker defended the importance of Journal-approval votes to establish a quorum before major votes or leadership announcements. Political scientist John W. Patty's study showed that these votes were associated with voting on significant legislation and were more likely to be close and party-line votes. According to Patty, leaders from both parties may prompt their Members to call Journal-approval votes in advance of high-priority measures to \"block off\" a voting period and \"signal\" the importance of the votes to come. Party leaders also use Journal-approval votes to assemble Members before an announcement or presentation, and Members may vote against them to demonstrate independence from leadership. Several associations, research groups, and media outlets rate Members based on their positions on record votes, with some omitting procedural votes like Journal-approval votes to produce more relevant voting scores. From 1991 to 2016, there were 472 Journal-approval record votes, ranging from 8 to 77 in a single Congress. Members may vote against Journal-approval votes to show independence from party leadership. During a 35-year period, Journal record votes ranged from 8 to 77 in a single Congress. Members of both majority and minority parties initiated approval votes equally. A significant trend is the increased postponement of record Journal votes triggered by demands for yeas and nays. Speakers can now postpone votes until later in the same legislative day. In recent Congresses, Journal record votes have been increasingly postponed until later in the legislative day, with the Speaker likely to group them with other record votes to minimize scheduling conflicts. This practice contrasts with earlier Congresses where immediate votes were more common, triggered by a Member noting the absence of a quorum after a voice vote. In recent Congresses, Journal record votes have been increasingly postponed until later in the legislative day, with the Speaker likely to group them with other record votes to minimize scheduling conflicts. Members can demand a record vote by requesting the yeas and nays, which guarantees a vote within the legislative day if supported by one-fifth of Members present. From 1991 to 2016, there were 396 record votes triggered by quorum points of order, compared to 76 votes triggered by a demand for the yeas and nays. During the 114th Congresses (2005-2016), there was an increase in yeas and nays requests and a decrease in quorum points of order for record votes. Members can use quorum points of order or demand yeas and nays for a record vote on the Speaker's approval of the Journal. Quorum points of order require no additional support and ensure the Journal's approval will be reconsidered. Yeas and nays guarantee a record vote later in the day if supported by enough Members. During the 114th Congresses, there was an increase in yeas and nays requests for record votes. Yeas and nays demand locks in a vote period for important issues not related to the Journal."
