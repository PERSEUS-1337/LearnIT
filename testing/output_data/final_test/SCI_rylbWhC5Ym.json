    "content": "Temporal Difference learning with function approximation has been widely used recently, leading to successful results. However, a drawback is over-generalization with neural networks, causing slow convergence and instability. A novel TD learning method, HR-TD, reduces over-generalization for faster convergence with both linear and nonlinear function approximators. HR-TD is evaluated on linear and nonlinear benchmark domains, showing improvement in learning behavior and performance. TD learning with nonlinear function approximators and deep networks has led to breakthroughs in large-scale problems. The TD learning update involves estimating the value of a state, adjusting it based on the transition to the next state, and calculating the temporal difference error. In TD learning, the update rule adjusts the value of a state based on the transition to the next state. In deterministic environments, the learning rate can be set to 1 to reach the TD target, while in stochastic environments, it is set less than 1 to avoid over-generalization. When states are represented with a function approximator, changes to one state may affect another due to their similarity. In TD learning, the update rule adjusts the state value based on the transition to the next state. Over-generalization can occur when using neural network function approximators, leading to an increase in TD error. The HR-TD algorithm offers a solution by introducing parameter regularization to control for this issue. Our novel algorithm efficiently learns from fewer samples than prior approaches, addressing the over-generalization problem in TD learning. The paper is organized with a background on TD learning, over-generalization, and optimization techniques in Section 2, followed by a discussion of state-of-the-art research in Section 3. The motivation, design, and experimental results of our algorithm are presented in Sections 4 and 5, validating its effectiveness. Reinforcement Learning problems are defined as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large or continuous state spaces requiring function approximation. The value estimate of state s with parameter \u03b8 under policy \u03c0 is defined. TD learning updates state values by bootstrapping off estimated values of predicted next states. 1-step TD methods, like TD(0), bootstrap from immediate next states to learn current state values. The TD error \u03b4 t (s t , s t+1 |\u03b8) is minimized in TD learning by updating parameters using gradient descent. The optimal action value function Q satisfies the Bellman optimality equation, and the partial derivative of v(s t |\u03b8) or Q(s t , a t |\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8 guides parameter updates. In the linear case, v(s t |\u03b8) = \u03b8 t \u03c6(s t ) and g t (s t , a t |\u03b8) = \u2202 \u03b8 Q(s t , a t |\u03b8). In TD learning, the TD error is minimized by updating parameters using gradient descent. The proximal mapping is introduced to address the issue of over-generalization in function approximation. It helps in reducing the TD error by adjusting weights that correspond to important features. Proximal mapping is used after parameter updates to incorporate constraints. It incentivizes moving in the direction that minimizes the function and keeps the parameter close to a reference point. Proximal methods are useful in reinforcement learning, integrating with gradient TD learning and natural actor-critic methods. The recursive proximal mapping formulation of TD learning algorithm BID1 introduces a TD update law that solves a fixed-point equation. This approach does not optimize an explicit objective function but aims to address the over-generalization problem in reinforcement learning. The Temporal Consistency loss (TC-loss) method BID10 and constrained TD approach BID4 aim to minimize changes in the target state value. TC-loss, when used with TD loss, ensures temporally consistent estimates. Drawbacks include different asymptotic solutions from TD and unclear solution properties. Parameter components have varying impacts on changing the value function. The constrained TD algorithm BID4 aims to alleviate overgeneralization by using vector rejection to diminish updates along the gradient direction of the action-value function of the next state. However, it faces the double-sampling problem and is not easily extended to nonlinear function approximation like DQN. In visual environments with similar state representations, overgeneralization can be severe. The constrained TD algorithm BID4 aims to reduce overgeneralization by using vector rejection to decrease updates along the gradient direction of the action-value function of the next state. This is important in visual environments with similar state representations, where overgeneralization can be a significant issue. The Constrained TD BID4 algorithm aims to reduce overgeneralization by maximizing the correlation of weight updates with the features of the current state while minimizing correlation with the features of the next state. This approach addresses the issue of large positive correlations leading to increased errors in learning. In linear value function approximation, parameters should be adjusted carefully to avoid changing important features of the state. The Constrained TD BID4 algorithm focuses on reducing overgeneralization by maximizing weight update correlation with the current state features and minimizing correlation with the next state features. This helps prevent large positive correlations that can lead to learning errors. In linear value function approximation, careful adjustment of parameters is necessary to avoid altering crucial state features. The Constrained TD BID4 algorithm aims to reduce overgeneralization by controlling the weighted feature correlation between the current and successive states. The constrained Mean-Squares Error is used to update parameters per step, ensuring the true value function is maintained. Using Lagrangian duality, the parameter update can be reformulated to prevent learning errors. The algorithm for value function approximation in the Constrained TD BID4 method involves using Lagrangian duality to reformulate the parameter update, with a closed-form solution for weight updates. The algorithm for control includes minimizing the squared Bellman error using SGD and backpropagation through the target network parameters. Theoretical analysis of Algorithm 1 with linear function approximation is conducted in this section. The update of weights should satisfy specific conditions for convergence. The loss used in Hadamard regularized DDQN is a mixture of Eq. (6) and another loss. Target network is not used in calculating this loss. In the theoretical analysis of Algorithm 1 with linear function approximation, the update of weights must meet certain convergence conditions. Hadamard regularized DDQN uses a specific loss function that does not involve the target network. The approach of slowly introducing a discount factor into the error computation has been shown to accelerate the learning process in MDPs. This method, known as HR-TD, does not require a separate time-varying discount factor and its schedule. HR-TD is evaluated on Mountain Car and Acrobot control problems using both linear and nonlinear function approximation techniques. The algorithm HR-TD is evaluated on complex domains like Atari Learning Environment BID0, specifically on the game of Pong. OpenAI gym BID3 is used to interface the agent with the environments. Comparison metrics include accumulated reward per episode and average change in target Q value. HR-Q learning is expected to improve policy earlier, while HR-TD is expected to evaluate policy value as well as TD. The change in value of the next state is evaluated to see if HR-TD can reduce it due to regularization. The text discusses the diagnostic nature of a quantity related to regularization in training algorithms. It compares the evaluative property of HR-TD on control tasks and outlines the steps involved in training a policy on the Mountain Car domain. The experiment involves choosing actions based on a policy, updating parameters using backpropagation, and visualizing the cumulative score in an episode. In an experiment comparing TD and HR-TD on control tasks, the MSE values are calculated by averaging the last 10 training steps and taking the mean across 10 runs. TD and HR-TD show similar values, while TC converges to a different minimum with a high MSE. When comparing TD and HR-TD on control tasks, MSE values are similar, while TC converges to a high MSE. Lowering the learning rate for TC avoids destabilization but doesn't converge in the max training steps. HR-Q learning with Neural Networks is tested on Mountain Car and Acrobot without basis expansion. Performance is compared with Q-Learning and Q-learning with TC loss using DDQN as the underlying algorithm. 20 independent runs are conducted over 1000 episodes, showing HR-TD learning a useful policy behavior early on. In experiments comparing HR-TD, DQN, and TC, HR-TD shows early learning of a useful policy behavior. HR-TD learns a state representation that balances target value changes better than DQN and TC. The technique is validated on a more complex domain with DDQN on Atari, showing scalability and consistent trends. In experiments comparing HR-TD, DQN, and TC, HR-TD shows early learning of a useful policy behavior. HR-TD does about as well as DDQN on the complex network. HR-TD with linear function approximation is studied in the Mountain Car domain using Fourier basis functions. All methods are trained with a 6th order Fourier basis expansion, leading to 36 features. A constant learning rate of \u03b1 = 0.01 is used for all methods, with HR-TD initialized with a regularization factor \u03b7 = 0.3. Learning curves for 1000 episodes, averaged over 20 runs, show HR-Q and TC outperform Q-learning in FIG3. HR-Q also exhibits more stable updates. In this paper, the analysis highlights the issue of over-generalization in TD learning with function approximation. A novel regularization scheme based on the Hadamard product is proposed to address this problem. The effectiveness of the algorithm is experimentally validated on benchmarks of varying complexity. Additionally, the double sampling problem in CTD is discussed, which arises when the product of two expectations is needed. In stochastic MDP problems, residual gradients have a double sampling issue, while TD does not. However, Constrained TD (CTD) may suffer from a triple sampling problem. In CTD, the regular TD update does not have double-sampling problems, but the second term may lead to issues."
