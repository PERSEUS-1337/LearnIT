    "title": "SB 1150",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. In response to the foreclosure crisis in California starting in 2008, the Legislature enacted the Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR) to require mortgage servicers to provide a fair and transparent process for borrowers applying for loan modifications before starting foreclosure proceedings. This helped stabilize families, neighborhoods, and communities by slowing down indiscriminate foreclosures. District attorneys and legal aid organizations are seeing an increase in cases where mortgage servicers exploit a loophole in the Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR) to foreclose on homeowners who survive the death of a borrower and have an ownership interest in the home but are not on the mortgage loan. These survivors, often the borrower's spouse over 65 years old, face barriers and abuses when trying to get loan information from the servicer, leading to foreclosure. Home ownership is crucial for building generational wealth, but indiscriminate foreclosures on surviving heirs hinder this opportunity and worsen wealth inequality. Legislation aims to provide transparency and support for surviving heirs to prevent foreclosures and keep them in their homes. This act is intended to align with federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines. Section 2920.7 of the Civil Code states that a mortgage servicer must not initiate a foreclosure process upon notification of a borrower's death by a successor in interest who is not a party to the loan. The servicer must request documentation of the borrower's death and allow a reasonable period for the claimant to provide it before taking any action. Upon receipt of reasonable documentation demonstrating ownership interest in the real property, a claimant will be deemed a \"successor in interest\" by the mortgage servicer. A minimum of 90 days is provided for the claimant to present this documentation upon written request. (2) A mortgage servicer must apply the section's provisions to multiple successors in interest according to loan terms and laws. Nonapplicant successors may need to consent to loan assumption. (3) Being a successor in interest does not change the servicer's duty to provide loan modifications. Successors may need to qualify for foreclosure prevention options. Within 10 days of being deemed a successor in interest, a mortgage servicer must provide written information to the successor, including loan details like balance, interest rate, and payment amounts. The successor can choose to apply to assume the deceased borrower's loan, subject to credit evaluation by the servicer. A successor in interest of an assumable loan can apply for a foreclosure prevention alternative while seeking to assume the loan. If eligible for the prevention alternative, they can assume the loan. The successor has the same rights as a borrower under various sections. \"Owner-occupied\" refers to the property being the deceased borrower's principal residence. A successor in interest can seek injunctive relief to stop violations of certain sections until corrected by the mortgage servicer. The injunction remains until violations are remedied, and the entity can request to dissolve it once violations are fixed. After a trustee's deed upon sale is recorded, a mortgage servicer may be liable for actual damages to a successor in interest for violations. The court can award treble damages or $50,000 if violations were intentional. Prevailing successors in interest can also receive attorney's fees and costs. The Department of Business Oversight and the Bureau of Real Estate may adopt regulations to enforce mortgage servicing rules. The rights and remedies provided by this section are independent of other laws. The act does not affect mortgage obligations. Definitions for \"notification of death\" and \"mortgage servicer\" are provided. \"Reasonable documentation\" includes proof of successor in interest. To provide proof of succession, different documents are required based on the relationship to the deceased: letters for personal representatives, will or trust document for devisees or heirs, copy of transfer on death deed for beneficiaries, affidavit of death or grant deed for surviving joint tenants, affidavit of death or deed for surviving spouses in community property, certification of trust for trustees, and relevant trust documents for trust beneficiaries. A \"successor in interest\" is a person related to the deceased borrower who notifies the mortgage servicer of the death and provides documentation. This applies to first lien mortgages on owner-occupied residential properties with up to four units. The property must have been the deceased borrower's principal residence. Any mortgage servicer, mortgagee, or beneficiary of the deed of trust who complies with relevant provisions regarding successors in interest of Regulations X and Z will be considered compliant with this section. The provisions of paragraph (1) will only be effective upon revisions to Regulations X and Z by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This section does not apply to successors in interest involved in a legal dispute over the property securing the borrower's mortgage. This section exempts certain financial institutions and licensed individuals from foreclosure regulations if they foreclosed on 175 or fewer residential properties in California. It will be in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The provisions of this act are severable, meaning that if any part of the act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the other valid provisions."
