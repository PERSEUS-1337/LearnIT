The amendment to Section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires a certification from the applicant regarding patents published by the Secretary at least 1 day before the application is filed. The 30-month period for civil actions in case of patent infringement is only available for patents published before the application date. The application can be amended to include a certification described in paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV), allowing the 30-month period for the patent in question. Any subsequent patents published before the approval of the application will be addressed separately. The subsequent applicant can address the patent in a subsequent application by making a certification described in paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV), allowing for the 30-month period. The Secretary may permit the applicant to reference information from the previous application when filing a subsequent application. The FDA allows applicants to reference information from previous applications in subsequent filings, with specific conforming amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. SEC. 3.

Additionally, the application may be imposed after the filing date or if the owner of the patent violates antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) applies to unfair methods of competition. If an applicant forfeits the 180-day exclusivity period, a subsequent application with a certification period described in paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV) becomes effective immediately upon approval. The subsequent applicant is not eligible for a 180-day exclusivity period. If an applicant forfeits the 180-day exclusivity period, they will not be eligible for it again. SEC. 4. BIOEQUIVALENCE.
