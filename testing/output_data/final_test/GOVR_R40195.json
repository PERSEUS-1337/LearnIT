    "content": "The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits government sponsorship of religious instruction. The U.S. Supreme Court distinguishes between direct aid to sectarian schools and indirect aid through voucher programs. Direct aid must pass the Lemon test, ensuring a secular purpose, no advancement of religion, and no excessive entanglement with religion. Prior to the Court's latest decisions, the primary effect and entanglement prongs were substantial barriers for direct aid programs. The Court often found the primary effect prong violated because it presumed public aid to pervasively sectarian institutions could not be limited to secular use. Additionally, direct aid programs benefiting such institutions were deemed unconstitutional due to excessive entanglement with monitoring their use of the aid. The Court's decisions in Agostini v. Felton and Mitchell v. Helms have lowered constitutional barriers to direct aid to sectarian schools by abandoning the presumption of pervasively sectarian nature. Aid must now serve a secular purpose and not lead to excessive entanglement, but the primary effect test now requires aid to be secular in nature. The Court has redefined the primary effect test for aid to sectarian schools, requiring it to be secular in nature and distributed based on neutral criteria. Past jurisprudence allowed indirect aid with fewer restraints, but still required a secular purpose. The key question is whether aid recipients have a genuine choice between secular and religious options. If religious options dominate, the program is deemed unconstitutional. The Court has expanded the range of indirect aid programs for schools, including religious options, as long as parents have a genuine choice between secular and religious options. This was exemplified in cases like Zelman v. Simmons-Harris and Everson v. Board of Education. The Court has upheld indirect aid programs for schools, including religious options, as long as parents have a genuine choice between secular and religious options. This was shown in cases like Zelman v. Simmons-Harris and Everson v. Board of Education. In Wolman v. Walter, the Court found the Establishment Clause violated by public subsidy of field trip transportation for parochial schoolchildren due to field trips being controlled by the school. The Court also upheld the loan of secular textbooks to sectarian schools, reasoning that the textbooks are limited to secular use and the loan programs are general welfare programs. In Mitchell v. Helms, the Court overturned previous rulings and deemed it constitutional for the government to provide instructional materials, including computer hardware and software, to sectarian schools. The aid was considered secular, distributed based on religiously neutral criteria, and could be limited to secular use without government monitoring. Lemon v. Kurtzman, however, held it unconstitutional for a state to subsidize parochial school teachers of secular subjects. The Court ruled it unconstitutional for a state to subsidize parochial school teachers of secular subjects like math and foreign languages, as it would require intrusive monitoring to prevent religious influence. Similar programs providing services to nonpublic schools were also struck down for entangling government with schools. In Agostini v. Felton, the Court overturned previous decisions and upheld the provision of educational services to sectarian schoolchildren by public teachers on the premises of sectarian schools. Additionally, in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, the Court upheld the provision of a sign-language interpreter for a disabled child attending a sectarian secondary school under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In Levitt v. Committee for Public Education, the Court struck down a program reimbursing sectarian schools for administering teacher-prepared tests with potential religious content. In contrast, in Wolman v. Walter, the Court upheld a program providing standardized tests and scoring services to nonpublic schoolchildren, including those in religious schools. In Committee for Public Education v. Regan and Regan, the Court upheld programs reimbursing sectarian schools for administering state-prepared tests and complying with state-mandated record-keeping requirements. The Court reasoned that the tests and requirements were limited to secular use and did not involve the teaching process. In Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist and Sloan v. Lemon, the Court found unconstitutional programs providing tuition grants and tax benefits to parents of children in private, mostly religious schools. The Court determined that these programs primarily subsidized sectarian schools, benefiting only a specific group. However, in other decisions, the Court upheld voucher and tax benefit programs that were available to children in both public and private schools. In Mueller v. Allen, Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind, and Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, the Court upheld benefit programs that provided assistance to children attending public and private schools on a religiously neutral basis. The programs included tax deductions, grants, and voucher programs that indirectly benefited sectarian schools. In Zelman, the Court affirmed that sectarian schools benefited indirectly from the choices of students or parents. The universe of choice for parents included public school options. The Court also upheld public subsidies for services like physician and dental care, diagnostic services, and school lunches for eligible children in sectarian schools. In Everson v. Board of Education, the Court upheld the provision of public services to sectarian schools, stating that the Establishment Clause does not require them to be cut off from such services. In Roemer v. Maryland Board of Public Works, the Court approved noncategorical grants to church-affiliated colleges with restrictions on the use of funds for sectarian purposes. Tilton v. Richardson saw the Court supporting a federal program providing grants to colleges. In Tilton v. Richardson, the Court upheld a federal program providing grants to colleges, including church-affiliated ones, for constructing facilities not used for religious purposes. In Hunt v. McNair, a state program issuing revenue bonds for higher education facilities with religious affiliations was upheld with restrictions on sectarian use. Rosenberger v. The Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia was deemed constitutional by the Court. In Rosenberger v. The Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, the Court ruled that it was constitutional for a state university to subsidize printing costs for a religious student publication, as denying the subsidy would be viewpoint discrimination violating the First Amendment. The Court also upheld programs providing grants to students attending higher education institutions, including religiously affiliated colleges. The Supreme Court affirmed decisions regarding state scholarship programs for students attending public or private colleges, including religiously affiliated ones. In Locke v. Davey, the Court found that a restriction on using scholarship funds for devotional theological degrees did not violate the Establishment Clause as recipients independently decided how to spend the funds."
