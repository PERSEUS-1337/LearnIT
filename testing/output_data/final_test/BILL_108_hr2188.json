INCREASE AND DECREASE IN EARNINGS CREDITED TO STATE ACCOUNTS based on meeting or failing to meet funding goals. \"Increase and Decrease in Earnings Allocated to State Accounts based on Meeting or Failing to Meet Funding Goals\" If the average daily balance in a State account in the Unemployment Trust Fund exceeds the funding goal, the amount credited will increase by the interest premium. If the balance is below the funding goal, the amount credited will decrease by the interest penalty, with a limit of $2,500,000.

The amount credited is determined by specific percentages for each State, with a cap of $2,500,000. The Secretary adjusts interest premiums if they exceed penalties. An interest penalty is half a percent of the excess funding goal for the State with the largest percentage, and a product of the amount credited and a percentage for other States.
