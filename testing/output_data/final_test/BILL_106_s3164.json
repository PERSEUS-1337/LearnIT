    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Seniors From Fraud Act\". Congress finds that older Americans are increasingly targeted by various forms of fraud and criminal activities. The TRIAD program, supported by law enforcement agencies and community partners, aims to reduce elder victimization. Congress should continue to back TRIAD and similar initiatives to enhance the safety and well-being of senior citizens. Telemarketing fraud targeting senior citizens costs consumers billions annually. Fraudulent telemarketers create \"mooch lists\" of vulnerable individuals, with over half aged 50 or older. Law enforcement agencies and organizations collaborate to warn seniors on these lists. The Administration on Aging informs senior citizens about telemarketing fraud to prevent them from becoming victims. The Senior Fraud Prevention Program authorizes funding for the National Association of TRIAD for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on the effectiveness of the TRIAD program before its authorization expires, including an analysis of programs, identification of obstacles, and recommendations for improvement. The Senior Fraud Prevention Program authorizes funding for the National Association of TRIAD to educate senior citizens about telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide information on the dangers of fraud and how to protect against it. The Senior Fraud Prevention Program aims to educate senior citizens about telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud, emphasizing the risks of sharing personal and financial information with unsolicited callers. It also includes informing seniors on how to report fraud, their consumer protection rights under Federal law, and other necessary information to protect them. The Secretary will determine the means of disseminating this information, considering public service announcements, printed materials, websites, direct mailings, and telephone outreach. The Secretary will prioritize disseminating information on fraud prevention to areas with high incidents of fraud against senior citizens, including telephone outreach to individuals on \"mooch lists\" confiscated from fraudulent marketers. SEC. 5. STUDY OF CRIMES AGAINST SENIORS. The Attorney General will conduct a study on crimes against seniors to develop new strategies for prevention. The study will analyze the types of crimes, risk factors for victimized seniors, and the response of criminal justice systems. The feasibility of States establishing a centralized database on crimes against seniors, effectiveness of damage awards for fraud, and ways to prevent crimes against seniors are being studied. Seniors will be included in the National Crime Victimization Survey to gather statistics on crimes targeting them and risk factors. The study focuses on the locations where crimes against seniors are likely to occur and the specific characteristics of senior victims, including age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. State and local governments are encouraged to incorporate fraud avoidance information into programs for the aging."
