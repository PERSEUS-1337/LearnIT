The Act \"Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act of 2010\" allows Juvenile Accountability Block Grants to be used for bullying prevention and intervention programs, with specific guidelines to be followed by states or local governments receiving the funds. The Attorney General must establish voluntary guidelines within 6 months for identifying bullying, involving juveniles in programs, and developing prevention and intervention programs focusing on accountability. The Attorney General must establish guidelines for identifying bullying and developing prevention programs, including counseling services, parental involvement, behavior modification, and education for juveniles involved in bullying incidents. The guidelines established by the Attorney General provide information to school administration, staff, child care providers, and law enforcement on identifying and addressing bullying. States or local governments can adjust these guidelines to meet specific needs. Bullying is defined as verbal acts, name-calling, and written statements that are threatening or harmful. Bullying includes written statements that may be threatening, harmful, or humiliating, conducted through various electronic means. It also encompasses physical threats, creating a hostile environment, harassment based on various factors, and discriminatory statements or conduct. The text chunk discusses bullying behavior, which can involve an imbalance of power leading to humiliation without the intent to harm a specific individual. Additionally, there is an amendment regarding the reauthorization of Juvenile Accountability Block Grants for fiscal years 2011 through 2015."
