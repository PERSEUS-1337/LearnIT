    "content": "Section 1 introduces a special tax treatment for certain life insurance contracts and trusts related to disabled individuals. It allows for a deduction for premiums on life insurance for the benefit of disabled individuals. In the case of an individual, a deduction is allowed for qualified life insurance premiums paid during the taxable year. Qualified life insurance premiums refer to premiums under a qualified disabled individual's life insurance contract. This contract must have the exclusive beneficiary as a qualified disabled individual. The qualified disabled individual's trust must be the exclusive beneficiary of the life insurance contract, with all income beneficiaries being disabled individuals. The contract can insure the taxpayer's life, their spouse's life, or the lives of both, as well as the former spouse's life if divorced. Ownership of the contract must be relinquished. The taxpayer must hold all ownership in the life insurance contract, with a face amount not exceeding $1,000,000. A disabled individual is defined as someone unable to work due to a severe impairment lasting at least 10 years. The full-time minimum wage amount for a calendar year is defined as the gross income an individual would earn if employed and paid for 2,000 hours at the minimum wage rate. This applies to individuals whose adjusted gross income does not exceed 2 times the full-time minimum wage amount for the year. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 limits the number of life insurance contracts that can be considered as qualified disabled individual's contracts for tax purposes. Taxpayers with multiple contracts must choose only one to be treated as such each year. A Qualified Disabled Individual's Trust is defined for this purpose. The term 'qualified disabled individual's trust' refers to a trust in the United States where all income beneficiaries are disabled individuals, with specific requirements for the trustees. The term 'member of the family' in a trust refers to individuals who are not income beneficiaries and includes spouses, parents, children, grandchildren, siblings, and former spouses. Trusts with more than 3 trustees must have at least one-third who are not family members. Distribution of trust assets is limited to benefit income beneficiaries until the last one passes away. The term 'parent' in a trust includes stepmothers, stepfathers, and legally adopted individuals. Distributions from a qualified disabled individual's trust are excluded from the gross income of the disabled individual. This allows for deductions and credits for taxes deemed distributed from the trust. Distributions from a trust for a qualified disabled individual can be deducted and credited for taxes deemed distributed, providing benefits to both the trust and the income beneficiaries.
