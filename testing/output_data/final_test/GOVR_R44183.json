    "content": "This report discusses appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2016, focusing on components like USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and DNDO. It covers the Administration's FY2016 request and Congress's appropriations for Research and Development, Training, and Services. The report also includes provisions from the proposed bill that impact these functions. The CRS reports on homeland security appropriations track legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The reports do not analyze specific issues related to mandatory funding or follow other legislation related to DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. The discussion of appropriations legislation includes specialized budgetary concepts explained in the appendix to CRS Report R44053. The curr_chunk discusses adjustments to discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act and provides details on budget authority amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations. Data for FY2015 amounts are derived from the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015. The curr_chunk provides information on the FY2016 budget request and funding levels from congressional documentation, including H.R. 240, S. 1619, H.R. 3128, and P.L. 114-113. It references various sources such as the Budget of the United States Government, FY2016 DHS budget justifications, and the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016. The homeland security appropriations bill allocates resources to every departmental component of DHS, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of annual funding. The budget is divided into five thematic groupings, with a mix of fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending making up the remainder. The DHS appropriations bill allocates resources to departmental components, with a focus on Research and Development, Training, and Services. Title IV and Title V provide funding for support functions, with a total budget request of $5,428 million for FY2016, including $1,554 million in discretionary authority. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2016 allocated $1,554 million in discretionary authority. The Senate-reported bill proposed a decrease of $103 million (6.6%) from the request, while the House-reported bill would have provided $1,503 million in net discretionary budget authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 included $1,499 million for these components, a decrease of $55 million (3.5%) from the request. The table provides funding details for Research, Development, Training, and Services for FY2015, including amounts requested and allocated by the Administration, Senate, and House appropriations committees. It also mentions a proposed legislative change to the U visa program by the Administration. USCIS activities include processing immigration applications, petitions, naturalization petitions, and more. USCIS is responsible for processing immigration applications, petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, and citizenship benefits. The agency is funded through fee revenues and annual appropriations, with a request for $130 million in appropriations for FY2016, including funds for the E-Verify program and Immigrant Integration Initiative. The FY2016 budget request for USCIS included $4,004 million in new gross budget authority, with $3,229 million allocated for adjudication services, $143 million for information and customer services, $415 million for administration expenses, and $27 million for the SAVE program. Additionally, the Administration proposed legislative changes to the U visa program, potentially costing $21 million from the general fund of the Treasury. The Senate-reported S. 1619 recommended USCIS receive $3,610 million in gross budget authority for FY2016, $394 million below the requested amount. It included $120 million for the E-Verify Program, $10 million less than the Administration's request. The bill allowed up to $10 million in fee revenue for immigrant integration grants, with a stipulation that no funds could be used for granting immigration benefits. The House-reported H.R. 3128 recommended USCIS receive $3,610 million in gross budget authority for FY2016, $394 million below the requested amount. It included $120 million in appropriations for USCIS, $10 million less than requested. The bill allowed USCIS to expend up to $10 million in user fees to support immigrant integration grants. The committee directed USCIS to provide at least $29 million to convert paper immigration records to a digital format. The House-reported bill for USCIS in FY2016 did not prohibit pay raises using fee revenue, but any savings from foregone raises were to enhance E-Verify. USCIS appropriations could not be used for immigration benefits without a criminal background check. Funds for immigrant integration grants could not be used for aliens not lawfully admitted. P.L. 114-113 provided $120 million for USCIS, $10 million below the requested amount. The FY2016 USCIS budget was $10 million below the Administration's request, totaling $3,610 million with fee collections. Funds were allocated for the E-Verify Program, and immigrant integration grants could be funded from fee revenues. Grants were specified for lawful permanent residents only, with background checks required before granting any benefits. The FY2016 USCIS budget was $10 million below the Administration's request, totaling $3,610 million with fee collections. Background checks are required before granting any immigration benefits. USCIS was directed to implement GAO's recommendations on fraud in the asylum process and report on E-Verify usage statistics, advance parole usage, fee study results, and noncitizen compliance with address change notification requirements. The Senate committee directed USCIS to improve E-Verify accuracy and provide national-level statistics on its usage. They also instructed USCIS to incentivize smaller businesses to use E-Verify and report to Congress on the costs and time needed to make it mandatory for employers. P.L. 114-113 did not provide further guidance on E-Verify. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center offers law enforcement training to 91 federal entities. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides advanced instruction to 91 federal entities and other law enforcement organizations. FLETC aims to promote consistency and collaboration by training officers in a multi-agency environment. It has four training sites in the US, offers online training, and employs approximately 1,100 personnel. The Administration requested $267 million for FLETC in FY2016, with an additional $117 million expected in reimbursements from other government agencies for law enforcement training. The Senate and House-reported bills for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated less funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) than requested, impacting salaries, expenses, and training needs due to unfilled personnel positions. The final act included $245 million for FLETC, $22 million less than requested and $13 million less than the previous year. The final act for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $22 million less than requested for the Salaries and Expenses appropriation, with $5 million additional funding for training requirements. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development (R&D), conducting R&D in its own laboratories and funding R&D by other entities. The Administration's request for the S&T Directorate in FY2016 was $779 million, 29.4% less than FY2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower funding for Laboratory Facilities, with no funds requested for NBAF construction in FY2016. The request included an increase in support for Apex projects to $78 million, proposing six new projects and a \"technology engines\" activity within the Apex program. The Senate committee recommended a $14 million decrease in funding for the S&T Directorate compared to the Administration's request. They suggested an $8 million increase for University Programs but a $20 million decrease for RD&I. The committee emphasized maintaining at least 10 university centers of excellence and directed funding to the Apex program while focusing on three specific areas. The House committee recommended $787 million for S&T, $8 million more than requested. They supported the Apex program and allocated $9 million more for University Programs. The final appropriation included increases for University Programs but decreases for Laboratory Facilities and Management. DHS-wide coordination of R&D activities has been a longstanding issue. DHS has faced challenges in coordinating R&D activities for years. A 2012 GAO report highlighted the lack of department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, leading to a lack of knowledge about total investments. Congress directed DHS to develop new policies and procedures in response to the GAO's findings. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 and 2014 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a review process for all R&D work within DHS and implement new policies for R&D prioritization. Concerns remain about coordinating R&D department-wide, with ongoing efforts to develop a process for coordination. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is addressing concerns about its fragmented R&D programs by establishing Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) to coordinate and prioritize technological capability gaps across the department. This initiative is part of the Unity of Effort effort to focus research and development investments strategically. The Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) will identify and prioritize technological capability gaps within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Under Secretary for S&T will lead the overall effort, with senior representatives from operational components leading individual IPTs. S&T will conduct independent technical assessments of acquisitions to ensure they fill capability gaps. DNDO is responsible for nuclear detection R&D, testing, and acquisition within DHS. The DNDO is responsible for nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. It coordinates federal nuclear forensics programs and the U.S. portion of the global nuclear detection architecture. The Administration requested $357 million for DNDO in FY2016, an increase of 16.1% from the FY2015 appropriation of $308 million. The funding increase includes merging the Radiation Portal Monitors and Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems programs into a single Radiological and Nuclear Detection Equipment Acquisition program. The Senate committee recommended $320 million for DNDO, $37 million less than the request. The House committee recommended $357 million, with a slight reduction in the Management and Administration account. The final appropriation was $347 million, $10 million less than the request, with reductions in both Management and Administration and Nuclear Detection Equipment Acquisition. In 2013, Congress directed DHS to review programs related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats for potential improvements and cost savings. In July 2015, DHS officials testified about plans to consolidate DNDO, OHA, and other programs into a new office for coordination of various security strategies and preparedness efforts. The House and Senate committee reports on FY2016 appropriations did not address the proposed consolidation of programs related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. A provision in the final bill prohibited DHS from using FY2016 funds to establish an Office of CBRNE Defense \"until such time as Congress has authorized such establishment.\" The provision did, however, give DHS the authority to transfer funds for the establishment of such an office, if authorized."
