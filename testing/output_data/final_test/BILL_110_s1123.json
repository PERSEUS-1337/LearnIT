    "content": "The \"Simplified Small Business Telephone Tax Relief Act of 2007\" extends the filing period and provides a safe harbor for certain taxpayers seeking refunds of the excise tax on toll telephone service. The \"Simplified Small Business Telephone Tax Relief Act of 2007\" extends the filing deadline for overpayments related to nontaxable services billed between February 28, 2003, and August 1, 2006. The overpayment can be credited against taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code or refunded to the taxpayer as per the Secretary's rules. The Act also ensures that social security trust funds are held harmless by the Treasury Secretary. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers funds from the general fund to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. In cases of overpayment, eligible taxpayers can elect to receive a credit against taxes or a refund. The taxpayer can elect to receive a credit or refund for overpayment based on their adjusted gross income, ranging from $50 to $200. For eligible taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $300,000 and $500,000, the credit or refund amount ranges from $250 to $300. Eligible taxpayers must have at least $25,000 of gross income from a trade or business in the most recent taxable year. The election for the refund or credit must be made as prescribed by the Secretary, with a special rule for claims relating to preceding years. No election can be made if a claim has been previously filed before the date of the enactment of this Act. The term \"nontaxable service\" is defined in accordance with Internal Revenue Service Notice 2006-50, 2006-25 I.R.B. 1141."
