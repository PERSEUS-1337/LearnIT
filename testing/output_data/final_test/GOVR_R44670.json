    "content": "The Social Security full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which workers can claim full benefits. Claiming before or after the FRA affects monthly benefits. The FRA is gradually increasing from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period. The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits is gradually increasing to 67 for workers born in 1960 or later. Workers can claim benefits as early as age 62, but there are permanent reductions for claiming before the FRA. Delaying benefits past the FRA results in a permanent increase in monthly benefits, with a maximum credit applying up to age 70. Claiming benefits after age 70 does not increase monthly benefits. The full retirement age (FRA) was initially 65, later increased by Congress in 1983. Age 65 was chosen as a retirement age due to a compromise between 60 being too young and 70 being too old. The full retirement age (FRA) was increased gradually from 65 to 67 for workers born in 1938 or later, with further increases for later birth years until reaching 67 for workers born in 1960 or later. This change was part of the 1983 amendments aimed at improving the system's financial outlook by reflecting increases in longevity and health status of workers. The early eligibility age of 62 remained unchanged, but the increase in FRA led to larger benefit reductions for those claiming benefits between the ages of 62 and the new FRA. The Full Retirement Age (FRA) has gradually increased from 65 to 67 for workers born in 1938 or later. This change resulted in larger benefit reductions for those claiming benefits between the ages of 62 and the new FRA. The Early Eligibility Age (EEA) is currently 62 for workers and spouses, with benefits subject to permanent reduction for early retirement. In 1956, the eligibility age was lowered to 62 for female workers, wives, widows, and female dependent parents to align benefits with husbands' ages. In 1961, the eligibility age for male workers was lowered from 65 to 62, with benefits subject to reduction if claimed between 62 and 65. An inconsistency in benefit calculation between male and female workers was addressed in 1972 legislation, ensuring retirement benefits were computed the same way for both genders. Further adjustments were made to the eligibility age in subsequent years. The eligibility age for receiving benefits was adjusted over the years, with changes for widows, widowers, and disabled individuals. Benefits are adjusted based on the age at which a person claims them to provide similar total lifetime benefits. Claiming benefits earlier results in lower monthly payments, while delaying results in higher payments. Birth date is not considered for benefit adjustments. When claiming Social Security benefits, the full retirement age (FRA) is based on the month of birth, with adjustments made for those born on the first of the month. A calculator on the SSA website helps determine the effect of early or delayed retirement on benefits. Claiming benefits before FRA results in a permanent actuarial reduction in monthly payments. For each month before the full retirement age (FRA), there are specific reductions in monthly benefits. Claiming benefits at age 62 results in a 30% reduction in monthly benefits for a worker with an FRA of 67. Workers who claim benefits after FRA receive a delayed retirement credit (DRC), which is a permanent increase in benefits. The DRC has been modified over the years, initially increasing benefits by one-twelfth of 1%. The delayed retirement credit (DRC) was initially increased by one-twelfth of 1% for each month between ages 65 and 72 that a worker did not claim benefits. The credit was later increased to 3% per year in 1977 and further increased under the Social Security Amendments of 1983. Currently, the DRC varies based on the worker's year of birth, reaching a maximum of 8% per year for workers born in 1943 or later. The delayed retirement credit (DRC) was increased to ensure workers receive similar lifetime benefits regardless of claiming age. Claiming benefits after full retirement age (FRA) results in a higher benefit, up to a maximum age of 70. Claiming benefits before FRA leads to a permanent reduction in benefits. If a worker delays claiming retirement benefits until age 70, their benefit would be 132% of the full amount, a 32% increase. Claiming benefits before full retirement age results in a permanent reduction in monthly benefits. Social Security beneficiaries below the FRA with current earnings are subject to the retirement earnings test, where benefits are withheld if earnings exceed specified thresholds. The lower earnings threshold in 2019 is $17,640. The retirement earnings test (RET) applies to Social Security beneficiaries below the full retirement age (FRA). In 2019, the lower earnings threshold is $17,640, and the higher threshold is $46,920 for those who will attain the FRA during the year. If earnings exceed the thresholds, benefits are withheld. Once the beneficiary attains the FRA, benefits are no longer subject to withholding based on earnings. The retirement earnings test (RET) applies to Social Security beneficiaries below the full retirement age (FRA). In 2019, the monthly exempt amounts are $1,470 and $3,910. Benefits are withheld only for months where earnings exceed the monthly exempt amount. Benefits withheld under the RET are recalculated when the beneficiary reaches FRA. The retirement earnings test (RET) applies to Social Security beneficiaries below the full retirement age (FRA). Benefits are recalculated at FRA, resulting in a higher monthly benefit going forward. Statistics show that a majority of retired-worker beneficiaries claim benefits before FRA, with 37% claiming at age 62 and 64% under age 66. The Social Security full retirement age was increased from 65 to 67 as part of the 1983 Amendments to address funding problems. The increase is being phased in and will be fully implemented by 2022. The system is once again facing projected long-range funding shortfalls. The Social Security system is projected to face funding shortfalls, with benefits expected to be paid until 2034. Various proposals have been suggested to improve the system's financial outlook, including increasing the retirement age. Lawmakers supporting this change cite gains in life expectancy, while opponents argue against it. Opponents of increasing the retirement age argue that gains in life expectancy have not been equally shared, especially among those with lower socioeconomic status. Research shows a widening gap in life expectancy by SES, impacting Social Security benefits based on average life expectancy. This disparity in life expectancy has implications for the actuarial adjustments to benefits for early or delayed retirement. Increasing the Social Security retirement age has been recommended by deficit reduction commissions and policymakers due to gains in life expectancy. The proposed S.O.S. Act of 2016 suggests raising the Full Retirement Age (FRA) gradually to 69 by 2034, which could improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by 39%. The Bipartisan Policy Center proposed increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 69 gradually by one month every two years after reaching 67 for those turning 62 in 2022. This change could improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 19% of the projected funding shortfall. The commission recommended increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 68 by 2050 and 69 by 2075, with the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) also increasing to 63 and 64. This change would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 15% of the projected funding shortfall. Additionally, the commission suggested allowing people to claim half of their benefits at age 62 and the other half at a later age for more flexibility in claiming benefits.

The proposal also included a hardship exemption for up to 20% of retirees who may be physically unable to work beyond age 62. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 increased the retirement age gradually from 65 to 67, considering factors like physical demands of labor and lifetime earnings. Concerns about the effects of raising the retirement age on certain populations are not new."
