    "content": "Most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment is a key principle of the WTO agreements, requiring each member to treat all other members' products equally. The United States grants normal trade relations (NTR) or MFN status to all countries except Cuba and North Korea, resulting in higher import duties for non-NTR countries. The WTO agreements require MFN treatment to be applied unconditionally, but a member can opt-out of obligations towards a new member by invoking the non-application provision. This clause relieves the member from applying MFN or other obligations but also denies benefits and protections. The United States suspended MFN status to communist countries in 1951 under the Trade Agreements Extension Act. The Trade Act of 1974 continued this denial of nondiscriminatory status to communist countries, except Poland and Yugoslavia. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies NTR status to countries that restrict freedom of emigration, which can be lifted if the President determines compliance with emigration conditions. The Jackson-Vanik amendment requires countries to comply with freedom-of-emigration conditions to receive NTR status. Congress can use this law to address various economic and political issues. Removal of restrictions requires legislative action. Czechoslovakia's GATT status was suspended in 1951 due to communism. The United States invoked the non-application provision to suspend MFN treatment for Romania and Hungary when they became GATT signatories in 1971 and 1973. Restrictions were lifted when the US granted PNTR status to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania after the fall of communist governments. PNTR was also granted to Albania, Bulgaria, and Cambodia before their WTO accession. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania did not require the non-application provision. Mongolia joined the WTO before receiving PNTR from the US. The United States invoked the non-application provision with various countries before granting them PNTR status, including Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Vietnam. PNTR was also granted to Mongolia, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia with the condition that it would enable the US to avail itself of all rights within the WTO regarding those countries. Moldova and Russia were also subject to the non-application provision before receiving PNTR status. China, as with other communist countries, was also subject to these provisions. China was granted conditional MFN status under the Jackson-Vanik amendment in October 1979. It acceded to the WTO on December 11, 2001. Legislation (P.L. 106-286) removed the Jackson-Vanik requirement for U.S. trade with China, allowing the President to grant PNTR on January 1, 2002. PNTR was linked to U.S. acceptance of conditions for China's WTO accession. The bilateral agreement between the United States and China, part of China's WTO accession process, includes special safeguard procedures for market disruption, antidumping measures, and a commission to monitor human rights. Several countries subject to restrictions have applied for WTO membership, including Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Congress has a role in the WTO accession process through the repeal of Title IV, giving leverage on negotiation conditions. Congress can choose to repeal restrictions before countries join the WTO, allowing the US to meet MFN requirements. Many countries affected by Title IV view the requirements as a barrier to WTO accession. Many countries affected by Title IV restrictions see them as outdated Cold War relics that do not apply to their current emigration policies. They argue for unconditional removal of these restrictions to be treated as normal trade partners. Another option is for Congress to tie granting PNTR to WTO accession, similar to the model used for China. This could indirectly define the conditions for countries entering the WTO. The debate on PNTR for Russia included concerns about its fulfillment of WTO commitments, such as SPS standards and IPR protection. H.R. 6156 required the USTR to report annually on Russia's implementation of these commitments to Congress. The USTR and Secretary of State report annually on actions to enforce Russia's WTO commitments and promote the rule of law. The Secretary of Commerce takes measures against bribery and corruption in Russia. USTR includes information on U.S. digital trade barriers in its annual report. Congress has the option to not repeal Title IV, sending a strong message to Russia. The United States has the option to not repeal Title IV, which would signal concerns or discontent with a partner country's policies without blocking its entry into the WTO. However, this would require invoking the non-applicability provision and would mean the U.S. and the partner country are not bound by WTO rules in their trade relations. Congress must weigh the costs and benefits of each option and consider the implications for U.S. trade relationships with different countries. The 113th Congress may need to extend PNTR to two countries, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, as they join the WTO. Both countries are currently under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. How Congress treats these countries could impact U.S. relations with them."
