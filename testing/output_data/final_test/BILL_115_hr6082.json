The Act \"Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act\" amends sections of the Public Health Service Act to replace \"substance abuse\" with \"substance use disorder\" and allows disclosures to covered entities in accordance with HIPAA regulations for treatment purposes. The Act \"Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act to allow disclosures of de-identified health information to public health authorities, as long as it meets specified standards. Definitions for \"covered entity\" are also provided in accordance with HIPAA privacy regulations. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to HIPAA privacy regulation, including health care operations, individually identifiable health information, payment, and public health authority. These definitions are important for understanding the regulations outlined in the Act \"Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act.\" The curr_chunk amends the Public Health Service Act regarding the use of records in criminal, civil, or administrative contexts.

This aligns with restrictions on the use of patient records without consent or court authorization in agency proceedings and law enforcement purposes. The curr_chunk adds antidiscrimination provisions to the Public Health Service Act, prohibiting entities from discriminating based on information received through disclosures. This includes discrimination in healthcare, employment, housing, and access to courts. Recipients of federal funds are also prohibited from discriminating based on disclosed information. The curr_chunk amends the Public Health Service Act to include notification requirements in case of a breach of records, applying HITECH Act provisions to programs or activities described in the Act. The curr_chunk discusses the sense of Congress regarding accessing State-based prescription drug monitoring programs for patients in programs covered by confidentiality requirements. It also mentions the Secretary of Health and Human Services making necessary regulatory revisions for implementing the amendments made by this section. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must update regulations within a year to ensure covered entities provide easily understandable privacy practice notices for patient records. This includes a statement of patient rights and how to exercise them. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with experts, must identify model training programs and materials for Substance Use Disorder Patient Records within one year of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must identify model training programs and materials for Substance Use Disorder Patient Records within one year of the Act's enactment. If no such programs exist, private or public entities can develop and disseminate them for healthcare providers. The Secretary must identify model training programs and materials for Substance Use Disorder Patient Records within one year of the Act's enactment. These programs should address the disclosure of patient records to facilitate communication between treatment providers and other healthcare entities. The Secretary will periodically review and update model programs and materials for Substance Use Disorder Patient Records to promote integrated care, prevent inappropriate prescribing, and involve families in case of overdose. When updating model programs and materials for Substance Use Disorder Patient Records, the Secretary must seek input from relevant stakeholders. This Act does not limit a patient's right to request restrictions on record use or a covered entity's choice to obtain consent for record disclosure. Patients have the right to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of their records for treatment, payment, or health care operations, and covered entities should make reasonable efforts to comply with these requests. The House of Representatives passed the document on June 20, 2018, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
