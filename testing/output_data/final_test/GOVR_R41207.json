    "content": "The unauthorized immigrant population in the United States is a controversial issue that has hindered comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the past. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for administering and enforcing immigration law, with USCIS handling adjudications, ICE enforcing immigration law, and CBP securing U.S. borders. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for securing U.S. borders and estimating the unauthorized immigrant population using survey data. DHS and Pew Research Center regularly publish estimates of the unauthorized resident population, with DHS estimating 11.5 million in January 2011 and 11.4 million in January 2012. The Department of Homeland Security estimated the unauthorized resident population at 11.5 million in 2011 and 11.7 million in March 2012. Both DHS and Pew Research Center reported a peak in unauthorized population in 2007, with a decrease between 2007 and 2009. The trend in population size since 2009 is uncertain. Unauthorized aliens enter the U.S. through valid nonimmigrant visas, fraudulent documents, or border-crossing cards. Recent reports from DHS's Office of Immigration Statistics and the Pew Research Center analyze the demographics of the unauthorized resident population in the U.S., shedding light on how individuals enter the country, either through valid means, fraudulent documents, or illegal border crossings. In 2006, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that 40% to 50% of unauthorized immigrants entered with inspection, while the rest entered without inspection. The exact percentages of how individuals entered the U.S. in recent years remain unknown. Table 1 shows the breakdown of the unauthorized resident population in the U.S. in 2012 by period of arrival, with over half entering between 1995 and 2004. Mexico was the main source country, with 6.7 million unauthorized immigrants in early 2012, representing 59% of the total population at that time. These data are crucial for estimating potential beneficiaries under legalization programs with eligibility cut-off dates. In 2012, there were an estimated 6.0 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico in the U.S., accounting for 52% of the total unauthorized resident population. The Department of Homeland Security estimated a total of 8.9 million unauthorized immigrants from North America, including Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean, and Central America, in 2012. Additionally, there were 1.3 million unauthorized immigrants from Asia. Table 2 shows state-level estimates for unauthorized immigrants in the top nine states of residence in January 2012, with California having the highest number. DHS and Pew Research Center provide different estimates for California's share of the unauthorized population. The top nine states housed 70% of unauthorized immigrants in 2012, showing less geographic concentration compared to previous years. Demographers analyzed the gender and age of unauthorized immigrants in the US in January 2012 and March 2010. DHS estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants in January 2012, with 10.3 million adults and 1.1 million children. Pew estimated 11.2 million unauthorized residents in March 2010. Majority of unauthorized immigrants were aged 25-44, with a median age of 36.2 years in 2010. These demographics have implications for labor force participation. Pew estimated 5.5 million children in the US in 2010 with at least one unauthorized parent, 1.0 million were unauthorized aliens. There were at least 9 million people living in mixed-status families in the US in 2010. These demographic data may be useful in addressing the unauthorized population. The data on living arrangements and mixed-status families suggest that strategies focused on unauthorized aliens will impact family members, including U.S. citizen children. Pew estimated 8.0 million unauthorized aliens in the labor force in 2010, accounting for 5.2% of the civilian labor force. High labor force participation by unauthorized immigrants has been considered in policy decisions. Some strategies to address unauthorized immigration focus on preventing unauthorized immigrants from obtaining employment and legalizing their status through guest worker programs or work history requirements for legal permanent resident status. The Immigration and Nationality Act and federal laws impose restrictions on unauthorized immigrants. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines grounds of inadmissibility for unauthorized immigrants, including health, security, and immigration law violations. INA \u00a7212(a)(6)(A) limits the ability of illegal entrants to be legally admitted to the country. The Immigration and Nationality Act restricts the legal admission of illegal entrants to the country, with exceptions for certain cases such as asylum seekers and those subjected to battery or extreme cruelty. Additionally, aliens who were previously illegally present in the US may face inadmissibility for a period of time under the 3- and 10-year bars. The Immigration and Nationality Act imposes restrictions on illegal entrants, with exceptions for asylum seekers and victims of abuse. Aliens unlawfully present in the US for over 180 days face inadmissibility for 3 years upon departure, while those present for a year or more face a 10-year bar. Certain unauthorized aliens can adjust status to LPR without triggering these bars. Grounds for deportation are outlined in INA \u00a7237(a). INA \u00a7237(a) outlines grounds for deportation from the United States, making unauthorized aliens deportable for violating immigration laws or failing to maintain nonimmigrant status. It also includes penalties for those attempting illegal entry or assisting unauthorized aliens. Under INA \u00a7275(b), aliens apprehended while entering the United States at an undesignated time or place face a civil penalty of $50 to $250 for each entry or attempted entry, with double penalties for repeat offenders. Additionally, INA \u00a7276 imposes harsher penalties, including criminal consequences, on certain aliens removed from the United States. The INA imposes stiffer penalties, including criminal consequences, for certain aliens removed from the United States who re-enter. Employers must verify work eligibility through the I-9 system and may use E-Verify. Violations may result in civil and criminal penalties, known as \"worksite enforcement.\" Despite efforts, an estimated 8.0 million unauthorized workers are in the labor force. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 restricts unauthorized aliens and certain legal aliens from receiving federal public benefits, with some exceptions. These benefits include grants, contracts, loans, professional licenses, welfare, health, housing, education, food assistance, and unemployment benefits provided by the U.S. government. The INA places restrictions on unauthorized immigrants from receiving federal public benefits, with limited exceptions for emergency services and in-kind services. Certain unauthorized immigrants can apply for relief like cancellation of removal to obtain LPR status. The Attorney General can cancel removal or adjust the status of certain nonpermanent residents in the US. To be eligible, the alien must have been physically present in the US for 10 years and show that removal would cause extreme hardship to their family. INA \u00a7245 allows certain aliens to adjust to LPR status, based on family relationships or job skills. Inspected or paroled entry is required for adjustment under INA \u00a7245(a), unless qualifying for special battered alien provisions. Certain aliens may qualify for self-petitioning under special battered alien provisions to adjust status under INA \u00a7245(a). Exceptions to lawful status requirements exist for spouses, minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens. INA \u00a7245(a) primarily benefits nonimmigrants eligible for LPR status, while INA \u00a7245(i) allows certain aliens to adjust status if they entered the U.S. without inspection or are not eligible under \u00a7245(a). The INA \u00a7245(i) provision allows certain unauthorized aliens to adjust status if they meet specific criteria, such as being the beneficiary of a family- or employment-based immigrant visa petition filed by April 30, 2001. Another option for unauthorized immigrants to obtain lawful permanent residence is through the registry provision (INA \u00a7249), which requires continuous residence in the U.S. since before January 1, 1972. The INA asylum provisions allow any alien in the United States to apply for asylum based on persecution fears. If granted, the alien can stay legally and apply for LPR status after one year. Various options aim to reduce the unauthorized resident population, falling under two categories. Many options aim to reduce the unauthorized resident population in the United States, either through encouraging departure or granting legal status. Unauthorized aliens have no legal right to live or work in the country and are subject to removal. One strategy involves ICE locating and removing them. ICE, the DHS entity responsible for immigration enforcement in the United States, conducts removal proceedings for unauthorized aliens. In FY2012, there were 255,886 non-expedited removals, typically overseen by an immigration judge. Expedited removal procedures apply to arriving aliens without proper documentation or who commit fraud. During FY2004-FY2012, non-expedited removals increased, peaking in FY2009 but still accounting for less than 3% of the estimated 10.8 million unauthorized immigrants in the US. The idea of removing all unauthorized residents was discussed in a 2007 Senate hearing, with an estimated cost of $94 billion. Myers estimated the total cost of removing unauthorized immigrants at roughly $94 billion. Some advocates of removing unauthorized immigrants propose attrition through enforcement as an alternative approach. Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies supports this strategy, which involves steady enforcement of immigration laws to reduce the illegal population over time. Attrition through enforcement involves shrinking the unauthorized alien population over time by making it harder for them to find jobs in the United States. Steven Camarota and Mark Krikorian support this strategy, with Camarota citing DHS estimates showing a decrease in unauthorized residents leaving the country. Krikorian emphasizes the importance of expanding E-Verify to deter unauthorized aliens from finding employment. Expanding E-Verify and increasing ICE enforcement are key parts of an attrition strategy to address unauthorized employment in the United States. Various bills in Congress aim to make participation in E-Verify mandatory for all employers. The Senate-passed S. 744 and the House's H.R. 1772 both aim to establish a permanent electronic eligibility verification system based on E-Verify. However, they differ in allowing electronic verification before hiring and verifying previously hired workers. Additionally, S. 744 includes provisions on immigration enforcement within the United States. The House's SAFE Act (H.R. 2278) addresses interior enforcement of immigration laws in the United States. It aims to increase criminal penalties for immigration violations and establish new grounds for inadmissibility and deportability. There are differences in approaches regarding granting benefits to unauthorized immigrants, with some advocating for legal status to benefit the economy and society. Some proposals argue for legalizing unauthorized immigrants to boost wages and spending for economic recovery. Various options have been suggested, including granting legal status through existing or new mechanisms. Similarities can be seen with past legalization programs like the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The legalization program allows eligible applicants to first obtain temporary resident status and then apply for LPR status after 18 months. To qualify for temporary status, an alien must prove continuous unlawful residence in the US since January 1, 1982, and admissibility. To adjust to LPR status, a temporary resident must meet various requirements, including continuous US residence and basic citizenship skills. Supporters refer to these programs as \"earned adjustment,\" where immigrants earn legal status through contributions to society like work or education. One way to enable some unauthorized immigrants in the United States to legalize their status would be to update the eligibility dates for existing mechanisms through which eligible aliens can obtain LPR status. Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress to extend the eligibility dates for the INA \u00a7245(i) provision and the INA registry provision. The ability to adjust status under INA \u00a7245(i) is currently limited to aliens who are beneficiaries of an immigrant visa petition or labor certification application filed by April 30, 2001, but there have been efforts to extend this date. Efforts to extend eligibility dates for INA \u00a7245(i) and INA registry provision have been ongoing. A bill to extend the filing deadline for \u00a7245(i) was close to enactment in 2001 but was halted due to the events of September 11. Currently, acquiring legal permanent residence through the INA registry provision requires continuous residence in the US since before January 1, 1972. Various bills have been introduced to advance the registry date, including proposals for a \"rolling registry date\" system. Efforts to extend eligibility dates for INA \u00a7245(i) and INA registry provision have been ongoing. Various bills have been introduced to advance the registry date, including proposals for a \"rolling registry date\" system. Two sets of immigration bills containing legalization programs for different segments of the unauthorized population have been regularly introduced in recent Congresses, focusing on agricultural workers and unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the US as children. Since the late 1990s, major immigration legislation has been regularly introduced in Congress to grant legal status to certain segments of the unauthorized population, such as agricultural workers and students. Legislation often combines H-2A reform with a legalization program for agricultural workers, known as the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act (AgJOBS). In the late 1990s, Congress introduced legislation like AgJOBS to provide legal status to certain unauthorized populations, including agricultural workers. Recent bills in the 113th Congress combine new temporary agricultural worker visas with provisions for unauthorized aliens to obtain legal status in the US. The Senate's S. 744 bill includes a two-stage legalization program for farm workers to obtain \"blue card\" status after meeting requirements. After performing agricultural work and meeting requirements, workers could apply for LPR status. The Agricultural Guestworker Act (H.R. 1773) allows unauthorized aliens to obtain temporary legal status through a new agricultural worker visa program. The DREAM Act enables eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status in the US through cancellation of removal. The DREAM Act creates a new legalization program for aliens, granting conditional legal status initially. Additional requirements must be met to become a full-fledged LPR. Immigration reform efforts in the 109th and 113th Congresses led to the passage of major bills, including a general legalization program in the Senate's bill (S. 2611) and no such provisions in the House-passed bill (H.R. 4437). In 2013, the Senate passed another immigration bill (S. 744) without reconciliation with the House. In 2013, the Senate passed a major immigration bill (S. 744) that included a general legalization program for unauthorized immigrants. Various proposals have been introduced to grant legal status to a significant portion of the unauthorized population, with applicants needing to meet specific requirements to \"get right with the law\" and earn relief. Various proposals have been introduced to grant legal status to unauthorized immigrants, with requirements such as continuous physical presence, work, fines, federal income tax payment, and basic citizenship skills demonstration. A \"back of the line\" provision is common, where eligible aliens must wait to adjust to LPR status based on visa availability. Adjustments of status under these proposals are not subject to existing numerical limitations in the INA. Recent comprehensive immigration bills have proposed two-stage legalization programs for eligible aliens, where they first apply for temporary status and then for LPR status. Different versions include applying for temporary guest worker status or temporary legal status before adjusting to LPR status under current law. Some proposals aim to provide relief to unauthorized immigrants in the US without offering a pathway to LPR status. One subset suggests granting nonimmigrant status, possibly as temporary workers, with limits on stay duration. Another subset proposes a \"quasi-legal\" status for eligible unauthorized immigrants to stay temporarily in the US without a defined legal immigration status. Some past proposals included Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status for unauthorized aliens, granting them a limited time to leave the US and seek legal admission abroad. Compliance with DMD terms would prevent inadmissibility issues, but failure to depart would result in ineligibility for immigration benefits. Addressing the unauthorized immigrant population remains a contentious issue. Addressing the unauthorized immigrant population is a key point of disagreement in immigration reform discussions. Senate-passed S. 744 proposes new legalization programs for unauthorized resident aliens to obtain LPR status. Agreement on this issue remains uncertain, whether through a legalization-focused strategy or a departure-based approach, or a combination of both."
