    "content": "The \"ILSA Enhancement and Compliance Act\" includes amendments to the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, establishing a multilateral regime for sanctions, describing the imposition and termination of sanctions, and defining key terms. Additionally, it creates the Office of Global Security Risk in the Securities and Exchange Commission, with provisions for its establishment and reporting requirements. Congress finds that Iran, North Korea, Libya, and Syria are aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction and are threats to national security. Iran has been denounced for deception regarding its nuclear program. Iran has been accused of deceptive practices in its nuclear program, including providing false information to the IAEA and attempting to cover up its activities to avoid detection. The IAEA found highly enriched uranium at Natanz, raising concerns about Iran's nuclear activities. The IAEA inspectors found significant modifications at the Kalaye Electric Company that could affect environmental sampling accuracy. Iran introduced nuclear material into its pilot centrifuge enrichment cascade at Natanz despite the Board's warning. Iran acknowledged uranium conversion experiments in the early 1990s in a letter to the IAEA. Iran has indicated the need for more time to investigate uranium conversion experiments and closed facilities. Iranian authorities stated that imported uranium was not processed or used in centrifuge tests, but some UF6 was missing. They claimed the decision to start a centrifuge enrichment program was made in 1985, receiving centrifuge drawings in 1987 through a foreign intermediary. The Iranian authorities outlined the three phases of their nuclear program, with activities at different locations in Tehran. In a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2003, Iran mentioned past cooperation in laser technology that did not materialize. In 2003, Britain, France, and Germany offered technology to Iran in exchange for halting its nuclear fuel enrichment program and accepting more intrusive UN inspections, despite US opposition. European oil investments have significantly boosted Iran's economy, with $20 billion in oil agreements signed with the EU since 1995. Since 1995, European countries like France, Germany, and Britain have been actively investing in Iran's oil fields and seeking to increase exports to Iran. European banks have provided significant loans and export insurance to support these investments. Additionally, there have been efforts to pursue a European Union-Iran trade pact. Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, John S. Wolf, testified in 2003 about international relations with Iran. Relations of the Senate in 2003 indicated that Libya has crossed the nuclear threshold and is seeking nuclear weapons capabilities, despite being a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Director of Central Intelligence stated that Libya intends to reestablish its offensive chemical weapons capability and has produced chemical agents. Libya has a history of using chemical weapons, as seen in 1987 against Chad. Libya has used missiles and aircraft in combat, including firing SCUD missiles at an Italian island in 1987. The country may be capable of producing small quantities of biological agents and continues to seek ballistic missile delivery systems for chemical or nuclear warfare. With the suspension of UN sanctions, Libya's ability to acquire biological-related equipment and expertise will increase. Kadish expressed concerns about Libya's efforts to acquire long-range missile capability due to their financial resources, stating that the Missile Defense Agency is particularly worried about this.
