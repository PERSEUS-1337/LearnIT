    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trisomy 21 Research Resource Act of 2011\". The Congress findings state that Dr. Jerome Lejeune discovered the extra chromosome 21 responsible for Down syndrome in 1959, opening new doors in genetics. Down syndrome, named after Dr. John Langdon Down, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disabilities, occurring in one out of 691 live births. Down syndrome is a genetic condition caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to intellectual disabilities and increased susceptibility to certain diseases. This condition affects adaptive behavior and lasts a lifetime. Down syndrome may offer protection against common diseases like atherosclerosis, hypertension, and various tumors. Research on Down syndrome could lead to new treatments for widespread illnesses. Lead researcher Dr. Bill Mobely emphasizes the potential benefits of studying individuals with Down syndrome. Over 400,000 people in the US have Down syndrome, with incidence increasing with maternal age. Life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome is also mentioned. Life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome has increased significantly in recent decades, varying across ethnic groups. People with Down syndrome are active in school, work, decision-making, and contribute meaningfully to society. The Children's Health Act of 2000 addressed research needs for various disabilities but did not adequately cover Down syndrome, hindering progress in this area. The Children's Health Act of 2000 did not adequately cover Down syndrome research, hindering progress in the field. The new Act aims to include Down syndrome in research and surveillance at NIH and CDC to improve understanding of the condition. The Children's Health Act of 2000 did not cover Down syndrome research well. The new Act aims to include Down syndrome in research at NIH and CDC to improve understanding of the condition. SEC. 409K adds Down syndrome research activities to the Public Health Service Act. The Children's Health Act of 2000 did not cover Down syndrome research well. The new Act aims to include Down syndrome in research at NIH and CDC to improve understanding of the condition. SEC. 409K adds Down syndrome research activities to the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH will expand and intensify research programs on Down syndrome in coordination with relevant institutes, centers, offices, and agencies of the National Institutes of Health. A Research Plan on Down Syndrome will be published and updated every five years. The Children's Health Act of 2000 lacked coverage for Down syndrome research. The new Act includes Down syndrome in NIH and CDC research to enhance understanding. SEC. 409K adds Down syndrome research activities to the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH will conduct basic, clinical, and translational research on Down syndrome, focusing on early detection, biological mechanisms, and treatment. The new Act includes Down syndrome in NIH and CDC research to enhance understanding. Research areas include interventions to enhance cognition, treatments for associated medical disorders, developmental disorders, genetic contributions to clinical presentation, and biomarker identification. Noninvasive imaging is used to identify genotypes and phenotypes of Down syndrome. Research areas for Down syndrome include identifying genotypes and phenotypes, pharmacological therapies for common features like Alzheimer's disease, improving quality of life for individuals and families, and research training programs. Additionally, there is a proposal for a contact registry for individuals with Down syndrome to facilitate research resources. A contact registry for individuals with Down syndrome is proposed to identify and collect names and contact information nationwide, with consent required for information collection and maintenance. The Director of NIH may establish a research database for Down syndrome individuals, including names, contact information, and medical conditions, searchable by category, and exclusively used for research purposes. The Director of NIH may expand tissue banks to include tissue from donors with Down syndrome, with consent required for inclusion in the Research Database for Down Syndrome. The Director of NIH may collect and maintain information about an individual's medical condition only with their consent. In carrying out this paragraph, the Director of NIH may utilize research resources subject to consent requirements. The Director of NIH may collect information on individuals' medical conditions with consent, utilizing research resources. The NIH should consider other research resources, promote research on therapies for individuals with Down syndrome, and encourage their inclusion in clinical trials. The Director of NIH may establish a consortium to enhance research on Down syndrome by facilitating information exchange and collaboration among partner agencies, organizations, and individuals. The consortium aims to streamline communication, minimize duplication of efforts, and integrate diverse perspectives to make the research more efficient and effective. SEC. 4. CDC DOWN SYNDROME SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include a new program for Down syndrome surveillance and research. The Secretary may award grants for data collection on Down syndrome and establish a National Down Syndrome Epidemiology Program through the CDC. The Secretary may award grants for data collection on Down syndrome and establish a National Down Syndrome Epidemiology Program through the CDC, including national surveillance and coordination with the National Institutes of Health. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, regarding the implementation of the Act and its amendments."
