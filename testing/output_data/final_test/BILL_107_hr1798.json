    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Patient Access to Preventive and Diagnostic Tests Act\" establishes coding and payment procedures for new clinical diagnostic laboratory tests under Medicare. The Secretary will establish payment procedures for new lab tests with new HCPCS codes under the Medicare Act. The Secretary will determine the payment amount for new lab tests with new HCPCS codes only after completing the process outlined in subparagraph (B). This includes making a list of tests being considered for payment amounts available to the public and publishing a notice in the Federal Register on the same day. The Secretary will convene a meeting to receive comments and recommendations from the public on establishing payment amounts for new lab tests with new HCPCS codes, involving representatives of all entities within HCFA. The Secretary convenes a meeting to gather input on setting payment amounts for new lab tests with HCPCS codes, involving various stakeholders and making meeting minutes public within 15 days. The Secretary develops a list of proposed determinations for payment amounts for new lab tests, based on comments received at a public meeting, and publishes it for public review. A public meeting is announced in the Federal Register to gather further comments and recommendations on the proposed determinations. The Secretary convenes a meeting to receive public comments and recommendations on proposed determinations, makes a transcript of the meeting available to the public, and develops a final list based on feedback received. The Secretary establishes procedures for determining payment amounts for new tests based on specific criteria and feedback from the public. The Secretary establishes procedures for determining payment amounts for new tests based on specific criteria and feedback from the public. The procedures require making data available to the public, allowing for administrative reviews of adverse determinations, and revising determinations based on review results. The Secretary establishes procedures for determining payment amounts for new tests based on specific criteria and feedback from the public. The term 'HCPCS' refers to the Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System. A code is considered 'substantially revised' if there is a substantive change to the definition of the test or procedure it applies to. If a new test is clinically similar to one with an established fee schedule amount, the Secretary will pay the same fee schedule amount for the new test. The Secretary will pay the same fee schedule amount for a new test if it is clinically similar to a test with an established fee schedule. If the new test is not clinically similar, payment will be based on the lesser of the actual charge or a percentage of the prevailing charge level. The fee schedule amount for a new test is determined based on specific criteria until sufficient claims data is available to establish a fee schedule amount. The fee schedule amount for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test described in clause (i) is determined based on specific criteria, with adjustments made annually. The national limitation amount for a test is set at 100 percent of the median payment amounts for all payment localities in the last calendar year. The Secretary can apply comparability provisions to amounts determined under this clause. The Secretary shall set the fee schedule amount for a test at 100 percent of the median payment amounts for all payment localities in the last calendar year, with comparability provisions applicable. The fee schedule amount for a test is set at the national limitation amount for 2001, adjusted annually. Changes are made to the Social Security Act to reflect these adjustments. The Secretary shall establish a mechanism for reviewing the adequacy of payment amounts for specific tests under the Social Security Act. Interested parties can request a timely review, and the Secretary may not delegate this authority. The Secretary may not delegate the authority to make determinations on clinical diagnostic laboratory tests and must base decisions on data from affected payment localities and all sites of care. Undue weight on prevailing charge levels for any one type of entity is prohibited. The Secretary cannot assign a new code for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test that results in lower payment solely based on the test being able to be performed by a laboratory with a certificate of waiver. Effective dates for implementing certain procedures are to be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Social Security Act amendments require implementation by October 1, 2001. The amendments on inherent reasonableness and code assignment apply to determinations made after the enactment of the Act."
