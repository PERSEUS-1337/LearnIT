    "content": "The refined coal credit is being modified to include qualified coal waste sludge recycling. The refined coal credit under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include solid fuel produced from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process. The refined coal credit under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes solid fuel produced from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process. A qualified coal waste sludge recycling facility must be in place and functioning to process coal with coal waste sludge to be eligible for the credit. The refined coal credit under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes solid fuel produced from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process. A credit of $3.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent is allowed for refined coal from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process. The refined coal credit now includes solid fuel from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process. A credit of $3.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent is allowed for refined coal sold to an unrelated person during a specific period. The refined coal credit now includes solid fuel from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process, with a credit of $3.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent allowed for refined coal sold to an unrelated person during a specific period. The definition of a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process is clarified for this section. The recycling process involves liquefying coal waste sludge to create a feedstock for coke manufacturing. Coal waste sludge includes tar decanter sludge and byproducts of the coking process. The process converts hazardous waste into a usable feedstock for coke production. The process liquefies coal waste sludge to distribute as feedstock for coke manufacturing. Excess liquefied coal waste sludge can harm coke battery operations. Coal waste sludge has an energy content of 7,000 to 16,000 Btus per pound. Selling refined coal from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process entitles the seller to a credit under this section. The credit is available even if the refined coal is purchased for use as a feedstock for coke by a taxpayer who has previously claimed credits for coke production. Rules for taxpayers producing coke or coke gas from refined coal are outlined in section 45K(h). The amendment to section 45K of the Code specifies that no credit will be allowed for coke or coke gas produced from refined coal from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process if credits have already been claimed under section 45. Taxpayers can still claim the credit for coke or coke gas produced from feedstocks without a refined coal credit. The amendments made by this Act govern the interaction of section 45 and apply to taxpayers producing refined coal from a qualified coal waste sludge recycling process. Effective Date: The amendments apply to refined coal produced after the date of enactment of this Act."
