    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reporting on Influence and Subversion by the Kremlin Act\" or \"RISK Act\". The Congress found in 1986 that the Soviet Union and its proxies were actively trying to influence world opinion and discredit the U.S. Since then, active measures by the Russian Federation have continued without diminishing. The Russian Federation continues to deploy military, cyber, intelligence, and economic tactics to weaken US democratic institutions and challenge the international liberal order. The Director of National Intelligence concluded that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election were part of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the illegal occupation of Crimea and invasion of Georgia. The Russian military, heavily invested in by Putin, continues aggressive acts against US allies in Europe, undermining trust in democratic systems. The Russian Federation's subversive activities are being assessed. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing subversive activities by the Russian Federation. The assessment will be conducted by an independent entity with expertise in diplomatic and military developments in Europe and Russia, using previous studies as needed. The assessment obtained for purposes of subsection (a) shall include an assessment of disinformation and propaganda activities of the Russian Federation, including support for such activities, the structure of the Russian Government's disinformation apparatus, and propaganda techniques used. An assessment of Russian support for separatist activities, cyber intrusions, energy exports for coercion, and democratic deterioration in the Russian Federation. The report required under subsection (a) will detail conditions in the Russian Federation, including suppression of freedom of the press, detention, beating, and murder of political activists, suppression of minority rights, suppression of human rights, and efforts to undermine Russian nongovernmental organizations and civil society. It will be submitted in unclassified form, with the possibility of a classified annex. SEC. 4. COUNTERING RUSSIAN INFLUENCE FUND. The President can establish the Countering Russian Influence Fund in the Department of the Treasury. The Fund will consist of appropriated amounts and funds available to the Secretary of State. It aims to provide bilateral assistance to countries in Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia to counter Russian activities like disinformation, propaganda, and election interference. The Countering Russian Influence Fund in the Department of the Treasury aims to counter Russian activities like election interference and financial transparency. Funds can be used by civil society organizations for public awareness campaigns. $100,000,000 is authorized for this purpose, in addition to other bilateral assistance funds for countries in Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia.
