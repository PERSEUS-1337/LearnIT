Congress finds that Iran has engaged in illicit activities to acquire nuclear weapons capability and has provided support to terrorist groups. Iran already possesses enough enriched uranium to produce nuclear weapons and has advanced nuclear facilities and technology. Iran has advanced nuclear facilities and technology for weapons-grade enrichment and long-range ballistic weapons. Iran has been found non-compliant with its safeguards agreement by the IAEA since 2005, and the UNSC has issued resolutions demanding suspension of uranium enrichment activities. The UNSC adopted resolutions demanding Iran suspend its enrichment program and comply with IAEA requirements to address concerns about the possible military use of its nuclear activities. The UNSC adopted resolutions urging Iran to halt its enrichment program and comply with IAEA demands to ensure the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. Subsequent resolutions reiterated these calls for Iran to cooperate with international efforts to verify its nuclear intentions. The UNSC adopted resolutions urging Iran to comply with IAEA efforts to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. Congress passed legislation imposing sanctions on Iran to pressure them to abandon nuclear weapons pursuit and support for terrorism. The Department of State has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and characterized it as the most active sponsor of terrorism. President Obama has expressed determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, stating that all options are on the table. He emphasized a policy of prevention, not containment, towards Iran's nuclear ambitions. The President also warned Iran that time is running out to meet international demands. Iran's newly elected President, Hassan Rouhani, has a history of involvement in Iran's nuclear program. In a leaked 2004 speech, Rouhani admitted to using negotiations with Europeans as a tactic to buy time for Iran's nuclear advancements. Since Barack Obama became President, Iran has significantly increased its nuclear capabilities, including tripling the number of operating centrifuges to 15,000 and expanding enrichment facilities. Iran has also continued constructing a heavy water reactor for plutonium production, indicating its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Iran's nuclear capabilities pose a grave threat to regional stability, world peace, and the national security interests of the United States and its allies. A nuclear weapons-capable Iran could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in nearby powers, increasing the risk of regional nuclear confrontation. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.\" is a condensed summary of the previous paragraph which highlighted the threat posed by Iran's nuclear capabilities to regional stability and national security interests. (a) Statement of Policy.--Congress aims to ensure Iran halts all uranium enrichment, identifies enrichment sites, removes enriched uranium to a third party, closes the Fordow facility, stops developing plutonium reactors, and halts centrifuge activities. It is the sense of Congress that if Iran meets specified objectives, the US will pursue a negotiated settlement on nuclear activities in Iran, including commitments to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, ceasing ballistic weapon development, and allowing IAEA access. Iran must allow IAEA inspections, stop supporting terrorist groups, demonstrate peaceful foreign policy, recognize neighbors' sovereignty, and cease threats against the US and Israel. SEC. 4. MILITARY READINESS AND CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT. Congress declares the US is prepared to use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. To maximize diplomatic leverage, the President can take action if Iran is using diplomacy to advance its nuclear program. Congress acknowledges the need for swift action to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and authorizes the use of force against legitimate targets in Iran if necessary. The key objectives regarding Iran's nuclear program are to uphold relevant UN Security Council resolutions, deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons to protect US national security and allies, and degrade Iran's capacity for future weapon development. SEC. 5. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO IRAN. Authorization for Imposition of Sanctions allows the President to prohibit businesses that continue to deal with Iran from receiving US government contracts or accessing US capital markets. For foreign financial institutions, the President can also restrict the opening or maintaining of accounts in the US. The term \"Iran\" refers to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including its central bank and any agencies or instrumentalities. An \"Iranian-controlled entity\" is defined as an organization in which the Government of Iran holds more than 50 percent of the equity interest or a majority of seats on the board of directors. An \"Iranian-controlled entity\" is an organization where the Government of Iran holds more than 50 percent of the equity interest or a majority of seats on the board of directors. The entity is controlled by the government through its directors or by influencing actions, policies, or personnel decisions."
