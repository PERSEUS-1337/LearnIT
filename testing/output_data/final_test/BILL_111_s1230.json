The Home Buyer Tax Credit Act of 2009 allows a 10% credit on the purchase price of a principal residence, not exceeding $15,000.

The Home Buyer Tax Credit Act of 2009 allows a 10% credit on the purchase price of a principal residence, not exceeding $15,000. If a credit is allowed for a principal residence purchase, no credit is allowed for another residence purchase in the same year. Joint purchases by unmarried or separately filing married individuals disqualify them from the credit if any individual has already claimed it for another residence purchase. The Home Buyer Tax Credit Act of 2009 offers a 10% credit on the purchase price of a principal residence, capped at $15,000. The term \"principal residence\" is defined as in section 121.

The Home Buyer Tax Credit Act of 2009 allows a 10% credit on the purchase price of a principal residence, with a cap of $15,000. The credit allocation among individuals is determined by the Secretary, with rules similar to section 1400C(e) for defining the purchase. Rules for reporting requirements and recapture of credit in certain dispositions also apply. If the taxpayer disposes of or fails to occupy their principal residence within 24 months of purchase, the tax for that year will increase by the amount of the credit received. Exceptions include the taxpayer's death or involuntary conversion of the residence. If a taxpayer acquires a new principal residence within 2 years of disposing of their current residence, certain tax provisions may not apply. This exception also applies to transfers between spouses or incident to divorce under section 1041(a). For transfers between spouses or incident to divorce, certain tax provisions may not apply if a new principal residence is acquired within 2 years. In cases of joint returns, half of the credit allowed will be attributed to each individual. Members of the Armed Forces on active duty moving due to military orders are exempt from certain tax provisions. The tax return requirement is increased under this subsection, requiring the taxpayer to file a return for the taxes imposed. A credit allowed for the purchase of a residence will reduce the basis of the residence. A taxpayer can elect to treat a purchase of a principal residence as made on December 31, 2009, for tax purposes. (b) Conforming Amendments: Various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are amended to include references to section 25E. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item after section 25D. The Home Buyer Tax Credit Act of 2009 amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the first-time homebuyer credit deadline and allows for the election to treat purchases in the prior year. The effective date for these amendments applies to purchases after the enactment of the Act."
