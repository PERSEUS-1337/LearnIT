The Congress finds that Fort Presque Isle was a frontier outpost in Erie, Pennsylvania, built in 1795-1796 and during the War of 1812. General Anthony Wayne, a Revolutionary War hero, was known for his leadership and bravery. Legend has it that he was nicknamed \"Mad\" by his troops. Fort Presque Isle's original blockhouse was built in 1795 by 200 Federal troops under Captain John Grubb to counter Native American uprisings. General Anthony Wayne died at the fort in 1796 and was buried there. The existing blockhouse was built in 1880 as a memorial. The section establishes the Fort Presque Isle National Historic Site to reconstruct the frontier fort, preserve General Anthony Wayne's grave site, and enhance understanding of its historical significance. The Fort Presque Isle National Historic Site in Erie, Pennsylvania is established to preserve the historic location of Fort Presque Isle, including a blockhouse replica. The site comprises approximately ________ acres and a map with boundary description is available for public inspection.
