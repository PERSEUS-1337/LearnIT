    "content": "The federal budget process involves both Congress and the executive branch, with the Constitution outlining the roles of each. Impoundment, a practice where the President withholds or delays spending funds provided by law, has been a part of budget implementation since the 19th century. While past Presidents sought accommodation with Congress, the Nixon Administration saw impoundment escalate into a major conflict involving the courts and Congress. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and its amendments in 1987 established a framework for handling rescissions, involving Congress and the President in major conflicts. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 briefly allowed for spending reductions proposed by President George W. Bush. The report reviews data on rescission requests and outcomes, comparing administrations and concluding with observations on the budget process. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established deferrals and rescissions for budget authority, with reporting requirements for the President to inform Congress of proposed actions. Reporting duties were later transferred to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established procedures for deferrals and rescissions of budget authority, requiring the President to report proposed actions to Congress. The Comptroller General oversees executive compliance and reports to Congress if necessary. Congressional review and control differ for rescissions and deferrals, with funds needing approval within 45 days of continuous session. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established procedures for deferrals and rescissions of budget authority, requiring the President to report proposed actions to Congress. Funds proposed for rescission not approved by Congress become available for obligation after about 60 calendar days. Congress may alter the amount proposed for rescission by the President and has expedited procedures for congressional action on any rescission bill introduced with respect to a special message submitted by the President. In 1987, Congress enacted budget process reforms, including eliminating presidential deferrals for policy reasons. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established procedures for deferrals and rescissions of budget authority. Section 207 prohibits the practice of resubmitting identical or similar rescission proposals after Congress fails to act within 45 days. This prohibition applies for the duration of the appropriation, potentially spanning multiple fiscal years. The Act has been in effect for over 35 years. The Impoundment Control Act, in effect for over 35 years, allows Congress to recapture influence over impoundment of funds. Congress tends to approve rescission requests in appropriations measures rather than individual bills. If Congress does not act on a rescission request within 45 days, the funds must be released, although action often occurs after the deadline. Congressional action on rescission requests often occurs after the 45-day review period, creating ambiguities in interpreting data on proposed rescissions. Congress may approve more or less than the President's request, and can also initiate rescission actions on its own. This can result in funds being available for obligation before being permanently rescinded, leading to questions on whether it is considered as \"congressional approval\" or a \"rescission initiated by Congress.\" Data in Table 2 shows the outcome of rescission requests by Presidents since 1974, with percentages of requests approved by Congress. President Ford attempted to rescind funding added by Congress to his budget, mainly for domestic social programs, with limited success. President Ford's rescission proposals were seen as a new source of authority for withholding funds, with 34% accepted by Congress. However, he had less overall success (16%) than his successors. In contrast, President Carter, with the same party controlling both Houses of Congress and the White House, had fewer rescission requests but higher approval rates. President Carter's reluctance to propose rescissions was noted by Allen Schick, with 90% involving defense programs like the B-1 bomber. President George W. Bush did not submit any rescission requests during his administration, despite Republican control of Congress. Comparisons are generally made to the Ford through Clinton administrations, with the decline in rescission requests during Carter's presidency. During President Reagan's administration, there was a significant increase in rescission requests, with the largest number occurring in 1985. The approval rate for these requests was 36%, with a focus on domestic program cuts rather than targeted terminations. During President Reagan's administration, there was a significant increase in rescission requests, with an approval rate of slightly over a third. However, there were substantial differences in approval rates from year to year. President Reagan was successful in obtaining congressional approval for almost 70% of his requested rescissions in fiscal years 1981-1982, but faced challenges in fiscal years 1983-87 when Congress approved less than 2% of the value of his requests. The absence of rescission requests in FY1988 was due to a compromise agreement announced in November 1987, resulting from a \"Budget Summit\" between the White House and Congress. President Reagan did not submit formal rescission requests for fiscal 1988 but identified \"wasteful items\" in a message to Congress, asking for a review and possible repeal of these provisions. He reserved the option to propose formal rescissions or reallocate funds for more worthwhile purposes at a later date. President Reagan refrained from using the rescission mechanism temporarily, but before leaving office in 1989, he proposed six new rescission packages for FY1989. The George H.W. Bush administration had a lower approval rating for rescission requests compared to Reagan, with only 20% of total dollars requested approved. In 1992, rescissions became a controversial political issue during Bush's presidency, with 128 requests totaling $7.9 billion made in the first four months of the year. In 1992, President Bush requested $7.9 billion in rescissions, targeting Defense Department programs and small earmarked projects added by Congress. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees created alternative packages, leading to a $8.2 billion rescission law signed on June 4, 1992. Only $1.7 billion of the defense funds came from programs the Administration wanted to rescind. The Clinton Administration had a high success rate with rescission proposals, with 67% accepted and 54% of total dollar amounts approved by Congress. President Clinton achieved his greatest success in FY1995, when Congress was controlled by the opposition party. President Clinton had a lower number of rescission requests per year compared to his predecessors. He ranked second in average rescissions per year, with President Reagan submitting the most in total. The Clinton Administration had a high success rate with rescission proposals, especially in FY1995 when Congress was controlled by the opposition party. During the Ford Administration, most rescissions were initiated by Congress, while President Carter and President Reagan saw a shift towards more presidential proposals. The number and dollar amount of rescission requests have varied widely over the 35 years under the Impoundment Control Act. In the 35 years under the Impoundment Control Act, rescission requests have fluctuated widely. President Clinton had the most success in 1995 with 86% of proposals approved, but none were approved in 2000. Rescissions invite conflict between the President and Congress, as they imply Congress erred and wasted funds. The number of congressionally initiated rescissions increased significantly by the end of FY1992. During the period from 1974-1992, there was a significant increase in congressionally initiated rescissions. Over $107.7 billion was rescinded, with over 80% coming from Congress. The use of rescissions as a budgetary tool evolved, with Congress approving about a third of Presidential requests and initiating over 300 rescissions. Milton Socolar noted a shift in the debate from whether to cut to where to cut, as Congress embraced more reductions than proposed by Presidents. Since 1974, there has been a shift in the use of rescissions as a budgetary tool, with Congress initiating over 80% of the total rescinded amount. The focus has moved from deciding whether to cut to deciding where to cut, reflecting a change in priorities rather than a reduction in total spending. The proportion of enacted rescissions initiated by Congress has continued to increase, with over 99% originating from Congress in FY1997 and FY1998. Since FY2000, all rescissions enacted have been congressionally initiated. President George W. Bush and President Obama did not submit any rescission requests to Congress. The growth of rescissions initiated by Congress may be linked to limits on discretionary spending from the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. Congress includes rescission provisions in appropriations measures to reallocate funds without breaching spending caps. President Clinton briefly had authority to rescind funds under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, while President George W. Bush did not request any rescissions. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 gave the President enhanced rescission authority to cancel certain items in appropriations, entitlement measures, and tax breaks. The President could cancel discretionary budget authority, new direct spending, or limited tax benefits in a bill signed into law, with the cancellation taking effect upon special notification to Congress. \"Cancellation\" meant preventing provisions from having legal force unless Congress reversed the action. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President the authority to cancel certain items in appropriations, entitlement measures, and tax breaks. The cancellation would only take effect if Congress did not reverse the action by enacting a \"disapproval bill.\" The President had to determine that the cancellation would reduce the federal budget deficit without impairing essential government functions or harming the national interest. Congress had 30 days to consider disapproval bills to reverse the cancellations. A 2/3 majority in both the House and Senate would be needed to override the President's veto of the disapproval bill. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President authority to cancel certain items in appropriations, entitlement measures, and tax breaks. Congress had 30 days to consider disapproval bills to reverse the cancellations, requiring a 2/3 majority in both the House and Senate to override the President's veto. President Clinton exercised this new veto authority by cancelling tax benefit provisions and direct spending items in various acts. President Clinton utilized the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to cancel multiple projects in various appropriations acts in FY1997. He vetoed a total of 82 cancellations across different departments, including the Department of Defense, Treasury, Energy, Water, VA/HUD, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce-Justice-State. President Clinton issued 11 special messages with 82 cancellations under the Line Item Veto Act. However, 38 cancellations in the Military Construction Appropriations bill were rejected by Congress. A District Court judge reinstated a provision in the Treasury bill for federal employees to switch pension plans. The Supreme Court overturned the LIVA in June 1998, leaving 43 cancellations in effect. President Clinton's cancellations in FY1998 amounted to about $355 million, with a net budgetary effect of $325 million after overturned cancellations. In FY1998, President Clinton's cancellations totaled about $355 million, with a net budgetary effect of $325 million after 39 cancellations were overturned. CBO estimated total savings over a five-year period from the cancellations as less than $600 million. Data for FY1998 from rescission requests under the Impoundment Control Act and cancellation actions under the Line Item Veto Act are presented in Table 4, showing larger combined totals impacting the broader picture of data over three decades. The data from FY1998 shows President Clinton's cancellations totaling $355 million, with a net budgetary effect of $325 million after 39 cancellations were overturned. The percentage of the President's proposals accepted by Congress drops slightly when including LIVA cancellations, but the combined total dollar amount accepted by Congress sets a new high of 90%. Comparing figures across administrations, the addition of LIVA data increases the percentage of total dollar amount requested and approved by Congress to 56%. President Bush did not submit any formal rescission requests under the ICA during his Administration. President Bush did not submit any formal rescission requests under the ICA during his Administration. However, controversy arose over his calls for \"cancellation\" of certain funds. In October 2005, he sent a $2.3 billion rescission package to Congress, aiming to reduce unnecessary spending and redirect funds for hurricane recovery efforts. OMB Director Joshua Bolten clarified that the proposed rescissions targeted unspent balances in federal programs deemed low priority or unnecessary. In October 2005, President Bush proposed a $2.3 billion rescission package to Congress to reduce unnecessary spending and redirect funds for hurricane recovery efforts. Congress approved $400 million of the proposed cancellations. The Comptroller General contacted agencies affected by the proposal, identifying instances where over $470 million was withheld in response. In response to President Bush's proposed $2.3 billion rescission package, Congress approved $400 million in cancellations. The Comptroller General found that agencies had withheld over $470 million in anticipation of possible rescissions, violating the Impoundment Control Act. An OMB memorandum clarified the distinction between proposed cancellations and rescission requests. The President's proposed rescission package was approved by Congress, with $400 million in cancellations. Agencies had withheld over $470 million in anticipation of possible rescissions, violating the Impoundment Control Act. The OMB clarified the difference between proposed cancellations and rescission requests under the ICA. The revised OMB Circular A-11 reiterated the distinctions between rescissions and cancellation proposals in the budget process. GAO found that agencies were not improperly withholding funds proposed for cancellation in the President's FY2007 budget submission. In response to a request from the Senate Appropriations Committee, GAO identified proposed cancellations in the FY2007 Budget affecting 40 programs. Only one instance of funds being mistakenly withheld was found, which were released after GAO's inquiry. The George W. Bush Administration did not provide a public explanation for choosing cancellations over formal rescissions under the ICA. President Bush was hesitant to use existing rescission authority, preferring enactment of a different approach. President Bush sought greater authority to reject spending items through a proposed bill titled the \"Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006.\" The bill aimed to amend the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to allow expedited rescissions, requiring a vote on canceling certain spending or tax provisions. Despite the lack of use of current rescission authority, the bill faced criticism for not being utilized by President Bush. The House passed H.R. 4890 on June 22, 2006, granting the President greater authority to reject spending items. However, the Senate did not act on a companion measure before adjourning. In 2007, the Senate failed to vote on similar provisions. President Obama's campaign platform in 2008 included a plan to review federal spending line by line. President Obama and Joe Biden plan to review the federal budget line by line, eliminating underperforming government programs and selecting new initiatives based on merit. The Administration proposed the \"Reducing Unnecessary Spending Act\" in 2010, aiming to expedite rescission measures. Data shows that from FY1974 to FY2009, Presidents requested over 1,000 rescissions totaling $76 billion, with about a third approved by Congress. Only four times in over 30 years did the sum of requested and enacted rescissions exceed $1 billion. The ICA was enacted in various fiscal years. Congress initiated 1,880 rescission actions totaling nearly $197.1 billion, which is significantly more than presidentially requested rescissions. The trend shows an increasing number of rescissions initiated by Congress. Despite the modest totals of rescissions requested and enacted from FY1974 to FY2009, they are small compared to annual budget outlays and the federal budget deficit. Acting CBO Director Donald Marron noted that Presidents have rarely recommended rescissions, proposing only about $73 billion from 1976 to 2005. The ICA framework allows for rescissions of funds, with Congress initiating more actions than the President. There have been $73 billion in rescissions proposed by Presidents from 1976 to 2005. The process has been used by Presidents to cut spending, but Congress also uses it to express changing priorities. Supporters suggest changing the framework to make it easier for the President's proposals to be approved. The President can propose rescissions of discretionary spending under the ICA framework, which requires Congress to act within 45 days to approve the cuts. Mandatory spending, accounting for 62% of outlays, is not subject to rescission. The 1996 LIVA reversed the burden of action on rescission proposals, making cancellations permanent unless Congress disapproved by a 2/3 majority. President Clinton had the authority to cancel new items of direct spending and certain tax benefits, totaling $355 million in FY1998. The estimated five-year savings were just under $1 billion, with less than $600 million saved when Congress disapproved cancellations. This experience may not reflect how future Presidents would use enhanced rescission authority. Some proposals aim to ensure that funds rescinded under the ICA are used for deficit reduction, not for other spending purposes. The LIVA included a \"lockbox\" mechanism to guarantee that cancellations would contribute to deficit reduction. Various bills have specified that rescinded amounts should only be used for deficit reduction, not to offset spending increases elsewhere. Some observers believe expanding the President's rescission authority may not lead to significant savings or deficit reduction. Studies suggest governors use stronger veto power to prioritize executive spending over legislative priorities. Granting the President enhanced rescission authority could give preference to presidential spending over congressional spending, redirecting resources to the President's agenda. Testimonies in 1995 and 1992 highlighted the potential impact of expanding the President's rescission authority. In 1992, GAO Assistant Comptroller General Harry Havens testified that giving the President item-veto power would shift power from Congress to the President, impacting the balance of power between the branches. President Bush's 1992 rescission proposals totaling $7.9 billion were met with congressional review and discussion on competing spending priorities. In 1992, the President's $8.2 billion package was signed into law with over $6 billion in congressionally initiated cuts. Senator Robert Byrd criticized the President for only targeting Congress for wasteful spending and highlighted examples of wasteful spending in the executive branch. Senator Byrd criticized wasteful spending in the executive branch, citing examples like a grant to study fish aggregation in Nicaragua and a study on dental fear incidence. In 1992, Congress initiated cuts that exceeded the President's proposed rescissions, showing Congress's spending priorities prevailing. The history of impoundments reflects the ongoing power struggle over budget decisions between the President and Congress. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established greater accountability and oversight over rescissions and impoundment actions. Budgetary savings from rescissions since 1974 have been modest but still useful in controlling spending during large deficits. Prior to the 1970s, accurate data on impoundments was lacking, leading Congress to enact reporting requirements in the Federal Impoundment and Information Act of 1972. Compliance with the law was initially delayed, raising concerns about the completeness of information provided to Congress. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 increased oversight on rescissions and impoundment actions. It requires the President to inform Congress of proposed rescissions and the Comptroller General to oversee compliance. Messages from the President and the Comptroller General are to be printed in the Federal Register. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 mandated monthly reports on impoundment actions, initially from the President and later from the Director of OMB. President George W. Bush had deferral requests in FY2001, but no rescission requests. Monthly reports continued until September 2001, with no reports since June 2002 due to lack of presidential messages. OMB confirmed no funds were being deferred as of June 2002, stating no cumulative reports are needed until the President transmits new proposals to Congress. The OMB used to prepare year-end reports on rescissions, but these were discontinued in the 1990s. The House Appropriations Committee also compiles data on rescissions, including congressionally initiated actions to cancel funds. It is important to note that the Appropriations Committee's approach includes actions taken without a rescission request from the President. The Appropriations Committee tracks appropriations law and amendments, while OMB focuses on the President's proposed rescissions and Congress's actions. GAO began regularizing data collection on rescissions in 1992, providing updated data to Congress in a standardized format. The GAO began tracking rescissions in 1992, providing data on proposed and enacted rescissions by the President and Congress. The 1992 compilation included revisions and adjustments to historical tables, adding rescissions not previously identified and adjusting fiscal year credits. Further adjustments may be included as needed. The GAO has been tracking rescissions since 1992, providing data on proposed and enacted rescissions by the President and Congress. The most recent submission from GAO covered the period from FY1974-FY2008, with discrepancies in the total number and dollar amount of presidential rescission requests identified. Further adjustments may be included in future submissions. The GAO identified discrepancies in the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests compared to the sum of each administration's total dollar amount. No explanation was provided for these inconsistencies in the 2009 update."
