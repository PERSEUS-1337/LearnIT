    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 50833 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 50833. The department will allocate a percentage of State Block Grant Program funds for economic development planning and technical assistance grants to eligible small cities or counties. These grants are for business attraction, retention, and expansion programs, local economic development strategies, feasibility studies, and downtown revitalization. Applicants must provide a cash match of up to 25%. The department will determine the maximum grant amount per year for economic development grants. Each applicant can receive up to two grants per year but not exceeding the maximum amount set by the department. Unused funds may be used for other economic development purposes. The department will set aside a percentage of State Block Grant Program funds for technical assistance grants to small cities or counties for housing rehabilitation purposes. Applicants must provide a cash match of up to 25%. Any unexpended funds will revert to the general program, not the economic development set-aside. The maximum grant amount per year will be determined by the department. The department will determine the maximum grant amount per application in the NOFA. Each applicant can receive up to two grants per year, not exceeding the maximum amount set by the department. (c) The department may reduce set-asides percentages if grants are considered administrative expenditures under federal law. Two or more jurisdictions can pool funds for a joint application. General administrative activity planning studies do not count against allocations. The department may issue a NOFA allowing applicants with current Community Development Block Grant agreements signed in 2012 or later to apply for funds without meeting expenditure requirements. Evaluation will be based on eligibility, need, benefit, or readiness, without specific rating criteria. The director's determination under section 7078 of the California Code of Regulations does not exempt awarded funds from expenditure requirements under law. Section 51335 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Not less than 20 percent of units in a multifamily rental housing development financed under this chapter must be for lower income households, with 15 percent in targeted areas. Half of these units must be for very low income households, unless waived by the agency in designated geographic areas. The agency must provide housing assistance to very low-income households in designated geographic areas where the needs of lower-income households are not being met. The rental payments for units occupied by very low income households should not exceed 30% of 50% of the area median income. Base rents for lower income and very low income households should be adjusted for household size. The financing extended under this chapter will be determined to be appropriate and commercially reasonable. The local agency issuing permits for multifamily rental housing development may provide concessions and inducements to enhance economic feasibility and offer units for very low-income households. This includes reductions in construction requirements, density bonuses, expedited permit processing, mixed-use zoning, and reducing or eliminating various fees and charges. The agency issuing permits for multifamily rental housing development may offer financial incentives to reduce costs and enhance project feasibility for lower income households. Selection criteria for Section 8 certificate holders should not be more burdensome than for other prospective tenants. The Legislature intends for the agency to finance projects that provide shelter for lower income households with cost-effective design requirements, avoiding excessive amenities that hinder the goal. Design standards should be less costly for multifamily rental developments compared to past requirements. The agency aims to finance projects for lower income households with cost-effective design requirements, allowing for developments with substantially less costly design requirements than those required before January 1, 1986. The Legislature intends for the agency to prioritize funding projects that provide shelter for larger families by giving priority to developments with three- and four-bedroom units. As a condition of financing, the housing sponsor must enter into a regulatory agreement ensuring units for lower income households are prioritized until bonds are paid off. The agreement binds successors and runs with the land, recorded in the county recorder's office. The agency must ensure that units for lower income households are of comparable quality and offer a range of sizes and bedrooms. Priority is given to processing loans for rental housing developments with innovative and energy-efficient techniques to reduce costs. To qualify for housing or development assistance, projects must meet certain criteria such as utilizing federal assistance, redevelopment funds, or local financial aid, being sponsored by a nonprofit housing organization, providing a significant number of housing units as part of a local government plan, and reserving a percentage of units for lower income households. New and existing rental housing developments may be syndicated with agency approval, ensuring compliance with regulations. Syndication terms must not reduce requirements or benefits. This chapter offers an alternative financing method for multifamily rental housing. SEC. 4: This act does not affect regulatory agreements recorded before August 31, 2016. SEC. 5: This act is urgent for public peace, health, and safety due to the critical need for affordable housing statewide."
