    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring the Doctors of Our Country through Scholarships Veterans Affairs Act of 2014\" or the \"RDOCS-VA Act of 2014\". Congress finds that the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities urgently need more physicians, especially those trained in primary care. The Health Professionals Educational Assistance Program offers scholarships and loan forgiveness to health professionals but does not prioritize primary care commitment for VA-employed physicians. The ROTC model is effective in training officers for the Armed Forces and could be adapted to address this need. Congress can address the primary care shortage at Department of Veterans Affairs by providing full-tuition scholarships to students committed to serving as primary care doctors. Establishment of Restoring the Doctors of Our Country Through Scholarships--Veterans Affairs Program in Chapter 76 of title 38, United States Code, to address the primary care shortage at the Department of Veterans Affairs by providing full-tuition scholarships to students committed to serving as primary care doctors. The Restoring the Doctors of Our Country Through Scholarships-Veterans Affairs program aims to increase the availability of physicians providing primary health care at VA medical facilities. The program includes awarding at least 400 scholarships to individuals selected by the Secretary, covering all tuition and costs for their undergraduate medical education. The RDOCS-VA program covers tuition and costs for undergraduate medical education for up to 48 months and provides a cost-of-living stipend. Participants must enroll in a participating medical program, maintain academic standing, and complete a residency in a primary care specialty. The RDOCS-VA program requires scholars to become licensed, maintain board certification in a primary care specialty, and complete a five-year post-graduate period of employment with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preference is given to applicants in accelerated family-medicine programs or those willing to work at facilities with urgent need for primary care physicians. An RDOCS-VA scholar is ineligible for other educational assistance and may face liability for breaching the agreement by not accepting scholarship payments. Liabilities include liquidated damages of $1,500 and repayment of funds received. Liabilities may arise for an RDOCS-VA scholar if they fail to meet academic standards, are dismissed for disciplinary reasons, voluntarily leave the medical program early, or do not obtain a medical license in their state. This liability replaces any service obligation under the agreement. The RDOCS-VA scholar may face liabilities if they fail to meet academic standards, are dismissed for disciplinary reasons, leave the program early, or do not obtain a medical license. In case of breach of agreement by an officer, the United States can recover damages within one year. The Secretary must submit an annual report on physician workforce, including the number of scholarships awarded. The subchapter covers data on physician shortages at Department medical facilities, a gap analysis of primary care practitioners needed, and estimates of funding required through the RDOCS-VA program. Definitions include an accelerated track family-medicine program and associated regions. The term 'board certification' refers to a medical specialty certification, while 'participating undergraduate medical program' pertains to a State-operated allopathic or osteopathic program. 'Primary care specialty' includes geriatrics, gerontology, family medicine, or general internal medicine. The term 'RDOCS-VA officer' refers to a program participant who completed undergraduate medical training but has not fulfilled all scholarship requirements.
