    "content": "The September 11, 2001 attacks highlighted the need to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Pakistan's location, relationship with terrorist groups, and nuclear programs have raised concerns about WMD proliferation. Pakistan is seen as a critical hub for the nexus of terrorism and WMD due to assassination attempts on President Musharraf, nuclear sales by AQ Khan, and ongoing battles with terrorist elements. Pakistan's nuclear doctrine and military capabilities also contribute to the concern. Pakistan's doctrinal preference and conventional force inferiority drive the forward deployment of its nuclear forces, prompting discussions on U.S. assistance to secure nuclear warheads in India and Pakistan. Suggestions range from enhancing security at nuclear sites to implementing locks on weapons. Senator Lugar expressed concerns post-9/11 about the security of Pakistan's nuclear program and raised uncertainties about WMD programs in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and North Korea. Senator Lugar highlighted the importance of discussing nuclear security with India and Pakistan post-9/11, emphasizing the need for safe storage and accountability. He also suggested that cooperative programs with Iran, Syria, or Libya should not be dismissed, citing the success of the Nunn-Lugar program in Russia as a model for international cooperation on securing weapons of mass destruction. Cooperating on securing weapons of mass destruction involves working together to retrieve dangerous materials and assisting victims of nuclear, chemical, or biological terrorism. Differences between India, Pakistan, and the Former Soviet Union limit the applicability of programs due to their non-legal nuclear weapon state status. The United States faces restrictions in providing assistance to non-nuclear weapon states like India and Pakistan, focusing on securing nuclear materials and providing employment for personnel. The paper discusses the challenges of providing assistance for securing nuclear weapons in India and Pakistan due to sensitivity and restrictions. It analyzes the potential application of Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs in the region, distinguishing between securing weapons and securing nuclear material. The existing nonproliferation laws and policies are considered in assessing U.S. policy options. In the 107th Congress, Senator Lugar introduced a bill to expand the application of Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) funds outside the former Soviet Union. However, the House bill prohibited such uses of CTR funds, and the provisions were dropped in conference. The Congress also addressed Indian and Pakistani nonproliferation issues in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act Fiscal Year 2003. The United States aims to encourage India and Pakistan to establish a system to protect nuclear devices and materials, consistent with nonproliferation treaties. Both countries are urged to commit to a nuclear test moratorium, not deploy certain missiles, align export controls with international standards, and cooperate on nonproliferation efforts by September 2003. The United States encourages India and Pakistan to establish effective systems to protect nuclear devices and materials by September 2003, aligning with nonproliferation treaties. This includes bilateral meetings to discuss security issues and confidence-building measures regarding nuclear policies and programs. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act authorized the Bush Administration to spend $50 million from the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program in states outside the former Soviet Union. Senator Lugar introduced a bill to remove restrictions on using CTR funds outside the FSU. The bill introduced by Senator Biden in the 109th Congress would remove restrictions on spending Cooperative Threat Reduction Program funds outside the former Soviet Union, authorize $10 million for nonproliferation efforts in Pakistan, and require certification from the President for any military or economic assistance to be provided. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, enacted in 1991, aims to address the proliferation danger posed by the former Soviet Union's weapons infrastructure. The program's objectives include destroying weapons of mass destruction, establishing safeguards against proliferation, and preventing the diversion of scientific expertise. Senator Lugar stated that the CTR program has successfully separated 6,564 Russian nuclear warheads from their missiles. The CTR program has separated 6,564 Russian nuclear warheads from missiles and stored fissile material. Over 30,000 tactical nuclear weapons have been stored, and non-weapons employment provided for Russian nuclear scientists. Destruction, dismantlement, chain of custody, and demilitarization are key areas of effort in the program. Activities include removing warheads, deactivating missiles, and improving safety and security measures for nuclear weapons and materials. Demilitarization projects focus on defense conversion and supporting WMD scientists in pursuing peaceful objectives. The CTR program has evolved over time to address Russian, NIS, and U.S. priorities, providing alternative employment for WMD scientists and implementing material protection measures. In one incident, the Department of Energy provided blankets to facility guards to prevent them from leaving their posts. As the economy worsened in Russia, CTR projects aimed to support unpaid or out-of-work WMD scientists and prevent theft of nuclear material. The United States implemented security measures for nuclear material, including \"quick-fixes\" and more sophisticated measures like sensors and cameras. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program was a novel approach to addressing nuclear weapons and material security, with a focus on preventing Russia's WMD infrastructure from unraveling. The circumstances leading to a similar nuclear terrorist threat in India and Pakistan are different from those addressed by the CTR program. The success of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program was due to a basic agreement on the threat and willingness to cooperate. Russia had agreed to nuclear reductions under START I, with the main issue being implementation and funding. Unlike the situation with India and Pakistan, there is no similar agreement with the United States. India has stated it will disarm when other nuclear states reduce their stockpiles. Therefore, current destruction and dismantlement activities do not apply. The CTR program focused on securing weapons and materials taken out of service in Russia, without enhancing safety, security, and control over active nuclear assets. Establishing verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of existing nuclear weapons, components, and materials is the most applicable of all the CTR objectives for India and Pakistan. However, threat reduction measures for these countries may conflict with nuclear deterrence, as consolidating materials and weapons could increase vulnerability to a preemptive strike. Unlike Russia, the risk of a preemptive strike is a major complication for India and Pakistan. In Russia and the NIS, obstacles to consolidation are primarily related to cost and effort in constructing facilities like the Mayak plutonium storage facility. In India and Pakistan, the fear of a preemptive strike is prominent, with rumors of attacks on nuclear capabilities. The concern of preventing diversion of scientific expertise applies to all countries, but the underlying causes differ, such as financial security in Russia and sympathy for terrorist aims in Pakistan. In India and Pakistan, brain-drain projects may focus on personnel reliability testing and psychological profiling for nuclear experts. Some argue against expanding CTR, suggesting it may not be effective. Funding current WMD scientists in India and Pakistan at higher levels to retain them in the program could be politically unacceptable. Some argue that the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program has not focused enough on nuclear material security, which is seen as the greatest threat. There are concerns that U.S. assistance could inadvertently improve India and Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Proponents of the CTR program in the Newly Independent States (NIS) emphasize enhancing physical security and protection of nuclear assets without enhancing operational capabilities. The main nuclear risks in South Asia are terrorists acquiring nuclear material or weapons and the possibility of accidental nuclear war. To address these risks, there is a need for greater physical security at weapons sites and sites storing weapons-grade material. Additionally, safer nuclear weapons and enhanced command and control are necessary to reduce the risk of preemptive or sudden war. This paper focuses on enhancing physical security measures for nuclear material to reduce the risk of terrorist threats. While some suggest making nuclear weapons safer, the emphasis here is on physical security rather than safety measures. The United States requires physical security for bilateral nuclear trade. The United States requires physical security measures for nuclear material in bilateral trade. India and Pakistan, with weapons-grade material, are potential targets for theft. Both countries are parties to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material covers a range of nuclear terrorist activities and requires parties to criminalize those activities. The United States and other members have agreed to extend physical protection to domestic use and storage. The International Atomic Energy Agency conducts physical protection assessment programs, and India and Pakistan have been active in discussions on expanding the Convention. In 2002, the IAEA conducted a joint safety and security workshop in Islamabad. India requested a regional workshop on physical protection in 2002. Most material and facilities in India and Pakistan are not subject to international safeguards. India has safeguards on 6 reactors. Key nuclear weapons-related facilities in India not subject to IAEA inspections include the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Trombay, which houses reactors for plutonium production and uranium enrichment. These sites could be attractive to terrorists due to the presence of weapons-usable nuclear material. Pakistan has IAEA safeguards on a few facilities, including the KANUPP power reactor. Pakistan has key nuclear facilities not under international safeguards, including the Khan Research Laboratories at Kahuta and centrifuge enrichment plants at Sihala, Golra, and Wah/Gadwal. These sites could be high-value targets for terrorists. Since the 1998 nuclear tests, both India and Pakistan have accelerated nuclear weapons development, but it is believed that neither country has deployed warheads mated with delivery systems. India and Pakistan have structured nuclear command and control authority, but it is unclear if they have implemented two-man rules for authorized use of warheads. Physical separation of fissile material components helps deter unauthorized use and theft. The security measures for nuclear weapons in India and Pakistan are unclear. While India maintains civilian oversight, Pakistan relies on military security. The details of security procedures in both countries are unknown. The security of nuclear assets in Pakistan has raised concerns, with reports of nuclear components being moved to undisclosed locations. President Musharraf reorganized the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and investigated nuclear scientists with ties to extremists. Dr. A.Q. Khan, a Pakistani nuclear freelancer, was involved in selling nuclear materials and technology to Libya, Iran, and North Korea. Dr. A.Q. Khan sold nuclear technology to rogue states, amassing millions of dollars. Pakistani officials claimed to have tightened controls on their nuclear weapons program with the creation of the National Command Authority in 2000. Key people in the program are screened every two years, but top-level individuals are controlled by their organizations. India's Nuclear Command Authority was established in January 2003, but there is little information on personnel screening measures. India and Pakistan were the only states outside the NPT to openly declare their nuclear weapons status. The international community faced a dilemma after India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998. Talbott stated in Foreign Affairs that the United States cannot concede that India and Pakistan have established themselves as nuclear-weapons states. The international community has avoided addressing their nuclear weapons status, but some see them as a model for new nuclear weapon states. Consensus on nuclear assistance to non-nuclear weapon states is strong and embodied in the NPT. Views on sharing nuclear technology and weapons varied before the NPT came into force in 1970. The United States considered giving India nuclear weapons to counter China's arsenal in 1964. Nuclear weapon states have shared technology and spied on each other. China initially supported nuclear proliferation but later joined the NPT. States outside the NPT, like Pakistan, have received nuclear technology. Negotiators of the NPT realized any international nuclear assistance could aid a weapons program. Nuclear weapons require precise design and construction, making any assistance valuable to aspiring nuclear weapon states. Nuclear weapon states commit not to transfer weapons or assist non-nuclear weapon states in acquiring them. This commitment has no verification measures. Negotiators felt comfortable focusing verification on recipient states, with all states obliged not to provide nuclear material without IAEA safeguards. Safeguards have existed in nuclear trade to prevent military misuse. The importance of safeguards in preventing nuclear proliferation is evident in international policies and laws. States with full-scope safeguards are considered more nonproliferation-worthy, as seen in U.S. export control laws. The international nuclear nonproliferation regime follows cues from the U.S., such as requiring full-scope safeguards for nuclear supply. Efforts post the Khan network discovery focus on adopting the Additional Protocol as a new nonproliferation acid test. Efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation are ongoing, with concerns about the safety and security of proliferant states' nuclear weapons. There is a perception of hubris among nuclear weapon states in providing security measures. China's nuclear test expanded the list of nuclear weapon states beyond those with large industrial economies. Pakistan asserts its ability to protect its arsenal, while India remains silent on the issue. Global terrorism concerns may impact perceptions of assistance to India and Pakistan. In the years following India's first nuclear test in 1974, Pakistan sought to counter the perceived threat by acquiring nuclear weapons. Cooperation with China and nuclear shopping in Western Europe helped Pakistan's program advance. The Glenn-Symington amendments in 1977 cut off aid to countries importing enrichment or reprocessing capabilities. India has remained silent on the subject of nuclear weapons. In 1985, Congress passed the Pressler amendment conditioning aid to Pakistan on not possessing a nuclear explosive device. President Bush terminated aid to Pakistan in 1990 after they failed to meet this condition. Between 1990 and 1995, Pakistan and India faced restrictions on U.S. assistance, military sales, financing, and international loans. In 1995, the Pressler amendment was modified to apply only to military assistance. In 1998, sanctions were tightened on India and Pakistan due to their nuclear tests, leading to restrictions on U.S. support for international financial institutions' loans, exports, and assistance from the Export-Import Bank. Despite many countries lifting sanctions quickly, prohibitions on nuclear trade with these countries remain in place. U.S. policy on South Asian nuclear proliferation is currently uncertain, with nonproliferation benchmarks set after the 1998 tests not publicly addressed since 2000. These benchmarks included halting nuclear testing, signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, stopping fissile material production, refraining from missile and nuclear weapon testing, formalizing export controls, and reducing tensions, including in Kashmir. India and Pakistan have not tested nuclear weapons since 1998 but are unlikely to ratify the CTBT. The Bush Administration is unlikely to sign and ratify the CTBT due to the absence of U.S. ratification. They do not support a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and believe a fissile material production cutoff treaty is unverifiable. Assistant Secretary of State Christine Rocca stated that the administration aims to prevent nuclear and missile arms races, discourage nuclear testing, and prevent proliferation. There are opportunities for the U.S. to exert leverage in building trust with Pakistan through military cooperation and information sharing. The Bush Administration's stance on nuclear weapons in South Asia is complex. While efforts to build trust with Pakistan and India are ongoing, there are doubts about extending trust to nuclear weapons issues. The administration acknowledges the presence of nuclear weapons in the region and focuses on managing the dangers they pose through confidence-building measures. Constraints on U.S. assistance in this regard can be categorized into three groups. The constraints on U.S. assistance in South Asia regarding nuclear weapons can be categorized into three groups: legal prohibitions, technical limitations, and political limitations. Legal prohibitions are embodied in international treaties and U.S. domestic law, while technical limitations stem from the lack of information on Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons. Political limitations include the willingness of India and Pakistan to cooperate and the impact on nonproliferation regimes. The NPT imposes constraints on the United States regarding the transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them. The meaning of \"control\" is not clearly defined. The NPT imposes constraints on the transfer of nuclear weapons or control over them, focusing on allies making command decisions for U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe. Non-nuclear-weapon states are obligated not to assist in manufacturing such weapons, covering assistance that enhances command and control, including PAL technology. India and Pakistan, as non-NPT nuclear weapon states, are not bound by obligations regarding command and control of weapons. The NPT does not clearly define violations of Article I, focusing on what cannot be done rather than what can be done. Legal advisors have examined this issue, but there is no public State Department view available. Assistance that could potentially aid a nuclear weapons program may violate U.S. legal obligations, both internationally and domestically. While certain types of aid may indirectly support such programs, they are permitted if not closely linked. However, providing transferrable funds raises greater concerns about potential linkage to nuclear weapons programs under U.S. domestic law. The U.S. has restrictions on nuclear cooperation with India and Pakistan due to nonproliferation laws. The Atomic Energy Act governs international nuclear cooperation and requires an Agreement for Cooperation. Currently, the U.S. does not have such agreements with India or Pakistan. Section 144 of the AEA covers the release of sensitive nuclear information. The AEA allows the release of sensitive nuclear information, excluding atomic weapons design or fabrication details. The Secretary of Defense can exchange Restricted Data for defense planning, personnel training, enemy capabilities assessment, and weapon delivery system development. Cooperation with India or Pakistan is unlikely to meet these criteria. The President can authorize data exchange on atomic weapons with another country to enhance their nuclear weapon capabilities. The Atomic Energy Act allows the exchange of sensitive nuclear information, excluding atomic weapons design details. The President can authorize data exchange on atomic weapons with another country to enhance their nuclear weapon capabilities. The Act was amended in 1978 by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, making cooperation with India or Pakistan unlikely under certain criteria. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act amended the Atomic Energy Act in 1978, requiring states engaging in significant nuclear trade with the US to sign an Agreement for Cooperation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees significant nuclear trade, while the Department of Energy regulates the transfer of technology. Recipient states must maintain IAEA safeguards on all nuclear materials in peaceful activities unless it involves non-nuclear parts of atomic weapons. The recipient state must guarantee that nuclear materials and equipment transferred will not be used for any military purpose. The Secretary of State must provide a nuclear proliferation assessment statement to the President to ensure the agreement is consistent with nonproliferation criteria. The President may exempt a proposed cooperation agreement from certain requirements if it jeopardizes U.S. nonproliferation objectives. Section 128 of the NNPA outlines conditions for terminating U.S. cooperation, prohibiting exports to states that have detonated nuclear devices or violated IAEA safeguards. Export Regulations: Transfers of nuclear-related equipment or material may require full-scope safeguards under NSG guidelines. U.S. export regulations have multiple tiers, including licensing for items on the NSG's dual-use list. India and Pakistan are not NSG members. The U.S. export regulations function in tiers, with the Commerce Control List specifying regulated items and the entities list focusing on end-users. Entities of proliferation concern are in China, India, Israel, Pakistan, and Russia. After the 1998 nuclear tests, Indian and Pakistani organizations on the entities list increased due to sanctions. The Department of Commerce policy was to deny licenses for exports to India and Pakistan for nuclear nonproliferation or missile technology reasons. In 2001, restrictions on exports to India and Pakistan for nuclear nonproliferation or missile technology reasons were lifted. Currently, Indian nuclear-related facilities on the entities list include Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Indira Gandhi Atomic Research Center, and others. Pakistani facilities on the list include AQ Khan Research Laboratories and Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. The Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and its subordinate entities in Pakistan, including various nuclear facilities, are unsafeguarded and sensitive sites. Concerns arise regarding the export of equipment, material, or information for cooperative nuclear threat reduction to these facilities. The United States' policy of not supplying items to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities may conflict with exports to India and Pakistan under a CTR-like program. Under the 1990 Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI), the Department of Commerce can impose licensing requirements on exports and reexports of goods and technology to prevent diversion to nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile proliferation. U.S. exporters must apply for a license if they know or suspect that exports will be used for nuclear explosive activities, unsafeguarded nuclear activities, or activities related to producing special nuclear material. Section 744.2 of the Export Administration Regulations outlines criteria for assessing license applications. The criteria for assessing license applications include the nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, such as adherence to the NPT, full-scope safeguards, and cooperation agreements with the United States. Descriptions of Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons programs are incomplete and unreliable, with a high level of secrecy surrounding both programs. The United States faces challenges in providing assistance to Russia and the NIS due to lack of access to sensitive facilities. Concerns arise about whether U.S. assistance in securing nuclear weapons could inadvertently improve Indian or Pakistani capabilities. PALs, developed in the 1960s, prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons but also make them more deployable. One of the goals of U.S. nonproliferation policy is to prevent India and Pakistan from deploying their weapons. U.S. assistance may be a sensitive issue for both governments, with India focusing on reactor safety talks and Pakistan insisting their nuclear assets are secure. The Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson admitted that the U.S. offered to train Pakistani personnel on nuclear asset safety. General Musharraf's decision prompted the U.S. to ask for installation of nuclear weapon command and control. U.S. assistance needs to have a low profile for success due to mistrust and cooperation issues between the U.S., India, and Pakistan. Following Operation Enduring Freedom in Iraq, there are concerns in Pakistan about being targeted by U.S. counterproliferation efforts. The Bush Administration's lack of sanctions on Pakistan for aiding North Korea and not pressing for access to A.Q. Khan may be seen as reluctance to upset relations. Pakistan's designation as a major non-NATO ally in 2004 has also boosted confidence in the U.S. despite lingering mistrust. Despite some progress in Kashmir, India and Pakistan show little interest in enhancing transparency with each other or the United States. Pakistan's reliance on foreign procurement sources hinders transparency measures, while a culture of secrecy in both countries poses challenges. Legal, technical, and political constraints limit direct assistance related to nuclear weapons. Improving site security at nuclear facilities in India and Pakistan is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and theft of weapons or materials. Measures such as perimeter security, personnel identification systems, and sensors can help mitigate the nuclear threat in the region. Senator Lugar suggested promoting exchanges between security experts and offering assistance on export controls and border security to enhance operational capabilities of nuclear weapons. Improving site security at nuclear facilities in India and Pakistan is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and theft of weapons or materials. Measures such as perimeter security, personnel identification systems, and sensors can help minimize the threat of unauthorized entry. Assistance could cover personnel vetting, training, and development of a security culture. US officials toured sites and conducted vulnerability assessments in the Russian case, offering information on security procedures at sensitive facilities. Assistance under IAEA auspices has been provided for improving site security at nuclear facilities in India and Pakistan. Measures for material security include material protection, control, and accounting (MPC&A), with a focus on monitoring techniques and accounting systems. International safeguards rely on state systems of accounting and control (SSACs) to track material flows. Assistance on nuclear weapons security is limited to prevent theft or unauthorized detonation. Measures include sharing new techniques for securing material, encouraging participation in multilateral programs, providing equipment for physical protection, and offering experts' training sessions. Pakistan and India could benefit from participating in these initiatives. Measures to ensure nuclear weapons security include armed guards and permissive action links (PALs) to prevent unauthorized use. Both India and Pakistan are likely aware of the importance of protecting their nuclear weapons. Implementing measures for personnel security in the absence of disarmament may be limited. President Bush announced a strategic partnership with India in 2004, focusing on civilian nuclear technology, space technology, and high-technology trade. The cooperation aimed to enhance security in nuclear programs without violating the NPT, with exports to safeguarded nuclear facilities. The cooperation between the US and India in nuclear technology aimed to enhance security in nuclear programs through exports to safeguarded facilities. However, assistance to Pakistan may be more challenging due to limited access to key figures like AQ Khan. The nuclear programs of India and Pakistan are smaller than Russia's, making the potential costs of a cooperative threat reduction program uncertain. In 1991, the Nunn-Lugar program was created to assist in destroying nuclear and other weapons, with stipulations on recipient commitments. Costs for implementing such a program could vary depending on the approach taken, from low-technology to high-technology solutions incorporating cameras, encryption, and remote monitoring. The Nunn-Lugar program was established in 1991 to help destroy nuclear and other weapons, with recipient nations needing to meet certain conditions. Presidents Bush and Clinton initially certified Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, but later withdrew certifications for Belarus and Russia due to human rights abuses and non-compliance with arms control agreements. The Bush Administration requested a waiver from Congress for the certification requirements. The Nunn-Lugar program established in 1991 to help destroy nuclear weapons required recipient nations to meet certain conditions. Legislation in the 108th Congress aimed to remove certification requirements and restrictions. U.S. nonproliferation laws have evolved to target critical capabilities and the transfer of nuclear weapons. The 109th Congress may revisit this issue if new legislation is introduced. Some argue for accepting India and Pakistan's nuclear status and relaxing restrictions, while others fear it would weaken nonproliferation efforts. The U.S. faces a dilemma in treating states with WMD programs outside the NPT. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impact of accepting Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons status on international security and stability, as well as the tradeoffs between nonproliferation policy and counterterrorism cooperation. Senator Biden introduced a bill addressing proliferation of nuclear weapons and promotion of democracy as threats. The bill introduced by Senator Biden addresses the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation in Pakistan by authorizing $10M for nonproliferation efforts. It also includes a provision to ensure that no US assistance goes to those opposing nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The bill does not address the lack of progress in promoting democracy in Pakistan. President Musharraf's authority to waive coup-related sanctions for Pakistan was extended through FY2006, raising the need for Congress to revisit the issue for FY2007. Despite the 9/11 Commission Report emphasizing the importance of supporting Musharraf's vision for a moderate Islamic state, little progress has been made towards democratic rule in Pakistan."
