    "content": "EXCEPTION FROM PROVISIONS REQUIRING REDUCTION IN ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL LIFE INSURANCE. The amount of additional optional insurance under section 8714b of title 5, United States Code, can be continued without reduction if there is a designation under section 8705 for payment to a permanently disabled individual at retirement, and if an election is made on behalf of that individual. However, any required reduction will occur if the insurance is not paid according to the designation at the time of retirement. The term 'permanently disabled' is defined based on Social Security Act regulations, with a requirement that the disability is expected to last permanently. This definition applies to the designation of insurance for care and support at retirement, with potential reductions if the insurance is not used as designated. To be eligible for unreduced additional optional insurance, the insured individual must elect to continue full cost withholdings from their annuity or compensation. This election can be revoked by the insured individual. The insured individual can revoke their election for unreduced additional optional insurance or make changes to their designation. The Office of Personnel Management will determine eligibility for the insurance. The amendments made by this section will take effect upon the enactment of the Act. Regulations will be prescribed for certain individuals not otherwise eligible. Individuals not initially eligible can make an election under specific conditions within a year of the Act's enactment. The election is allowed for those who separated from service during a specified period and would have been eligible if the amendments were in effect at the separation date. After making an election under specific conditions within a year of the Act's enactment, withholdings under section 8714b(d)(3)(A) of title 5 will be made from the individual's annuity or compensation. If benefits are paid upon the insured individual's death, a reduction will be made to reflect withholdings that were not made before the election. The Office will notify current and former Federal employees about the enactment of the Act and any eligible benefits. The notification will include information on making an election under paragraph (2) and other relevant details."
