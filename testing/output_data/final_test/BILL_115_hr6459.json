    "content": "The Act is titled the \"TSA OPEN for Business Act\" and includes a new section on a diversified technology stakeholder marketplace. The \"TSA OPEN for Business Act\" requires the Administrator to submit a strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace for security screening technologies, with a focus on increased participation of small business innovators. The strategy must address how the Administration's processes impact the acquisition of innovative technologies from new stakeholders. The Administrator must submit specific actions to foster diversification within the technology stakeholder marketplace, assist small business innovators, and assess feasibility of partnering with a 501(c)(3) organization for transportation security enhancement. The Administrator is required to assess the feasibility of partnering with a 501(c)(3) organization to provide venture capital for small business innovators in the homeland security technology sector. This organization would be modeled after the In-Q-tel program and aim to commercialize innovative technologies within 36 months. The intelligence community is urged to assist small business innovators in commercializing security-related technologies. Enhanced engagement with the In-Q-tel program is encouraged. No changes to Transportation Security Administration standards are required. Definitions for \"intelligence community\" and \"small business concern\" are provided. The Comptroller General will review the strategy's impact on small business innovators in transportation security technology. The strategy has led to increased participation of small business innovators in the technology marketplace and diversified the marketplace. A clerical amendment was made to the table of contents in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The House of Representatives passed a bill related to a diversified technology stakeholder marketplace on September 4, 2018. Clerk Karen L. Haas attested to this."
