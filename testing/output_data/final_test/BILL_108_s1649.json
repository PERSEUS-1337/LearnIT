The Bureau of Land Management found it suitable for full wilderness status. President George H.W. Bush supported designating it as wilderness in 1992. The Pueblo of Zia has cooperated with other parties to acquire public land near the Zia Reservation and Ojito Wilderness Study Area to enhance protections and ensure public access for various uses. This includes transferring parcels of land to the Pueblo of Zia and designating the Ojito Wilderness as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Ojito Wilderness, part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, is in the best interest of people in New Mexico and other states. It aims to preserve the area as a resource for wildlife habitat protection, scenic and historic preservation, scientific research, education, recreation, solitude, and inspiration for future generations.
