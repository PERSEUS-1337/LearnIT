    "content": "Section 522 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows individual debtors to exempt certain property from the bankruptcy estate, protecting it from creditors. Federal exemptions include a homestead exemption of $21,625, a vehicle exemption of $3,450, and exemptions for jewelry, tools of the trade, and household goods. Debtors can choose between federal exemptions or those provided by state law, but cannot mix and match. In bankruptcy cases, debtors can choose between federal and state exemptions. Some states allow debtors to choose, while others prohibit the use of federal exemptions. Virginia now offers protection for debtors' firearms, with varying conditions among states. Some states limit the number of firearms exempted, while others restrict it to one firearm. Oregon allows an exemption for one pistol and one rifle or shotgun, with a total exemption value of the two firearms not exceeding $1,000. Some states have no limit on the number of firearms exempted as long as the total value is below a specific amount. Oklahoma allows an unlimited number of firearms to be exempted if their total value does not exceed $2,000. Some states only exempt firearms for personal use. Some states exempt firearms for personal use, with specific requirements. H.R. 1181, introduced in 2011, aimed to provide a firearms exemption in bankruptcy for debtors opting for federal exemptions. Louisiana requires exempted firearms to be used for business purposes. Montana and Nevada exempt all arms required by law, in addition to one selected by the debtor. The bill aimed to add a $3,000 exemption for firearms in bankruptcy, allowing debtors to protect their interest in rifles, shotguns, or pistols. Firearms would be included in the definition of \"household goods\" under the proposed amendments. The bill aimed to add a $3,000 exemption for firearms in bankruptcy, allowing debtors to protect their interest in rifles, shotguns, or pistols. Firearms would be included in the definition of \"household goods\" under the proposed amendments. The bill would not have changed the maximum value of household goods whose liens could be avoided in bankruptcy. Currently, there has been no legislation introduced in the 113th Congress that would provide a federal exemption under the Bankruptcy Code for firearms."
