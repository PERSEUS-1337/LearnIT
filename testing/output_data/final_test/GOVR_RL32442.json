    "content": "In 2002, there were 24,805 U.S. farms producing cotton, with 60% classified as specialized cotton farms. These specialized farms produced 70% of the total cotton crop. In 2003, 12.1 million harvested acres yielded 18.255 million bales of cotton lint, with a farm value of $5.5 billion. Cotton accounted for 5.1% of total crop receipts in the U.S. in 2003. In 2003, the leading cotton-producing states were Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, California, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Louisiana, accounting for 80% of total production. Annual U.S. cotton production since 1991 averaged 16.8 million bales, with a share of world production averaging 20%. The United States is the world's second largest cotton producer, with an average share of world production at 19%. In the 2003/04 marketing year, about 80 countries are forecasted to produce 93 million bales of cotton, with the leading seven countries accounting for 80% of world production. The United States, Brazil, and Uzbekistan are the only net exporters among the leading producing nations. The U.S. dominates all other cotton exporting countries, with expected exports of 13.8 million bales, constituting 42% of total world exports. In the 2003 marketing year, U.S. cotton exports are expected to reach 13.8 million bales, constituting 68% of total use. Domestic manufacturing of cotton fabric and yarn has been declining rapidly while foreign manufacturing has increased. Exports have risen rapidly and to record levels as manufacturing has expanded overseas. The shift in cotton deliveries from domestic to foreign users raises questions about the impact of cotton support programs on U.S. manufacturing. Subsidies do not raise market prices but support producers' income and production costs. Despite tariff barriers, U.S. cotton production did not decrease in response to low prices in 1999-2002, instead increasing after the price drop. The U.S. cotton support programs aim to protect domestic producers from foreign competition. Measures like Cotton User Marketing Certificates and import quotas benefit U.S. yarn and fabric manufacturers. Import competition and the phase-out of quotas have led to a decline in U.S. textile manufacturing. Efforts to boost economic growth in poorer regions have increased import competition. Legislation like the CBERA, Andean Trade Preference Act, and African Growth and Opportunity Act have been implemented to aid these regions. U.S. cotton support programs aim to protect domestic producers from foreign competition through measures like Cotton User Marketing Certificates and import quotas. U.S. farm-level cotton prices are influenced by world supply and demand conditions, with imbalances reflected in price changes. Demand for cotton textiles is unstable due to competing fibers like wool and synthetics. Farm-level cotton prices and cash receipts from 1991 to 2003 show fluctuations. During the 13-year period from 1991 to 2003, farm prices for cotton fluctuated significantly, averaging $0.57/lb. The price swing was not unique to cotton, as other agricultural commodities also experienced similar fluctuations in response to global supply and demand imbalances. Various programs provided price support and crop loss assistance to support farm income during this unstable time. Farm subsidy programs, including direct payments to farms and crop insurance indemnity payments, are designed to offset low market prices or low yields. Cotton subsidy payments to farmers averaged $0.21/lb from 1991 to 2003, stabilizing their revenue. The combined annual average value of market price and farm subsidy was $0.78/lb. The United States, Spain, and Greece are among the nations that subsidize cotton production. The US had a subsidy of $0.31/lb in 2001/02, with a total cost of $3,001 million. Other top subsidizers include China, Greece, and India. (Source: International Cotton Advisory Committee) The ICAC report in September 2003 highlighted that some countries provided emergency assistance for cotton production in 2001/02 without ongoing price or income support programs. Production costs are divided into variable cash costs and fixed costs, with U.S. variable cash costs fluctuating around $0.50/lb over the past 13 years. Variable cash costs, such as seed, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, and repairs, are crucial for sustaining the farming enterprise. Fixed costs average about $0.29/lb. Fixed costs for cotton production average $0.29/lb, including depreciation, land costs, taxes, and overhead. Cash variable costs have averaged $0.50/lb, with market prices at $0.57/lb. While variable costs were usually covered by market prices, they did not cover all fixed costs. Subsidies help cover costs when market prices are low. International comparisons are made by the ICAC. The International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) compares production costs among countries, indicating that U.S. costs are high compared to Brazil and some African countries. Factors contributing to cost differences include yields, land, labor, fertilizer, and ginning costs. U.S. farm cotton revenues averaged $0.78/lb annually from 1991 to 2003, with variable cash costs at $0.50/lb and total economic costs at $0.78/lb. The 1994 WTO Agriculture Agreement aimed to bring agricultural products under more effective multilateral rules, including prohibiting subsidies exceeding negotiated limits. This agreement marked the beginning of reductions in protection and trade-distorting support, with a commitment to continue reform efforts through negotiations. The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) was initiated in November 2001 to improve market access for agricultural products, reduce export subsidies, and decrease trade-distorting domestic support. A framework for agriculture negotiations was agreed upon in Cancun in September 2003, with the US and EU proposing a framework that led to a counterproposal by a group of 21 developing countries (G-21 framework) calling for deeper cuts in developed country support and the elimination of export subsidies. The standoff between developed and developing countries over cotton subsidies led to the failure to reach an agreement on agriculture negotiations. Four African cotton-exporting countries proposed ending global trade-distorting subsidies for cotton within three years, while the US suggested a global sectoral initiative for cotton and textiles to address subsidies and trade barriers. The dispute between Brazil and the US over cotton subsidies at the WTO led to a breakdown in negotiations. Brazil accused the US of exceeding subsidy limits, causing harm to the Brazilian cotton sector. Despite failed consultations, a Dispute Settlement Panel was formed to review the charges. The Dispute Settlement Panel was formed on March 18, 2003, to review Brazil's accusations of U.S. cotton subsidies exceeding limits. Brazil argues that U.S. cotton program provisions, export credit programs, and the Market Access Program function as export subsidies, violating U.S.-WTO obligations. The U.S. considers Step 2 payments part of its domestic support program, while Brazil argues that the U.S. is no longer exempt from WTO dispute proceedings under the \"peace clause\" of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture. Brazil argues that U.S. cotton subsidies have exceeded limits set by the WTO's \"peace clause\" rule, which exempts domestic support measures from being challenged as illegal subsidies as long as they remain at or below 1992 levels. The Dispute Settlement Panel's interim report suggests a partial finding against the United States, with the final ruling expected to be unfavorable. If so, the U.S. is likely to appeal, prolonging the dispute resolution process. The United States is expected to appeal the unfavorable ruling in the WTO case regarding U.S. cotton subsidies. If Brazil wins, there could be compensation or trade sanctions against U.S. cotton exports. Agricultural subsidies and import barriers are complicating negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Brazil and the United States have differences in tariffs, which is a challenge in the negotiations. The United States is pushing for broad tariff reduction in the Free Trade Area of the Americas, while Brazil and other Latin American countries want the US to relax trade remedy laws and reduce domestic subsidies for farmers. Agricultural trade is a major concern for Latin American countries, but the US prefers to address agriculture policies in global negotiations. Cotton is a focus for policy changes that also affect grains and oilseeds, potentially impacting much of US crop production. The United States is advocating for broad tariff reduction in the Free Trade Area of the Americas, while Brazil and other Latin American countries are pushing for the US to relax trade remedy laws and reduce domestic subsidies for farmers. Policy changes in cotton production could impact a significant portion of US crop production. The 2002 Farm Act authorized subsidy mechanisms for major crops in the US, including cotton, to stabilize farm incomes. These mechanisms do not raise the market price of cotton but increase the effective price received by farmers through programs like marketing assistance loans and direct support. Three support mechanisms available to producers include marketing assistance loans, direct payments, and counter-cyclical payments. Upland cotton producers can receive $0.52/lb. under the marketing assistance loan program, while ELS cotton producers can receive $0.7977/lb. Farmers can use harvested cotton as collateral for a nonrecourse marketing assistance loan from the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. Repayment options depend on market prices. When market prices are lower than the loan rate, farmers can repay the loan at the adjusted world price (AWP), retain ownership of the cotton, and sell it in the marketplace. The difference between the loan rate and the AWP is known as a marketing loan gain, limited to $75,000 per person per year. Repayment at the AWP is intended to avoid acquisition of cotton by the CCC. Farmers can also purchase cotton commodity certificates from the CCC at the adjusted world price to repay nonrecourse marketing assistance loans. The only allowed use for cotton commodity certificates purchased from the CCC at the adjusted world price is to repay loans. Farmers can choose to receive loan deficiency payments instead of taking out nonrecourse loans, which has administrative and financial advantages. However, both loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains count towards the annual payment limit. Marketing assistance loans help reduce revenue risk from price variability. Marketing assistance loans reduce revenue risk associated with price variability and are considered production distorting in a WTO-sense. The direct payments program pays upland cotton farmers $0.0667/lb. on 85% of historical cotton production, not linked to current production or prices. The United States considers direct payments to be non trade-distorting under WTO rules, decoupling support payments from production requirements and market prices. Direct payments, also known as flexibility contract payments, were renamed \"direct payments\" in the 2002 farm bill and extended through crop year 2007. These payments are not tied to production or market prices but are based on acreage, impacting land values. The Counter-Cyclical Program, established in the 2002 farm bill, provides payments to farmers based on historical production levels. Payment rates are counter-cyclical to market prices, increasing when market prices fall below a certain target price. The counter-cyclical payment rate is determined by the difference between the lower season average market price and the higher target price. It cannot exceed $0.1373/lb and no payments are made if the season average price is above $0.6573. These payments are not tied to farmers' production decisions but are linked to market prices, reducing revenue risks. Counter-cyclical payments, along with direct payments, form the DCP program, similar to target price deficiency payments made from 1973 to 1995. Counter-cyclical payments were introduced in the 2002 farm bill to address lower market prices and provide support to farmers. These payments are not tied to production and have an annual limit of $65,000 per person. Market loss payments were made on an ad hoc basis for the 1998-2001 crops due to lower prices, leading to the creation of the counter-cyclical payments program. This program institutionalized market loss payments and reduced revenue risks for farmers. The 2002 farm bill introduced counter-cyclical payments to support farmers during periods of low market prices. These payments, along with fixed direct payments and market assistance loan rates, help stabilize cotton prices. The government is obligated to make fixed direct payments annually, regardless of market conditions. Cotton produced outside of the program base receives only the market assistance loan rate. The history of cotton price support payments from 1991 to 2003 averaged $1.441 billion annually, with subsidies averaging $0.17/lb. This subsidy covered 34% of production costs and nearly 60% of fixed costs. Supply instability is caused by low crop yield due to natural disasters, but producers can get subsidized crop insurance. Crop insurance and disaster payments have been available to cotton producers since 1982 to protect against substantial crop losses from natural hazards. Multi-peril crop insurance covers nearly every cause of yield loss and is subsidized by the USDA's Risk Management Agency. The crop insurance program is designed to be actuarially sound, with total premiums covering total indemnities over time. However, from 1991 to 2003, cotton losses exceeded premiums in most years, resulting in net losses covered by the federal government due to reinsurance. Critics argue that the high premium subsidy and lack of actuarial soundness make the program a means of transferring government funds to cotton farmers. Congress made significant revisions to the program in 1994. In 1994, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act mandated farm subsidy program participation for crop year 1995. Federal insurance subsidies increased in 2000, leading to over 90% participation in planted cotton acres. From 1991 to 2003, the federal cost of crop insurance covered an average of 10.9 million planted cotton acres annually, with an average net federal cost of $219 million per year. These expenditures indirectly support farm income through premium subsidies and indemnities. Additionally, private insurance agency administrative costs and federal administrative costs averaged $74 million per year. The average subsidy rate for cotton production from 1991 to 2003 was $0.026/lb, increasing to $0.032/lb from 1995 to 2003. Disaster payments ranged from zero to $444 million annually, averaging $100 million per year. These payments equaled $0.01/lb of production. Additional tools are used to maintain U.S. upland cotton sales internationally when domestic prices are not competitive. Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 are programs to maintain U.S. upland cotton sales internationally. Step 1 allows for loan rate reductions, Step 2 pays domestic mills and exporters when domestic prices are higher than world prices, and Step 3 permits increased import quotas. These programs were adopted to address competitiveness issues in the cotton market. The Step 1 provision in the 1990 farm bill allows for adjustments to the Adjusted World Price (AWP) for U.S. upland cotton sales in Northern Europe, potentially increasing marketing loan program subsidies. The USDA has not utilized Step 1 since 1992, but it remains a unique tool for supporting cotton prices. The Step 1 provision in the 1990 farm bill allows for adjustments to the Adjusted World Price (AWP) for U.S. upland cotton sales in Northern Europe, potentially increasing marketing loan program subsidies. When the five-day average of the U.S. Northern European price (USNE) exceeds the Northern European price (NE) and the AWP is less than 115% of the loan level, the USDA may lower the AWP up to the difference between the USNE price and the NE price. This adjustment enables loan deficiency payments when US prices are higher than the loan price of $0.52. Step 2 subsidies encourage U.S. buyers to purchase U.S. cotton by offsetting price differences with direct payments. Payments are made when U.S. cotton prices exceed foreign prices for a consecutive four-week period. Payments are not made if the AWP exceeds 134% of the loan rate. Similar payments were adopted for ELS cotton in 1999. Step 2 subsidies incentivize U.S. buyers to purchase U.S. cotton by providing direct payments when U.S. cotton prices are higher than foreign prices for four consecutive weeks. Special import quotas are implemented when there is a shortage of domestic supply, allowing for increased imports exempt from high duties. The USDA implements Step 3 quotas when the USNE price exceeds the NE price for four consecutive weeks or when the U.S. stocks-to-use ratio falls below 16%. The quota size is one week's domestic mill consumption, with importers given 90 days to make purchases and 180 days to bring in the cotton. Total Step 3 imports are limited to five weeks of domestic mill use, with annual U.S. cotton imports estimated at 19 million pounds in the 2003/04 marketing year. Additionally, a limited global import quota for upland cotton is allowed when spot market prices show sustained strength for a three-year period. Limited global import quotas for upland cotton are allowed when spot market prices show sustained strength for a three-year period. This helps domestic mills access lower-priced foreign cotton to compete with foreign mills. Export assistance programs for agricultural commodities include federal export credit guarantees and USDA promotion programs like the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program. The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program (FMD) and Market Access Program (MAP) focus on promoting agricultural products. FMD and MAP are exempt from subsidy reduction commitments. The USDA's General Sales Manager administers credit guarantee programs to finance exports, underwritten by the government to encourage sales in countries where financing may be needed. These programs are viewed as commercial support, not export subsidies. The USDA's General Sales Manager administers credit guarantee programs to finance exports, viewed as commercial support, not export subsidies. The programs aim to encourage commercially viable transactions, with terms and conditions now being negotiated in the WTO. GSM-102 guarantees repayment of short-term bank loans, while GSM-103 covers intermediate-term bank loans. Eligible countries must pass a \"creditworthiness\" test. Cotton-related exporter applications for FY2003 totaled $334.8 million under GSM-102. Exporter applications for FY2003 totaled $334.8 million under GSM-102, with cotton-related applications at $11.73 million. The Supplier Credit Guarantee Program guarantees short-term credit for U.S. exporters. If a foreign borrower defaults, the CCC assumes the debt. The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program aims to expand export opportunities through industry-sponsored promotions. The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program (FMD) aims to expand export opportunities through industry-sponsored promotions, technical assistance, and market research. Funding is from discretionary appropriations of up to $34.5 million annually. Nonprofit industry organizations submit proposals for marketing activities to the USDA, with approved projects reimbursed on a cost-share basis. In FY2002, cooperators receiving federal funds for cotton-related activities were the Cotton Council International and the National Cottonseed Products Association. The Market Access Program (MAP) was authorized by the 2002 farm bill with annual appropriations starting at $100 million in FY2002 and increasing to $200 million for FY2006 and FY2007. It aims to develop foreign markets for agricultural products through activities like advertising, market research, technical assistance, and trade servicing. MAP funds are split with 60% supporting generic promotion and 40% supporting brand-name promotion. The federal contribution for generic promotion is up to 90% and for branded promotion up to 50%. The FY2003 allocation for the Cotton Council International was $8,406,098.
