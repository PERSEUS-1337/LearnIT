    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 230.8 of the Labor Code is amended to protect parents of school-aged children or licensed child care providers. Employers with 25 or more employees at one location cannot discriminate against these employees for taking up to 40 hours off each year to participate in child-related activities. This includes enrolling children in school or child care, with a maximum of eight hours off per month. Employees can take up to 40 hours off each year for child-related activities under Section 230.8 of the Labor Code. If both parents work for the same employer, only one parent can take time off at a time unless approved by the employer. Employees can use vacation, personal leave, or compensatory time off for this purpose, or take unpaid time off if allowed by the employer. Employees are entitled to at least 24 hours of paid time off annually for planned absences, unless specified in a pre-2017 collective bargaining agreement. Any employee's entitlement under this provision cannot be reduced by post-1995 collective bargaining agreements. If all full-time employees are on vacation at the same time, an employee cannot use accrued vacation time for planned absences. The employee must provide documentation from the school or child care provider to prove engagement in child-related activities as requested by the employer. Any employee denied time off for child-related activities is protected from employer retaliation and discrimination. They are entitled to reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and equitable relief. Employers who willfully refuse to rehire or promote such employees may face civil penalties. An employee who faces retaliation for exercising their rights can file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. Employers must display a poster in the workplace informing employees of their right to request and use eight hours of paid time off for their child's school-related activities. Employees are entitled to eight hours of paid time off for their child's school-related activities. Retaliation or discrimination against employees requesting or using this time off is prohibited. \"Parent\" includes various caregivers, and \"child care provider or school emergency\" refers to situations where a child cannot stay at school or with a caregiver. The child may need to be picked up from school or child care provider due to various reasons such as behavioral issues, closure of the facility, or natural disasters like fire or flood."
