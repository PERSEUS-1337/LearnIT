    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Trial Lawyer Pork Act\" aims to eliminate benefits for trial lawyers. It includes findings related to this issue. The Congress found that former powerhouse trial lawyer William Lerach was sentenced to prison for his role in a criminal scheme involving illegal kickbacks in class action lawsuits. Lerach and fellow lawyer Melvin Weiss are both serving time for their involvement in the scheme. In response to corruption in the trial lawyer industry, Richard Scruggs pled guilty to bribing a State judge for higher legal fees and is now in Federal prison. Minority leaders requested a bipartisan investigatory hearing to examine illegal activities in the industry. The minority leader and ranking member requested a bipartisan investigation into the trial lawyer industry due to concerns about illegitimate lawsuits harming the economy and American families. Despite calls for comprehensive tort reform, no action has been taken on reports of trial lawyer corruption. The majority in Congress has been providing legislative favors to the trial lawyer industry, including a new tax benefit in H.R. 6049 that will give lawyers a $1.6 billion windfall over 10 years. This comes at the expense of U.S. taxpayers and American jobs, with lawyers and law firms donating $85 million to Democratic candidates. The trial lawyer industry has increased its political support for the majority in Congress by donating $85 million to Democratic candidates during the 2006 election cycle. The American Association for Justice spent $1.1 million on lobbying in Washington in the first quarter of 2008. Lawyers and law firms are the top donors to Federal candidates in the current election cycle, contributing $83 million. The American Association for Justice political action committee has contributed $1.9 million to candidates, mostly Democrats. The 110th Congress should investigate the trial lawyer industry instead of providing special favors. William Lerach describes illegal activity as an \"industry practice\" that harms American jobs and working families. SEC. 102. ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF LAW BENEFITTING TRIAL LAWYERS. Provisions of law benefiting trial lawyers to the detriment of consumers in various categories shall have no force or effect, including anti-protective orders, broadening maritime lawsuits, prohibition of uniform Federal law, expansion of medical liability lawsuits, expansion of environmental lawsuits, and ending arbitration agreements. The Fairness Act of 2007, Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act of 2008, and Automobile Arbitration Fairness Act of 2008 are examples of laws benefiting trial lawyers. Other examples include expansion of asbestos lawsuits and products liability lawsuits, as well as providing tax breaks for lawsuits. A rule of construction allows provisions of Acts of Congress to take effect despite limitations outlined in the Act. The Act enacts a provision that cites a report from the General Accountability Office, stating that the provision does not favor trial lawyers over consumers and that there are no other means of remedy without it. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the provision will not have a negative fiscal impact. TITLE II--CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE CREATION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW\n\nSEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Clarity and Transparency in Lawsuits Act'' or ``CATLA''.\n\nSEC. 202. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that private rights of action shift enforcement to private lawyers, courts are asked to recognize implied rights of action under Federal law adding unpredictability, and creating a private right of action should be subject to open debate in Congress. This legislation aims to fulfill the Supreme Court's suggestion regarding private litigants having a cause of action. Congress has enacted statutes providing a private right of action to support statutory rights, reducing uncertainty and costly litigation. SEC. 203. CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION. Any Federal law creating a private right of action must explicitly state so. No Federal or State court can infer a private right of action without this provision. SEC. 204. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect upon enactment and applies prospectively, including to laws not previously interpreted by the Supreme Court as creating a private right of action. TITLE III--PROSECUTING OR COUNSELING CLAIMS OR DEFENSES THAT ARE FALSE, FRIVOLOUS, OR WHOLLY INSUBSTANTIAL SEC. 301. PROSECUTING OR COUNSELING CLAIMS OR DEFENSES THAT ARE FALSE, FRIVOLOUS, OR WHOLLY INSUBSTANTIAL. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act prohibits attorneys from prosecuting or counseling false, frivolous, or insubstantial claims in commerce-related litigation. Violations result in sanctions, including payment of expenses and possible additional penalties. Sanctions Under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are amended to require payment of reasonable expenses for violations, including attorneys' fees and costs, and possible additional sanctions such as striking pleadings. The amendments to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure now include sanctions such as striking pleadings, dismissing the suit, or imposing nonmonetary penalties. Attorneys have the right to appeal these sanctions, with the sanction being stayed during the appeal process. Additionally, the rule clarifies that it does not prevent the assertion of new claims or remedies under civil rights laws. SEC. 403. PREVENTION OF INTERSTATE FORUM-SHOPPING. A person cannot bring a personal injury claim in a State court if they are not a resident of that State, unless the acts giving rise to the claim occurred there. If jurisdiction cannot be obtained in the State where the acts occurred, the claim can be filed in another State where the defendant's principal place of business is located or where the defendant resides. In a civil action, a nonresident plaintiff must establish that personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained in the State where the action arose. Each plaintiff joining a civil action must independently meet this requirement. Failure to satisfy this section results in dismissal of the claims without prejudice to refiling in another State or jurisdiction. In a civil action, a nonresident plaintiff must establish that personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained in the State where the action arose. Each plaintiff joining a civil action must independently meet this requirement. Failure to satisfy this section results in dismissal of the claims without prejudice to refiling in another State or jurisdiction. If a person alleges acts in multiple States, the trial court determines the most appropriate forum based on private and public interests. Factors include access to proof, witness availability, and distance from the incident site. Factors affecting the public interest in determining the most appropriate forum for a civil action include administrative difficulties for the forum courts, deciding controversies where people are most affected, the burden of jury duty on citizens with little relation to the litigation, and practical problems contributing to the ease, expense, and expedition of the trial. In determining the most appropriate forum for a civil action, factors include administrative difficulties, controversies where people are most affected, burden of jury duty, and practical trial problems. If another forum is deemed more suitable, the court will dismiss the claim and toll the statute of limitations. \"Personal injury claim\" refers to a civil action under State law for personal injury, illness, death, mental or emotional injury, risk of disease, or medical monitoring costs. The term \"person\" refers to any individual or entity, excluding governmental entities. The term \"State\" includes various territories and possessions of the United States. The section applies to personal injury claims filed in State court after the enactment of the Act. It does not limit court jurisdiction over foreign defendants or preempt State laws on venue requirements."
