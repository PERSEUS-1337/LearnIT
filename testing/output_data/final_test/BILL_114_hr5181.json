    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016\". The Congress acknowledges the need to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. Foreign governments, including Russia and China, use disinformation to undermine US national security. Russia has conducted large-scale disinformation campaigns to destabilize US allies. Disinformation is a key feature of Russia's pursuit of objectives in various regions. The challenge of countering disinformation is significant. The United States Government should develop a comprehensive strategy to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda, protect and promote a free press in vulnerable countries. The United States Government should establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda and support a free press in vulnerable countries. The Secretary of State, in coordination with other relevant departments, shall establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response to collect and analyze information on foreign government information warfare efforts and integrate critical data on foreign propaganda into national strategy. The Center for Information Analysis and Response will integrate efforts to track and evaluate counterfactual narratives threatening US national security interests, and counter foreign information operations. It will also collect and analyze relevant data. The Center for Information Analysis and Response will analyze information from various sources to counter propaganda and disinformation aimed at US allies. They will also identify trends in foreign propaganda tactics. The Center for Information Analysis and Response utilizes clandestine special operators and agents to counter foreign misinformation and disinformation, promote fact-based narratives, share expertise on technologies, identify gaps in US capabilities, and pinpoint vulnerable populations to propaganda. The Center for Information Analysis and Response counters foreign propaganda and disinformation by coordinating with allied nations and international organizations to amplify efforts and avoid duplication. The Secretary of State appoints a full-time Coordinator to lead the Center. The Secretary of State establishes a Steering Committee composed of senior representatives from relevant agencies to provide advice on the operations and strategic orientation of the Center for Information Analysis and Response. The Committee includes officials from various agencies and meets regularly. The Steering Committee, chaired by the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, meets every 3 months. Co-Vice Chairmen include officials responsible for digital media programming and information operations. The Coordinator of the Center serves as Executive Secretary. The Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors does not participate. The Broadcasting Board of Governors ensures journalistic freedom and integrity of media organizations. The Chairman can appoint personnel without following civil service laws, with confirmation by the Steering Committee. Compensation can be determined by the Chairman. Other Federal agencies may join the Steering Committee with approval from the Chairman and Secretary of State. The Chairman has the authority to set compensation for the Director and staff without following certain federal pay regulations. Federal employees can be detailed to the Center without reimbursement, and temporary services can be procured as needed. Under section 3109(b) of title 5, United States Code, individuals can be compensated at rates not exceeding the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to support the Center and provide grants to support local independent media in countering foreign disinformation. The Center aims to collect and analyze disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda targeting the United States and its allies. It also supports efforts to counter foreign governments' use of these tactics to influence policies and stability. Organizations can apply for funds under this subsection. Organizations seeking funds must undergo vetting to ensure compatibility with US interests and objectives. The Secretary of State will prioritize foreign students and community leaders susceptible to foreign manipulation in educational and cultural exchange programs. A report on the success of the Center will be submitted to Congress within a year of its establishment, with recommendations for improvement. The Center and Steering Committee will be terminated at a certain point. The Center for Information Analysis and Response and the Steering Committee will terminate ten years after the enactment of this Act."
